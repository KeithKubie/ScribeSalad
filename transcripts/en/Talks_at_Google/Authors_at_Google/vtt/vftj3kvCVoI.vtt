00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:07.140
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, on behalf of the Authors@Google
program, I'm really pleased to welcome William

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.859
Bennett Turner to speak today with us about
his book, "Figures of Speech: First Amendment

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:19.040
Heroes and Villains." And while reading his
book, all right, this is a used copy [chuckles].

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.770
I kept this particular point in mind, a point
that he makes early on that "it's easy to

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.070
support free speech when you agree with what's
being said, but a challenge to support another's

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.540
right to express ideas one disagrees with
or even loathes. I found myself holding off

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.900
judgment till I heard his arguments for each
case he put before us, the beneficiaries of

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.210
the First Amendment.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.739
It was an excellent exercise in remaining
open-minded while all sides were being heard."

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.550
Turner practiced law for 45 years and has
argued three cases before the US Supreme Court.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.250
He served as a legal affairs correspondent
for KQED television in San Francisco.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.579
He has appeared on Nightline, CBS Morning
News, PBS News Hour, and many other programs.

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:09.580
For 25 years, he taught courses on the First
Amendment at UC Berkeley. And now please join

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.200
me in welcoming Bill Turner.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.200
[applause]

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:22.360
&gt;&gt;William Bennett Turner: Hi everybody. I'm
glad to see that there's some interest here

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.400
in the First Amendment and in free speech
and freedom of the press. Google's life depends

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.500
on it.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.270
Nobody should take these freedoms for granted.
They're what make us a free people and these

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.020
freedoms are very fragile. Let me talk a little
bit about the book and then I'd like to say

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.740
a word about WikiLeaks and the First Amendment.
First let me introduce you to some of the

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.470
characters in the book.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.420
And you can feel free to hiss the villains
and cheer the heroes if you can figure out

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.420
who they are.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.420
[laughter]

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:11.659
Citizens United is a non-profit corporation,
conservative politically, that produced a

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:19.919
video hatchet job on Hilary Clinton during
the 2008 primaries. And last year, won the

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:27.590
most important First Amendment decision of
the 21st Century so far, a decision that you're

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:36.329
probably familiar with banking freeing corporations
to buy political ads supporting or opposing

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.329
candidates.

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:50.239
Quite different is Yetta Stromberg, who was
a counselor at a summer camp in San Bernardino

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.329
for communist families. Children from six
to sixteen attended the camp. And she got

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.069
them up every morning and held a pledge of
allegiance to the flag. It was a little red

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.299
flag with a hammer and sickle on it.

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:12.079
And she was convicted after the camp was raided.
And all of the adults were arrested. She was

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:20.809
convicted of flying a red flag quote, "as
a symbol of opposition to organized government."

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:28.359
And in 1931, hers was the first case in American
history in which the Supreme Court threw out

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.839
a law on First Amendment grounds.

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:40.629
Americans do have a right to oppose organized
government. Dannie Martin, the man on the

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:47.739
left here in the jail clothes, was a heroin
addict and an alcoholic and a very clumsy

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:54.319
bank robber who got caught red-handed and
was sentenced to 33 years in federal prison,

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.519
where he discovered a rare talent for writing.

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:08.329
And he wrote a long series of--. Became an
award-winning author of a series of vignettes

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:14.829
of prison life for the San Francisco Chronicle
until he wrote one that was critical of the

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:21.299
prison warden and they lowered the boom. Dannie
said quote, "I committed bank robbery and

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.060
they put me in prison and that was right.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:34.819
Then I committed journalism and they put me
in the hole and that was wrong." Judge Robert

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:42.300
Schnacke, a crusty old Republican judge in
San Francisco, a federal judge, presided over

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:50.539
a trial I did on whether California could
hold executions in secret. And if not, whether

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.060
the state could prohibit televising executions.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.700
The judge gave the government the benefit
of the doubt, which is always a mistake in

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.919
a First Amendment case. Then there's Earl
Caldwell, the New York Times reporter, who

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:13.719
covered the Black Panther party. He was subpoenaed
by a federal grand jury to disclose all of

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:17.389
his confidential sources and notes.

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:23.530
The Supreme Court ruled that he didn't have
any First Amendment right to protect his sources.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:30.379
That's the only time in history that the court
has addressed the issue. Richard Hongisto,

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:36.669
which may be a familiar name to you, was first
sheriff of San Francisco and he was somewhat

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.759
of a hero in advocating government transparency.

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:48.090
But he then lurched into villain status when
as Chief of Police of San Francisco, he ordered

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:57.129
the cops to confiscate all copies of this
issue of the San Francisco Bay Times. Clarence

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:04.710
Brandenburg, the Ku Klux Klan leader whose
case established the right to advocate bad

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.680
ideas, like racial hatred for example.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:20.300
His case still limits the ability of the government
to restrict terrorist speech. James Madison,

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:29.280
the father of the First Amendment, and Madison
with one of his friends. That was at the National

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.410
Constitution Center in Philadelphia where
you can hang out with all of the Founding

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.410
Fathers.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:42.889
They're all in bronze, but it's still interesting
to be with them. Larry Flint. He is no James

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:49.830
Madison. Larry Flint is the world's leading
pornographer whose case against the Reverend

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:58.010
Jerry Falwell, leader of the Moral Majority,
resulted in strong First Amendment protection

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.840
for political satire.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:06.449
After the argument in his case, Flint said,
"If the court will protect a scumbag like

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:15.090
me, then it will protect all of you." And
Clinton Fein, he pronounces his name Feign,

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:22.069
a hero from the digital world, whose adventures
with the First Amendment seem relevant to

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:23.300
Google.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:31.159
When I first met Clinton, he felt betrayed.
He thought he had been promised freedom of

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:38.009
expression. Instead, he got the Communications
Decency Act. He was born in South Africa and

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:43.960
Clinton grew up under apartheid. When he graduated
from college, he wanted to be a journalist,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.520
but the South Africa at the time wasn't a
very promising environment for young journalists.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:55.539
So, he emigrated to the United States, studied
up on the Constitution, studied for his citizenship

00:07:55.539 --> 00:08:02.289
exams and so on. Learned all about the Constitution
and he was naturalized as a citizen in 1994.

00:08:02.289 --> 00:08:07.150
The First Amendment's free speech clause was
what he cared most about.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:14.581
He wanted to speak on the internet. But Congress
then enacted the Communications Decency Act

00:08:14.581 --> 00:08:23.759
of 1996. As a result of this law, Fein would've
had freer speech in then post-apartheid South

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:32.090
Africa than he had in the United States because
his online speech was subject to the act.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:40.030
The act which we called the CDA was the most
sweeping restriction on the speech of ordinary

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:46.209
citizens that Congress has ever attempted.
It was more threatening to the average person

00:08:46.209 --> 00:08:53.660
than the infamous Sedition Act of 1798. It
had two provisions--two main provisions.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:09:02.830
One made it a federal crime to communicate
anything quote "indecent" online, knowing

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:11.110
that the communication was to a minor, somebody
17 years of age or younger. The term "indecent"

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:18.690
was not defined at all. The other provision
made it a crime to quote "display" on the

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:26.100
internet anything quote "patently offensive"
if it was quote "available” to a minor,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.000
as virtually everything is of course.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.950
Violation of either of these provisions was
punishable by two years in prison. The ostensible

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:41.990
purpose of the CDA was to shield children
from exposure to indecent online material.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:48.269
Every politician, of course, wants to protect
America's children from smut.

00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:55.050
The CDA was an act of legislative villainy
because any modestly intelligent Congressperson

00:09:55.050 --> 00:10:01.070
had to know that this clumsily drafted CDA
violated the First Amendment.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:07.250
But nobody was willing to say that. Passing
the law meant dumping the responsibility for

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:13.920
saying so on the courts. And the CDA was promptly
challenged by the American Civil Liberties

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:20.959
Union and other organizations. They went to
the federal court, district court in Philadelphia,

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:26.480
which immediately stopped the government from
enforcing the law during the lawsuit.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:33.510
The court found then that the CDA would criminalize
a vast range of speech that Americans--at

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:42.000
least adults--have a right to engage in. For
example, using any of satirious George Carlin's

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.440
famous dirty words from his "Filthy Words"
monologue --shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker,

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:56.880
and so on--would be a felony if you put it
in an email to your 17-year old little brother,

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.680
or made it available on any website that a
minor could access.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:09.320
Displaying great works of art like Tony Kushner's
Pulitzer Prize winning play "Angels in America,"

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:17.089
which has a lot of rough language and sex
scenes and so on, would be a crime. Magazines

00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:25.029
like Wired, that appeared both in print and
online and used some of Carlin's words would

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:29.850
be protected on the news stand, but subject
to criminal prosecution as soon as the editor

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:35.329
pressed the button to post an article online.

00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:42.100
At the time the CDA was enacted, Clinton Fein's
day job as a self-taught computer whiz was

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:48.660
constructing and maintaining websites. But
he'd also begun publishing edgy, provocative

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:54.350
material that attracted the government's attention.
And a dispute with the Navy over his using

00:11:54.350 --> 00:12:01.899
a Navy recruiting poster, Fein got legal help
from Michael Traynor, who's a prominent San

00:12:01.899 --> 00:12:02.899
Francisco lawyer.

00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:09.769
At the time, Traynor and I were representing
Wired magazine in various First Amendment-related

00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:15.829
matters. And we were concerned about the CDA's
impact. We met with Fein who wanted to challenge

00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:22.620
the CDA in any way he could. So, we helped
him have his day in court.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:27.990
Our main attack was on a provision of the
CDA that it was different from the ones in

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:37.630
ACLU case. It was an update of the old federal
obscene telephone call statute. As part of

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:45.579
the CDA, Congress made it a crime, also punishable
by two years in prison to say online anything

00:12:45.579 --> 00:12:55.240
quote "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy,
or indecent with intent to annoy another person."

00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:00.370
Clinton himself was annoyed and he wanted
to annoy the politicians and prudes who egged

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:08.209
him on. So, he launched a website called annoy.com
[audience chuckles], which he announced was

00:13:08.209 --> 00:13:16.779
its own CDA, created and designed to annoy.
Annoy.com had several innovative features.

00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:22.240
One of them was called "Heckle." It enabled
site visitors to construct and send email

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:28.540
messages anonymously to various public officials
and public figures. It operated like the Mad

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:38.190
Libs game and invited visitors to criticize
the recipients in the most vulgar and hilarious

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.310
terms.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:45.509
Most of the messages predictably would annoy
whoever received them. For example, one could

00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:51.740
compose a letter to then Speaker of the House,
Newt Gingrich. This was one of them on Heckle.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:14:00.480
It might say, "Dear Speaker Gingrich. Your
contract with America is brilliant/pile of

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.290
shit.

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:14.240
It will save/ruin America. It will benefit
all Americans/only the rich. You are truly

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.899
a genius/an asshole."

00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:19.339
[laughter]

00:14:19.339 --> 00:14:26.110
The problem with annoy.com was that if the
CDA was constitutional, Clinton then was subject

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:36.190
to criminal prosecution for violating both
the prohibition on posting indecency and the

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:42.199
online communication of quote "indecent material
with intent to annoy."

00:14:42.199 --> 00:14:47.569
So, we mounted a two-pronged attack. First,
we filed a brief amicus curiae, a friend of

00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:53.899
the court brief in the United States Supreme
Court, in the ACLU suit. And there, we attacked

00:14:53.899 --> 00:15:01.819
the constitutionality of the CDA itself. Second,
we filed our own suit against Attorney General

00:15:01.819 --> 00:15:08.810
Janet Reno, in federal court in San Francisco,
seeking to adjoin her from enforcing the "intent

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.019
to annoy" law.

00:15:11.019 --> 00:15:16.579
Janet Reno was my law school classmate and
it's hard for me to believe that she could

00:15:16.579 --> 00:15:22.699
believe the arguments that her underlings
made on her behalf to support the CDA. This

00:15:22.699 --> 00:15:28.259
is one of Clinton Fein's creations of Janet
Reno.

00:15:28.259 --> 00:15:33.279
Our case was a lot stronger, actually, than
the ACLU's because the law we were challenging

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:38.259
had nothing to do with children. The government
couldn't defend it on the ground that it was

00:15:38.259 --> 00:15:44.810
needed to protect children from indecency.
It was a flat out ban on speech that adults

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.350
have every right to communicate.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:54.019
The fact that a communication is made with
intent to annoy can't save the law. Speech

00:15:54.019 --> 00:16:01.290
doesn’t lose First Amendment protection
by offending its audience. The government

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:08.779
delayed--forever, it seemed--delayed responding
to our suit as long as it could, arguing that

00:16:08.779 --> 00:16:12.569
the ACLU's case would likely affect the issues
in our case.

00:16:12.569 --> 00:16:17.990
And the ACLU case hadn't been decided yet.
The government insisted though, on its right

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:25.610
to prosecute Fein for any violations of the
annoy law that occurred while the case was

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:32.199
delayed. The court in San Francisco agreed
with the government to defer any ruling until

00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:41.660
Reno v. ACLU came down, leaving Fein at risk
if he continued to operate annoy.com.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:52.820
He continued. On June 26, 1997, the Supreme
Court decided Reno v. ACLU. It was a wonderful

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:59.550
decision. A landmark of First Amendment freedom
and a charter of liberty for the internet.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:05.699
You ought to keep a copy of it under your
pillow. The opinion was written by Justice

00:17:05.699 --> 00:17:13.800
John Paul Stevens and it qualifies him for
candidacy in the pantheon of First Amendment

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.950
heroes.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:21.370
Reno v. ACLU was the court's first internet
case. It was a new medium of communication

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:26.510
for the court. And nobody could know how the
court would apply First Amendment rules to

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:32.290
it. In the past, when confronted with a new
medium, the court had sometimes fumbled.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:40.210
For example, when movies were invented and
became commercial, the court in 1915 allowed

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:47.790
cities to censor them at will, reasoning that
movies were just a business like any other

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:54.970
and subject to local regulation, not protected
by any speech or press guarantees.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:18:02.140
That ruling wasn't overruled until 1952. And
the court also botched the job when it first

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:08.940
encountered cable television. But Stevens
got it right in the ACLU case. His opinion

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:15.640
first laid out in detail how the internet
actually works. Seventy-seven years old at

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.640
the time.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:22.970
He retired last year at 90. But at the time
of this decision, he was 77. And he casually

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:29.810
observed that quote "navigating the web is
relatively straight-forward." And this was

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:30.810
pre-Google.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.150
[laughter]

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:39.500
Stevens then dealt with the government's argument
that the internet should be treated like broadcast,

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:45.250
subject to government regulation like the
FCC's regulation of radio and broadcast television.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:52.070
Indeed, the government argued that what it
called the "indecency problem" on the internet

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.510
is much more pronounced than it is on broadcast
stations.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:19:01.330
This was because, they said, the internet
operates quote "without the intervention of

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:08.970
editors, network censors, or market disincentives."
In other words, the government argued that

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:14.730
because ordinary citizens could communicate
with each other directly, not as the passive

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:21.710
recipients of programming directed at them
by broadcasters and commercial sponsors, the

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.960
government has to step in to police indecent
material.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:31.630
In my view, the perverse result of that would
be that the more democratic the medium free

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:38.290
of commercial censors, the greater the government's
right to regulate the medium. But Stevens

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:45.170
demolished the government's argument pointing
out that broadcast regulation lied on the

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:52.530
unique characteristics of the broadcast medium--the
scarcity of frequencies on the electromagnetic

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:59.410
spectrum, the long history of government regulation
in allocating frequencies and requiring that

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:04.620
licensees act in the public interest, and
the invasive nature of the medium.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:12.840
Stevens said, "These factors are not present
in cyberspace" finding that the content on

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:19.910
the internet is as diverse as human thought.
Stevens concluded that internet speech is

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:28.370
at least as free as speech in newspapers,
in books, or on soap boxes. The court then

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:32.280
found the law unconstitutional.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:40.650
It was vague in the sense that no one could
know exactly what was prohibited. Congressman

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:49.690
Weiner's wiener? Who knows? And it was over-broad
in the sense that it swept within its criminal

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:55.140
prohibition speech that the First Amendment
protects at least among adults.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:21:00.740
And trying to protect children from indecent
material, Stevens said the government may

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:07.080
not reduce the adult population to quote "only
what is fit for children." The level of internet

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:15.290
discourse cannot be limited to that suitable
for a sandbox. Since there are alternative

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:22.140
ways to shield children from exposure to unwanted
internet material, like parents installing

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.240
filters, for example.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:30.071
The government failed to justify criminalizing
the internet speech of ordinary citizens.

00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:40.020
Finally, Justice Stevens made short shrift
of the government's last ditch, desperate,

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:45.590
Hail Mary argument that wait a minute. We
have another interest, not just the interest

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:53.000
in protecting children but we have an equally
significant interest in quote "fostering the

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.870
growth of the internet as a communications
medium."

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:03.770
The government argued that the easy availability
of indecent material on the internet was quote

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:10.920
"driving countless citizens away from the
medium because of the risk of exposing themselves

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.830
or their children to harmful material."

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:22.730
Justice Stevens responded, "The dramatic expansion
of this new marketplace of ideas shows the

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:28.110
government is just plain wrong. The growth
of the internet has been and continues to

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:29.770
be phenomenal."

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:35.820
More importantly, Justice Stevens said as
a First Amendment matter, "We presume that

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:42.550
government regulation of the content of speech
is more likely to interfere with the free

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:48.701
exchange of ideas than to encourage it. The
interest in encouraging freedom of expression

00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:56.800
in a democratic society outweighs any theoretical
unproven benefit of censorship."

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:04.240
The CDA was thus given a decent burial. And
the most democratic means of communication

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:12.650
ever invented allowed to flourish. Well, in
light of Reno v. ACLU, Clinton Fein's case

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:19.510
on the annoy provision looked like a slam
dunk. The Supreme Court had proclaimed an

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:23.170
indecent online speech couldn't be made criminal.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:30.300
And in our case, the government couldn't even
argue that it had a need to protect children.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:37.040
But instead of graciously conceding that the
annoy provision was unconstitutional, Janet

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:43.990
Reno's underlings came up with a shameless
interpretation of the law that would rescue

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.990
it.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:50.940
The government now claimed that the law didn't
mean what it said. It did not, in fact, outlaw

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:57.970
indecent communications at all. The government
said the provision prohibiting quote "obscene,

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:06.380
lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent communications
was limited to obscene communications."

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:12.340
Therefore, the government said since Clinton
Fein wasn't in the business of putting obscene

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:19.570
material online, the law didn't apply to him
and his case should be dismissed. Lemme remind

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:23.180
you what obscenity is.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:29.660
Something is obscene if it falls within the
three-part definition of obscenity established

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:36.850
by the Supreme Court in a case called Miller
v. California, 1973. In order to be obscene,

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:44.280
that's a category of speech that has no First
Amendment protection at all. In order to be

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:49.640
obscene, it has to appeal predominantly to
the prurient interest-- the interest in sexual

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.870
arousal.

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:59.560
Secondly, it has to be patently offensive
in its depiction of sexual or excretory acts.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:08.211
And third, it has to lack serious political,
scientific, literary, or artistic value. All

00:25:08.211 --> 00:25:13.410
three things have to be true in order for
the material to be obscene. It's a very small

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:15.650
category of outlawed speech.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:22.270
The first two, none of this makes any sense.
But the first two things, that has to appeal

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:28.430
to the prurient interest, it has to turn you
on, one professor has said. The second thing

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:32.660
says it has to gross you out. It has to be
patently offensive. It has to do both. It

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.120
has to both turn you on and gross you out.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:38.440
It doesn't make any sense. Anyway, that's
what obscenity is.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.000
[laughter]

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:47.210
The government hardly prosecutes any obscenity
cases anymore. They're hard core, bestiality

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:53.500
rape scenes and violent videos and stuff.
They rarely trouble with obscene cases.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:59.320
And Clinton Fein clearly wasn't putting anything
obscene online. Well, the government's new

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:08.220
definition of the annoy law was ridiculous.
Obscenity already was prohibited in any medium

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:14.580
of communication, so the government's interpretation
would render the law meaningless.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:21.390
Alas, two of the three district judges on
the court agreed with the government using

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:27.870
Reno's interpretation as a convenient way
to avoid declaring the whole law unconstitutional.

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:33.620
Since Fein didn't challenge the prohibition
of obscenity the judges dismissed his case.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:41.990
But since the district court decision applied
only here in Northern California, and Fein's

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:48.120
communications were available all over the
country, he remained at risk of prosecution

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:53.660
elsewhere where other courts might read the
law to mean what it actually said.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:59.900
All internet users would be living under a
cloud, and an uncertain cloud, of a law that

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:09.360
on its face made indecent, annoying communications
a felony. So, we took the case on direct appeal

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:17.890
to the Supreme Court. And on April 19th, 1999,
the court handed down what had to be the shortest

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:25.440
First Amendment decision ever, quote "The
judgment is affirmed."

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:31.570
No explanation. It was a terribly disappointing
outcome and waste of several years of litigation

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:37.881
during which the government never suggested
limiting the law to obscenity. There was a

00:27:37.881 --> 00:27:43.960
sliver of a silver lining. The Supreme Court's
action had the effect of making the district

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.830
court interpretation binding nationally.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:53.970
It was now the law of the land. So, in practical
terms the litigation got Clinton Fein what

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:59.540
he needed, the ability to communicate material
that might be considered indecent and to annoy

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:06.620
recipients without fear of criminal prosecution.
What he didn't get but deserved was a ringing

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:14.290
affirmation that the CDA annoy provision violated
the First Amendment.

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:22.880
After the demise of the CDA, the Congress
attempted three other laws attempting to restrict

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:29.900
online sexual content. They've only tried
to address sexual content on the internet.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:35.790
The only kind of content Congress has ever
attempted to regulate. One of the laws, you

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:39.360
may remember, was about virtual child pornography.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:45.510
But only one of the laws, not the one on child
pornography, only one of the laws survived

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:53.900
in the Supreme Court. It required public and
school libraries to install software filters

00:28:53.900 --> 00:29:02.090
to screen out material that may be quote "harmful
to minors." No definition of what that meant.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:11.270
And in a case ominously named United States
of America v. The American Library Association,

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:18.850
the Supreme Court upheld the law on the reasoning
that Congress could put strings on the subsidies

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:24.560
that it chooses to give. Government doesn't
have to fund libraries, but if it does it

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.700
can put conditions on the funding.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:35.210
At the argument in the case, the government
lawyer was asked by one of the Justices, "Well,

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:42.320
what if an adult in a public library wants
to get access to some site and it's blocked?

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:47.610
Doesn't that deny him the full resources of
the internet?" And the government lawyer said

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:55.890
to the court, "No. Upon request of an adult
user, a librarian will come running and unblock

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:59.980
the site or disable the filter."

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:08.570
And on the basis of that kind of wishful thinking
the court upheld the library law. Whether

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:17.160
software filters solve these kinds of First
Amendment internet problems is an interesting,

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.940
amusing diversion.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:24.850
In the Library case, the government urged
that filters are effective in protecting children

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:30.370
from exposure to harmful material, while it
was the civil libertarians who argue that

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:37.450
the filters over block and under block and
the government has no business policing libraries

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:39.020
anyway.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:46.030
In the CDA case and other internet cases,
these roles were reversed. The ACLU argued

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:52.290
that filters were effective and a less restrictive
means of protecting children than criminal

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:58.480
prosecutions, while the government argued
that filters were ineffective and they needed

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.520
the criminal sanction.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:09.590
This seeming inconsistency was nicely resolved
by Ann Beeson of the ACLU, who said the central

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:16.390
issue is whose finger is on the mouse, the
parents or the government? When a parent installs

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:22.260
a filter that keeps a kid from seeing a bunch
of sites that may or may not be pornography,

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.240
that's parenting.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:31.360
When government forces all adults and minors
to use filters, that's censorship. The broader

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:37.180
issue in all of this is whether the courts
ought to accept the government's assertion

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:45.900
that it has a compelling interest in protecting
minors from material that it considers harmful.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:51.180
The government has not been required to prove
that minors are in fact injured by hearing

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:58.840
dirty words or seeing sexual images. If we
uncritically assume that the government has

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:05.200
a compelling interest in shielding children
from speech it says is harmful, what's to

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:15.470
prevent legislators from enacting say a literature
decency act, or a law banning profanity, or

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:18.940
bad grammar, or Facebook?

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:25.860
All of those may be harmful to children in
somebody's eyes. Well, undaunted by his adventures

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:33.370
with the legal system, our hero, Clinton Fein
continues now to rail against politicians

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:39.380
and powerful corporations using both annoy.com
and art.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:45.730
He's become a renowned digital artist and
he's a direct beneficiary of Larry Flint's

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:53.330
case against Jerry Falwell and its protection
for offensive satire and vicious political

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:59.700
cartooning. Working with a computer and a
digital camera, Fein has created political

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:05.790
cartoons, collages, and other images that
offend their targets and many others.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:15.750
Here are a few. An attack on using emaciated
fashion models. This ad for a gallery show

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:21.620
that Clinton did depicts former Mayor Rudy
Giuliani, sitting naked in a urine-filled

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:28.890
glass, referencing Giuliani’s denial of
funding for the Brooklyn Museum when he was

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:30.930
Mayor.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:38.800
Art Forum, the magazine, refused to run the
ad. Fein savagely attacked the George W. Bush

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:44.710
Administration at every opportunity, especially
the invasion of Iraq and the Abu Ghraib torture.

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:51.360
One of his images shows the President nailed
to the cross, crucifixion-style with an erection

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:57.950
popping out of his loin cloth in the shape
of a rocket, under the banner "Who would Jesus

00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:59.860
torture?"

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:05.630
The printer for an art gallery show found
that Fein's image was offensive and destroyed

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:12.099
it. This sort of censorship, of course, does
not violate the First Amendment because only

00:34:12.099 --> 00:34:19.410
the government can violate the First Amendment.
The Constitution binds only the government,

00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:24.450
not private entities--people, churches, corporations
of any kind.

00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:31.210
Only the government can violate the Constitution.
Nor does this kind of censorship dampen Fein's

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:37.500
willingness to exercise the freedom of expression
that brought him to this country. His imagery

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:45.029
sometimes is sexual. It includes anuses and
erect penises and George Carlin-esque words

00:34:45.029 --> 00:34:46.730
describing them.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:52.789
He says his mother "wishes I would do water
colors." A First Amendment true believer,

00:34:52.789 --> 00:35:04.680
he keeps on poking at hypocrisy and blasting
the mainstream media for laziness and cowardice.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:11.340
Now, let me say a word about WikiLeaks and
the First Amendment. On the fortieth anniversary

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:21.030
of the publication of the Pentagon Papers,
today, June the 13th, Julian Assange arrived

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:25.500
on the scene just too late to make this book.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:28.039
Where is this book anyway? You took my copy.

00:35:28.039 --> 00:35:29.630
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: [inaudible]

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:31.710
&gt;&gt;William Bennett Turner: A dog-eared copy.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:32.710
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:36.190
&gt;&gt;William Bennett Turner: Yeah, well Julian
Assange didn't show up in time. Is he a First

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:42.480
Amendment hero or a villain? When he was interviewed
on 60 Minutes recently, he wrapped himself

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.190
in the First Amendment.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:51.980
And he said about WikiLeaks quote, "Our founding
values are those of the American Revolution,

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:58.920
those of Jefferson and Madison." Assange may
not know that our Constitution was written

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:08.869
in secret in that hot summer in Philadelphia
in 1787, behind closed doors guarded by sentries.

00:36:08.869 --> 00:36:17.589
There were no leaks. We like to think of ourselves
as an open society with a transparent government,

00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:25.029
but in fact we have a long history of government
secrecy and constitutional tolerance of that

00:36:25.029 --> 00:36:26.650
secrecy.

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:33.630
Here's my two cents worth on WikiLeaks and
the First Amendment. My thesis is this: WikiLeaks

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:40.720
basically owes its existence to two weaknesses
in First Amendment protection for speech and

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:47.910
the press. Both of the weaknesses stem from
bad Supreme Court decisions that I unfortunately

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:49.100
had something to do with.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:57.559
The rulings were that there is no constitutional
right of access by either press or public

00:36:57.559 --> 00:37:05.250
to government information or facilities. That's
Houchins v. KQED, one of the stories in the

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:12.220
book. The other was that reporters don't have
any First Amendment right to protect their

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:16.670
confidential sources against compelled disclosure.

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:23.950
That's Earl Caldwell's case, also in the book.
If we had a constitutional right to know what

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:31.849
our governments up to and reporters could
honestly promise whistle-blowers confidentiality,

00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:38.690
which WikiLeaks provides, who needs WikiLeaks?
I hope you won't think this is just sour grapes

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.220
because I was on the losing side of these
cases.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:45.869
I'm not trying to say, "If they'd only listened
to me, we wouldn't have WikiLeaks." It's not

00:37:45.869 --> 00:37:51.700
that at all. It's just a recognition that
our First Amendment rights are not as strong

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:58.730
as they ought to be. To the extent that WikiLeaks
informs us citizens, what the government is

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:07.109
doing in our name and does what the mainstream
media can't do guarantee confidentiality for

00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:08.829
whistle-blowers.

00:38:08.829 --> 00:38:16.190
It partially repairs these flaws in First
Amendment protection. Of course, the government

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:23.099
always has plausible reasons for keeping secrets
and restricting speech and in all of the cases

00:38:23.099 --> 00:38:29.750
in the book, the government argued that some
competing value--might be National Security,

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:35.180
protection of privacy, shield our children
from harmful material, whatever--some competing

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:42.119
value and an important competing value requires
or justifies a restriction on speech.

00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:51.369
It's the collision of these competing values
that makes First Amendment cases so hard and

00:38:51.369 --> 00:39:00.291
so interesting. As for WikiLeaks, the government
is considering prosecution of Assange for

00:39:00.291 --> 00:39:08.069
violating the Espionage Act. You remember
that Daniel Ellsberg was prosecuted when he

00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:14.190
leaked the Pentagon Papers to the New York
Times exactly 40 years ago.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:22.869
If Assange is prosecuted, it will be another
epic First Amendment battle. No publisher

00:39:22.869 --> 00:39:30.779
has ever been prosecuted for violating the
Espionage Act. However the First Amendment

00:39:30.779 --> 00:39:36.380
issues play out, let's hope our own government's
hands are clean.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:43.289
The Ellsberg prosecution was dismissed in
mid-trial when the judge discovered that President

00:39:43.289 --> 00:39:51.519
Nixon's plumbers unit, trying to stop leaks,
had burglarized Ellsberg's psychiatrist’s

00:39:51.519 --> 00:39:56.269
office in an attempt to dig up dirt on Ellsberg.

00:39:56.269 --> 00:40:03.670
We have no evidence that the Obama White House
was complicit in developing the sexual misconduct

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:11.809
charges against Assange after WikiLeaks' three
big disclosures last year. It may be just

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:19.019
a coincidence that following immediately upon
the disclosures, our friend Sweden issued

00:40:19.019 --> 00:40:26.109
an extraordinary international arrest warrant
seeking Assange's extradition on a charge

00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:30.920
of failing to use a promised condom.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:36.769
There can't have been many instances of using
that kind of heavy legal artillery for such

00:40:36.769 --> 00:40:46.289
a charge. Companies that supported the WikiLeaks
site, like PayPal, Amazon, and Visa and MasterCard,

00:40:46.289 --> 00:40:52.910
may have decided independently without any
government prompting to withdraw their support.

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:59.900
And hacker attacks on WikiLeaks servers may
have been orchestrated by freelancers without

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:04.279
any government encouragement. It would be
really distressing to learn that our government

00:41:04.279 --> 00:41:11.150
was involved in any of this. Imagine the irony
if government complicity were established

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:19.039
by secret government documents someday to
be leaked by WikiLeaks.

00:41:19.039 --> 00:41:27.150
So, questions about WikiLeaks, about these
internet cases, or anything in the book, or

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:31.190
whatever you wanna talk about? I'll be here.

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:32.190
[applause]

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:33.390
Thank you.

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:40.460
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: I have a question
for you about filters, a different sort of

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:46.619
filter, like top-level domain XXX, or kids.com,
which I think was in a concurrence or dissent

00:41:46.619 --> 00:41:48.819
of ACLU v. Reno.

00:41:48.819 --> 00:41:52.089
What do you think of them or what would be
the legal arguments against having those as

00:41:52.089 --> 00:41:55.079
part of government's efforts to censor the
internet?

00:41:55.079 --> 00:41:59.420
&gt;&gt;William Bennett Turner: This sound system
sounds like you're out in left field somewhere.

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.579
And I'm having trouble getting that. But filters
and you said--

00:42:02.579 --> 00:42:07.839
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Yeah. Just like
using top-level domains like XXX, or dot kids,

00:42:07.839 --> 00:42:12.530
to establish like a sort of physical--. The
analog of physical zoning. Like, what do you

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:13.530
think of it? How would you argue against it?

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:20.849
&gt;&gt;William Bennett Turner: Yeah, well if the
government requires it, that invites First

00:42:20.849 --> 00:42:26.079
Amendment litigation. If the government says,
"You have to be over here," they're regulating

00:42:26.079 --> 00:42:28.059
the content of your speech.

00:42:28.059 --> 00:42:34.240
And that triggers the requirement that the
government show a compelling interest in that

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:43.119
restriction and that the restriction is narrowly
tailored to serve that interest. I doubt serious--.

00:42:43.119 --> 00:42:51.859
Well, I don't think anybody's proposing that
the government require that kind of zoning,

00:42:51.859 --> 00:42:54.559
XXX domain names and so on.

00:42:54.559 --> 00:43:00.930
I understand that the pornographers are on
both sides of this. They want people to stumble

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:07.710
into their sites accidentally. They don't
want to be segregated--some of them. And some

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:13.619
of them want to be liberated to put whatever
they want without people getting mad at them

00:43:13.619 --> 00:43:17.230
or getting interfered with by filters and
so on.

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:20.089
That's a business choice. It's not a legal
problem.

00:43:20.089 --> 00:43:25.089
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: So, on a personal
level, do you believe that First Amendment

00:43:25.089 --> 00:43:28.960
rights are an inalienable human right, or
just a cultural distinction that Americans

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:29.960
have?

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:30.960
[laughter]

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:31.960
&gt;&gt;William Bennett Turner: Say it again.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:36.789
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Oh yes. So, do
you personally believe that First Amendment

00:43:36.789 --> 00:43:41.700
rights are a basic human right or a cultural
right for Americans and other such democratic

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.110
nations? Like, a cultural distinction.

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:53.759
&gt;&gt;William Bennett Turner: No, I think there's
nearly universal agreement that free speech

00:43:53.759 --> 00:44:00.609
is a human right and it's recognized by every
constitution in the world that I've ever heard

00:44:00.609 --> 00:44:01.609
of.

00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:09.140
The Constitution of North Korea, Cuba, that
are completely oppressive, recognize it and

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:14.910
all of the United Nations declaration of rights
and all of the international treaties recognize

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:18.569
free speech as a basic human right.

00:44:18.569 --> 00:44:26.630
Whether the countries live up to the lip service
that they give to these rights in their constitution

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:33.390
is an entirely different matter. Not unique
to the United States by any means. In fact,

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:38.400
and this will be a little sobering to you,
there are organizations that rank the countries

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.740
of the world in terms of their free speech
and press and so on.

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:46.430
The United States and the organization that
you're most familiar with called Freedom House,

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:52.079
started by Eleanor Roosevelt back just after
World War II. And they rank all the countries

00:44:52.079 --> 00:44:57.670
in the world by how free they are every year.
Their most recent report ranked the United

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:01.499
States not first, not second, tied for 24th.

00:45:01.499 --> 00:45:02.559
[laughter]

00:45:02.559 --> 00:45:09.109
With the Czech Republic, behind countries
like Estonia and Jamaica and so on. And ranked

00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:15.819
right up at the top in freedom of the press,
in particular, are all the Scandinavian countries.

00:45:15.819 --> 00:45:21.690
Iceland and Finland seem to trade off One
and Two year after year. It's all of them.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:25.890
Part of it has to do with the structure of
our media. Part of it has to do with the decline

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:32.539
of the newspaper industry here. In Finland,
for example, a great majority of the population

00:45:32.539 --> 00:45:36.539
reads on paper two newspapers a day.

00:45:36.539 --> 00:45:42.690
Unheard of in this country. They just care
more about those values than we seem to. Yes,

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:43.690
sir.

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:52.490
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: The state of Tennessee
recently passed a bill that--. The state of

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:58.779
Tennessee recently passed a bill that would
fine a person who posts an image that's online

00:45:58.779 --> 00:46:03.900
that someone finds offensive. Do you have
any remarks about that? Or do you think that

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.369
bill is long for this world?

00:46:05.369 --> 00:46:10.240
&gt;&gt;William Bennett Turner: I'm not familiar
with the Tennessee bill. If all it does is

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:19.359
say you can't post an image that is offensive,
that is on its face unconstitutional. As I

00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:24.289
say, offensiveness is protected by the First
Amendment.

00:46:24.289 --> 00:46:31.819
Many, many cases saying that the fact that
something is offensive, is highly offensive,

00:46:31.819 --> 00:46:41.450
doesn't deprive the speech of First Amendment
protection. And that law will not survive

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:47.059
scrutiny for more than a minute.

00:46:47.059 --> 00:46:52.630
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: You mentioned in
the Reno v. ACLU case that part of the ruling

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:56.980
was based on internet not sharing the unique
properties of broadcast.

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:57.980
&gt;&gt;William Bennett Turner: Right.

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.670
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Do you foresee
a return to that question now that internet

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:03.780
is increasingly access through potentially
regulated spectrum?

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:07.589
&gt;&gt;William Bennett Turner: Potentially regulated
spectrum such as--

00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:11.180
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: I mean like cell
phone, wireless connection.

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:20.499
&gt;&gt;William Bennett Turner: No, I don't. I think
one of the benefits of having a totally corporate

00:47:20.499 --> 00:47:27.019
business-oriented majority on the Supreme
Court these days is that they are anti-regulation.

00:47:27.019 --> 00:47:33.970
The five conservatives on the court all came
to Washington as part of the Reagan revolution,

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:41.069
"Let's get government off our backs." And
one of the items that the Reagan Administration

00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:47.099
attacked right on was the Fairness Doctrine,
which used to be imposed by the FCC on licensed

00:47:47.099 --> 00:47:48.099
broadcasters.

00:47:48.099 --> 00:47:55.390
They got rid of that. They abandoned that.
And I don't detect any sentiment on the court

00:47:55.390 --> 00:48:10.009
for endorsing legislation now that would return
the internet to any kind of regulation about

00:48:10.009 --> 00:48:16.989
what can be and what can't be done in the
way of content. One slightly worrisome thing

00:48:16.989 --> 00:48:27.150
is the convergence factor, as you mentioned,
where the various media converge and become

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:28.150
one.

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:35.970
We get everything out of one place--a device,
or whatever it is. That opens up the argument

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:41.829
that there ought to be the government regulation
of the FCC, for example. They still police

00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:51.740
indecency. CBS got fined several hundred thousand
dollars for showing a nanosecond of Janet

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:55.329
Jackson's breast at the halftime show of Super
Bowl.

00:48:55.329 --> 00:49:00.529
The FCC's still in that business. They may
be put out of it this year in a case that's

00:49:00.529 --> 00:49:08.609
pending in New York, but the FCC is still
policing the air waves. It comes over the--.

00:49:08.609 --> 00:49:18.339
Not cable. They don't police content on cable,
but on over-the-air radio and television broadcast.

00:49:18.339 --> 00:49:24.989
The FCC's still in that business. As media
converge, would they likely extend that? I

00:49:24.989 --> 00:49:27.180
don't think so. I don't think they could get
away with it.

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:33.650
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: I got the impression
that you feel that the First Amendment should

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:39.670
have protected WikiLeaks. And I was wondering--.
I don't know if that's true, but I was wondering

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:47.839
if there, is there any type of government
information that you think it shouldn't protect

00:49:47.839 --> 00:49:51.720
for divulging? For example, suitcase atomic
weapons or whatever.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:56.769
&gt;&gt;William Bennett Turner: Yeah, sure. No,
obviously there are real, genuine needs for

00:49:56.769 --> 00:50:06.000
government to keep some secrets. Unfortunately,
government doesn't do a very good job on keeping

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.609
secrets.

00:50:07.609 --> 00:50:15.180
And they use that classified stamp in a libertine
way. I mean, they just classify so much, the

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:22.450
classification becomes meaningless. If Private
Bradley Manning, who's the alleged leaker

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:29.859
to WikiLeaks, was in fact the leaker, he had
a security clearance that gave him access

00:50:29.859 --> 00:50:32.670
to all of those classified documents.

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:39.309
He shared that clearance with 500 thousand
other people. How do you expect to keep a

00:50:39.309 --> 00:50:47.980
secret that 500 thousand people have access
to? You're right in thinking WikiLeaks ought

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:53.760
to have, that I think, WikiLeaks ought to
have a First Amendment defense to violating

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:59.430
the Espionage Act, but that depends on facts
that I don't know.

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:04.711
Wouldn't you like to hear the conversation
between Assange and Manning? Because I think

00:51:04.711 --> 00:51:12.770
a lot depends on how WikiLeaks got the information.
If they got the files over the transom as

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:19.029
we used to say, passively, they didn't do
anything. They were just dumped in their lap.

00:51:19.029 --> 00:51:27.299
And then published them on the internet. That's
just like the New York Times in the Pentagon

00:51:27.299 --> 00:51:35.900
Papers case. But if Assange and WikiLeaks
actively solicited the leaks, paid the leaker,

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:42.980
provided software assistance to the leaker
and so on, then probably they can be charged

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:48.999
with conspiracy, which is a prosecutor's favorite.

00:51:48.999 --> 00:51:53.430
And they're more like Ellsberg in that situation.
They're the actual--. They stand in the same

00:51:53.430 --> 00:52:03.130
shoes as the actual government employee who
betrayed his trust. But we don't know what

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:07.859
conversation, if any. I mean, Assange denies
that there was any conversation.

00:52:07.859 --> 00:52:13.480
He denies knowing who Manning was until his
name was published in the press later on.

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:21.079
So good is WikiLeaks encryption technology,
even the people at WikiLeaks don't know who

00:52:21.079 --> 00:52:22.460
they're dealing with.

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:25.759
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Well, on that note, thank
you very much for coming.

00:52:25.759 --> 00:52:26.239
