00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.520
Use completing the square to
write the quadratic equation y

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.390
is equal to negative 3x squared,
plus 24x, minus 27 in

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.920
vertex form, and then
identify the vertex.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.340
So we'll see what vertex form
is, but we essentially

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.880
complete the square, and we
generate the function, or we

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.440
algebraically manipulate it so
it's in the form y is equal to

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.970
A times x minus B
squared, plus C.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.390
We want to get the equation
into this form right here.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.450
This is vertex form
right there.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.770
And once you have it in vertex
form, you'll see that you can

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.280
identify the x value of the
vertex as what value will make

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.790
this expression equal to 0.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.740
So in this case it would be B.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.540
And the y value of the vertex,
if this is equal to 0, then

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.590
the y value is just
going to be C.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.470
And we're going to see that.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.480
We're going to understand why
that is the vertex, why this

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.310
vertex form is useful.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.310
So let's try to manipulate
this equation to get

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.650
it into that form.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.060
So if we just rewrite it, the
first thing that immediately

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.490
jumps out at me, at least, is
that all of these numbers are

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.790
divisible by negative 3.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.170
And I just always find it
easier to manipulate an

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.920
equation if I have a 1
coefficient out in front of

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.680
the x squared.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.390
So let's just factor
out a negative 3

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.670
right from the get-go.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.040
So we can rewrite this as y is
equal to negative 3 times x

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.470
squared, minus 8x-- 24 divided
by negative 3 is

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.752
negative 8-- plus 9.

00:01:32.752 --> 00:01:36.790
Negative 27 divided by negative
3 is positive 9.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.410
Let me actually write the
positive 9 out here.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.950
You're going to see in a second
why I'm doing that.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.020
Now, we want to be able to
express part of this

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.290
expression as a perfect
square.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.950
That's what vertex
form does for us.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.170
We want to be able to express
part of this expression as a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.160
perfect square.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.525
Now how can we do that?

00:01:54.525 --> 00:01:57.650
Well, we have an x
squared minus 8x.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.250
So if we had a positive 16
here-- because, well, just

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.675
think about it this way, if we
had negative 8, you divide it

00:02:03.675 --> 00:02:05.160
by 2, you get negative 4.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.110
You square that, it's
positive 16.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.870
So if you had a positive
16 here, this would

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.639
be a perfect square.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.450
This would be x minus
4 squared.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.300
But you can't just willy-nilly
add a 16 there, you would

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.075
either have to add a similar
amount to the other side, and

00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:22.000
you would have to scale it by
the negative 3 and all of

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.580
that, or, you can just subtract
a 16 right here.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.840
I haven't changed
the expression.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.630
I'm adding a 16, subtracting
a 16.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.370
I've added a 0.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.770
I haven't it changed it.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.890
But what it allows me to do is
express this part of the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.160
equation as a perfect square.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.830
That right there is
x minus 4 squared.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.240
And if you're confused, how
did I know it was 16?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.720
Just think, I took negative
8, I divided by 2, I

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.980
got negative 4.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.300
And I squared negative 4.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.640
This is negative 4 squared
right there.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.790
And then I have to subtract that
same amount so I don't

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.130
change the equation.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.190
So that part is x
minus 4 squared.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.190
And then we still have this
negative 3 hanging out there.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.690
And then we have negative 16
plus 9, which is negative 7.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.230
So we're almost there.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.860
We have y equal to negative 3
times this whole thing, not

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.350
quite there.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.880
To get it there, we just
multiply negative 3.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.480
We distribute the negative 3 on
to both of these terms. So

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.820
we get y is equal to negative
3 times x, minus 4 squared.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.390
And negative 3 times negative
7 is positive 21.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.520
So we have it in our vertex
form, we're done with that.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.860
And if you want to think about
what the vertex is, I told you

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.270
how to do it.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.670
You say, well, what's the
x value that makes

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.680
this equal to 0?

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.860
Well, in order for this term to
be 0, x minus 4 has to be

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.130
equal to 0.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.950
x minus 4 has to be equal to 0,
or add 4 to both sides. x

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.530
has to be equal to 4.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.580
And if x is equal to 4, this is
0, this whole thing becomes

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.000
0, then y is equal to 21.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.420
So the vertex of this parabola--
I'll just do a

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.850
quick graph right here-- the
vertex of this parabola occurs

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.960
at the point 4, 21.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.500
So I'll draw it like this.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.480
Occurs at the point.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.550
If this is the point 4, if this
right here is the-- so

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.960
this is the y-axis, that's
the x-axis-- so this is

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.920
the point 4, 21.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.590
Now, that's either going to be
the minimum or the maximum

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.860
point in our parabola, and to
think about whether it's the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.280
minimum or maximum point, think
about what happens.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.300
Let's explore this equation
a little bit.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:44.040
This thing, this x minus 4
squared is always greater than

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.170
or equal to 0.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.510
Right?

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.330
At worst it could be 0, but
you're taking a square, so

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.560
it's going to be a non-negative
number.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.160
But when you take a non-negative
number, and then

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.860
you multiply it by negative 3,
that guarantees that this

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.660
whole thing is going to be
less than or equal to 0.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.550
So the best, the highest, value
that this function can

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.360
attain, is when this
expression right

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.630
here is equal to 0.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.680
And this expression is equal
to 0 when x is equal

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.810
to 4 and y is 21.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.360
So this is the highest value
that the function can attain.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.660
It can only go down
from there.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.510
Because if you shift the x
around 4, then this expression

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.850
right here will become, well,
it'll become non-zero.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.910
When you square it, it'll
become positive.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.225
When you multiply it
by negative 3,

00:05:31.225 --> 00:05:32.360
it'll become negative.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.600
So you're going to take a
negative number plus 21, it'll

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.490
be less than 21, so your
parabola is going

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.730
to look like this.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.160
Your parabola is going
to look like that.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.330
And that's why vertex
form is useful.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.970
You break it up into the part
of the equation that changes

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.000
in value, and say,
well, what's its

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.130
maximum value attained?

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.150
That's the vertex.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.670
That happens when
x is equal to 4.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.320
And you know its y value.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.800
And because you have a negative
coefficient out here

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.710
that's a negative 3, you know
that it's going to be a

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:06.980
downward opening graph.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.560
If that was a positive 3, then
this thing would be, at

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.160
minimum, 0 and it would be
an upward opening graph.
