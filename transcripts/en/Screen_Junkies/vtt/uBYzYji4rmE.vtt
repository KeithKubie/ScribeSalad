00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.760
After 17 movies,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.700
the MCU finally went black,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.640
putting out a black crewed, black cast superhero movie that's one of the best ever released,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.180
leaving its haters with only one option:

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.920
watching every other MCU movie ever made.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.680
"Hmm."

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.580
Just when you though Chadwick Boseman had called dibs on every black icon,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.800
he's suiting up as Black Panther,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.500
a superhero with the high-tech suit of Iron Man,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.180
the all-natural steroids of Captain America,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.700
and the invisible jet of Wonder Woman.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.720
But one thing sets him apart from all the other MCU heroes,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.360
not 'cause he's black,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.000
not 'cause he's royalty.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.260
Nope, it's 'cause this Marvel hero...

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.220
just...

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.260
won't...

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.360
quip.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.280
"Help, people are shooting at me! Wait, let me put on my helmet."

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.080
"Enough."

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.340
"You froze."

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.420
"Ah."

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.760
"We will not...

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.340
help you."

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.280
"Did he freeze?"

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.240
"Like an antelope in headlights."

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.900
"Hehehehe."

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.100
"Are you finished?"

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.440
Wow, his dad just died and he didn't even crack a joke?

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.680
I thought you had to be a smartass to save the world.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.900
"Dance-off, bro!"

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.960
Journey to Wakanda,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.640
a combination of The Jetsons and a 1990's Jet magazine.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.420
It's the source of all the world's vibranium,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.120
a material so powerful,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.780
it tops Tony Stark's tech and Doctor Strange's magic

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.460
as the BS that can do whatever the script needs it to do.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.980
"There's vibranium on those trains?"

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.120
"There's vibranium all around us.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.380
It's how I healed you."

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.120
This secret kingdom has been hidden for centuries,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.680
thanks to an iron-clad policy of...

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.620
asking people not to say anything.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.600
"You speak nothing of this day."

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.600
But after sitting out the slave trade,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.840
brutal dictators,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.060
2 World Wars,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.800
multiple alien invasions,

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.760
and a sentient AI using stolen vibranium to destroy the Earth,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.920
they're finally ready to get involved.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.860
In bay area real estate.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.300
"I bought this building.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.860
And that building.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.520
And that one over there."

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.180
Kitten steps, you guys.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.320
After taking 18 movies to get 6 quality villains,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.180
cry as Marvel just takes 3 movies to cut it back to 2.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.340
Maybe one.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.680
But for one shining moment,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.940
we had Klaue,

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.580
Andy Serkis's joyous portrayal of a guy who doesn't have to wear a mo-cap suit,

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.400
"That was awesome, that was awesome!"

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.620
and Killmonger,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.600
Michael B. Jordan's Michael Jordan of Marvel villains.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.560
"Hey, Auntie."

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.640
He's the buffest dude to ever graduate from MIT

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.780
who's ripped for your pleasure

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.780
and who actually wins the moral argument and changes the hero's mind.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.000
"Where was Wakanda?"

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.680
"All of you are wrong...

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.660
to turn your backs on the rest of the world!"

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.100
So wait, Killmonger was right?

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.740
I am not used to this much nuance in my Marvel villains.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.080
Quick, make him choke an old lady so I know who to root for!

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.720
Phew! Oh, there he is.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.620
While the boys are at play,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.280
it's the women of Black Panther who do all the work,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.800
like Okoye,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.700
literal snatcher of wigs,

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.520
Shuri,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.460
expert in weaponized memes,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.400
"WHAT ARE THOSE?!"

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.440
Angela Bassett as herself,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.580
and Nakia,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.460
who after all the debate between T'Challa and Killmonger,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.660
was making the same case all along and never got the credit for it.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.620
"Wakanda is strong enough to help others and protect ourselves at the same time."

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.740
Also, she saved the royal family.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.760
"Let's go!"

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.000
Also, she saved the future of the Black Panther.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.240
Wow, I am not used to this much agency in my Marvel love interest.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.420
Quick, have her get rescued so I know who the heroes are!

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.560
"Get down!"

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.260
Phew!

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.240
So enjoy this movie with great acting,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.200
"I must right these wrongs."

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.560
a great story,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.480
great themes,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.440
and great culture significance

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.320
that almost lets you forget the underdeveloped love stories,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.680
"Would you kill me, my love?"

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.120
the terrible CGI,

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.220
or the big, forgettable third act bruhaha.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.340
In other words,

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.740
it's a Marvel movie.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.480
You know, his heart's in the right place, but maybe don't let Everett Ross keep any guys with one arm in custody?

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:52.820
The guy is 0 for 2
