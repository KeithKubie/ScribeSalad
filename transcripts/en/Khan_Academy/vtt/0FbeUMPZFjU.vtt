00:00:00.287 --> 00:00:03.143
- [Voiceover] The diode is our
first semi-conductor device,

00:00:03.143 --> 00:00:04.883
and it's a really important one.

00:00:04.883 --> 00:00:07.311
Every other semi-conductor
is basically made

00:00:07.311 --> 00:00:09.545
from combinations of diodes.

00:00:09.545 --> 00:00:12.059
And here's a picture of
a diode that you can buy.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.240
This is a, just a small
little glass package,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.117
and that distance right there
is about four millimeters.

00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:23.135
And inside here, right inside here,

00:00:23.135 --> 00:00:25.218
is a little silicon chip,

00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:29.428
and it's manufactured to be a diode.

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:32.368
So the question is, what is a diode?

00:00:32.368 --> 00:00:36.927
A diode is something that
conducts current in one direction,

00:00:36.927 --> 00:00:41.042
and does not conduct current
in the other direction.

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:45.209
And the symbol we use for
a diode looks like this.

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:52.815
It has this big arrow here,

00:00:52.815 --> 00:00:56.982
that points in the direction
of the forward current.

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:00.431
One way to understand how a diode works

00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:02.688
is to draw an IV curve for it.

00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:05.855
So let's draw an IV curve for a diode.

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:13.267
If it was a perfect diode, made
in some unknown technology,

00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:17.061
what would happen is in
the reverse direction,

00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:20.811
if the voltage across
the diode was negative,

00:01:22.268 --> 00:01:25.595
we'll label the voltage this way,

00:01:25.595 --> 00:01:28.534
if the voltage across the
diode was negative, that is,

00:01:28.534 --> 00:01:32.701
this terminal is at a higher
voltage than this terminal,

00:01:33.836 --> 00:01:35.439
there would be zero current flowing.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.272
And then for any positive voltage,

00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:44.188
basically the diode
would look like a wire.

00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:45.919
So I can call that, that's essentially

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:48.336
model number zero of a diode.

00:01:51.475 --> 00:01:52.982
Now when we build real diodes,

00:01:52.982 --> 00:01:57.383
what happens is we don't quite
get that perfect behavior,

00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:01.402
so in particular, if we
build a diode out of silicon,

00:02:01.402 --> 00:02:05.235
we can go to a, I'll go
to a number one model.

00:02:08.681 --> 00:02:11.495
And a silicon diode
actually doesn't conduct

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:13.745
to a slight positive voltage,

00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:16.196
and then it would go up like that,

00:02:16.196 --> 00:02:19.279
where this is around point six volts.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.530
For a lot of simple
circuits that we build,

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.030
this is a pretty good IV model of a diode.

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:31.814
Just as a reminder, when we
have the IV curve of resistors,

00:02:31.814 --> 00:02:35.061
a resistors IV curve
looks something like this,

00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:38.266
it was a line that went through zero,

00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:39.809
and had a constant slope,

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:44.148
so a diode is a really
different kind of device,

00:02:44.148 --> 00:02:48.315
it's a non-linear device,
as we can see from this.

00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:53.264
Let me move up here and now
we'll go to a next level model,

00:02:53.264 --> 00:02:57.347
that is actually the one
I wanna talk about most.

00:02:59.218 --> 00:03:02.738
This is the model of diode
that we use most of the time,

00:03:02.738 --> 00:03:05.655
so I'll call this model number two.

00:03:06.706 --> 00:03:08.938
This is the model that you use
when you'll simulate circuits

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:11.799
or simulate diodes and we're gonna talk

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.826
about this a little bit more.

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:17.993
When you have a diode, if I
gave you a diode like this,

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.629
and I said what's the IV curve of it?

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.796
So what I would do is I
would find some sort of box

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.397
that made voltage for me, a power supply,

00:03:32.696 --> 00:03:33.906
with an adjustment on it,

00:03:33.906 --> 00:03:38.073
and then I would also have
something that read current.

00:03:40.895 --> 00:03:45.062
So this is an ammeter, and
this is a voltage supply.

00:03:46.224 --> 00:03:48.385
And we hook that up like that.

00:03:48.385 --> 00:03:50.693
What we're gonna do is we're
gonna generate this IV curve

00:03:50.693 --> 00:03:54.110
by making actual measurements of I and V.

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:59.176
So my first V setting is zero,

00:03:59.176 --> 00:04:01.676
that gives me this point here,

00:04:02.512 --> 00:04:05.034
I hope I measure a current of zero,

00:04:05.034 --> 00:04:06.538
otherwise this thing
would be generating power,

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:08.538
which it's not gonna do.

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.220
And then I turn up the voltage slightly,

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.757
and what I notice is there's no current,

00:04:12.757 --> 00:04:15.512
there's no current when
it's at point one volts,

00:04:15.512 --> 00:04:16.880
or point two volts.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.880
And then when it gets to
around point six volts,

00:04:22.225 --> 00:04:25.225
on the diode, here's VD, and here's,

00:04:32.524 --> 00:04:34.092
when the voltage on the
diode is around point six volts

00:04:34.092 --> 00:04:35.619
what I notice is the current goes up.

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:37.559
So it goes up to five milliamps,

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:40.284
and then a little bit higher,
it goes up to ten milliamps,

00:04:40.284 --> 00:04:43.761
like that, and I can
plot out all these points

00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:46.374
along this part of the curve.

00:04:46.374 --> 00:04:49.899
Now, I go back here and
I change the voltage here

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:52.828
to read the other way around,

00:04:52.828 --> 00:04:56.995
and that means I'm traveling
this way on the voltage axis.

00:04:59.073 --> 00:05:03.112
And what I'll read, my ammeter,
will read zero milliamps.

00:05:03.112 --> 00:05:05.710
Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.046
And so they plot in this
part of the line here.

00:05:09.046 --> 00:05:12.202
Now if I make this voltage
really large and really negative,

00:05:12.202 --> 00:05:15.299
say I make this like minus 50 volts,

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:17.216
that's this point here,

00:05:18.263 --> 00:05:21.938
what happens is I see a really
sharp increasing current,

00:05:21.938 --> 00:05:25.438
like that right there, and it keeps going.

00:05:26.863 --> 00:05:30.874
And that is called the
breakdown, VBR is breakdown.

00:05:30.874 --> 00:05:32.289
And for silicon diodes,

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.400
minus 50 volts is a
typical value for that.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.846
This graph here shows
a break in the scale,

00:05:38.846 --> 00:05:41.706
so this is minus one
volt, minus two volts,

00:05:41.706 --> 00:05:45.516
and then we go all the way out
to 50 volts, minus 50 volts,

00:05:45.516 --> 00:05:47.113
and that's where the breakdown occurs.

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:49.231
And most of the time
when we're using diodes,

00:05:49.231 --> 00:05:52.079
we're using them between
plus or minus one volt

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:53.996
across their terminals.

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.813
That's how we know what the IV
characteristic of a diode is.

00:06:00.813 --> 00:06:02.778
And what we can do is actually,

00:06:02.778 --> 00:06:05.312
for this section of the curve right here,

00:06:05.312 --> 00:06:07.142
for this part of the curve,

00:06:07.142 --> 00:06:09.243
I can model this with an equation.

00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:11.993
And the equation looks like this.

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:15.039
This is the IV equation for a diode,

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.206
so this is sort of like
the Ohm's law for a diode.

00:06:20.363 --> 00:06:23.113
I equals IS, this is the current,

00:06:25.783 --> 00:06:29.950
times e to the q, that's
the charge on an electron,

00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:36.883
times V on the diode, that's
the voltage on the diode,

00:06:36.883 --> 00:06:38.883
divided by kT minus one.

00:06:44.506 --> 00:06:46.043
K is Boltzmann's constant,

00:06:46.043 --> 00:06:48.935
and T is the temperature of the device,

00:06:48.935 --> 00:06:50.518
measured in Kelvin.

00:06:52.562 --> 00:06:56.603
So this equation actually
fits this part of this curve

00:06:56.603 --> 00:06:59.853
for a real diode, it's a fitting curve.

00:07:02.224 --> 00:07:03.939
We'll look at these
constants one at a time.

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:06.939
IS is called the saturation current.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.933
Saturation current.

00:07:17.926 --> 00:07:20.938
And for silicon, for
silicon that's a value

00:07:20.938 --> 00:07:23.938
of about 10 to the minus 12 amperes,

00:07:26.262 --> 00:07:30.713
which is one picoampere,
that's how much IS is.

00:07:30.713 --> 00:07:33.296
Q is the charge on an electron,

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:40.155
and that equals 1.602 times
10 to the minus 19 coulombs.

00:07:47.176 --> 00:07:50.926
That's q, VD is the
voltage across the diode,

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:56.696
K is Boltzmann's constant,
that's a small k, usually,

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:02.866
and that equals 1.38 times 10

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.623
to the minus 23 Joules per Kelvin.

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:20.373
And the last variable is T,

00:08:21.395 --> 00:08:22.938
and that's the temperature,

00:08:22.938 --> 00:08:26.605
and that's measured in
Kelvin, with a big K.

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:30.388
Kelvin is the absolute temperature scale,

00:08:30.388 --> 00:08:34.388
so zero Kelvin equals
minus 273 degrees Celsius.

00:08:41.934 --> 00:08:43.267
Very, very cold.

00:08:44.683 --> 00:08:48.100
So this right here is the diode equation,

00:08:49.755 --> 00:08:52.172
that's the diode IV equation.

00:08:53.458 --> 00:08:57.135
And it has this exponential shape in it,

00:08:57.135 --> 00:08:59.058
it has this exponential term in it,

00:08:59.058 --> 00:09:00.198
but when we look over here,

00:09:00.198 --> 00:09:02.073
maybe this doesn't look
like an exponential curve,

00:09:02.073 --> 00:09:03.636
you haven't seen a curve like that.

00:09:03.636 --> 00:09:05.136
But that actually is just a trick

00:09:05.136 --> 00:09:07.022
of the scale of this drawing,

00:09:07.022 --> 00:09:09.633
so what I wanna do now
is I'm gonna zoom in

00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:12.352
really super close, right
on this origin right here,

00:09:12.352 --> 00:09:16.519
and we're gonna see how this
exponential term shows up,

00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:21.161
and we'll see what the meaning of IS is.

00:09:28.092 --> 00:09:31.509
I equals IS times e qV over KT minus one,

00:09:39.238 --> 00:09:41.769
and here's a close up,
here's an extreme close-up

00:09:41.769 --> 00:09:44.151
on the origin of the diode curve.

00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:46.728
The voltage scale is blown
up by about a factor of 10,

00:09:46.728 --> 00:09:49.958
so here's 1/10th of a volt
forward across the diode,

00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.859
and the current scale is super blown up,

00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:55.610
this is in picoamperes now,

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.094
so this is in 10 to the minus 12th amperes

00:09:58.094 --> 00:10:01.334
instead of 10 to the minus three.

00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:02.332
And you can see here,

00:10:02.332 --> 00:10:05.068
this is a more familiar
looking exponential curve.

00:10:05.068 --> 00:10:07.734
And over here there's a
little bit of an offset,

00:10:07.734 --> 00:10:10.686
there's a little tiny current
in the reverse direction

00:10:10.686 --> 00:10:12.662
when the voltage is negative.

00:10:12.662 --> 00:10:15.329
And this amount here, that's IS,

00:10:17.954 --> 00:10:21.555
flowing in the negative
direction in the diode.

00:10:21.555 --> 00:10:24.832
If we look at the diode equation,
and you let V go negative,

00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:28.999
what happens is this term
here in the diode equation

00:10:29.914 --> 00:10:33.061
becomes very, very small compared to one.

00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:35.728
And what's left is IS times one,

00:10:37.166 --> 00:10:39.580
and that's what we're
looking at right here.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.503
This is a really small current,

00:10:41.503 --> 00:10:43.477
as you can see from the scale here,

00:10:43.477 --> 00:10:47.122
it's down in the low picoamps area.

00:10:47.122 --> 00:10:48.948
Almost all the time you
can ignore this current,

00:10:48.948 --> 00:10:51.115
and just treat it as zero.

00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:54.489
Whenever I wanna use a diode in a circuit,

00:10:54.489 --> 00:10:57.867
and we'll see how we solve
circuits that include

00:10:57.867 --> 00:10:59.396
these non-linear diodes in them.
