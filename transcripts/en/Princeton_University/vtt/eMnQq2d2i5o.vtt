CHRISTOPHER EISGRUBER:
At Princeton, we

00:00:02.015 --> 00:00:04.710
recognize that strengthening New
Jersey's innovation ecosystem

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.890
enhances a vital aspect
of the university's

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.750
educational mission.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.060
Increasingly, our
students and faculty

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.310
hope to bring their
knowledge to bear

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.130
on social, cultural,
and economic problems

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.350
through entrepreneurial
activity.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.530
And our top scholars find that
partnerships with nonprofit,

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.600
corporate, and
government sectors

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.930
help them to identify compelling
research questions that

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.551
make a difference in the world.

00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:32.009
PHIL MURPHY: The Incubator and
Collaborative Workspace Rent

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.350
Initiative-- we have to
make sure we trademark that.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.120
It's easy to-- add the
R&amp;D tax credit will allow

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.760
us to take full advantage
of everything our state has

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.670
to offer entrepreneurs
and startups,

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.690
as well as our established
innovation-driven companies.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.070
They are welcome additions on
top of the existing technology

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.770
business tax certificate
transfer program,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.980
and the angel investor
tax credit program.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.040
And we will continue to grow
our innovation ecosystem

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.430
through the EDA's recently
announced innovation challenge

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.050
for municipalities.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.950
We have everything right here
to dominate the innovation

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.160
economy-- and Chris
referenced this-- the people,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.150
the extraordinary talent,
our location, our history.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.920
We've led this space before.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.190
And through these
programs, we will again.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.080
ANNE-MARIE MAMAN:
This funding program

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.540
is focused on some of the
key elements of a startup

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.080
ecosystem, funding
and education.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.540
The rent support will
help small companies

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.900
to focus their precious
early funding on hiring

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.510
and on hitting milestones.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.480
And the emphasis on educational
programming for entrepreneurs

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.780
will help to make sure that
our entrepreneurs understand

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.540
how to create successful
companies to support

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.472
their innovative technologies.

00:01:50.472 --> 00:01:51.930
DEBBIE HART: The
medical innovation

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.304
that's being
developed right here

00:01:53.304 --> 00:01:55.350
in New Jersey by
our companies and

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.820
by our academic and research
institutions is second to none.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.050
With more than 350,000
direct and indirect jobs,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.900
over 3,100 life
sciences establishments,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.389
and more than 1,000
drugs in development,

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.210
New Jersey is one of
the top three biopharma

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.600
centers in the country, and
one of the top 10 innovation

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.690
hubs in the world.
