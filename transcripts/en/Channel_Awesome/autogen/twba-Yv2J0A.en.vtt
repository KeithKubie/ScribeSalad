that I really liked that in most other
 

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.920
that I really liked that in most other
cases and this could be in most other

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:28.930
cases and this could be in most other
 

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.420
cases and this could be in most other
cases I say this is kind of like

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:30.430
cases I say this is kind of like
 

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.630

repetitive writing and that's that Aang

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:33.640
repetitive writing and that's that Aang
 

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.450
repetitive writing and that's that Aang
has failed before he's going in again to

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:36.460
has failed before he's going in again to
 

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.909
has failed before he's going in again to
redeem himself and in a sense he has

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:38.919
redeem himself and in a sense he has
 

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:40.860
redeem himself and in a sense he has
failed again or he's been outsmarted at

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:40.870
failed again or he's been outsmarted at
 

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.600
failed again or he's been outsmarted at
the very least because the Fire Lord is

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:42.610
the very least because the Fire Lord is
 

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.010
the very least because the Fire Lord is
not there and he couldn't find him and

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:44.020
not there and he couldn't find him and
 

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.180
not there and he couldn't find him and
he couldn't fight uh to feed him uh so

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:48.190
he couldn't fight uh to feed him uh so
 

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.930
he couldn't fight uh to feed him uh so

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.750
now it's payback and he gets his payback
and he could die in the process but he

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760
and he could die in the process but he
 

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.840

he it doesn't even happen it's another
 

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.780
he it doesn't even happen it's another
failure and I think that is important I

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:12.790
failure and I think that is important I
 

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.730
failure and I think that is important I
think that's important thing to set up

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:14.740
think that's important thing to set up
 

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.380
think that's important thing to set up
because I think a lot of people do sort

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:16.390
because I think a lot of people do sort
 

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.150
because I think a lot of people do sort
of think well next time it'll be

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160
of think well next time it'll be
 

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.190
of think well next time it'll be
different and it always will be

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200
different and it always will be
 

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.020
different and it always will be
different and the second time is where

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:22.030
different and the second time is where
 

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.760
different and the second time is where
you build up all the energy and all the

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:23.770
you build up all the energy and all the
 

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.590
you build up all the energy and all the
power and all the strategy and you're

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600
power and all the strategy and you're
 

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.480
power and all the strategy and you're
gonna win this time and it doesn't

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:27.490
gonna win this time and it doesn't
 

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.220
gonna win this time and it doesn't
always happen and again that doesn't

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:29.230
always happen and again that doesn't
 

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:33.090
always happen and again that doesn't
always mean give up uh if there are some

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:33.100
always mean give up uh if there are some
 

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.200
always mean give up uh if there are some
times where the writing is on the wall

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:34.210
times where the writing is on the wall
 

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.240
times where the writing is on the wall
and you have to accept it and that is

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:36.250
and you have to accept it and that is
 

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.620
and you have to accept it and that is
sort of what happened here they could

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:37.630
sort of what happened here they could
 

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.750
sort of what happened here they could
keep looking for the fire Lord but they

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760
keep looking for the fire Lord but they
 

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.870
keep looking for the fire Lord but they
knew people out there could be dying and

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880
knew people out there could be dying and
 

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.610
knew people out there could be dying and
they probably are dying they had to go

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:44.620
they probably are dying they had to go
 

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.780
they probably are dying they had to go
back and they had to help him they have

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:45.790
back and they had to help him they have
 

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.100
back and they had to help him they have
to escape they have to fight another day

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.110
to escape they have to fight another day
 

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.530
to escape they have to fight another day
and this was supposed to be the big

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:49.540
and this was supposed to be the big
 

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.100
and this was supposed to be the big
Redemption and it's not and that's just

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:53.110
Redemption and it's not and that's just
 

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.670
Redemption and it's not and that's just
such another tough defeat to take and on

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:56.680
such another tough defeat to take and on
 

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.160
such another tough defeat to take and on
top of that and now the children are

00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.170
top of that and now the children are
 

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.050
top of that and now the children are
being separated from the parents and

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:01.060
being separated from the parents and
 

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.150
being separated from the parents and
Aang has to go up there and he has the

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.160
Aang has to go up there and he has the
 

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.410
Aang has to go up there and he has the
responsibility looking after these

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:04.420
responsibility looking after these
 

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.830
responsibility looking after these
people and he probably has to hear over

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:07.840
people and he probably has to hear over
 

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.420
people and he probably has to hear over
and over at least in his head that he

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:09.430
and over at least in his head that he
 

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.210
and over at least in his head that he
has failed them and now the adults are

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:12.220
has failed them and now the adults are
 

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.980
has failed them and now the adults are
all in prison or being tortured or

all in prison or being tortured or
 

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.840
all in prison or being tortured or
whatever and it's just so much more to

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:15.850
whatever and it's just so much more to
 

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.050
whatever and it's just so much more to
be thrown on him and like I said in any

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:19.060
be thrown on him and like I said in any
 

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.730
be thrown on him and like I said in any
other show I would say this is too

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:20.740
other show I would say this is too
 

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.260
other show I would say this is too
repetitive because we've seen this we've

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:22.270
repetitive because we've seen this we've
 

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.420
repetitive because we've seen this we've
seen him be harsh on himself and say I'm

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:24.430
seen him be harsh on himself and say I'm
 

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.670
seen him be harsh on himself and say I'm
not going to fail again and he fails

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:26.680
not going to fail again and he fails
 

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.000
not going to fail again and he fails
again but you know that happens it does

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.010
again but you know that happens it does
 

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.400
again but you know that happens it does
happen and I'm curious to see where

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:32.410
happen and I'm curious to see where
 

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:33.810
happen and I'm curious to see where
they're gonna go with that because they

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:33.820
they're gonna go with that because they
 

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.050
they're gonna go with that because they
seem to be very good at taking these

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.060
seem to be very good at taking these
 

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.820
seem to be very good at taking these
emotions you think are going to go in a

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:38.830
emotions you think are going to go in a
 

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.560
emotions you think are going to go in a
certain direction or emotions are going

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:40.570
certain direction or emotions are going
 

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.000
certain direction or emotions are going
to lead to a certain outcome and that

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.010
to lead to a certain outcome and that
 

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:46.020
to lead to a certain outcome and that
outcome doesn't happen and they seem to

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.030
outcome doesn't happen and they seem to
 

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.760
outcome doesn't happen and they seem to
work with that very well they seem to

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:47.770
work with that very well they seem to
 

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.710
work with that very well they seem to
know what to do with that and not become

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:49.720
know what to do with that and not become
 

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.150
know what to do with that and not become
too repetitive so I'm very curious how

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160
too repetitive so I'm very curious how
 

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.620
too repetitive so I'm very curious how
how they're going to have egg deal with

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:55.630
how they're going to have egg deal with
 

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:00.180
how they're going to have egg deal with
this because this is in some respects so

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:00.190
this because this is in some respects so
 

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:01.150
this because this is in some respects so
much

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.160
much
 

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.280
much
worse than before because he had the

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:03.290
worse than before because he had the
 

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.050
worse than before because he had the
time now and he had the ability and

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:05.060
time now and he had the ability and
 

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.879
time now and he had the ability and
everything was said that he was still

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:06.889
everything was said that he was still
 

00:11:06.889 --> 00:11:10.119
everything was said that he was still
outsmarted and just the amount of pain

00:11:10.119 --> 00:11:10.129
outsmarted and just the amount of pain
 

00:11:10.129 --> 00:11:12.400
outsmarted and just the amount of pain
that's going to cause and it just it

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:12.410
that's going to cause and it just it
 

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.619
that's going to cause and it just it
made things so much worse because now

00:11:14.619 --> 00:11:14.629
made things so much worse because now
 

00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:16.480
made things so much worse because now
all these people are in prison and like

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:16.490
all these people are in prison and like
 

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.150
all these people are in prison and like
said now he's looking after all the

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:19.160
said now he's looking after all the
 

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.679
said now he's looking after all the
younger people in this group and it's

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:20.689
younger people in this group and it's
 

00:11:20.689 --> 00:11:22.809
younger people in this group and it's
just so painful and I'm curious to see

00:11:22.809 --> 00:11:22.819
just so painful and I'm curious to see
 

00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:24.670
just so painful and I'm curious to see
how he's going to get through that and

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:24.680
how he's going to get through that and
 

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.040
how he's going to get through that and
the big element of the show seems to be

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:27.050
the big element of the show seems to be
 

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.879
the big element of the show seems to be
that persistence that when you fail it's

00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:30.889
that persistence that when you fail it's
 

00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:33.309
that persistence that when you fail it's
all right it or if I even all right it's

00:11:33.309 --> 00:11:33.319
all right it or if I even all right it's
 

00:11:33.319 --> 00:11:35.290
all right it or if I even all right it's
just gonna happen you're going to fail

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:35.300
just gonna happen you're going to fail
 

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.050
just gonna happen you're going to fail
and you have to keep finding a way of

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:38.060
and you have to keep finding a way of
 

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.100
and you have to keep finding a way of
living with that whether it's

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.110
living with that whether it's
 

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.629
living with that whether it's
confronting it again or trying to change

00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:43.639
confronting it again or trying to change
 

00:11:43.639 --> 00:11:45.280
confronting it again or trying to change
it or whether you just had to live with

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:45.290
it or whether you just had to live with
 

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.949
it or whether you just had to live with
it and I like that they're doing this

00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:47.959
it and I like that they're doing this
 

00:11:47.959 --> 00:11:49.780
it and I like that they're doing this
because they're really switching it

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:49.790
because they're really switching it
 

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.290
because they're really switching it
around with Zuko and Aang and before it

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:53.300
around with Zuko and Aang and before it
 

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.420
around with Zuko and Aang and before it
was really Zuko that was constantly

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:55.430
was really Zuko that was constantly
 

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.090
was really Zuko that was constantly
failing and he had to really question

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:58.100
failing and he had to really question
 

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.059
failing and he had to really question
what he was doing it for and and how he

00:12:01.059 --> 00:12:01.069
what he was doing it for and and how he
 

00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:04.360
what he was doing it for and and how he
was going to do it and why and now you

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:04.370
was going to do it and why and now you
 

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.420
was going to do it and why and now you
have ain't doing the same thing and what

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:07.430
have ain't doing the same thing and what
 

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.280
have ain't doing the same thing and what
are the best moments to do this what's

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:09.290
are the best moments to do this what's
 

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.079
are the best moments to do this what's
the worst moment what's more important

00:12:11.079 --> 00:12:11.089
the worst moment what's more important
 

00:12:11.089 --> 00:12:13.389
the worst moment what's more important
in these moments where do you go how do

00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:13.399
in these moments where do you go how do
 

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:13.809
in these moments where do you go how do
you do it

00:12:13.809 --> 00:12:13.819
you do it
 

00:12:13.819 --> 00:12:16.509
you do it
it's great seeing this sort of switch

00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:16.519
it's great seeing this sort of switch
 

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:18.879
it's great seeing this sort of switch
and it's not but it's not super obvious

00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:18.889
and it's not but it's not super obvious
 

00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:20.740
and it's not but it's not super obvious
all the time

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:20.750
all the time
 

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.900
all the time
like I said I mean right now Sukho if

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:22.910
like I said I mean right now Sukho if
 

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.400
like I said I mean right now Sukho if
they want to do it Zuko would still be

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:24.410
they want to do it Zuko would still be
 

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.809
they want to do it Zuko would still be
with the father and he wouldn't confront

00:12:25.809 --> 00:12:25.819
with the father and he wouldn't confront
 

00:12:25.819 --> 00:12:28.090
with the father and he wouldn't confront
him but instead he's gonna go with the

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:28.100
him but instead he's gonna go with the
 

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.689
him but instead he's gonna go with the
avatar so he has an evolution as well in

00:12:31.689 --> 00:12:31.699
avatar so he has an evolution as well in
 

00:12:31.699 --> 00:12:34.030
avatar so he has an evolution as well in
his character while Aang seems to be

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:34.040
his character while Aang seems to be
 

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:39.160
his character while Aang seems to be
falling more and more uh so in terms of

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:39.170
falling more and more uh so in terms of
 

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.900
falling more and more uh so in terms of
achievements anyway you know is he he

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:40.910
achievements anyway you know is he he
 

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.280
achievements anyway you know is he he
couldn't defeat the Fire Lord if

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:42.290
couldn't defeat the Fire Lord if
 

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.650
couldn't defeat the Fire Lord if
anything he's made things worse so I

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:44.660
anything he's made things worse so I
 

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.639
anything he's made things worse so I
like seeing this all sort of balancing

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:48.649
like seeing this all sort of balancing
 

00:12:48.649 --> 00:12:50.259
like seeing this all sort of balancing
out the sort of balancing act and it's

00:12:50.259 --> 00:12:50.269
out the sort of balancing act and it's
 

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:52.150
out the sort of balancing act and it's
not always I was really afraid for a

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160
not always I was really afraid for a
 

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.069
not always I was really afraid for a
while that just the whole show all the

00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079
while that just the whole show all the
 

00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:56.920
while that just the whole show all the
seasons was gonna be Zuko chasing him

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:56.930
seasons was gonna be Zuko chasing him
 

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:01.299
seasons was gonna be Zuko chasing him
and I'm glad it's not I'm glad early in

00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:01.309
and I'm glad it's not I'm glad early in
 

00:13:01.309 --> 00:13:02.679
and I'm glad it's not I'm glad early in
the second season

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:02.689
the second season
 

00:13:02.689 --> 00:13:04.869
the second season
Zuko decides to leave the Fire Nation

00:13:04.869 --> 00:13:04.879
Zuko decides to leave the Fire Nation
 

00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:07.299
Zuko decides to leave the Fire Nation
and other people are after him and I'm

00:13:07.299 --> 00:13:07.309
and other people are after him and I'm
 

00:13:07.309 --> 00:13:10.090
and other people are after him and I'm
glad that in the third season it's very

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:10.100
glad that in the third season it's very
 

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.799
glad that in the third season it's very
much like they were defeated and now

00:13:11.799 --> 00:13:11.809
much like they were defeated and now
 

00:13:11.809 --> 00:13:13.540
much like they were defeated and now
it's time to rise back up and it's the

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:13.550
it's time to rise back up and it's the
 

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.030
it's time to rise back up and it's the
fight back

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040
fight back
 

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.490
fight back
how do you do it will it even be

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:16.500
how do you do it will it even be
 

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.780
how do you do it will it even be
successful because now they're

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:17.790
successful because now they're
 

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.689
successful because now they're
introducing these possibilities at least

00:13:20.689 --> 00:13:20.699
introducing these possibilities at least
 

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:22.730
introducing these possibilities at least
in the realm of this world that it may

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:22.740
in the realm of this world that it may
 

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.470
in the realm of this world that it may
be it won't be successful this was like

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480
be it won't be successful this was like
 

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.629
be it won't be successful this was like
their big moment and it totally got

00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639
their big moment and it totally got
 

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.629
their big moment and it totally got
fucked up so I'm I'm even though we know

00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639
fucked up so I'm I'm even though we know
 

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:30.590
fucked up so I'm I'm even though we know
it's gonna turn out good in the end

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600
it's gonna turn out good in the end
 

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.269
it's gonna turn out good in the end
again take a look at um you know you

00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279
again take a look at um you know you
 

00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:37.730
again take a look at um you know you
know it's gonna be alright but you don't

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:37.740
know it's gonna be alright but you don't
 

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.620
know it's gonna be alright but you don't
know how and you don't know the journey

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:39.630
know how and you don't know the journey
 

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.059
know how and you don't know the journey
that they're gonna go through and they

00:13:41.059 --> 00:13:41.069
that they're gonna go through and they
 

00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:43.430
