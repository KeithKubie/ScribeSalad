00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.057
- IT WAS EXCITING FOR ME,

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:27.194
BUT FOR JACK, WELL,
HE HAD SPENT HIS WHOLE LIFE

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.629
DREAMING OF THIS MOMENT,

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:31.632
NEVER REALLY BELIEVING
IT WAS WITHIN REACH.

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:34.067
LIFE IS TRULY FULL OF SURPRISES.

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:35.269
- I LOVE THIS.
- YEAH.

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:36.937
- AND I LOVE YOU.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.139
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR BRINGING ME ON THIS TRIP.

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:40.374
- AW, DAD.

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:42.809
- AND, FORREST,
I WANT TO SEE YOU

00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:44.411
GET BACK TOGETHER
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:45.779
- AW.
- I DO.

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:47.648
AND AS SOON AS WE'RE OFF
THIS SPACESHIP,

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:50.150
I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING IN MY
POWER TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS.

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:52.719
A DAUGHTER DOESN'T LISTEN
TO ANYONE MORE THAN THEIR POP.

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:55.789
BELIEVE ME.
- OKAY.

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:58.158
- TEN, NINE...

00:00:58.192 --> 00:01:01.261
all:
EIGHT, SEVEN, SIX,

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:07.334
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:08.635
- INITIATE LAUNCH.

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:10.637
- THAT'S ONE SMALL STEP
FOR MAN--

00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:13.407
- NO.
JACK!

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.078
- ALTITUDE, 300,360 FEET.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.447
WELCOME TO SPACE.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.115
[all screaming]
- OH, MY GOD.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.584
- OH, NO!
NO, JACK!

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:25.085
JACK!
- OH, MY GOD, IS HE--

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:26.119
- JACK, YOU CANNOT BE DEAD!

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:27.187
THERE'S NO WAY!

00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:28.689
YOU GOT TO TALK TO SUZANNE!

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:30.591
JACK, YOU GOT TO TALK
TO SUZANNE!

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:32.492
OH--OH, NO.

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:34.595
BUT HE WAS DEAD.

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:37.130
MY DEAR VIEWER,
IT SADDENS ME TO SAY

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:40.334
THAT JACK'S TRAGIC FAILURE
TO FASTEN HIS SAFETY HARNESS

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:43.303
HAD ENDED THE LIFE
OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY MAN

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:48.141
AND CAST A HORRIBLE PALL
OVER THIS JOURNEY INTO SPACE.

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:50.978
BUT THE JOURNEY WOULD GO ON.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.716
- GUYS, I'M REALLY SORRY
TO DO THIS,

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:00.153
BUT I'VE KIND OF PROMISED
TO PROMOTE PRODUCTS,

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:02.890
SO, UH...

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:04.525
STEAK 'N SHAKE--

00:02:04.558 --> 00:02:07.794
WHERE THE STEAKBURGER'S
ALWAYS OUT OF THIS WORLD.

00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:09.396
U-HAUL--

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.732
WHETHER IT'S ONE SMALL STEP
OR ONE GIANT LEAP,

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:14.067
U-HAUL WILL GET YOU THERE.

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.636
KRISPY KREME--

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.971
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
WHO BROUGHT THE DOUGHNUTS?

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:19.072
HUH?

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:24.578
- MY FELLOW TRAVELERS HAD FORKED
OVER A LOT OF MONEY

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:26.547
FOR THIS ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
EXPERIENCE,

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.917
SO YOU COULDN'T BLAME THEM FOR
DOING WHAT THEY CAME HERE TO DO.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.386
- SO...
- WAIT. ARE--ARE YOU...

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.254
- I DON'T KNOW.
- OH, MY GOD.

00:02:34.288 --> 00:02:35.556
OH, MY GOD.

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.659
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:40.160
BRYCE.

00:02:40.194 --> 00:02:41.762
- WILL YOU MARRY ME, CARRIE?

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:43.597
- OH, IT'S GORGEOUS.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.933
OF COURSE I WILL.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:47.835
IS THIS ON TAPE?
- DID WE GET IT ON TAPE?

00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:49.536
- WAIT. WAS THAT--
- UH...

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.106
- WAS THAT BODY IN FRONT
OF THERE THE WHOLE TIME?
