00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.880
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Good morning everyone, and welcome
yet another attempt at The App Clinic of video

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.510
players.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.210
But before we get started, you know, we're
going to be reviewing these video player apps.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.840
And frankly I don't really understand what
the big deal is.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.410
I mean, I've had a look at the code.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.839
And as far as I can see, this is all we need
to do, right?

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:31.099
We just need to, you know, get a video to
view, put it somewhere on my screen, and then

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.730
it's just a simple matter of passing in different
URLs, right?

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.770
I mean, if that's all there is too it, what's
the challenge?

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.940
Why are there--why are these apps popular?

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.190
Why can't people just, you know, build it
themselves.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.190
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Sure.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.660
Your ignorance astounds me.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.280
You might think that of course, having a video
view that's so easy to use would make it very

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.800
easy to write a video app.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.800
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.800
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The truth is in software, things
that are very easy to use are often not very

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.800
powerful.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.530
And that's exactly the way that video player
turned out.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.750
Now, we started way back in the--in the early
days of Android, with media playback via the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.850
MediaPlayer API.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.220
Of course, that's what we just saw with this
sim, that's actually a one call fire and forget

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.100
way of playing back video.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.110
A MediaPlayer is really easy to use.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.920
But it's probably too easy to use, especially
if you're looking for professional custom

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.030
solutions.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.420
It's basically a black box.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.990
If you have any kind of special needs, you're
out luck.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.990
For instance, MediaPlayer is hardware accelerated.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.190
But, it's hardware accelerated differently
on different platforms, on different versions

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.460
EOS and different OEM devices.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.680
And there's no way to find out what type of
hardware acceleration you're getting.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.680
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Huh.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.979
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, that's not really a problem
if you don't want customization because you're

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.770
always guaranteed that an Android device will
playback H2--H.264 baseline profile.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.610
A lot of people don't like baseline profile
though especially people who have already

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.680
encoded for other devices.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.390
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Shocked.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.230
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, when we launched Honeycomb,
we decided to make some improvements and we

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.840
supported an API called OpenMAX AL.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.069
Now, the truth is OpenMAX AL was not necessarily
our first choice because it's not a Java API.

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.189
But, it is a cron standard, much like OpenGL
and allowed us to get some of the professional

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.010
features that we were looking for.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.439
So, if you wanted professional features in
Honeycomb and in Ice Cream Sandwich, OpenMAX

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:36.680
AL is a great choice.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.919
The drawback is you've got to write your code
in C. With Ice Cream Sandwich we also introduced

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:50.249
a new way of working with video, and that
was the texture review and service view.

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:56.860
So these--the ability to actually work with
video textures allowed you to do some more

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.529
interesting things like real time video effects.

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:00.829
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.620
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But things didn't really get
real until Jelly Bean.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.019
Jelly Bean is the apotheosis of video APIs,
by which I mean we have a Java API that works.

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.019
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.040
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Jelly Bean supports what we call
MediaCodec.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.709
A MediaCodec is not an easy to use API by
any means.

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.730
But it's a sort of API that if you are a professional
that writes video apps for a living and understands

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.489
media.

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.889
You're going to love it or at least hate it
considerably less.

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.899
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Minimizing hate factor, that's what
we're all about.

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:35.899
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:40.420
It gives you low level access to the media
acceleration hardware and it gives you an

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.870
API to query what formats the hardware supports.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.169
So like I said, it's not a simple API by any
means.

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:55.079
But it is professional and it supports most
of the used cases and corner cases that a

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.599
really nice video player needs.

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.409
And we'll see some of those used cases as
we look at the apps.

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:06.480
For instance, as I mentioned media player
will only hardware accelerate certain formats.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.480
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I see.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.489
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And you don't necessarily know
what formats those are.

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.710
So, it's impossible with media player to make
an application that claims to support every

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.489
format or even a large number of formats.

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.530
And I think, we noticed that one of the selling
points to the players that we're looking at

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.160
today, is how many different media formats
they support.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.539
That was one of the biggest things which most
of them claimed, was which media formats they

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:32.539
support...

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:33.539
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:34.539
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...being able to play things back.

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.310
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And without MediaCodec, your
stuck with two unattractive choices.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:47.810
You can either only support the baseline formats
that are hardware accelerated across all Android

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.810
devices.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.810
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Or you do everything with a software
decoder and don't support hardware decoding

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.480
at all.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.480
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Right.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.709
And that's going to result in worse playback,
right?

00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:02.790
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: In general, or at the very least
a lower battery life, because a software implementation

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.480
is going to require a lot more power since...

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.480
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That makes sense.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.169
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...it's being done the CPU and
you know, less efficient SOC--part of the

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.169
SOC.

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.169
&gt;&gt; MEIER: There you go.

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.169
That was educational.

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:14.169
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.120
So let's talk about, if you decided to make
a media app.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.120
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Indeed.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.300
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: What should it be?

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.300
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.349
So, let's have a look.

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.870
So these are the--these are the criteria which
we are looking for.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.879
The prescriptions if you will for making a
great video player app.

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:33.449
And I think we want to break this down into
two general categories.

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:34.449
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Sure.

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:40.380
These are the main two pieces of functionality
that every video app we looked at has.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.380
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.830
And you'll note also that we--the apps that
we're looking at here are video players.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.801
So this is apps where you're playing back
video that you've already downloaded, put

00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:53.719
on to your device somehow rather than apps
which are designed for discovering content.

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:54.719
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:56.629
So this isn't Hulu or Netflix.

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:02.039
This isn't a Google Play or a streaming service.

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.650
This is all about, you've gotten video, you
know, from your camcorder or you downloaded

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.740
it from one of these sources.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.240
And you want to take a look at it.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.360
So there's--the two categories are Browsing
and Playback.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.980
So for Browse, it's really about easy organization.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.560
It's about being able to discover the information
that you've already got on your device.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.760
And so you've got one or two videos, then
that should be really straight forward.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.689
But, you've got to think in terms of scale.

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:28.810
What if you've got, you know, tens or hundreds
of videos that you want to be able to browse

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:29.810
through.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.810
What's that experience like?

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.219
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know, we sort of went through
a lot of this with audio...

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:33.219
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:38.520
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...playback apps when we talked
about those about a month ago and how one

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.500
thing that can make or break an app is how
easy it is to discover the content that you

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.250
want to play and ignore the content that you
don't.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.280
And one of the most important things that
a video app can do in the browse mode is,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.449
respect to the .nomedia file, that a lot of
game developers for instance will download

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:06.319
a bunch of AVIs or MPEG4s to a media directory,
so that they can play it later on in the game.

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:12.150
Now, because that's not a universally accessible
global media directory that's meant to be

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.150
played by anyone.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.150
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:20.229
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: They'll stick a .nomedia file
inside that directory, and if you don't respect

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:21.229
that.

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:22.229
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You need a little noise.

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:23.229
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:26.080
You're going to get cut scenes from games
that you didn't even know existed.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.210
And a lot times they don't have very informative
names.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sure.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That ends up being kind of a
spoiler really.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.220
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.169
And you don't know what that is until it's
the end scene from a game that you're halfway

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:35.169
through playing.

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:36.169
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yup.

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:37.169
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So as...

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:38.719
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Thanks a lot, Bard's Tale is
ruined for me.

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:41.979
&gt;&gt; MEIER: In terms of playback, it's kind
of what you'd expect.

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:46.090
And again, what we've sort of described already
in terms of why you're building these apps

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.090
to begin with.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.020
And it's the ability to be able to play back
pretty much anything.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.949
So I don't want to have to think about what
the codecs are, how it's being transcoded.

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:56.080
I just want to copy stuff onto the device
and have it played back.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.080
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.629
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And I wanted to it efficiently as
well, so hardware decoding where possible.

00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:01.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.060
I also wanted to have my app support subtitles.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.520
This is really important for hearing impaired
people.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.090
To me, it's important because I like to watch
foreign language films.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.569
My wife does not speak English as a foreign
or as a first language.

00:08:16.569 --> 00:08:17.569
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:19.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You have some problems with American
I believe Reto, so...

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:20.770
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's right.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:21.770
It can get confusing.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:22.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.370
So, you need to have those subtitles just
incase.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.770
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:30.529
And the last thing we wanted to talk about
was the notification bar or status bar.

00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:35.270
Being the real one, and we saw a lot of apps
trying to sort of, half take our advice here

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.602
and say, "Oh well people say that they want
to have their status bar visible because they

00:08:38.602 --> 00:08:39.919
want to see what the time is.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:44.180
They want to see, you know, that sort of information,
battery life, wifi connectivity..."

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.230
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well and of course they weren't
taking our advice.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.960
I mean, these are features these apps have
had for a long time.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.960
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, apparently.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.800
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's obvious that people want
to be able to see the sorts of things that

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.770
they see in a notification bar, battery life
and the clock being two very important once.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:57.770
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.800
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But if you're going to show that
already.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.950
Why not just support all of these cases.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.660
When I have a notification, I want to be able
to pull it down.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:10.710
I want to know if I need to stop watching
my video because there's an important meeting

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.889
that I completely forgot about.

00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:12.889
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:15.740
So let's have a look at the apps which we're
going to check out today.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.870
So the poor app developers for these apps
who have been waiting for two or three weeks

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:24.900
now for this feedback, but we're going to
be looking at MX Player, CineXPlayer and DICE

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.900
player.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.360
So three video playing apps there.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.980
So, let's get started, I guess.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:31.980
Let's kick off of it.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.580
The first step we wanted to look at was CineXPlayer.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.620
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And as you can see we've got the--they've
got a feature graphic which is really nice.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:45.280
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, and the feature graphic
here is nicely done.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.960
But, I wouldn't use this one personally.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.680
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, I mean, you can see we're
looking at a confidence model.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.760
It's from a fair distance away.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.990
And you can't really read the name of the
app from here.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.290
It fades into the background, the contrast
isn't really high enough, and the words are

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.290
too small.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:06.230
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No, all I see is X with maybe
an E and something that's either an R or an

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.850
X.
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Next to it, yeah.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:08.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:09.850
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Who can say?

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.850
So that, you know, they've got the table stakes
here, they've got the ability to be featured

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.180
or promoted in Google Play by having a feature
graphic which is really important...

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.180
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.150
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...but they haven't taken advantage
of it.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:24.190
We've seen just recently people blogging,
talking about the fact that just having a

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:28.460
better feature graphic can have significant
impact and your downloads, should you be fortunate

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.460
enough to be promoted.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.460
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.510
I can--I can guarantee that for this one they
wouldn't run it.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:38.080
They--this would get kicked back to the developer
just because it's eligible at those--at those

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.080
dimensions.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.080
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, what--why don't you show
me what the CineXPlayer does, you know.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.260
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:49.440
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know, we've got our fancy
HDMI set up, does not work today and the reason

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:58.470
is that most video apps do not actually display
the UI out of the HDMI port so instead what

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:04.140
we've got is a--an even fancier and far more
expensive solution on the...

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.140
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...in this high-tech home movie
camera pointed at the screen here so we'll

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:10.930
go ahead and...

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:11.930
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:12.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...see how that works today.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.000
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sort of camera you expect to see--seeing
in the movie Super 8 primarily.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.360
Probably the one's filming the movie Super
8 rather than be featured in the movie Super

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.360
8.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.790
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, this is CineX and so CineXPlayer
so you can see straight away we've opened

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:25.790
it up.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.311
We've got a really customized display or at
least you can see part of it with the--with

00:11:29.311 --> 00:11:31.100
the reflection.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:35.720
But that kind of makes the point and then
it is a--it is a very dark looking display.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.760
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.070
I'm not going to complain actually...

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.070
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No, that's fine.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.040
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You don't want to make complains
about the other apps it's that they're too

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.040
white.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.040
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Too white.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.040
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.040
Yeah.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.040
Yes.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.790
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And part of the--but the big deal
here is that it is entirely gray.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:53.040
We've got these massive areas here for thumbnails
which are populated which is a little bit

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.180
surprising presuming that this--that these
movies can be played back.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.101
It's kind of weird that you wouldn't display
something.

00:11:59.101 --> 00:12:02.690
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, that was the thing that
really confused me is it felt like we had

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:06.680
a thumbnail area but there's no thumbnail
anywhere I mean, I...

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.680
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Even on, you know camcorder videos
and stuff that I completely expected to have

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.250
a thumbnail the things that even had a thumbnail
in the gallery.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.250
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.100
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Are not shown with thumbnails,
so I--did they just run out of time or...

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.100
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's hard to say.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.570
It's disappointing though because I mean,
this is--a video playing app is very visual

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.570
that's kind of the point.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:25.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.660
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And so part of creating that immersive
experience is to have the thumbnails here

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.240
so that you're immediately drown into--to
watch one of these things.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.930
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Really--about all these apps is
about engagement and I think we're lacking

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:36.930
here.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.530
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, I think we're, you know,
we don't want to spend too much more time

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.900
on this black screen so why don't we...

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.900
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Why don't we go ahead and play
this week in Android development.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:44.970
Oh.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Can't be done.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Disappointing.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.900
So, it's nice that they gave you the ability
to report it but disappointing that it is

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:53.900
not able to play back.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.030
What--it seems to be a reasonably standard
and encoded MP4.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:01.230
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Being the MP4 that you pirated
off in YouTube.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.670
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes, that's you know, well, I'd
like to think it is the MP4 that I uploaded

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.850
to YouTube rather than the one I pulled down
from YouTube.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:07.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:12.700
Now, I just noticed that my--that my microphone
here is falling off and so we probably a need

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.310
a lot of dialogue help-in post.

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:20.620
But I mean, let me just clip that right back
on here.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.620
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Which is a nice change.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:25.190
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: [INDISTINCT] everybody like,
I--but I was too loud today.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:28.530
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So let's close this then.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:32.120
So, it does give you the ability report which
presumably will give then the ability to get

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.370
feedback on what encoding types they don't
support.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:38.890
But we can go back here and click on this
other video and have that play back.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:39.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:45.070
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And so right away we can see as
we disappear here.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:49.720
We've kind of got partially immersive but
not really, I mean, it's thumbnail but that's

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.800
fine because it is a very small, a very low
resolution proof.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, well this--is this
Technicolor?

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.010
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It is.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.010
It is Technicolor.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.050
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Can we--can we get it to--there
we go.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.050
&gt;&gt; MEIER: There you go.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.850
So, we can blow it up so you can have the
Native resolution or blow it up to full which

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.170
is nice.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:07.030
And we go full screen but we don't really
go full screen not--yeah, you can see on the

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.890
display that the navigation along the bottom
is too visible.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:10.890
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, is that a fridge.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:11.890
Okay.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:12.890
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It could be.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:17.500
Has--as this is the standard notification
so my--it kind of feels like my status bar

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.970
should have gone away and if this was running
on a phone I can tell you that it would, that

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:25.500
the status bar would have disappeared but
because this isn't targeting tablet devices,

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.080
these aren't targeting Android 11.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.490
We have the mini button it's kind of shameful
and what it's doing here but it's all the

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:33.740
standard menu button of shame.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:38.960
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, I cant you that--not targeting
Android 11 it's actually the main problem

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.960
with this app.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.960
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.980
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But Android technology is we
just learned has moved on considerably from

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:52.140
the old Ginger and Froyo days where we didn't
have a particularly good system wide store

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.840
for video and now we've got so much better
APIs.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:04.120
The hard work has come along considerably
the framework now supports a much--not only

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.250
much better video playback but also much more
interesting UI Organization.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.250
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:12.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's a shame that CineXPlayer
is not enough with the times and that way.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.910
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.660
So, again, so the big thing here which would
be nice to see--so they've actually implemented

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:23.060
this pseudo notification bar along the top
here, which does have--let's see if I can

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.180
pause and that'll stop.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.370
So it does have the time.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.650
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It has the battery life as well
so it's trying to give us the sort of information

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:33.710
which would normally be in my notification
bar but frankly I just want my notification

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:38.150
bar back and in this instance is not even
getting rid of it so it's sort of a redundant.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.000
A few other things which, you know, which
I wanted to mention while we're looking at

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.920
CineXPlayer, the menu button which I already
mentioned this should be bringing up a menu

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.410
ideally as part of an ActionBar overflow menu.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:50.410
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:51.980
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And what you're looking at here
is really settings.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.620
We should leave behind the settings dialogue.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.620
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.301
&gt;&gt; MEIER: What you can see at the bottom here
is which is really nice is that they have

00:15:57.301 --> 00:16:03.170
used the audio effects APIs in Android which
is allowing you to modify things like treble,

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:08.210
bass, 3D effect and bass boost which is all
part of the Android media effects framework

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.850
which is a really nice feature for them to
build in.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That is cool.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.650
All right.

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:19.120
Oh, I think that that gives us a good idea
of what CineXPlayer is about.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.920
Let's go ahead and go on to our next victim.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.510
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-huh, absolutely.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:28.010
So, I think the next, oh, well, before we
do move on there is one thing I wanted to

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:34.090
mention which is if you look at the--at the
market listing of the Google Play listing

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:35.090
for this app.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:39.680
They mentioned that they require the phone
state permission to be able to listen when

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.840
you've got incoming calls presumably to pause,
playback and do sensible things.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.890
Now as it happens that probably over thinking
it.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.269
So, Android does already give you a way to
be able to know when things like that happened.

00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:51.269
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:53.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Most basic of which is little pause
your activity.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.230
&gt;&gt; MEIER: When that happens it's probably
a good time to just pause and put everything

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.230
in stasis.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.800
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know, another note on that
here I've noticed that this is--in my opinion

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:09.059
what separates the more professional developers
from the less professional developers, I don't

00:17:09.059 --> 00:17:10.059
know.

00:17:10.059 --> 00:17:13.900
I think you and I have discussed before we're
both readers every now and then we take a

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.950
look at the website called the dailywtf.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:16.950
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:24.300
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And it seemed like 90% of the
WTF moments on that site come from a developer

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:32.140
finding some convoluted way to get the result
they want and not asking, gee, is there a

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:38.120
better way to his like instead of writing
200 lines of date and time parsing code in

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:44.810
Java wouldn't you want to use the date time
class and wouldn't a wise developer think

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:48.870
to themselves I wonder if such a thing is
a date time class exist.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:52.930
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It reminds me of my graphics class,
one of my first graphics class at college

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.160
where we're giving--given a task to draw a
circle...

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.630
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...on a canvas.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:03.250
And so we all disappeared into the lab and
after a few moments most of us had the, uh-huh,

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.080
moment when, "Oh, canvas.drawCircle."

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.640
That was not enough to display some of the
more intrepid folks who had all the arch signs

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.730
and cosigns and were building the whole thing
through a series loops and it's like that,

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.840
very impressive and entirely a waste of time.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.050
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Admirable, but yes.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:24.200
Unless you're--unless you're doing this from
the ground up on 1980s there are hardware

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.691
there is probably an accelerated routine in
there that you would never be able to write

00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:29.691
on your own because...

00:18:29.691 --> 00:18:30.691
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:18:30.691 --> 00:18:34.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...you don't have access to those
particular parts of the framework and those

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.600
particular parts of the hardware.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.600
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:42.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And this is a good example of
that if you--if you find yourself in a place

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:47.530
where you need to make the Android device
do something or you need to do something in

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.570
response to what the Android device is doing.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:50.570
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmmm.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:54.130
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And you find yourself writing
convoluted code that asks "What is the user

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:58.930
doing or am I on a tablet so I know whether
to rotate into portrait...

00:18:58.930 --> 00:18:59.930
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmmm.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.060
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...or landscape" or you just
doing a lot of queries.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:06.150
Chances are--and this is not always true but
there's a really...

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.150
&gt;&gt; MEIER: The good chance.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:10.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...high likelihood that you're
going to be able to find something, some of

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:16.570
that you can just catch in the Android framework
and if for some reason that doesn't suffice

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:22.920
if you found a place where let's say on pause
does not give you the information you need

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.910
to pause then that's a bug and that should
be reported.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:27.910
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's right.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.220
And we will--yeah, we would definitely listen
to that with interest.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:35.190
In terms of audio playback in fact there is
a one additional step you can take which is

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.480
listen for the lost of audio focus.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.260
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, you may find that, you know,
while you're watching a movie that we have

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:46.410
some other audio app starts playing and you
want to be able to pause when that happens

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:51.800
you can listen to the listen for lost of audio
focus and pause your playback at the same

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.650
time and there is in fact in Android training
class called managing audio playback which

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.790
will give you all the information you need
to do exactly that.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:05.180
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And read that class because even
apps which correctly catch audio focus change

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.600
messages have done some horrible, horrible
things.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.600
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.450
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: What was the one we were just
looking at an app which, actually in response

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:19.429
to audio focus change, started playing something
a zero volume stream that was muted.

00:20:19.429 --> 00:20:21.350
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, that's helpful.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.350
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:28.809
And for some reason I don't know the whole
story but after playing that app nothing else

00:20:28.809 --> 00:20:30.580
would play in the entire whole system.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.580
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Interesting.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because it...

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.580
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Perhaps it never gave back audio
focus.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.390
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It had just decided to play a zero
volume focus.

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:38.390
That's impressive.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.390
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yes.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.550
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, the next app which we wanted
to look at is MX Player.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:45.750
Now, this is an app that's I think you looked
at in more detail, but I've been fact used

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.760
this one a little bit myself.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.659
So, we're both a little bit familiar.

00:20:48.659 --> 00:20:49.659
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:20:49.659 --> 00:20:54.700
I think we both ended up really enjoying the
playback functionality of this.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:55.700
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Although I was a little disappointed
in the browsing functionality.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.470
Now, you don't have quite as much on your
device as I did.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.470
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sure.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:07.640
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But you--it starts out with this
really simple browsing interface.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.480
Now, unfortunately it has something that looks
like an action bar.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.480
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But it doesn't really act like
an action bar.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.380
There's no navigation.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.380
There's no auto affordance.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.380
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Right.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, when I moved down into these
movies folder for instance.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:21.860
Although I get pretty much what you expect.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.670
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Now you get the file now, yeah.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.549
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: There's no way for me to move
up.

00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:26.549
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh.

00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:29.700
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And there's no real indication
that I've moved into a different location

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.110
in the hierarchy.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:36.350
Now, once I had several different folders
and play list and alternate locations...

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.350
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.350
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...on my device.

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.059
I found that to be sort of disorienting.

00:21:41.059 --> 00:21:42.059
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:42.059 --> 00:21:46.750
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I didn't really like not knowing
where I was in the--in the general hierarchy

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.750
of my device.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:48.910
It might just be me.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:49.910
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.250
I think it's an interesting point and something
consistent between all of these apps which

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:57.160
is at the browsing experience doesn't seem
optimized for content discovery.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.260
So, I can see where these apps will probably
come from as people who have this content

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.440
and they wanted to view it on their tablets.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.180
The Native MediaPlayer can do the job and
so they build apps to do that.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.390
So, knowing what's on there and having it
already in a directory structure and, you

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.420
know chance is it's probably going to be enough
for them to understand.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:17.330
But as you're trying to build something for
more people to use who didn't build the app,

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:20.100
you really need to make things like navigation
much more prominent.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.750
So, people who didn't design it still understand
how it works.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.750
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:27.100
I feel like the--in this case the navigation
is workman like.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.100
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.810
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It certainly does the job but
it doesn't show the sort of craft that we've

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.660
come to expect out of the top Android apps.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:34.660
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And that's sad because the playback
screen...

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.940
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:38.940
This is where it really...

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:39.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...is really amazing.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:40.940
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...really shines.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:41.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.990
So, I'm going to resume watching--I'm still
getting Android developments.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.790
The playback is great, immediately comes full
screen.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:23:01.520
When I decide to bring up the UI it gives
me not only a nice--a nicer UI.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.520
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.050
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know, with this a little
less of extrusive.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:08.760
But also let's me know for instance am I hardware
accelerated or...

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.350
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, I use software or hardware decoded,
nice.

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:12.350
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:13.350
It let's me choose.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:18.070
It does have--you know, we didn't see all
of this on the--on the tablet but on the phone

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.190
I believe it does actually bring up the real
notification bar and...

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:22.190
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Well, indeed.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.190
And you can see that...

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:24.190
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.190
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...if we hit play here we'll--oh
no, it doesn't--it does.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:26.190
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.190
So, it goes...

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.500
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, you can see everything's disappeared
and in fact even the navigation here.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:33.519
So, it's using the Android 4.0, you know,
low profile stuff.

00:23:33.519 --> 00:23:34.519
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:23:34.519 --> 00:23:35.890
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And on a phone it will do exactly
that.

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:37.970
So, it gives you this completely immersive
experience.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:39.960
No notifications, no clocks, nothing.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.840
As soon as you hit the screen, boom.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.840
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.840
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You get it all back.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.840
You get the status bar.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.840
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.840
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You get the action bar.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.940
You get status and navigation the whole thing.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.810
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And I like that it keeps the
UI up when I'm paused, right?

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:52.810
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:56.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It has a very nice scrubbing
functionality here.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.580
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very nice.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:02.090
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It also has some gestures which
I think are really interesting.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:09.150
The moving left to right in the middle of
the screen will scrub for a little bit more

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.150
sensitivity.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.150
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.509
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And then on one side of the screen
you get brightness.

00:24:13.509 --> 00:24:14.509
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:24:14.509 --> 00:24:16.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And then on the other side you
get volume.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.680
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very nice.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, that's a cool innovation.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.680
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, definitely.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.680
I like that.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But what I found most valuable
of all.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.740
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-huh.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:28.050
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because I have an 18 month--18
month-year-old girl, she absolutely loves

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:32.769
to watch videos of her mommy and of herself
and not of me but...

00:24:32.769 --> 00:24:34.250
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Who can blame her?

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:41.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But it drives her nuts, drives
me not when the video goes away because she

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.820
pressed to the wrong area of the screen.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:44.820
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sure.

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And she doesn't know anything
about soft buttons or the back button, the

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.870
home key or the apps switcher.

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:49.870
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's all just screen.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:53.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: She just knows that mommy went
away and she doesn't know why.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:58.990
So, one innovation that I thought was really,
really interesting here is this child mode.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.990
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.450
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Where you press.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.610
I'm going to go ahead and bring it out again.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:13.470
While you're playing back you can press this
little lock button 

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:16.780
and that puts you into lockout mode.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:23.370
So, anything you do on the screen will have
no effect except for pressing this tiny little

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.370
lock button.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:25.370
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You happen to press the little tiny
lock button.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:26.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:27.370
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Interesting.

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, it doesn't completely solve
the 18-month-old problem, but it does mean

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:35.500
that she's much less likely to hit that tiny
little button correctly than she is to...

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.940
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Even with her little fingers.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:38.940
Yeah.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:39.940
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's interesting.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:40.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, it requires a better long
press too which is also...

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.940
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:42.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...a little bit difficult for
her.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.190
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Do you know they--how they went
implementing that?

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:45.440
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I have no idea.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.760
I have absolutely no idea how they did it
or whether the way they did it.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.760
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.960
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Is considered kosher in any way.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.580
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It doesn't seem it's finally legit
even if it is very useful.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, I'm really, really looking
forward to having a conversation with the

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:00.869
framework team and with the developers and
see how they went about it.

00:26:00.869 --> 00:26:01.869
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:26:01.869 --> 00:26:07.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because although I think it breaks
a lot of Android rules, on the other hand

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.010
it's awesome.

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:09.010
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's kind of useful.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So...

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.100
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's always an interesting challenge.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:15.990
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, in general this app scores
big on two counts.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:18.880
First is that it's got a really nice UI.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.880
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:24.760
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And second it doesn't remove
you from the normal Android experience.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:29.530
So, as you--as you go out of the full screen
mode you still have the normal Android action

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:30.530
bar and the...

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:31.530
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:32.530
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...notification bar.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:33.530
Everything that you want.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:34.530
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:35.530
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The only thing--I said action
bar but I meant notification bar.

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:36.530
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:41.309
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But speaking of action bar, in
the browser that really should be a real action

00:26:41.309 --> 00:26:42.309
bar.

00:26:42.309 --> 00:26:43.309
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:43.309 --> 00:26:44.530
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, why isn't it to the real
action bar?

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:48.299
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Well, probably because we haven't
released a compatible action bar.

00:26:48.299 --> 00:26:49.299
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:26:49.299 --> 00:26:50.299
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:26:50.299 --> 00:26:51.299
That seems like a...

00:26:51.299 --> 00:26:52.299
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Although...

00:26:52.299 --> 00:26:53.299
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...reasonable alternative because
of that.

00:26:53.299 --> 00:26:54.490
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...many of the things that they're
doing can't be supported in anything below

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:55.490
Jelly Bean.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:56.490
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.790
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, it would be nice I think.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:58.790
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.120
Well, they don't have particular complex browser
which is one the...

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.120
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...you know the comments that we
had.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.330
And so it seemed like the work involved to
get a real action bar and give that negative

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:13.000
feel for the more advanced devices would be
worthwhile an investment at this point.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.070
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, just one last note on this
browser and I think we could make this comment

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:24.380
about a lot of apps is that this sort of little
thumbnail on the left side of the listview

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.720
with gigantic amounts of white space around
it.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.720
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.720
Uh-hmm.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.660
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Is really getting old and some
of the newer apps that we've been very impressed

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:32.660
by lately and...

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.660
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:37.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...they're doing well in the
Google Play Store has gone to a completely

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.790
different tiled view with large thumbnails.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.830
The title's overlaid on an alpha blended background.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:45.830
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, you don't get any white space
at all.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.480
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.450
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And I think that ends up being
a much more pleasant browsing experience.

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:52.450
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:55.730
And again, you know, it's just--you've got
this wonderfully immersive video playback

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:56.730
experience.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.440
It would be wonderful to have that as part
of the browsing experience as well.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.220
And really make this much more like a gallery.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.269
Frankly, I love more like the way that the
YouTube app works.

00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:05.269
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:07.770
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And that you open it up and you
kind of get this wall of video.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.200
And that's obviously very specific to YouTube.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.850
But it's that sort of feel of trying to immerse
you in content which makes you feel all the

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:21.040
more willing in desire or sort of being able
to just stop playing stuff back and see what's

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.380
behind each of those windows.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: At the same time--let's face
it.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:29.700
We're going to spend 2% of our time browsing
and 98% of our time watching, you know.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.700
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: This definitely delivers the
goods when it comes to watching.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:39.630
Now, nearly as good in that department is
our next app DICE Player.

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:43.460
But I think before we talk about that we wanted
to discuss a few more coding questions.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.460
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Indeed.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.830
So, one of the things which I really like
about MX Player was the fact that it handled

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:49.380
that immersive experience correctly.

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.121
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, we got rid of all of my cron,
but then brought it all back as soon as I

00:28:53.121 --> 00:28:54.121
pressed the button.

00:28:54.121 --> 00:28:58.760
And so if you're wondering how to I do that,
well, here's the code that tells you.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:04.790
So, for Android 4 and above, what you want
to do is actually set the system visibility

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:06.520
options to SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:13.320
So, what that will do was actually remove
all the cron, the status bar, the navigation,

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.480
the notification bar, everything on Android
4 devices.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.780
And you'll note that at the same time as we
set that flag we're also going to set a listener

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.500
which is going to set the UI flag either visible
or full screen.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:30.380
So, that's going to remove your notification
bar on phone devices as opposed to tablets.

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.430
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And so this is the neatest way and
that's what we're seeing on this device.

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:39.110
If you go back before that on Android 3, so
Honeycomb devices, it's a little bit different.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:45.260
We have--we have the ability to hide the status
bar and we also have the ability to go into

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:49.240
what's kind of a low--a low profile mode.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:54.299
And so this is going to eliminate your status
bar, your notification bar on the phone devices

00:29:54.299 --> 00:29:59.860
and it's going to make your navigation on
Honeycomb devices be those three little dots.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:04.080
So, it hides as much as it can but doesn't
actually give you any extra screen real estate.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.080
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.080
This is what we use to call lights-out mode.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.080
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.080
Lights-out mode.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.590
So, that's kind of your next best for sort
of the Honeycomb ear devices.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:17.309
If you go back one step further before we
had tablet devices nearly--currently, you

00:30:17.309 --> 00:30:20.030
had on the screen at all, was the status bar.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:24.300
The way to do that, was to flag full screen,
you know, set the window layer [INDISTINCT]

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:30.559
flag full screen and that will remove your
notification bar and this is something which

00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:34.410
is only appropriate to do in a very specific
circumstances in playing back video is one

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:35.410
of those circumstances.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:41.370
And the important thing to note here for pre-Honeycomb
devices is that you have to manually add it

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:42.370
and remove it.

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:45.080
And so one of the temptations that I've seen
in a lot of apps do is they simply remove

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.690
it and you never get it back.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.799
So, even while you're browsing when if you're
not, even doing video playback, you're going

00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:51.870
to still have your notifications, that's infuriating.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:57.480
So, what you actually want to do here is tie
this code into play and pause of your media.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:01.740
So, whenever you're playing you can hide the
notifications and soon you pause, you bring

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.179
it back again.

00:31:03.179 --> 00:31:04.179
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Excellent.

00:31:04.179 --> 00:31:06.549
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, shall we move?

00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:09.730
DICE player, I think was the next app that
we wanted to take a look at it.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:10.730
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.390
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, this doesn't have a feature
graphic so, it doesn't have the tablet stakes

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.930
to be featured even if we wanted to which
is...

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:16.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:17.930
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...disappointing.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:19.289
So, that should be the first action item for
those guys.

00:31:19.289 --> 00:31:20.289
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:31:20.289 --> 00:31:26.690
Very disappointed to see that, but DICE player
in its implementation is actually quite nice.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:28.809
Actually, I think that they've got the best
browser.

00:31:28.809 --> 00:31:29.809
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:31:29.809 --> 00:31:31.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Of the ones that I've looked
up.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.450
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Suddenly looks from here, very similar
as MX Player, but with the real ActionBar

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:35.450
which gives at the end.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:39.820
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know the very similar to
the MX Player mean--well sort of brings surface

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.190
as we get through this, but yeah.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:47.179
It's your typical browser as we said could
be better, but the really nice thing is as

00:31:47.179 --> 00:31:52.660
I go through the browsing experience, I have
a very predictable...

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.840
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:59.179
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...and familiar ActionBar layout,
an ActionBar UI pattern to deal with.

00:31:59.179 --> 00:32:06.200
So, I can navigate through the ActionBar in
navigation pattern and I've got also my actions

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.200
over here.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.870
Now, there is one thing that confuses me a
little bit.

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:10.870
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sure.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.830
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: There's a screen for, well you
know what?

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:13.990
I'm going to let you guess.

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:18.540
This is--this little thing that looks to me,
like a monopoly house, what would you say

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.700
that, that button will do?

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:23.450
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I'll say, I would assume that, that
was a misplaced home button.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:25.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Effectively navigate you to the
home?

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:26.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:27.500
What you would expect when you're hitting
this button here?

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:28.500
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:29.840
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, they're taking you to the--to
the root navigation.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.840
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:31.840
That's what I thought too, but...

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.020
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Let's see what happens when I...

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: A complete surprise.

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:35.970
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:39.570
Media full, so this is how you manage which
local folders and well, even looks like a

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:42.400
remote sources of being indexed for your video
[INDISTINCT]

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.400
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.840
And I kind of felt like I did one about my
first box Wonka mix ups.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.559
You know, candy where all the colors are wrong.

00:32:48.559 --> 00:32:49.559
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-huh.

00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:53.170
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And the strawberry one is orange
colored and the grape one is purple, no.

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:54.170
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:55.170
Grape would be purple.

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:56.170
Yeah.

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:57.170
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Grape would be purple.

00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:58.970
Anyway, the point is, I felt mixed up.

00:32:58.970 --> 00:32:59.970
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:05.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The--what this actually took
us to is a settings page for getting other

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.050
types of media.

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:10.309
Now, in its defense this is an awesome piece
of functionality.

00:33:10.309 --> 00:33:11.309
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:33:11.309 --> 00:33:12.309
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right?

00:33:12.309 --> 00:33:16.820
I can choose a [INDISTINCT] server, I can
choose an FTP server, I can take an HTTP stream.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.289
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very nice.

00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:20.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And add them all into this.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:24.460
So, if you've--if you're like me and you've
got like a lot of videos on a share--on your

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.460
Windows machine....

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.460
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:29.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...or a Linux machine at home
then, being able to connect to [INDISTINCT]

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.269
FTP is a really nice piece of functionality,
right?

00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:33.269
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:38.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I did test this with my Windows
machine at home and its streamed a large video

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:40.750
directly of that machine and that made me
super happy.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:41.750
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:45.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But the functionality, I don't
think I ever would have found, if I haven't

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.289
been thinking "Well gee, how do I get to the
home screen of this app?"

00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:49.289
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:33:49.289 --> 00:33:50.289
Well, indeed.

00:33:50.289 --> 00:33:52.740
And we're in kind of the special case because,
you know, we are reviewing these apps; we're

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.180
going to hit pretty much every button to see
what it does.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:58.820
A lot of users are going to be even be looking
for that particular functionality, take one

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.720
look if the app going to help.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:05.300
No, I can't see anywhere in--can't see anywhere
here.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.470
I guess--I guess it doesn't do that.

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:08.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:09.960
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And then move on to next app.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:14.309
We want to make sure that any--particularly,
useful functionality like this, differentiating

00:34:14.309 --> 00:34:16.909
functionalities is really easy to discover.

00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:20.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And while we're talking about
discovery too, this is something I noticed

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.599
a lot with the settings.

00:34:22.599 --> 00:34:24.159
A lot of times I found apps....

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:25.159
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:29.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ....that have really, really
intriguing functionality and its hidden in

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.669
a piece of the settings.

00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:32.729
Sometimes that I wouldn't even thought to
look for.

00:34:32.729 --> 00:34:33.729
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sure.

00:34:33.729 --> 00:34:37.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And in some cases, its functionality
that I really, really wanted to sort of wish

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:44.149
was either turned on by default or perhaps
just more discoverability because there's

00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:49.649
some really cool stuff in here that I wouldn't
have thought to look for.

00:34:49.649 --> 00:34:55.380
Now, when it comes to playback, there's a
couple of things that I really, really like

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.380
about this application.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.380
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sure.

00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:01.660
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, I've using MX Player more
and I think you have too.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:02.660
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:06.589
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And there's really only one reason
for that and that's because MX Player doesn't

00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:08.099
hide my notification box.

00:35:08.099 --> 00:35:11.140
I mean, in every single other way.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.140
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.619
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: DICE Player is superior in this
playback UI.

00:35:15.619 --> 00:35:26.819
It supports essentially the same scrubbing
motions as we saw before, including the fine

00:35:26.819 --> 00:35:28.089
tune scrub here.

00:35:28.089 --> 00:35:29.089
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:35:29.089 --> 00:35:31.769
But it's not doing a real time frame preview
when we're doing [INDISTINCT]

00:35:31.769 --> 00:35:32.769
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You're right.

00:35:32.769 --> 00:35:35.410
[INDISTINCT] in every other way.

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:36.900
I was--I was exaggerating there.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:37.900
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:38.900
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I was overly excited.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:39.900
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:40.900
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uncomfortably so.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:41.900
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uncomfortable excited, it's a problem.

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:46.410
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But in nearly every way and it--they--and
they do have a lot of the same and you know,

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:48.609
over here we got brightness, over here we've
got volume.

00:35:48.609 --> 00:35:50.309
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I see that they switched that around
for MX Player.

00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:51.920
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, you go to be different.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.920
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And I think MX Player is actually
patented the right-hand side.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.150
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That could be it.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:03.049
So, you can see actually as well while we
do have to playback they've--again, sort of

00:36:03.049 --> 00:36:05.519
half gotten right the immersive experience.

00:36:05.519 --> 00:36:09.849
So, you can see and you probably can't see
on the video, but when it is playing back

00:36:09.849 --> 00:36:15.200
rather than losing the navigation completely,
they're going to a Honeycomb compatible lights-out

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.829
mode and so they sort of up to date, up to
a Honeycomb but haven't taken that extra step

00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:19.829
for Jelly Bean.

00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:20.829
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Great.

00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:23.579
And so that makes it useful on tablets because
I do get my notification bar badge.

00:36:23.579 --> 00:36:24.579
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Right.

00:36:24.579 --> 00:36:25.579
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But on the phone, you don't.

00:36:25.579 --> 00:36:26.579
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's exactly right.

00:36:26.579 --> 00:36:31.319
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And on the phone instead, you
get a sort of fake notification bar.

00:36:31.319 --> 00:36:32.319
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:36:32.319 --> 00:36:36.130
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That has the time and has the
battery indicator.

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:37.130
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.650
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But it doesn't show me any of
my notifications, which is something that

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:40.730
I generally like.

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:43.930
I also don't like the way that UI just goes
away when I'm paused.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:44.930
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:46.249
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I would prefer that it remained.

00:36:46.249 --> 00:36:50.799
Other than that though, it does have of course
the child lock mode that we saw before.

00:36:50.799 --> 00:36:55.970
One thing that I really like is that, it automatically
selects to the hardware accelerated.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:56.970
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, yes.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:01.280
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: If the hardware supports it and
if the video is encoded in a way that the

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.529
hardware can decode.

00:37:02.529 --> 00:37:07.140
So, I don't have to do it on the other app
which is think [INDISTINCT] so this really

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.569
should be hard work already.

00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:09.569
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:37:09.569 --> 00:37:13.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, I didn't play with it enough
to see if it feels on any particular videos

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:20.749
or even if an MX Player will actually remember
defaults that would be cool too, but on the

00:37:20.749 --> 00:37:25.160
initial, you know, first blush I think that
this is app is a little bit better.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: At playing back video.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.160
I would like to see scrubbing.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That would be nice.

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.160
Yeah.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: A nice.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.160
That would be really cool.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.599
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Just a little visual touches which
I think MX player have done a good job at.

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:34.599
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:37:34.599 --> 00:37:38.779
But this has really interesting features for
instance; it does have the capability to speed

00:37:38.779 --> 00:37:44.119
up videos which is great on your more recent
this week in Android Development that you

00:37:44.119 --> 00:37:45.750
bowed to all people that...

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:46.750
&gt;&gt; MEIER: To public pressure.

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:47.750
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...that does as well.

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:48.750
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.319
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All those non English speakers
you said they couldn't understand you.

00:37:50.319 --> 00:37:54.729
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Little that they know that when
I spoke it's a more reasonable pace they still

00:37:54.729 --> 00:37:55.729
couldn't understand me.

00:37:55.729 --> 00:37:56.729
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Not at all?

00:37:56.729 --> 00:37:59.450
&gt;&gt; MEIER: This way I don't have an excuse.

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:00.450
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:05.729
So, the other thing that I think is just incredibly
interesting here, I'm not going to say--not

00:38:05.729 --> 00:38:09.480
going to say too much about it, let's just
see what it does.

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:14.169
I press this button here, oh, my goodness,
look at that.

00:38:14.169 --> 00:38:15.950
&gt;&gt; MEIER: How interesting.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:21.769
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm not sure whether you love
or hate it, but I get the feeling that if

00:38:21.769 --> 00:38:29.009
I were using my tablet for a lot of, let's
say email, road task, and I might really appreciate

00:38:29.009 --> 00:38:33.009
having a video that I could just playback
in the corner.

00:38:33.009 --> 00:38:37.259
It certainly appeals to me for the couch potatoes
scenario where...

00:38:37.259 --> 00:38:38.259
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sure.

00:38:38.259 --> 00:38:41.259
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...I'd like to have something
playing while I browse for something else.

00:38:41.259 --> 00:38:42.259
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:38:42.259 --> 00:38:43.259
Yeah.

00:38:43.259 --> 00:38:44.259
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Then again...

00:38:44.259 --> 00:38:46.230
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I don't know what to make of this,
I'm pretty sure I would know what the framework

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:47.230
team would make of it.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:51.099
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm pretty sure they're doing
something sketchy that's going break somewhere.

00:38:51.099 --> 00:38:52.099
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:38:52.099 --> 00:38:53.849
I wouldn't--I wouldn't be banking on this
one.

00:38:53.849 --> 00:38:56.069
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: There will be sorrow at some
point.

00:38:56.069 --> 00:39:00.950
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But it's an interesting feature,
it's certainly taking things in the direction

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:03.269
we shouldn't think anyone else has thought
to do so, you know.

00:39:03.269 --> 00:39:04.269
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yup.

00:39:04.269 --> 00:39:05.269
It's fascinating.

00:39:05.269 --> 00:39:06.269
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Fair play for that.

00:39:06.269 --> 00:39:09.809
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Very interesting and I think
that as I've shown this to my friends, the

00:39:09.809 --> 00:39:16.200
people that I've shown it to you who are die
hard Android--let's say actual developers

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.200
on the framework team.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.200
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.190
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Think that it's a little sketchy.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.890
Other people they actually think its kind
of awesome.

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:22.890
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:23.890
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, yeah, you know, that will
happen.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:25.059
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:39:25.059 --> 00:39:26.059
Absolutely.

00:39:26.059 --> 00:39:27.059
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:39:27.059 --> 00:39:28.939
You know people like crystal Pepsi too.

00:39:28.939 --> 00:39:30.271
&gt;&gt; MEIER: People like new coke.

00:39:30.271 --> 00:39:31.271
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:39:31.271 --> 00:39:32.271
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Good thinking.

00:39:32.271 --> 00:39:33.979
I love the weight.

00:39:33.979 --> 00:39:34.979
All right.

00:39:34.979 --> 00:39:35.979
So, let's have a look.

00:39:35.979 --> 00:39:37.499
We don't want to spend too much more time
today.

00:39:37.499 --> 00:39:41.799
It was supposed to a be shorter episode and
we seemed to be completely unable to mitigate

00:39:41.799 --> 00:39:46.160
our own blabber amounts, but let's see if
we can have a look at some of the prescriptions

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.160
for these apps specific.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.961
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I think its completely unfair
by the way, we're 20 minutes behind time and

00:39:49.961 --> 00:39:55.290
it doesn't even count the five minutes that
we spent jerking off at the beginning of the

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:56.290
show.

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:57.290
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's very true.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:58.290
That's very true.

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:00.430
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, aren't you glad that we're
not doing this live and we can cut that out?

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:01.430
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very glad.

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:02.430
Very glad.

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:03.589
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:04.589
Let's go.

00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:07.749
Let's talk about our results from this week's
App Clinic.

00:40:07.749 --> 00:40:08.749
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Here indeed.

00:40:08.749 --> 00:40:11.049
So, this is the prescription for CineXPlayer.

00:40:11.049 --> 00:40:16.289
So, the big thing there was to use to audio
focus and un-pause to control the playback

00:40:16.289 --> 00:40:21.530
rather than relying on notifications from
the system that incoming calls are happening

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:23.130
and those sorts of things.

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:26.210
We really think that they should revisit the
custom UI.

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:29.979
Nothing wrong with the UI particular for an
app like this which is very immersive, but

00:40:29.979 --> 00:40:34.440
I think that almost an ActionBar but isn't
an ActionBar that includes the search control

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:39.599
that isn't a search control is probably something
that they will reconsider.

00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:41.249
And the same with the custom status bar.

00:40:41.249 --> 00:40:46.150
You know, really take the advice and handle
full screen in a way that, you know, tablet

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:50.230
and phone uses have come to expect that ability
to be able to hide everything and then bring

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:52.230
it back as soon as you're playing things.

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:57.519
I also wanted to point out that the Google
Play listing for CineXPlayer has a fantastic

00:40:57.519 --> 00:41:01.710
testimonial saying how the wonderful the app
is on an iPhone.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:04.179
Now that's a not entirely good practice.

00:41:04.179 --> 00:41:05.200
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know what--yeah.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.480
I mean it--I don't--I don't think it bothers
us but it bothers our merchandising team.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.480
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.480
Good for...

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Spectacularly.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.290
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, if you're building an app like
this and you want to be featured and frankly

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:15.290
who doesn't?

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:16.989
You may want to consider things like that.

00:41:16.989 --> 00:41:20.809
There's someone on Google Play and merchandising
team who's going to look at these apps and

00:41:20.809 --> 00:41:23.710
if doesn't have a feature graphic they're
going to pass it by.

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:28.459
If it's cooling out competitors it probably
going to think twice as well.

00:41:28.459 --> 00:41:33.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, prescriptions for MX Player
are considerably shorter because we both love

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.160
the app.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It was a nice app, yeah.

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.059
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But we'd really like to see a
better ActionBar.

00:41:38.059 --> 00:41:39.059
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:41:39.059 --> 00:41:40.059
It seems like such an easy win.

00:41:40.059 --> 00:41:43.039
You know, they're already using all of the
native Android 4.0 stuff.

00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:45.650
They've got an ActionBar or something very
much like it in the view.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:49.880
Putting it in the browser as well and give
us that experience that we used to.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.880
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.829
But the video playback I think in general
is really--was really great.

00:41:54.829 --> 00:42:00.529
The only thing that wasn't jarring was that
I would go from the video playback which is

00:42:00.529 --> 00:42:08.219
a dark theme and, you know, usually a high
contrast experience with the videos that I

00:42:08.219 --> 00:42:09.219
watched.

00:42:09.219 --> 00:42:14.400
And then I would be flopped directly into
this light themed browser and especially at

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.519
night, you know, if I'm watching videos in
bed or whatever that was a little bit jarring.

00:42:18.519 --> 00:42:19.519
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes.

00:42:19.519 --> 00:42:22.950
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I feel like maybe a dark theme
is a better choice for some of these apps.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:24.790
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, seems like it would make sense.

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:27.039
I did want to call out as well with MX Player.

00:42:27.039 --> 00:42:30.529
One of the things that they do really well
is feasibility to the play pretty much anything

00:42:30.529 --> 00:42:31.529
we throw at it.

00:42:31.529 --> 00:42:33.349
We throw some pretty upscale media codecs
at it.

00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:38.829
I was able to decode everything if not always
at full speed at least it was able to figure

00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:39.910
it out which is really impressive.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:40.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's absolutely true.

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:43.820
I remember we throw a quick time animation...

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:44.820
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:45.839
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...play--video at it.

00:42:45.839 --> 00:42:46.839
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And it didn't choke.

00:42:46.839 --> 00:42:47.839
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No.

00:42:47.839 --> 00:42:48.839
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Which surprised me.

00:42:48.839 --> 00:42:51.119
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It played very slowly but then
again so did my [INDISTINCT]

00:42:51.119 --> 00:42:52.489
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly right.

00:42:52.489 --> 00:42:56.180
It also passed the test--it was the only app
that we looked at that was able to play back

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.069
media which we plug into the device in any
ways.

00:42:59.069 --> 00:43:04.479
So, whether that was native on the device,
via SD card or even by via USB key for which

00:43:04.479 --> 00:43:09.920
I managed to dig out of a skeleton--well,
not skeleton but a cobweb string corner.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.460
I was still able to do that.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.539
So, that's--that was impressive.

00:43:12.539 --> 00:43:16.089
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: A DICE Player did a lot of things
right.

00:43:16.089 --> 00:43:18.999
Most importantly I think it got its defaults
right.

00:43:18.999 --> 00:43:19.999
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes.

00:43:19.999 --> 00:43:22.180
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: If a video could be hardware
accelerated it was.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.430
And I think you were pointing out if a video
is very small.

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:27.109
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It automatically full screened it.

00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:28.650
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Which none of the other players
did.

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:29.650
I was surprised.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:30.650
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:31.650
And you can argue either way.

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:35.349
You can say that they should be showing it
to you in its native resolution first and

00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:39.400
foremost but really if you're looking at these
apps--at this--at these videos I should say

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.670
on a tablet or on a phone chances are you
just want it to be full screened.

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:45.440
You just want to enjoy it in its immersive
experience as possible.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.130
So, it kind of makes sense to default that
way.

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:51.400
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, really there--we just had
some nit.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:57.950
We really liked the DICE Player playback engine
and the way that it handles defaults correctly

00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:01.399
but we really hated the way that it hid the
notification bar.

00:44:01.399 --> 00:44:02.399
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes.

00:44:02.399 --> 00:44:06.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And this is nit picky but we
felt like the ActionBar could use a little

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:08.420
bit of work when you...

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:09.420
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:12.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...hit the back button it popped
a confirm exit dialogue.

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:13.220
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...which I don't even know why
you do.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.220
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No.

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:19.319
Exactly, I mean this confirm to exit is one
of my pet peeves along with the exit buttons

00:44:19.319 --> 00:44:20.700
and exit menu items.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.019
There really isn't need for it.

00:44:22.019 --> 00:44:26.430
There's no need to confirm to exit just make
sure that there is no status loss when they

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:27.430
exit.

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:31.099
You know, you get the on pause, you get the
on stop, record, shared preferences it says

00:44:31.099 --> 00:44:35.049
what movie they're watching, what the current
playback position is and then if the app gets

00:44:35.049 --> 00:44:37.230
killed while you're in the background well
that's fine.

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:39.319
When you load up, load it all up full.

00:44:39.319 --> 00:44:44.229
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know I worked with a lot
of video games that were really, really concerned

00:44:44.229 --> 00:44:49.079
about what happens when you exit but that's
because they're building this gigantic OpenGL

00:44:49.079 --> 00:44:50.119
structures...

00:44:50.119 --> 00:44:51.119
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:44:51.119 --> 00:44:54.719
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...and they're loading lots of
texture but with this really you're recording

00:44:54.719 --> 00:45:01.049
where you're at in the video and maybe, you
know, zoom level and volume and brightness

00:45:01.049 --> 00:45:02.049
and...

00:45:02.049 --> 00:45:03.049
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:45:03.049 --> 00:45:06.369
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...a few other settings that's
it because resurrecting the video playback

00:45:06.369 --> 00:45:10.459
engine on Android is a very, very quick task.

00:45:10.459 --> 00:45:11.459
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:45:11.459 --> 00:45:13.930
They're hardly reticulating any [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:16.839
So, get rid of that.

00:45:16.839 --> 00:45:19.619
Get rid of the customs status bar during the
playback.

00:45:19.619 --> 00:45:23.330
We really rather just see the normal notification
bar and...

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:26.509
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And then that it is--because it
looks like really all this guys need to do

00:45:26.509 --> 00:45:30.979
is take another look at the Jelly Bean APIs
because there up to date for Honeycomb, but

00:45:30.979 --> 00:45:35.190
they haven't quite nailed it and I think they
have a look at the code samples we've given

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:36.190
here.

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:38.789
And take a look at the new Jelly Bean APIs
for this and they'll be good to go.

00:45:38.789 --> 00:45:39.789
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:45:39.789 --> 00:45:41.829
So, we've already shown how to handle full
screen correctly.

00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:45.880
If they take that to heart I think they'll
have a much better user experience.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.299
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:45:47.299 --> 00:45:49.811
So, that's the end of the App Clinic for today.

00:45:49.811 --> 00:45:54.690
A very special midweek episode of the App
Clinic to hopefully make out for our terrible,

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.559
terrible disasters in the last couple of weeks.

00:45:57.559 --> 00:46:00.539
We are going to tempt faith this week by doing
two App Clinics.

00:46:00.539 --> 00:46:04.480
We're going to be back on Friday to do an
App Clinic on shopping apps.

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:08.430
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Which we thought was going to
be about apps like Amazon or Zappos...

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:09.430
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:12.799
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But then we realized they Amazon
and Zappos are the same and there are no other

00:46:12.799 --> 00:46:13.799
shopping apps.

00:46:13.799 --> 00:46:15.920
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Which is apparently what all the
viewers thought as well.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.059
So, what we have is shopping assistance apps.

00:46:18.059 --> 00:46:23.210
So, we've learned that people would like to
us review shopping assistance apps and that

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:28.089
we need to be a lot more clear when we say
what our app themes are each week.

00:46:28.089 --> 00:46:29.089
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:46:29.089 --> 00:46:31.750
Well we do have some news in that area.

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:35.810
I won't spoil it today but when you tune in
next time we'll going to be talking a little

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:41.940
bit more about app themes and what will happen
to the apps after we've reviewed them.

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.000
We're very excited.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.920
So, yeah, it's been--it's been an interesting
experience.

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.450
We have gradually increased things and so
you'll see that--or in fact you may have already

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:55.970
watched Nick, Roman and Adam doing a UX make
over on a couple of these apps.

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:59.920
And so we're going to try and find more interesting
ways of being able to take the apps that we

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:02.849
look at and give them a more thorough go at.

00:47:02.849 --> 00:47:03.849
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:47:03.849 --> 00:47:08.910
Well, thank you to everyone who nominated
apps for our video playback app-a-ton.

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:09.910
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Indeed.

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:11.261
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: We really enjoyed it.

00:47:11.261 --> 00:47:16.339
I found some apps that I didn't know about
before and thank you again for everybody who

00:47:16.339 --> 00:47:18.059
nominated shopping apps.

00:47:18.059 --> 00:47:20.689
Now what are we going to do after shopping
apps?

00:47:20.689 --> 00:47:23.479
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I think there was some talk of celebrating
Halloween.

00:47:23.479 --> 00:47:24.801
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: With Halloween apps.

00:47:24.801 --> 00:47:25.801
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Halloween apps.

00:47:25.801 --> 00:47:27.369
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: What is a Halloween app Reto
Meier?

00:47:27.369 --> 00:47:31.270
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Well, I'm new to this country, so
I assume that there a huge amount of apps

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:33.200
designed specifically for Halloween.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.849
How to carve a Jack O' Lantern?

00:47:34.849 --> 00:47:38.170
How to keep track of the candy that you received
and give out?

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:42.819
Surely there is a huge, huge pile of apps
that people will have designed specifically

00:47:42.819 --> 00:47:45.359
for this most sacred of all holiday seasons.

00:47:45.359 --> 00:47:49.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I can only hope you're right
and if that's not the case what are we going

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:50.930
to do instead?

00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:52.509
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's a very good question.

00:47:52.509 --> 00:47:56.180
I will probably have to look on whatever the
next category we have and see if there are

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.229
people have nominated apps for that.

00:47:58.229 --> 00:47:59.229
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:47:59.229 --> 00:48:04.229
Now you did put up a set of cards on that
one site that you like so much.

00:48:04.229 --> 00:48:05.229
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Treelor.

00:48:05.229 --> 00:48:06.229
That's right.

00:48:06.229 --> 00:48:07.229
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:48:07.229 --> 00:48:08.229
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes.

00:48:08.229 --> 00:48:10.380
So, we will share once again a link to Treelor
on Android Developers plus page.

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:13.410
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And for those of you who thought
like me.

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:14.959
We were mistaken.

00:48:14.959 --> 00:48:18.999
It is not actually a Russian guy singing in
a weird singsong voice.

00:48:18.999 --> 00:48:20.890
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Or is it?

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:22.980
No way to know until you sign in.

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:23.980
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:27.880
All right, well thank you very much for viewing
yet another episode of the App Clinic.

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:33.799
We will be back Friday with more and don't
forget to watch on Tuesday when Roman Nurik

00:48:33.799 --> 00:48:36.999
brings us his version of Android design in
action.

00:48:36.999 --> 00:48:38.109
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Thanks for watching.

00:48:38.109 --> 00:48:39.109
I'm Reto Meier.

00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:40.109
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I am Ian NI-LEWIS.

00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:41.109
&gt;&gt; MEIER: See you later.

00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.690
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Cheers.
