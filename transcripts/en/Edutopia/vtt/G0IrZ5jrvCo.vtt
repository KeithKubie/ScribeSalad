00:00:01.126 --> 00:00:03.636
&gt;&gt;Katie: Having an Instructional
Coach has been the biggest help

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:04.916
that I could have had this year.

00:00:05.406 --> 00:00:09.366
Because she not only helps me with
lesson plans, but she helps me think

00:00:09.536 --> 00:00:11.746
through why I'm going to teach that way.

00:00:17.306 --> 00:00:20.116
&gt;&gt;Pam: Our Instructional Coaches
work very closely with teachers

00:00:20.116 --> 00:00:23.286
across the School Division
to help them really figure

00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:26.186
out what we call our Seven
Pathways to Learning.

00:00:26.186 --> 00:00:29.836
Whether it's Make-a-Work, or whether
it's giving kids the opportunity

00:00:29.836 --> 00:00:31.056
to have choice in their work.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:35.446
Our coaches really are a lynchpin in
the work that we do across the system.

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:39.746
&gt;&gt;Debora: Instructional Coaches
connecting teachers from one school

00:00:39.746 --> 00:00:42.376
to another is very important
because we feel

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:44.856
like that's how innovative
practices spread.

00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:50.236
We have 24 Instructional Coaches,
but no one coach is at one building.

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:52.566
Every building has at
least three coaches.

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.156
Every coach has at least three schools.

00:00:56.736 --> 00:00:58.456
&gt;&gt;Lisa: Trish has been
with us for four years.

00:00:58.456 --> 00:01:00.426
And Trish is an Instructional
Coach for the Division.

00:01:00.616 --> 00:01:02.236
She's actually works in three schools.

00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:03.996
Woodbrook is just one of her schools.

00:01:04.796 --> 00:01:08.746
&gt;&gt;Trish: So if I'm learning from
these twelve teachers at this school,

00:01:08.746 --> 00:01:12.336
I take all of that learning with
me to the other two schools.

00:01:12.486 --> 00:01:15.746
When I get together with the
coaches, I'm able to share.

00:01:15.946 --> 00:01:19.186
&gt;&gt;Trish: So I just want to
show you the first activity

00:01:19.236 --> 00:01:23.066
on this Fractions Number Chart
resource is a skip counting activity.

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:26.646
&gt;&gt;Katie: That's what Karen was talking
to me about at recess the other day.

00:01:26.916 --> 00:01:27.406
&gt;&gt;Trish: Okay!

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:30.106
&gt;&gt;Debora: Our teachers might have
a Project Based Learning Unit

00:01:30.106 --> 00:01:32.296
that they're doing and they want
to bring more technology in,

00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:34.746
and they want to bring some
different instructional strategies.

00:01:34.746 --> 00:01:38.266
And they would approach a coach,
and talk a little bit about that.

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:40.376
&gt;&gt;Trish: Kate came to me and said,

00:01:40.456 --> 00:01:45.056
"I'd love to do a Project Based
Unit coming up on Life Processes."

00:01:45.126 --> 00:01:49.086
&gt;&gt;Katie: The Project Based Learning Unit
that Trish Moya and I have been working

00:01:49.086 --> 00:01:53.636
on is a unit on plant
and animal life cycles.

00:01:54.216 --> 00:01:56.396
Project Based Learning
is pretty new for me,

00:01:56.396 --> 00:02:01.356
so Trish brings a whole nother
level of expertise to the board.

00:02:01.646 --> 00:02:04.396
&gt;&gt;Trish: And so what will you
be looking for on your notes?

00:02:04.396 --> 00:02:06.806
&gt;&gt;Katie: I'll be looking for
them to develop vocabulary.

00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:07.146
&gt;&gt;Trish: Okay!

00:02:07.356 --> 00:02:11.426
&gt;&gt;Katie: In the plant or animal
that they're researching.

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:12.506
&gt;&gt;Trish: Excellent!

00:02:12.506 --> 00:02:14.416
Is there anything from the
Critical Thinking Rubric

00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:15.906
that you might be able to use then?

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:19.146
&gt;&gt;Katie: I can use, "Feedback from my
friends and teacher to improve my work."

00:02:19.446 --> 00:02:24.006
&gt;&gt;Trish: It always comes
back to the teacher getting

00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:26.216
to tell you what they need.

00:02:26.816 --> 00:02:29.016
So that's always where I begin.

00:02:29.476 --> 00:02:33.216
&gt;&gt;Tony: So whether it comes to them
modeling instructional lesson plans

00:02:33.216 --> 00:02:36.416
to help the teachers see what it
might look like, or moving into more

00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:38.726
of an observation role,
where the teacher's trying it

00:02:38.726 --> 00:02:39.866
out and looking for feedback.

00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:43.566
Either way, the whole process is based
on what the teacher's looking for.

00:02:43.906 --> 00:02:44.626
&gt;&gt;Katie: Let's get to it.

00:02:44.626 --> 00:02:48.326
Step 1, gather all your materials.

00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:51.816
&gt;&gt;Katie: I'm really excited about
the unit, because the kids are going

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:53.496
to be doing it in such an authentic way.

00:02:53.846 --> 00:02:57.176
They're going to be creating videos,
and doing their own research.

00:02:57.176 --> 00:03:00.366
They're going to be posting their
own things on a blog or a website.

00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:02.866
Just something that they'll
always remember.

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:07.426
Working with Trish I learned that
kids really can drive their learning.

00:03:07.426 --> 00:03:09.736
&gt;&gt;Student: We were learning
about the life cycle of animals.

00:03:09.736 --> 00:03:13.026
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm learning about squirrels.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:18.156
And I picked squirrels because
I actually like squirrels.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:20.906
&gt;&gt;Student: And I learned that
there's many different cats.

00:03:20.906 --> 00:03:24.216
&gt;&gt;Trish: And they were so excited
about what they had learned.

00:03:24.816 --> 00:03:27.026
Did you notice that everybody
was up on their knees.

00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:27.896
&gt;&gt;Katie: They were all
up on their knees!

00:03:27.896 --> 00:03:28.816
&gt;&gt;Trish: Nobody was sitting down.

00:03:28.816 --> 00:03:29.896
They were all like, "I want to share!

00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:30.916
I want to share!"

00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:31.496
That was great.

00:03:31.496 --> 00:03:32.296
&gt;&gt;Katie: That was the cool part.

00:03:33.016 --> 00:03:37.416
&gt;&gt;Tony: How these coaches then become a
conduit for those ideas and those values

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:40.566
to move from classroom to
classroom, from school to school,

00:03:41.026 --> 00:03:44.396
that permeate the entire District,
is a really powerful thing.

00:03:44.396 --> 00:03:47.006
And that it comes from
the teacher's goals,

00:03:47.006 --> 00:03:51.816
and the teacher-centered approach really
does allow for the bottom-up growth

00:03:51.816 --> 00:03:52.956
that you'd really hope
to be able to see.
