00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.370
Let's say I have a line, let
me make it a straight line.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.060
And the equation of that line,
since it's running in the

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.320
horizontal direction is
going to be y is equal

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.656
to some constant.

00:00:11.656 --> 00:00:12.970
So let me write that.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.010
So the equation of this line
right here is y is equal to k.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.760
And let's say I have
some other point.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.650
I'll call that-- well, we'll
call that a focus because

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.886
it will be a focus.

00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:29.890
And let's say that point--
let's put it right here-- is

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.300
it the coordinate, let's
call it a comma b.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.915
And let's think about the set
of all points or the locus of

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:44.370
all points that are equidistant
to this point right

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.720
here and this line.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.800
Just so you get the
terminology we'll call

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.770
this line a directrix.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.500
Let me write that down.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.050
Directrix, it's probably a word
you've never heard before.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.640
And frankly, I've never heard
it outside of the context

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.190
of parabolas or conic
sections in general.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.150
So let's call that a directrix.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.090
This is our focus.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.150
And what we want to do is we
want to find all of the points

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.590
in the xy-plane that are
equidistant to this focus

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.560
and this directrix.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.090
So there's one point that just
by looking at it we could say

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.162
is going to be in our locus.

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:26.060
So it's going to be right there
because clearly, this point is

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.750
equidistant; it's halfway
between that point

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.380
and this line.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.500
Now let's see what
other points.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.900
There will probably be this
point right here because the

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.170
distance from there to there
is this name as the distance

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.410
from if you just drop
a line straight down.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.330
Remember, we want to get the
shortest distance between

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.380
this point and the line.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.380
We could have said something
like this distance, but this

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.370
distance wouldn't be the
shortest distance between

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.250
this point and this line.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.250
So you would go straight
down to the line there.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.920
Likewise, this point
would be there.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.960
So that distance is the
same as that distance.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.420
And you can already, I
think, begin to imagine

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.580
the type of shape this is.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.960
And if you look at the title of
this video you can probably

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.990
guess where this is going.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.630
That the shape is going to
look something like this.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.320
Or something pretty similar to
what we know as a parabola.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.800
And actually, it
will be a parabola.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.000
There's no mystery there.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.740
But what we're doing this in
this video is actually show

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.535
you that is a parabola.

00:02:24.535 --> 00:02:26.570
Show it to you mathematically
instead of this

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.420
little drawing here.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.390
Where I show you that it kind
of looks like it would be a

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.750
parabola because this distance
right here looks about the same

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.510
as that distance right there.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.750
I could keep going up and down
the curve and keep doing that,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.080
but that's not satisfactory.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.830
Let's actually mathematically
show that the locus of all

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.300
points that are equidistant to
this point and this line-- this

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.320
focus and this directrix--
is in fact, a parabola.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.870
So let's say I have some point
that's in this locus and let me

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.710
call the point here-- let me do
it in a different color because

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.570
it's the same color as
my directrix-- x, y.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.980
So I want to find all of the x,
y's-- all of the points that

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.220
satisfy an equation where their
distance to the focus is equal

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.590
to their distance
to the directrix.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.480
So what's the distance
between x, y and the focus?

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.790
What's this distance
right here?

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.950
d sub 1.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.076
Well, we just used the
distance formula.

00:03:23.076 --> 00:03:26.656
It's x minus the
x-coordinate of the focus.

00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:30.350
So it's x minus a squared.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.250
So the difference in
the x's squared.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.366
Plus the difference in the y's
squared-- y minus b squared.

00:03:38.366 --> 00:03:40.690
The square root of that.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.810
So this is the distance
to the focus.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.310
So I'll call that d sub 1.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.870
That's this distance
right there.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.830
And we want to find all of the
x and y's where the distance to

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.320
the focus is equal to
the distance to this

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.970
line right there.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.730
So if we call this distance--
let's call this the d sub 2--

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.480
the distance to the directrix.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.390
So the distance to the focus is
going to be equal to d sub 2.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.700
And d sub 2, what's this
going to be equal to?

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.790
Well, it's just the difference
in y because no matter where we

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.250
are we're just going to drop
down straight to the directrix.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.400
So the difference in y-- I
could just say y minus k.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.180
That would be the
difference in y.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.620
But in this case I did make it
so that the coordinate up here

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.690
is higher than the k over here.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.420
But what if we had a situation
where this point was

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.280
below this line?

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.440
I mean, there's nothing here
that I said that we can only

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.930
deal with points
above this line.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.930
We haven't proven that
to ourselves yet.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.020
So to make sure that this
distance is positive we could

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.350
take the absolute value or
we could just square it and

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.910
then take the square root.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.020
And then that ensures that
we're not dealing with

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.560
negative distances.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.590
So here we set up the equation
for all of the x's and y's

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.400
where the distance to the focus
is equal to the distance

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.940
to the directrix.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.070
And let's see if this actually
turns out to be a parabola.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.750
So the first thing we can do is
we can square both sides and

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.660
get rid of the radicals.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.010
So we get x minus a squared.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.160
Radicals aren't good.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.730
Well, I don't want to make
any social commentary.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:20.340
So x minus a squared plus y
minus b squared is equal to

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.620
the square root of the other
side-- y minus k squared.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.540
And right now, at least, it
looks like there's going to be

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.120
some y squared terms and I mean
there's definitely

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.580
an x squared term.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.420
That doesn't seem like it's
a parabola right now.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.000
But let's keep going forward.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.585
This is x minus a squared.

00:05:40.585 --> 00:05:43.650
And then let me square
these-- actually, expand

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.730
these two binomials.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:55.560
So plus y squared minus 2yb
plus b squared is equal to y

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.600
squared minus 2yk
plus k squared.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.020
Now what can we do
to simplify this?

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.960
Well, we have a y squared
here and we have a y squared

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.460
on the right-hand side.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.260
So we can subtract y
squared from both

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.242
sides of the equation.

00:06:11.242 --> 00:06:14.520
They cancel out, and then we
got rid of the y squared so all

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.580
of a sudden this is starting to
look a lot more like a parabola

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.260
because this is now an equation
that relates y's

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.170
to an x squared.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.250
So let's clean this up and
actually make sure that we can

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.860
get it in a form that we
normally associate

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.210
with a parabola.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:34.460
So we now have-- I'll just
rewrite it-- x minus a squared

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:42.260
minus 2yb plus b squared is
equal to minus 2yk

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.780
plus k squared.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.250
Now what can we do?

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.550
Let's take all the y's
and the constants on one

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.860
side of the equation.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.660
So if we move both of these
terms onto the right-hand

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.260
side, so we want to
add 2yb to both sides.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.970
So we get x minus a squared is
equal to-- I'm moving both of

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.845
these terms to the
right-hand side.

00:07:03.845 --> 00:07:07.740
So if we add 2yb to both sides
then we'll have a positive

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.490
2yb on the right hand side.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:17.670
So 2yb, and then we'll have
that minus 2yk right there.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.520
And then we're subtracting
b squared from both sides.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.720
So it's minus b squared
plus k squared.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.330
I just arbitrarily decided to
write whatever I transferred

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.710
from the left-hand side to the
right-hand side in magenta

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.590
just so maybe it makes
it a little bit clearer.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.400
And let's see if we can
simplify this further.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.420
And remember, just so you know
what I'm doing this whole time.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.770
In the back of my mind I'm
trying to get it into the

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.170
format that I normally
associate with a parabola.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.940
And I'll do it in the corner
here, just so you know

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.450
where the algebra's going.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:56.000
I'm trying to get into a
format x minus a squared

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.870
is equal to y minus b.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.360
Because if we have it in
this form, or actually ax.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.580
Let me write that because I
went too far to the right.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.910
A times x minus-- well,
actually I already used

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.260
the A so let me write x
minus-- I don't know.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:19.830
I'll make up x minus--
I'll call that v squared.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.120
I'm picking maybe v for
x value of the vertex.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.010
I'm making up
variables on the fly.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.930
A times x minus v squared
is equal to y minus b.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.000
And you know, the actual
letters I chose don't matter.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.860
But this is a general
form of a parabola.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.970
And this is where
I'm trying to go.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.200
If I can get this thing that
we're working on to this

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.410
form then we know we're
dealing with a parabola.

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:42.130
And then, we can actually
relate what we normally

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.830
associate with a parabola
to these terms up here.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.120
And obviously, these
are different letters

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.270
than these letters.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.760
And then we can try to figure
out-- if we have a parabola,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.590
how do we figure out its
focus and is directrix.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.110
But anyway, that was a bit
of an aside just so you

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.790
know where we're going.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.516
So let's try to simplify
this a little bit more.

00:08:57.516 --> 00:08:58.857
So we get--

00:08:58.857 --> 00:09:00.350
[PHONE RINGING]

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.010
--my phone is ringing.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.200
Let me silent it.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:10.000
So we get x minus a squared
is equal to-- let's see.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.540
If we factor out a 2 and
a y we get-- let me

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.520
factor out a y first.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:22.080
We get 2b minus 2k times y.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.260
And then I want to make
it minus some constant.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.460
So this is a constant
right here.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.650
This is one constant squared
plus another constant.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:36.750
So I could make this
equal to minus-- let

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.540
me think about this.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:42.410
This would be minus b
squared minus k squared.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.610
If I expand this minus out
you would get minus b

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:46.870
squared plus k squared.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.380
So this is the same
thing right there.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:49.870
And let's see.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:54.840
Can I factor out-- yeah,
I can factor out a 2.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:00.540
The whole thing becomes x minus
a squared is equal to 2 times b

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:07.360
minus k times y minus-- and now
this is the difference of--

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.680
yeah, this is b plus
k times b minus k.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.970
You might want to review
factoring polynomials if

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.560
that doesn't look familiar.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.780
But this is b plus
k times b minus k.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.285
And I want to do that because I
saw this b minus k out there so

00:10:23.285 --> 00:10:27.230
that looked interesting to get
it on both terms right there.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.740
Now let's see.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.060
If we divide everything times--
let's divide everything by 1

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.660
over 2 b minus k because I just
want a y here, so I have some

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:37.800
coefficient in front of the y.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.330
So let's divide everything
by 1 over 2 b minus k.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.430
Let me do it down here
so I have some space.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:57.660
1 over 2 b minus k times x
minus a squared is equal to--

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.120
I'm dividing this by 2 b
minus k, so that goes away.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:08.150
So it's y minus-- so if I
divide this by 2 b minus k the

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:18.780
b minus k's cancel out and I'm
just left with b plus k over 2.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.340
And I think I have gotten it
in the form that I wanted.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.480
In this case, the a that
I wrote up here is now

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.550
1 over 2 b minus k.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.150
This v is this a
that I did here.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.400
The y is the y and then my
constant term is out here.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.800
So I have hopefully shown to
you that the locus of all

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.180
points that are equidistant to
this point-- which is really

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.230
just an arbitrary point.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.110
I said it's the point a,
b-- and some line, is

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.440
in fact, a parabola.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.960
And that's one of the ways that
people define a parabola.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.300
And we'll actually see soon
that when you actually change

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.930
this relation-- in this case,
we found that all of the points

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.980
that are equidistant to the
focus and the directrix.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.760
If we changed that ratio, if we
find all of the points that are

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.010
1/2 as far away from the
directrix as the focus, we

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.830
start getting another
conic section.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.410
If we said twice as far
we would get another

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:12.060
conic section.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.320
So this is a very interesting
way of relating-- sometimes the

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.850
conic sections in the first
video I showed how they're all

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:19.970
related to cutting the
three-dimensional cone.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:22.610
But they're also related in
this way and eventually I want

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.130
to relate this to the
three-dimensional cone so you

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.790
can see how it all
fits together.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.810
Which is always the fun
thing about mathematics.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.790
So this so far, all we've shown
to you is if we do take the

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.780
locus of all points that are
equidistant to a point and a

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.770
directrix that it
is a parabola.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.570
Now, the interesting
thing to do is let's

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.830
say I have a parabola.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.490
Let me give a general form.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.810
And I'll try to use different
letters than I used up here.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:54.052
So let's say I have a
parabola y minus--

00:12:54.052 --> 00:12:56.920
let's call it y sub 1.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.070
Where it's just a particular
point on the parabola.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:05.090
Y minus y sub 1 or you could
call it some constant-- is

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:09.585
equal to-- let's call it, I
want to use a capital A just

00:13:09.585 --> 00:13:12.090
because that tends to be--
I'll use a capital A and just

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.340
know that it's different
than this lowercase A.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.960
Some capital A times
x minus x sub 1.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.200
squared.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.140
Whenever you see a y sub 1 or
an x sub 1, that means you're

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.770
actually dealing with
a constant term.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.560
If you see just an x or y that
generally means that you're

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.770
dealing with a variable term.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:28.570
So these are constants.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.240
I could have put letters there.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.000
I could have put a and b
there, but then that would've

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.070
gotten confused with that.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.970
But let's see if we can relate
these letters because this is

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.270
something that we normally see.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.690
And then, we want to find
the focus or the directrix

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.870
of a parabola like this.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.950
How can we relate these to
these values right here?

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:48.860
How does k and a and b relate
to these right there?

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:49.810
So let's see if we
can set that up.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.600
So if we just pattern
match that is A.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.250
If we say x sub 1 is lowercase
a, actually that's a straight

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.770
up pattern match, so we can
already write that on the side.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.830
x sub 1 is equal to a.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.210
So whatever x value I have
here, this is also the x

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.750
value of the focus point.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.210
Which makes sense because in
this case, we already learned

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:11.235
this in previous video.

00:14:11.235 --> 00:14:15.660
But we learned that the vertex
of this parabola is the

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.160
point x sub 1 comma y sub 1.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.370
Anyway, I don't want
to confuse you.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.690
Actually, you know
what I'm going to do?

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.980
I don't want to go too far off
into this topic, and I think

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.520
this video has already
gotten long enough.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.110
I will continue this
in the next video.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:29.612
See you soon.
