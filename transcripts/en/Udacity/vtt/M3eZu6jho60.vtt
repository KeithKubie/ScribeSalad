00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.270
The million dollar question that,

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.452
every developer has to ask themselves
is, where do I put my breakpoints?

00:00:06.452 --> 00:00:11.210
Defining breakpoints based on specific
devices, products, brand names or

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.150
anything else, will almost always
result in a maintenance nightmare.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.360
You never know what next
hot device will be or

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.450
what will be hot two years from now.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.110
&gt;&gt; Instead, look at the content
to find the right breakpoints.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.640
Scott Yale said it best.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.640
We shouldn't choose break points at all.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.920
Instead, we should find them,
using our content as a guide.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.800
Pete, I would love to get some insight,
into the choices that you

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.830
make when you're trying to decide,
what breakpoints to use on a page.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.550
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.100
Let's take a look.
