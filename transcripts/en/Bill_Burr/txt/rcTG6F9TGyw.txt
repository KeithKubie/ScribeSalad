Speaker 1:          00:00          Now I'm already off fucking track. You know what my fucking bank did to me? I walked in, I had this account in New York that I kind of, uh, it was a little checking account. I had a little bit of money and then all of a sudden notice they were taking some fees out. I'm like, well, that shouldn't be. So I get to New York, I walk in, I talked to the douchebag who works there and he goes, yeah, they're taking $27 a month out. I don't know why that is. Here. Let me check to see what's up. Click and click. I'll check on this thing. And he goes, yeah, we shouldn't have been doing that. And I go, okay, well can you refund the money? And they go, absolutely. Uh, and I go, well, you know, I've had the account for like six years. Can we see how long you've been doing this?

Speaker 1:          00:38          And he's like, I'm sorry, our, our records only go back for four months. Really? It only goes back for four months. It's amazing because my bank records at home go back the entire time I've had the account and that's incredible. And I just have some pithily some in there while you deal with hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, if not trillions. I don't know what the fuck you have. I just know there's a fucking Bank of yours in every God damn state now. But of course it only goes back like four months. So I go, all right, well what if I bring my records in? I look them over and I find out how long have you been doing it? And they're like, no, he can only refund it for four months. I'm like, two, what are you talking about? And he goes, yeah, well the bank kind of looks at it like that, that that was on you. What do you, and I was like, it's on me to not to, to not be like paying attention to make sure that people are supposed to be keeping my money safe, aren't fucking stealing from me. And He sorta like laughed. I'm like, dude, this isn't funny. This is ridiculous. You guys just stole from me. And if you've been doing it for six years, what's that? 270 bucks stare at another fucking Nav. 50, like almost 300 bucks a year for six years. That's like 1500 to 1800 bucks somewhere in there.

Speaker 1:          01:51          And the guy's just sitting there fucking laughing and a, you know, they say usual shit. Yeah. What are you gonna Sue us? Go ahead. We'll take some of that bail out money, which is part of your tax money and we'll fucking, uh, so I dunno what I'm going to do. I'm going to close out the account and uh, and I dunno, what do I do then? I go across the street to one of the bet for banks that are left. If anybody out there is in banking, how do I get my money back beyond the four months? Cause I know that they've been doing it longer than this. Um, can anybody explain that? You know, this is why people, this is why you don't put 100% of your paycheck into the fucking bank. He got to look at it this way. If somebody mugged you last week, would you walk up to the same person and take your paycheck and stick it in their back pockets?

Speaker 1:          02:36          You wouldn't, would you? But for some reason we have these fucking bankers. Yeah, I dunno. I think everybody should turn like, I don't know. Everybody should have a fucking safe that you have buried somewhere everyday, but he's got a gun in. Anybody can blow anybody away. I know. It's all fucked up. Fucking assholes. The guys sit in there fucking smiling. Nobody sitting there doing, he's doing that little twirly thing. You know that math people do with their pens and people who are in to finances. I think they do it to hypnotize you. It says, the guy's fucking sitting there telling me that they've been stealing 30 bucks a month from me and all I'm doing is I'm trying to focus on him. I keep looking down at his silver shiny pen, some sort of mind trick. Fortunately I was aware of it. I said, can you stop toiling your fucking pen? But I didn't want to do that cause I was trying to keep my cool, which obviously is a difficult thing for me to do, you know? I don't know right now bill, it's just 27 bucks a month times how many fucking people you remember superman three. When Richard Pryor stole half a cent from everybody in the next day. You had a fucking Ferrari. These Fox are taking 27 bucks a month from everybody. I'm convinced of it.

Speaker 1:          03:49          It's the fucking mob. I swear to God the mob went legit or those there will be blood guys. They the fucking assholes and run the Goddamn bags. He's fucking constant just stealing from me and there's nobody getting, nobody's gonna help me. What am I going to go down there? I'm going to get that guy used to be on the fucking, uh, leave it to beaver. What the fuck was the name of that show? Uh, Mayberry. I always hated that show, that old content walking around with their false set of voice. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          04:14          okay.

Speaker 1:          04:14          You know, you know what? That show lacked somebody that I wanted to bang. That's why I didn't watch it. There was nobody fuckable on it. That was the brilliance of the monsters that they were like, this is going to be hilarious. We're going to turn fucking Frankenstein into drag and Dracula into these Kooky characters and it's all going to be funny. But they knew at the end of the day they had to be somebody that a male demographic would want to fuck. So they came up with that girl who was allegedly ugly. Why am I explaining this classic show? You know the deal. And she looked like Marilyn Monroe and that's what kept me in there. I Dunno. All right. Batman. After a while it's like, do what is going on with this 40 year old guy in his ward and then all of a sudden they had cat woman walking around that fucking Horry outfit.

Speaker 1:          05:11          Is she the one who started that shit? Did women not dress like whores on uh, on Halloween before Batman or a bad girl or cat woman? Cat woman was a bad one. Right? This such pathetic cons, you know what I mean? It's, we take off that fucking ridiculous outfit. Go stand behind a wall and, and, and start talking to people and listen to how many people even fucking pay attention to you. They don't cause you got nothing to say. All you can do is just dress up your God damn Twat and start strutting around the fucking place that had nothing to do with cat. Woman had nothing to do with her. It had to do with me fucking get fucked over by that Goddamn bag. Assholes, fucking asshole son. I got to go down there. I got to go down there like, like some fucking guy whose button store just failed after 75 years.

Speaker 1:          06:07          You know, Frankie fish face and sons remember those fucking um, those businesses when you were a kid, it was always something, something and sons, you know, and like a lot of the times the kids were forced into the business. You know, some Italian guy, he opens a fucking prosciutto shop and then that's it. It's like an arranged marriage except that your job then you've got to show up and be good and well, I have been working in that ass, Toronto, they did y'all Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. You know, they don't know shit about anything else is everybody wanted to strike out on their own and now look, everybody ends up in a fucking cubicle working for these fucking cops who are stealing my money. That's uplifting, isn't it?
