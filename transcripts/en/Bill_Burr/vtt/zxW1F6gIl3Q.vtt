Hey,

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.480
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast is

3
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.530
just checking in.
Are you?
What's going on?

4
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.580
It's just fucking global warming.
Awesome.
Or what?
Jesus Christ,

5
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.070
the summer just keeps going.
It's incredible.
Um,

6
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.340
the Golden Age,
the golden age of global warming.

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.520
Enjoy it before the sea levels rise up.

8
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.363
<v 0>MMM.</v>

9
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.160
<v 1>By your waterfront property in West Virginia soon.</v>

10
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.660
Sorry,
I don't want to go with all gloom and doom here.
Um,
it is,
uh,

11
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.720
12:46 AM Thursday.
Uh,

12
00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:50.410
so I have gone 56 days.
All right.

13
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.410
56 days.
Two months.
Sorry,
two months.
No fucking booze.

14
00:00:55.411 --> 00:01:00.070
And 56.
Now what does the number 56 mean to you?

15
00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:04.960
All you baseball fans out there.
October playoff baseball,
56.

16
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.060
Jolton Joe Dimaggio's unbeatable hit record,

17
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.420
hit for 56 games in a row.
And it's,

18
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.430
I think it's very poignant that I bring up a great Yankee when those fucking

19
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.760
cops just came back against the,
uh,
Cleveland Indians.

20
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.390
And uh,
I have to tell you,
it was a red sox fan.

21
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.100
The Yankees are common and they're going to be good for a while.

22
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.170
They've got a bunch of,
you know what I love about the Yankees?

23
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.380
Is there a fucking team?
You know what I mean?

24
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.350
I fucking hate that they're going to be good,
but I've got to acknowledge it.

25
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.790
They're fucking good.
Um,
poor fucking Cleveland.

26
00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:45.670
Jesus fucking Christ.
Jesus Christ.

27
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.980
[inaudible]
oh Jesus.
Oh,
that's an old Jesus right there.

28
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.570
Up Two games to Nanaya decided when one more,
you know,
fucking do it.

29
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.550
Fucking comedy of errors.
I didn't see the game four,

30
00:02:00.551 --> 00:02:03.670
I guess they fucked up a bunch of errors and then they just,
you know,

31
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.550
the fucking guy in left field,

32
00:02:06.551 --> 00:02:11.290
that's the single turn into a double than they overthink fucking alligator arm

33
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.370
of fucking cutoff and the guys scratch this was a fucking shit show.
However,

34
00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:17.530
the only thing I don't like about the fucking,
by the way,

35
00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:21.370
Brett gardeners at bat legendary at bat,

36
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.880
their shortstop there.
I don't know if I'm going to say his name.
Raise a DD.

37
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.400
Gregarious.
I have no idea.
Two huge fucking home runs.
My only,

38
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.700
my only question mark,
if I can go sports radio right now.

39
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.800
Are you buying or are you selling?
I don't know about Chapman is the closer,

40
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.850
you know,
I know he closed the fucking game.
That was great for him.

41
00:02:42.851 --> 00:02:45.850
I know he wanted for the cubs last year,
but I don't know.

42
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.490
I don't think you got to fucking strong closer when he walks the first guy and

43
00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:55.330
you already have somebody else up in the bullpen.
Maybe I'm spoiled.

44
00:02:55.331 --> 00:02:59.110
After all those years when I watched Marianna Rivera,
nobody fucking got,

45
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.660
it's fucking,
Marianna were very,
that gave it,
the game's tied.
The game's over.

46
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.910
Except in 2004 of clothes.
Of course,
I'll bail you cunt.

47
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.160
Um,
that was impressive.
So now they're going to play the Houston Astros.

48
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.700
A franchise without an identity.

49
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.370
I don't know what it is about them.
I was just talking to a j Lo head,

50
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.780
you know,
giving them my condolences.
I congratulate Versie my teams out of it.

51
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:32.680
I'm not a cunt,
right?
Well,
I am,
but not that big of a cut.

52
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.590
Um,
I was just at what the fuck?

53
00:03:37.591 --> 00:03:42.540
Why are the Astros' so not exciting?
Is it to uniforms?

54
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.010
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.180
<v 1>Maybe I'm just an old guy.</v>

56
00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:47.700
When they were in the fucking national league and they had,

57
00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:49.970
I don't know what you would call those fucking uniforms,

58
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.270
those things with his shit.
They sorta had the,
uh,

59
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.660
the gay bar flag,
you know,

60
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.210
gay friendly fucking flag.

61
00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:04.020
They were flying those colors really progressive way back in the late seventies.

62
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.080
They played on the National League.
So it was all hitting run.

63
00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:12.030
They had the astro turf de ja Jr Richards.

64
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.960
They had hope say cruise Enos Cabell you remember that fucking team way back

65
00:04:18.061 --> 00:04:22.020
when?
I don't think that they've been fucking exciting ever since.

66
00:04:22.021 --> 00:04:27.021
It's some point they decided to have those fucking bland uniforms.

67
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.780
It's like dark color.

68
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.170
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

69
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.660
<v 1>You know what it looks like they did uniform.</v>

70
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:38.920
It's the uniform equivalent to when you go on a diet,

71
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.910
you know,
you have your first little fucking chest pains and they,

72
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:46.490
the doctor goes,
look,
and we'll tell you way now.
He didn't take off 30 pounds.

73
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.160
Need to cut all the salt and sugar out of your diet.
Right?
And you're like,

74
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.010
oh fuck.
And you just sitting there eating lettuce,
staring across somebody.

75
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:56.610
If somebody went to dinner with their eating the chicken palm,

76
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.460
their order in bread and you're just sitting there with your fucking salad and

77
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:04.030
the protein no bigger than the size of the palm of your hand.

78
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.280
They have the uniform version of that low level of excitement.

79
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.870
Um,
I have no,
I don't know shit about the Astros'.
Other than that,

80
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:17.770
they had an unbelievable year.
So,
uh,
I fucking love October baseball.

81
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.920
Um,
my fucking Red Sox Los,
we deserve to lose.
What are you going to do?

82
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.790
A,
we'll see what we do in the off season.
A congratulations to the Astros.

83
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:30.520
Definitely were the better team and a,

84
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:34.240
I missed all the Dodgers series and I saw the highlights tonight of,
uh,

85
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.920
of the cubs in nationals.
Jesus Christ.
That fucking grand slam is brutal.

86
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.020
You know,
it's weird.
Is the cubs lost for so long?
I still felt bad for him.

87
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:47.800
I forgot that they won the world series last year,
but I was just,

88
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:50.200
I'm so used to feeling bad for cubs fans.

89
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:54.400
I actually felt bad when that guy hit the home run.
And by the way,

90
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:57.350
can anybody explain,
and I,

91
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.380
this is always bugged me about Wrigley field is that fucking fence that just

92
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:08.960
juts out that little basket,
you know,

93
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.470
that gives the warning track power guy a fucking home run.

94
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.860
What are they going to take that thing down?
I don't understand that thing.

95
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.480
It hangs out into the field of play.
It's not a fucking,
oh,

96
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:24.470
it is a home run.
The little,
the little fence there.

97
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.210
What are we playing?
Fucking tee ball,
take the goddamn basket.

98
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.210
Whatever the fuck that is.
Um,

99
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.130
reminds me way back in the day when against the Yankees first,
the URLs,

100
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:41.390
when that kid reached over and grabbed the home run instantly became a fucking

101
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:45.470
hero with all Yankee fans who then I'll then turn around and fucking call the

102
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:48.860
fucking red socks.
I mean,
the,
the Patriots cheaters,
it's Hilarious,

103
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.400
but everybody does it.
You know what I mean?
I mean,

104
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:54.500
look at this big story out here in Hollywood.

105
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:58.880
The big scandal have the Weinstein,
right?

106
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.770
First of all,
dude,
I mean,

107
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:05.771
what a display of power to finish in a potted plant and then have the nerve to

108
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:09.560
call the person the next day saying,
hey,
you know,
I had a great time.

109
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.740
I mean that's out of your fucking mind and I don't get these fucking people,
uh,

110
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.090
where everything,
but I'm going to go to rehab.

111
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.170
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

112
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.400
<v 1>How do you go to Rehab to stop you for preventing a woman leaving a room,</v>

113
00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:28.230
taking your dick out and coming on a fern.
Do they have rehab?

114
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.640
I didn't know that.
What do you in there for?
Oh,
you know,
I uh,

115
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.510
I fucking blocked an exit and just on a plant.

116
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.060
Oh yeah.
Yeah,
me too.
Me Too.
I guess we're going to be buddies here.
Huh?

117
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.070
You know when they just in this wing of the rehab with this no potted plants,

118
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.410
they got buddies outside the fucking window.

119
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.250
Tried to sneak fucking plants in form.
That is the most bizarre fucking story.

120
00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:00.990
But,
um,
that's not what I want to talk about here.
You know what I mean?

121
00:08:00.991 --> 00:08:02.790
Where they fucking sit in there going to all,

122
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:07.200
I love when they said all all of men in Hollywood kept silent.

123
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:12.180
It's like everybody did and they weren't acting like Harvey Weinstein couldn't

124
00:08:12.181 --> 00:08:14.070
ruin the career of a guy.

125
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.940
That guy up until four days ago could take your career,

126
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.480
wanted up right in front of you and throw it in the gutter and you were done.

127
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:26.010
You were fucking done.
You're talking about a guy,

128
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.950
whoever allegedly could block a woman from leaving a room

129
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.190
and then calming on a plan and then fuck it.

130
00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:39.200
Does the follow up call like,
like the,

131
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.330
they went to dinner and a movie and they had a lovely time.

132
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.340
That's the level of power this guy had.

133
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.640
Human being should not have that level of power by the way.
Cause man or woman,

134
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.900
they,
they,
they do not handle it well.
Um,
but anyways,

135
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.050
let's get back to far as like,
you know,
being able to see both sides.

136
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.530
The fence here,
sports fans that just like,
you know,
that's obviously holding.

137
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:00.990
And then if the holding called,
doesn't it go against you?
It's like,
oh no,

138
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:02.310
no fucking great.

139
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:07.190
Call Greg Non Call Fox News Day.

140
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.760
We're going off on fucking Harvey Weinstein and all Hollywood now underhanded

141
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:15.150
and blah blah blah,
blah,
blah.
But when Trump was grabbing the pussies,

142
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.350
they got nothing,
right?
And then fucking CNN,

143
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.230
it's the same fucking way Trump grabs the fucking pussies.

144
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:25.380
They're all fucking over.
Harvey Weinstein does what he does.

145
00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:27.960
This isn't a time to fucking politicize this thing.

146
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.530
They're both so fucking full of shit.

147
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:35.070
And they're going to judge all the Hollywood on Harvey Weinstein.
Right?

148
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.880
The same way the Liberals Judge all Republicans on Donald Trump.

149
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:44.010
I don't know anybody.
Uh,
watch is either one of those channels.
However,

150
00:09:44.011 --> 00:09:47.370
I will say this cause I don't watch Fox News that often.

151
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.880
I don't really watch CNN,
but I will say at least see it and it looks,

152
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.630
it looks professional.
I'm not saying it is all it is,

153
00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:59.130
but I'm not saying it's obviously not ridiculously biased.
They both are.

154
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.930
But what is Fox News looks like?

155
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.600
It looks like fucking Wsp k TV 38 back in the day when they'd go in between

156
00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:12.450
periods and that little bullshit said,
I don't know.
What about Fox News?

157
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:17.370
It's like they got to put more money into it.
Everybody looks sweaty,
you know,

158
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.440
I don't understand it.
Um,
but anyways,
Jesus fucking Christ.

159
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.450
Uh,
so now they're going back into everybody's life.

160
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.110
They go back into somebody's eye.
You did this back in 2000.
Here's my thing.

161
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:34.020
All these guys and now going to have to apologize for all this shit they did

162
00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.740
ever deadly back into the fucking 90.
So whatever my question is,

163
00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:40.770
is when is the,
when is it going to even out?

164
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:46.260
I would love to see some gold digging whores come on and apologize and be like,

165
00:10:46.261 --> 00:10:47.190
yeah,
hey,
sorry,

166
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:52.080
I took your house and add a couple of kids with you and said that I loved you

167
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:53.920
when I really didn't.
Uh,

168
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.880
I shouldn't have done that and then prevented you from seeing those kids that

169
00:10:56.881 --> 00:10:57.631
you had with me.

170
00:10:57.631 --> 00:11:02.630
That half look like me and you now know that I never really loved you.
And,
uh,

171
00:11:02.631 --> 00:11:07.631
I'm sorry for that and banging the new guy in this house that you bought.

172
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.200
And now I'm also not going to,
you know,

173
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.630
have my new boyfriend ever move in or marry me because then my payments from you

174
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.330
and the alimony will stop.
I want to apologize for that.

175
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:20.970
My behavior was completely unacceptable

176
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.920
just to balance it out.
Listen,
if you're new to this podcast,

177
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.360
um,
one of the mainstays of this podcast is that I'm a,
I'm a,

178
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.160
I'm a contrarion count.
All right?

179
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.080
So if you're,
if you're new to it,
you know,
I don't know.

180
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.290
This first 11 minutes is what you can expect for the rest of this.

181
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.390
Um,
anyways,
I am in Atlanta,
Georgia right now.
Uh,

182
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:55.960
I got a,
uh,
I've got a small part in a big movie.
I mean,
that's my career.

183
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.800
That's my,
that's my fucking wheelhouse.
I love it.
You know,

184
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.690
all I want to do is paratroop in for a couple of fucking days,
have a good time,

185
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:09.520
you know,
get to watch the real fucking actors do that goddamn thing.

186
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.810
I always feel like I won a contest when I do a movie.
You know what I mean?
Like,

187
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:18.340
Hey,
you want to be in a movie?
Oh boy.
Oh boy do I.
Um,

188
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:22.720
so I'm going to be here for the next,
uh,
the next couple of weeks,
you know,

189
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.110
missing my family,
like fucking crazy.
Uh,
I'm hoping,
uh,

190
00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.980
trying to work something out where I can bring them in so I don't lose my

191
00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:33.160
fucking mind out here.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

192
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.060
I was actually so fucking lonely and depressed last night.

193
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.840
Um,
I mean obviously succeeded to do a movie,

194
00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:45.010
just missing my family that I walked by a liquor store and I saw this bottle of

195
00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:48.580
booze in there in the window and I was like,
uh,

196
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.130
am I going to buy that and finish all of it?

197
00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:56.680
And fortunately I walked past it and I went down to the laughing skull comedy

198
00:12:56.681 --> 00:13:00.790
club,
uh,
went up on stage,
thank you to them for putting me on stage.

199
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:06.070
And I went up there and I'm going to say I kind of eat my balls.
It was a very,

200
00:13:06.071 --> 00:13:10.270
a give and take,
a lot more.
Whatever's worse,

201
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.600
but w a lot more worse.
A lot more give or a lot more to,

202
00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:18.190
I don't know what it was,
but it was a
hotel.
It was a rough one.
Okay.

203
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.250
Um,
then,
anyway,
so now I'm out of here.

204
00:13:21.251 --> 00:13:24.370
I got to figure out what the fuck I'm going to do.
I went to trader Joe's,

205
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.760
I bought some healthy fucking food.
You know,
all this shit's healthy,

206
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:30.280
but they still have a frozen food aisle,
so I don't get that.

207
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.040
You know what I mean?
They still have fucking cereal.

208
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:34.350
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

209
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.890
<v 1>You know what I mean?
That's that part of a balanced breakfast isn't cereal.</v>

210
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.570
I don't,
can you even see what the fuck is cereal.
I've just thought about that.

211
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.020
Like what is in a cheerio?
I bought these brand fucking things.

212
00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:51.440
I don't know what they are
like,

213
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.580
can you make cereal?
I bet there's some somebody on youtube,

214
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.810
homemade cereal.
I'm going to look that up.
I bet to be.

215
00:13:58.811 --> 00:14:01.280
I'm going to go out and let me say on the first person who ever fucking Google

216
00:14:01.281 --> 00:14:05.040
this home.
Fucking feds are going to knock on the Goddamn door right now.

217
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.310
Homemade cereal.

218
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:12.100
Does anybody like serial enough to fucking do directions?

219
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.660
Okay.
Preheat your oven to 275 degrees.
I don't know about you,

220
00:14:16.661 --> 00:14:20.770
but I'm already out.
I get either open a box and pour it and it's done.

221
00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:25.660
Or I can go preheat my oven to 275 degrees for my friends around the world.

222
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:29.380
That's 135 degrees Celsius.

I lose that in and wheat brand.
Oh my God.

225
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.950
If you can actually take the time to make cereal,

226
00:14:41.951 --> 00:14:46.120

Air conditioning is like that person at a party who just won't shut the fuck up,

264
00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:02.830
you know?
Oh,
you know what they said that about,
I was watching,

265
00:17:02.831 --> 00:17:06.280
you know the B e t a rapid wards there,

266
00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.040
hip hop awards and I'm,

267
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.690
I'm watching all this shit.
And they had the guy from two live crew,

268
00:17:13.691 --> 00:17:16.510
they were giving him like a lifetime achievement award and it was fucking

269
00:17:16.511 --> 00:17:20.770
hilarious.
He was up there dressed like he just got a doctorate

270
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.540
and then afterwards he does all this music and it's all owe me so horny.

271
00:17:28.541 --> 00:17:31.450
All that shit.
I'm not saying I don't like that fucking music,
but I mean,

272
00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:36.220
Jesus Christ,
he had like a bow tie on and his whole suit and everything,

273
00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:40.330
it looked like it's a fucking elder statesman.
Um,

274
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.900
but anyways,
uh,
I dunno,
I was

275
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.590
talking to my wife about it,
but I don't know shit about hip hop,

276
00:17:48.591 --> 00:17:53.490
but this whole fucking thing where everybody is drinking that shit,
that lean,

277
00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:58.470
whatever the hell it is,
and everybody sounds,
even if they're not fucking wasted,

278
00:17:58.471 --> 00:18:03.210
they sound like they're waste drives me up the wall.
I just listened to it.

279
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:03.751
It's like,
you know,

280
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:06.740
when you go to a party and there's somebody way more fucked up than you were

281
00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.740
just like,
dude,
I can't talk to you.
I got,
how did I got to get out of this?

282
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:16.470
Um,
that's what it sounded like.
That one dude lost all that fucking wait,
man.

283
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.020
The guy usually takes his shirt off when he was fat,
he took his shirt off.

284
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:23.850
Now he's skinny or,
and he has his clothes on,

285
00:18:23.851 --> 00:18:27.690
which probably means he's still getting the skin removed or whatever.
You know,

286
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:29.370
it's funny.
All the weight that he lost.

287
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.870
He still weighs more than all of the Migos
put together.

288
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.310
Even with their jewelry on,
I'm sorry,

289
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.220
I've just been my first day on the movies tomorrow,

290
00:18:41.221 --> 00:18:45.870
so I've just been sitting here and fucking watching TV and a waiting to work.

291
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:46.950
So I've just been watching,

292
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:49.143
<v 0>mmm.</v>

293
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.210
<v 1>Just been watching all of this shit and uh,</v>

294
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.670
listening to music and stuff.
Dude,
I know,

295
00:18:56.671 --> 00:19:00.690
I'm like fucking over 10 years late on this thing,

296
00:19:00.691 --> 00:19:03.390
but I am an old guy is,
um,

297
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:08.100
I've just been listening to the first to Mars Volta albums and I gotta tell you,

298
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.960
John Theodore is a fucking genius drummer.
That,
what is it?
How do you say this,

299
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:16.410
Sarah Eyes?
I don't want to say anything.
V.
I s C r a any drummers out there.

300
00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:19.350
You got to listen to that fucking song and you've got to learn how to play it.

301
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.700
You can't be a drummer at listen to that and not want to at least that open and

302
00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:26.610
drum groove.
I don't know what the fuck he's doing on the breakdown in the end,

303
00:19:26.611 --> 00:19:28.800
but it's one of the sickest.

304
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:30.230
<v 0>Okay.</v>

305
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.390
<v 1>Fucking drum grooves I've ever heard in my life.</v>

306
00:19:32.391 --> 00:19:35.000
And you listened to what the guitar is doing.

307
00:19:35.001 --> 00:19:40.001
Most people would have just played with the guitar and the way he fucking plays

308
00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:43.364
around it.

309
00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:48.680
And one of my favorite things is does not have this snare on two and four.
It's,

310
00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:53.360
and it's still just fucking not only fucking rocks,

311
00:19:53.361 --> 00:19:55.580
it propels this fucking song.

312
00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.940
I think I've listened to the song 200 times

313
00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:04.450
and the last fucking week and it's still giving me chills.
It's fucking unreal.

314
00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:05.500
And I,

315
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.190
my drum teacher a long time ago told me to get into this band much sugar and I

316
00:20:09.191 --> 00:20:13.330
listened to it and I just,
it was too advanced.
I couldn't,

317
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.150
I couldn't hear what was,
it was just too much shit to be listened to.

318
00:20:16.151 --> 00:20:20.050
But because I've been listening to Mars Volta and they're crazy shit.

319
00:20:20.051 --> 00:20:24.130
I actually went back cause I was scrolling through looking for Mars Volta and I,

320
00:20:24.131 --> 00:20:26.470
and I had this much sugar album for the longest time.

321
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.970
And I went back and listened to it and I think I'm finally starting to like,

322
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:36.760
I always knew it was amazing,
but now I actually am like fucking into it.
Um,

323
00:20:36.761 --> 00:20:39.910
I just keep us in that first song.
I'm baby step in my way into it.

324
00:20:39.911 --> 00:20:44.350
This music is way advanced for my fucking limited fucking musical abilities.

325
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:49.060
But that first song Stanger,
s,
e,
n,
g,
h,

326
00:20:49.061 --> 00:20:53.740
just the drumming on that,
the whole fucking thing is unbelievable.
So,
uh,

327
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.070
I'd just been,
that's what I've been doing.
I haven't been Busan.

328
00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:02.300
I've been watching old twilight zones.
I've been listening to though.

329
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.140
There's all this fucking music and uh,
I dunno,

330
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:08.500
I went out tonight to his cigar bar.
That's my one vice that I have left.

331
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.350
That's all I got left.
Um,

332
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:16.660
and I went out and ordered my fucking club soda and a lime.
I got to tell you,

333
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.980
the minute I actually feel,
you know,
walk out,
I'm not shit faced.
It's Nice,

334
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:24.460
you know?
Yeah.
Bill,
that'd be boozed every fucking day.

335
00:21:24.461 --> 00:21:27.820
People find that nice after what I will.
All right then.
All right.

336
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.580
I haven't been able to watch any of the hockey.
Fucking,

337
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.400
I know the Bruins are one and two.
We got crushed by the ass tonight.

338
00:21:33.401 --> 00:21:34.234
Six to three.

339
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:39.690
And I'm actually debating on Saturday because I'm going out of my mind,

340
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.160
uh,
missing my family.

341
00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:45.610
I'm actually debating the Tennessee volunteers have a home game.

342
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:50.470
I'm actually debating,
it's a three hour drive.
I know they're not good this year,

343
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.890
but that's such a legendary stadium.
They are home.

344
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.740
I live on the other side of the country.
It's three hours.

345
00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.660
I can drive up their scalp,
a fucking ticket.
Watch him play the South Carolina.

346
00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:04.120
Gamecocks Nice Sec.
Match up.

347
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:07.780
I get to fucking go to that state.
I think I'm going to do it.

348
00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.340
What else am I gonna do?
Sit here alone in this fucking hotel room.

349
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.920
Missing my Kiddo,
you know?
Um,
anyway,
so let's get into the,
uh,

350
00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:22.870
I think I'm going to do it.
Fuck it.
That'll be my 20th,
my 20th,

351
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:27.610
um,
college football team that I've seen.
I've seen some big ones though,

352
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.340
will be my fifth or sixth SEC team that I've seen a home game.

353
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:36.100
I've seen Texas a and M,
Lsu,
Alabama,
Georgia,
Florida,

354
00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.700
and then Tennessee.
I mean,

355
00:22:39.701 --> 00:22:43.960
as far as the big ones I'd have left.
I'd have Auburn,
Ole Miss,

356
00:22:43.961 --> 00:22:48.880
Mississippi state,
and fucking Arkansas.
You know,

357
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:54.070
no disrespect to,
uh,
uh,

358
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.990
Vanderbilt was,
who's left?
Vanderbilt,
Kentucky and Missouri,
Missouri.
Like,

359
00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:03.670
you know,
I feel like the SCC is like,
they're rebound conference,
you know,

360
00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:05.830
they still want to be in the big 12,

361
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:09.400
but the fucking university of Texas came up with their own,

362
00:23:09.401 --> 00:23:13.030
I dunno if their own yes.
Network,
their own Nesson whatever the fuck they did.

363
00:23:13.031 --> 00:23:16.870
I don't understand why everybody else just didn't do the same thing.
Um,

364
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.920
but anyways,
I think I'm going to do it anyway though.

365
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.750
Isn't enough enough with the fucking babbling here?
Oh,

366
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.960

371
00:23:40.701 --> 00:23:45.701
If you got some lights or some fucking crabs down in your fucking under and you

372
00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:49.280
know,
maybe that's a way to get rid of crabs.
That's like,

373
00:23:49.281 --> 00:23:52.370
that's how fucking nice to me and disarm it.
Literally,

374
00:23:52.371 --> 00:23:55.250

375
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.300

380
00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:19.070
That Yankee Fan at the end of the fucking Cleveland series,

381
00:24:19.071 --> 00:24:24.020
when they cut to those two Yankee fans,
the guy on the left,
when he was clapping,

382
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:29.390
somebody's going to turn that into something.
I mean,

383
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.200

Clap better than this guy in the fucking look on his face.

386
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.420
I don't know what was going on with that guy.
I hope he doesn't help.

387
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.800
He's not touched on some level then.
I feel bad.
He did have front row seats.

388
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.160
You never know.

that I love how all this shade that they're throwing over at fucking Uber during

422
00:26:54.451 --> 00:26:59.451
this lift begin believes that being a ride sharing drivers should be fun.

423
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.180
If you're having a good time.
So are the passengers well,

424
00:27:03.181 --> 00:27:06.000
don't have to good at time.
You fucking up my life in your hands there.

425
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:07.343
If it choosing,

426
00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.970
I ride sharing company to drive for go with the company that treats you better.

427
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.170
Lift lift was the first offer.
INAP tipping.
When you drive for Lyft,

428
00:27:16.171 --> 00:27:18.990
you keep 100% of the tips are my stomach's growling here.

429
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.180
Being an actor can't eat late at night.

430
00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:25.830
A 100% of the tips drivers will be paid over 200 million in tips.

431
00:27:25.831 --> 00:27:29.430
Since drivers haven't paid over 200 million in tips since the feature was first

432
00:27:29.431 --> 00:27:30.210
introduced.

433
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:34.650
Express pay lets drivers get pay almost instantly instead of waiting for weeks.

434
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.050
Lyft has taken the guesswork out of pickups.

435
00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:42.060
The new amp device uses color coding to help passengers find the drivers.

436
00:27:42.061 --> 00:27:46.490
You can earn hundreds of dollars a week plus tips.
What are,
Whoa,

437
00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:49.860
are you drive boards?
Never been easier to give yourself a raise.
Sorry,

438
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.940
I'm doing this one 13 in the morning here.
Now it's a simple formula.

439
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.010
Happy drivers mean happy passengers.

440
00:27:56.011 --> 00:28:00.070
Maybe that's why nine out of every 10 Lyft riders get a perfect five star
rating.

441
00:28:00.071 --> 00:28:04.320
So join the ride sharing company that believes in trading.
It's people better.

442
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:09.680
Go to lift.com/burger today and you can get a $500 new driving bonus.

443
00:28:10.081 --> 00:28:14.760
That's lyft.com/bar
lyft.com/ [inaudible] spelled l,

444
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:19.230
y.
F.
T.
It's a limited time.
Only terms do apply.

445
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.920
All right.
What am I up to here?
28 and change.

446
00:28:22.921 --> 00:28:26.190
I got to kill another minute and a half.
Um,

447
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:32.220
actually if I do the drive
up to Knoxville,

448
00:28:32.221 --> 00:28:34.890
Tennessee,
um,

449
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:39.210
I will pass through one of my favorite and most one of the most underrated

450
00:28:39.211 --> 00:28:42.690
cities in the United States,
Chattanooga,
Tennessee.

451
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.280
I've only been there one time and I had such a fucking great time.
Great Food,

452
00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.580
great bars,
just great people.

453
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:54.510
Just a great fucking great city.
Love that place.

454
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.650
And um,
and Knoxville is another place that had a great fucking time.

455
00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.350
Everybody goes to Tennessee,
they all go to Nashville.

456
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:05.220
They want to go to the grand old fucking Opry.
They want to fucking,

457
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:09.570
I don't know what the fuck you'll go see some live music and all that shit.

458
00:29:09.571 --> 00:29:13.080
I'm telling you right now,
sorry.

459
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:18.240
Do not sleep on Chattanooga,
Tennessee.
Do not avoid Knoxville diff.

460
00:29:18.241 --> 00:29:21.720
Fucking great.
I swear to God,
if I wasn't in this God damn business,

461
00:29:21.721 --> 00:29:24.750
I could live in either one of those towns.
Um,

462
00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:28.200
I'm a big fan of that state.
Um,

463
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:33.670
not that I'm shitting on fucking Georgia here cause it's another good time.
Uh,

464
00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:35.970
speaking of which,
I guess the College Hall of fame,

465
00:29:35.971 --> 00:29:38.670
some sort of hall of fames out here.
I might go check that out down the street.

466
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.480
Um,
but that is it.
That is a podcast here.
Oh,
Billy freckles here is,

467
00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:44.800
I got to get my eight hours sleep.

468
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.043
<v 0>MMM.</v>

469
00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:52.100
<v 1>And go do my fucking little
what I like to call acting tomorrow.</v>

470
00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:55.820
Uh,
that is it.
It,
was there anything else I wanted to talk about,

471
00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:57.560
like promoting anything coming up?
Oh yeah,

472
00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:03.060
we added a third show and I'm in Austin at Austin city limits now is all excited

473
00:30:05.001 --> 00:30:08.870
that this is the same place where I saw Stevie Ray Vaughan play.

474
00:30:08.871 --> 00:30:10.880
But evidently that's a new one.
However,

475
00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:15.410
it is the same place where I saw Iggy pop with queen of the Queens of the stone

476
00:30:15.411 --> 00:30:16.700
age performed.

477
00:30:16.701 --> 00:30:21.470
So it is legendary and we'd be down there with Dean del Rey and I'm trying to

478
00:30:21.471 --> 00:30:23.690
find out if I can record.
Um,

479
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:28.280
cause my Madison Square Garden recording did not work.
Um,

480
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:31.820
I fucked up.
They just gave me the recording from the board.

481
00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.740
So I am loud as shit and you can barely hear the crowd.
So,

482
00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.850
oops.
I Dunno if I'll ever get to do Madison Square Garden against,
so,

483
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:44.480
oh well I guess it's just a memory.
Um,

484
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:48.170
but I'm starting to think when I play like these really cool venues like this,

485
00:30:48.171 --> 00:30:51.350
that I'm just gonna record the audio.
I don't know what I'm going to do with it.

486
00:30:51.351 --> 00:30:52.400
I might just start,
you know,

487
00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:57.140
putting out a random like fucking just on vinyl is some shit.

488
00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.410
<v 0>MMM.</v>

489
00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:01.243
<v 1>You know,</v>

490
00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:05.480
I got to know the guys over there at third man records that's also in Nashville.

491
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:10.110
Uh,
Jack White's company.
Those guys treated me great.
I did my,
uh,

492
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.040
Carnegie Hall One with those guys.
So maybe who knows,

493
00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:14.990
maybe I could do something with them.

494
00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:17.283
<v 0>MMM.</v>

495
00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:19.380
<v 1>I Dunno.
I kinda like the idea that,</v>

496
00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:23.130
cause my act changed so much and I have like a lot of like topical shit.

497
00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:26.690
And I was thinking like,
what if I just,
I don't know,

498
00:31:26.691 --> 00:31:29.720
just start recording all these sets and then maybe I splice it together.

499
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.450
A bunch of different ones.
I don't know.
We'll see what happens.

500
00:31:32.451 --> 00:31:34.610
But it's never bad to have a good recording.
Right.

501
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:38.840
Am I just spit balling out loud to you guys as if this is fucking entertainment?

502
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:42.320
I have no idea.
Um,
all right,
that's it.
Uh,

503
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:43.990
congratulations to Jaromir younger.

504
00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:47.000
You got fucking signed with the Calgary flames.

505
00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:51.870
The man's career continues and I look forward to watching them out there.

506
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:56.540
I know I made all you guys yawn.
I apologize,

507
00:31:56.541 --> 00:31:59.900
but I don't have time to do this tomorrow.
Uh,
that's it.

508
00:31:59.901 --> 00:32:02.970
You guys have a great day.
A wonderful weekend and

509
00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:09.470
I will talk to you on a Monday and a,
those of you new to this podcast,

510
00:32:09.471 --> 00:32:13.130
we now do a greatest hits from a Thursday gone by.

511
00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.630
You can listen to some cool music.

512
00:32:14.631 --> 00:32:18.560
If you have any questions about who did the music,

513
00:32:18.561 --> 00:32:23.210
just tweet at the mm podcast at the podcast.

514
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.890
And uh,

515
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:29.300
Andrew is really good about posting that type of shit to let you know who it is

516
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:34.400
cause he plays all the cool music,
you know,
um,
I'm way behind as you can tell.

517
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:38.270
All right,
I'm just starting to get into Mars Volta.
Okay.

518
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.300
I'm getting into a that people are hoping is going to have a reunion.

519
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:46.210
I'm just getting into them.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
That is it.
Uh,
all right.

520
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.320
Have a great weekend.
I'll talk to you later,

521
00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:53.670
<v 5>Susan.</v>

522
00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.120
[inaudible]

523
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:40.270
<v 6>all right.
Hair loss or sex loss bill,
I'm sure you've heard of Propecia.</v>

524
00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:41.890
Heard of it.
I used it.

525
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.233
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

526
00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.030
<v 6>I used it and the one I ran out of it,</v>

527
00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:50.200
I just had that honest moment with myself and I was just like,

528
00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:55.020
there's no way.
There's not going to be a side effect.
Okay.
There's always this,

529
00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:59.680
there's no way.
There's just no way.
There's no way this thing,
okay,

530
00:33:59.681 --> 00:34:03.280
I'll save my hair but damage my liver.
You know,

531
00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:08.830
what do I need more?
You know,
a full head of hair or a functioning fucking liver.

532
00:34:08.831 --> 00:34:09.664
You just,
you know,

533
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.500
you just got to bite the bullet and tr and just turn old just age gracefully.

534
00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:16.510
You know,
I try to keep my hair short.

535
00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.410
I tried to offend as little people as I go through the slow process of seeing

536
00:34:20.411 --> 00:34:25.040
what my skull actually looks like.
He goes,

537
00:34:25.041 --> 00:34:28.580
I have a lot of friends audit that say it's sort of works.

538
00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:32.510
Definitely slows down hair loss by doing something.
However,

539
00:34:32.511 --> 00:34:37.250
apparently the drawbacks is no boner.
Oh,

540
00:34:37.251 --> 00:34:40.310
is that right?
I don't know.
I don't know either way on that one.
That's a,

541
00:34:40.311 --> 00:34:45.080
that's some bar from stuff.
I think that that can,
that can happen to some people.

542
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.530
I have no fucking idea.
He said,

543
00:34:48.531 --> 00:34:52.100
so do you choose hair to get sex or choose no hair,

544
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:54.110
which might mean no sex.

545
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:59.430
Is this some sort of sick joke by the pharmaceutical companies?
No.
You,

546
00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.990
you're fighting nature.
Listen Dude,
I'll tell you right now.

547
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:08.780
All right,
there's women out there that think a shaved head is sexy.

548
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:12.290
Not all of them,
but there's enough.
All right,

549
00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:16.550
there's enough out there that you can keep going out.
Bang.
And women,
you know,

550
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:21.380
some women find a shaved head fucking they lay like it turns them on.

551
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.120
So listen,

552
00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:28.480
this is the great thing about women is they can see beyond what you look like.

553
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:35.600
Okay?
If you come in there and you got a little swagger and you're funny and you

554
00:35:35.601 --> 00:35:40.050
fucking,
you know,
shaved head shows confidence,
dude.
You're like,
fuck it.

555
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:44.490
Preemptive strike.
You guys are walking out on me.
Well,
you know what,

556
00:35:44.491 --> 00:35:47.820
I'm kicking you out the door and you take out your clippers.

557
00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.990
You know,
I buzzed my head down a few years ago.
I fucking loved it,
man.

558
00:35:52.991 --> 00:35:56.520
I took all the jokes.
When you can't the patient and look and make a wish,
Buh,

559
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.530
Buh,
Buh,
Buh and Peters out after a couple of weeks,
you know,

560
00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.520
I dunno,
I go back and forth.
I go back and forth.
I mean,

561
00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:06.980
I go literally from doing,

562
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:10.670
maybe I'll do the fucking hair transplant to all the way back to all fucking

563
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:14.330
shave my head again.
I have no idea,
but I gotta be honest with you,
dude.

564
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:18.860
It doesn't eat.
The vibe you're bringing is going to be way more.

565
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.880
Listen,

566
00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.760
do you really want to get with some girl who's with you because you have a

567
00:36:22.761 --> 00:36:26.480
fucking,
a nice big cow lick on top of your fucking head.

568
00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:29.660
And if you didn't have it,
then she wouldn't be with you.
You know,

569
00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:33.620
going bald is like driving a piece of shit car.

570
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.230
It really keeps the whores away from you.

571
00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:44.150
All these fucking idiots with full heads of hair driving around flashy cars.

572
00:36:44.151 --> 00:36:47.480
You see what happens to him.
But what happened to Mel Gibson?

573
00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.720
He should've just gone bald,
but he didn't,
he kept fighting it,

574
00:36:50.721 --> 00:36:53.150
doing shit up there,
drove around in a flashy car.

575
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:58.160
I had to give up my fucking lacquer tickets,
you know,
flipping out,
flipping out.

576
00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.060
You know what dude?
Yeah.
Don't take those fucking drugs.

577
00:37:02.061 --> 00:37:06.290
Those drugs have brand new and the side effects that they're talking about,

578
00:37:06.291 --> 00:37:10.130
I'm telling you,
is just the shit that they're letting on to cover their asses.

579
00:37:10.131 --> 00:37:12.770
That they said that there was some side effects.
Okay.

580
00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:17.690
From what I've overheard and bars,
the people on the FDA,

581
00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.710
half of them used to work for these pharmaceutical fucking companies.

582
00:37:20.711 --> 00:37:23.420
So they got the nuts running the fucking nuthouse.
All right,

583
00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.170
and you're just going to be,
again,

584
00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.460
you're going to be a little lab rat if you start taking that shit.
All right?

585
00:37:28.461 --> 00:37:30.050
So I would suggest not doing it.

586
00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:33.350
Let nature take its fucking course and do what I'm doing.

587
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:37.440
Wait for the cure and I guarantee it ain't gonna come.

588
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.750
So just fucking man up and go bald.
You fucking pussy.
Okay.
Do what I'm doing.

589
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:44.510
Just slowly let it happen.

590
00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.320
A year from now,

591
00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.960
I'm going to have fucking hair plugs and I'm going to be performing for

592
00:37:50.961 --> 00:37:55.100
dictators for New Year's Eve,
New Year's Eve.
Ah,

593
00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:59.510
be best friends with Beyonce.
I didn't see my itinerary either.

594
00:37:59.511 --> 00:38:00.770
I didn't know who it was.

595
00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.580
I literally use the same excuse for performing for oil man.

596
00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.793
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

597
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:07.520
<v 6>uh,
the past couple of weeks I've been talking about the food down here in New</v>

598
00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.130
Orleans,

599
00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:11.660
saint how delicious slash unhealthy it is and how you can't find fucking Kale.

600
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:16.760
Excuse me.
As I drift more cold water for my fucking scalded tongue.

601
00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:19.793
<v 4>MMM.</v>

602
00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:24.820
<v 6>I actually bought a juicer this week to somehow come back all the fried food</v>

603
00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:29.820
that I've been eating and a,
I started drinking that shit that,
that guy and uh,

604
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:33.610
uh,
fat dead and kind of sick,
whatever the fuck is called,

605
00:39:33.611 --> 00:39:34.900
fat sick and nearly dead.

606
00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:42.030
Just six fatty would dead fucking something,
whatever.
Um,

607
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:45.660
I've been drinking that shit man.
I gotta tell you something.
It's delicious.

608
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:50.550
Not only is it delicious,
you crave it after awhile and uh,

609
00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.400
yeah,
I think I dropped like four or five pounds.
Good pounds too.

610
00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.070
You know the flabby wants.

611
00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.070
I was joking on Twitter saying how I was in,

612
00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:05.630
I was in buttoned down shirt shape and I actually want to get into like,

613
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:09.050
I want to be in sitting down no shirt on shape.

614
00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:17.050
I don't know what,
I don't bill Cosby did a bit on this but
he's so had,

615
00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.250
what the fuck happens when you sit down?

616
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:23.750
You stand up and look sideways and Mary Lake Guy,
you know what?
That isn't bad.

617
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.030
Dare I say it's kind of cute.

618
00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:30.380
Shows that I like the occasional snickers.
Right.

619
00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.450
And you sit there pitching it yourself.
Like you're in an old old school,

620
00:40:34.451 --> 00:40:38.270
special k commercial going on.
Right.
That's not that bad.
It's not that bad.

621
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:43.450
Then you just sit down and like three handfuls of Shit just lands on your

622
00:40:43.611 --> 00:40:44.444
thighs,

623
00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:46.613
<v 4>you know,</v>

624
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:50.960
<v 6>for the life of me,
I can't let,
what is,
what happens.</v>

625
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:55.910
The hipbones move up to your fucking man tits and everything just gets blown
out.

626
00:40:55.911 --> 00:41:00.350
I have no idea.
But sitting down without a shirt on,
you know,
that's,

627
00:41:00.351 --> 00:41:03.890
that's the truth moment of your fucking physique that you're going to see all

628
00:41:03.891 --> 00:41:04.724
day.

629
00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:05.620
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

630
00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:09.730
<v 6>Stop standing up sucking and you got all right.
You want to see,</v>

631
00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.770
you want to see the damage you've done.
Maybe you're not ready for

632
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.863
<v 4>all right.</v>

633
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:18.200
<v 6>This is like the ring,
when you looked at that fucking chick's face,</v>

634
00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.730
you judges opens up and you land in a fucking walk in closet.

635
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:28.790
Oh my God.
I don't know what happened to me.
I'm not even that bad a shape.

636
00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:33.140
So I said,
fuck this.
I got a juicer.
And um,

637
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:37.500
I just did a quick gig up in Chicago,
came right back,
this private thing.
Um,

638
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:43.070
so I don't know.
I ate halfway decent up there.
I did find a Vegan restaurant,

639
00:41:43.071 --> 00:41:46.310
but then of course they had had some Chicago Pizza.
Um,

640
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:51.560
so now I came back and I had my little fucking grilled cheese sandwich and

641
00:41:51.561 --> 00:41:52.394
tomato soup.

642
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.640
So now my body is starting to pull me back to the bay,

643
00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.180
the dark side.

644
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.980
And that's what I've really learned about trying to stay in shape.

645
00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:08.630
It's all about keeping your brain out in front of your body,

646
00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.860
keeping your fucking wits about you.
Like this shit.

647
00:42:13.861 --> 00:42:17.560
It's like food,
you know when they say food is a drug,
I didn't believe him,
but I,

648
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:20.460
I'm totally convinced of it now.
It's like when you're eating bad,

649
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.840
when you just go on like a three month bender of just eaten bad in your head.

650
00:42:24.841 --> 00:42:27.990
Like,
Oh God,
I gotta stop.
I don't have a fucking cheeseburger.

651
00:42:27.991 --> 00:42:31.080
And you just keep going and then that makes you want cookies and all that type

652
00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:31.800
of shit.

653
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:36.800
It's the food equivalent to like locking yourself in a Roman just free basing

654
00:42:37.901 --> 00:42:42.870
for three months.
That's what you're doing.
So when I tried to do,

655
00:42:42.871 --> 00:42:44.430
when I'm eating,
eating bad like this,

656
00:42:44.431 --> 00:42:48.210
I just talked to a buddy of mine outside of the business who's trying to lose

657
00:42:48.211 --> 00:42:51.690
some fucking wait.
I was trying to tell him that like,

658
00:42:51.691 --> 00:42:55.980
you gotta keep your head out in front of it and just go like,
I want that,

659
00:42:55.981 --> 00:42:59.130
but I'm going to eat this.
Even in,
in,

660
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:03.390
in that moment when you're looking at that apple as opposed to that fucking

661
00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:07.710
glorious whatever you're looking at,
right?

662
00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:12.390
Toasted roast beef and cheese with the fucking pickles and the chips and all

663
00:43:12.391 --> 00:43:16.580
that.
The last thing your body's like,
that's fine.

664
00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:19.560
This is what the fuck I want.
And you got to reach for that apple.

665
00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:25.310
You've got to fucking hit that,
that crack pipe instead.

666
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.600
And I'm telling you the second you get to three bites in,
you're like,

667
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:34.550
oh thank God,
thank God I did that.
And you find,
cause from what I've,

668
00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:35.450
what I've read,

669
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:39.440
the very little I've read use your body is actually craving nutrition.

670
00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:41.413
<v 4>You know,</v>

671
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:43.800
<v 6>that's why we eat Chinese food.</v>

672
00:43:43.801 --> 00:43:47.160
Like fucking 35 minutes later you're hungry again because your body's still

673
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.010
craving nutrition.
There wasn't like a fucking ounce of it in that shit,

674
00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:54.090
at the risk of getting sued by that entire fucking continent of China

675
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.120
country.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,

676
00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:02.550
so that's what I would say.

677
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:04.720
<v 4>Okay.</v>

678
00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.531
<v 6>If you could try to do,</v>

679
00:44:05.531 --> 00:44:08.650
that's what I'm trying to do as I'm trying to keep my head out in front of it.

680
00:44:08.651 --> 00:44:12.370
So I got that grilled cheese sandwich and I got to tomato soup and I said,

681
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:12.580
all right,

682
00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:16.120
I gotta get back on the fucking Green Gumbo here as I'm calling it because I'm

683
00:44:16.121 --> 00:44:18.400
in New Orleans and uh,
that's it.

684
00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:21.980
I'm back on that shit for the last two tomorrow morning.

685
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:26.110
Wake up and make another one.
Bingo.
Bango I'm trying to do two a day.

686
00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:30.100
Jewson and then one day have on the fucking,
uh,
you know,

687
00:44:30.101 --> 00:44:33.570
a healthy dinner and then I go on the treadmill for a half hour.

688
00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:36.870
There's no fucking way.
You're not going to drop weight.
All right.

689
00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:41.640
So there you go.
So stop doing those stupid ass fad diets.
EA.

690
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:45.620
It's the fucking corn flakes died.
I DOJ is eat flakes.

691
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.410
They can eat as much as I wanted.
That bullshit veggie eventually.

692
00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.120
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

693
00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.450
<v 6>you don't really,
I think the really,
it really is,
is not even like,</v>

694
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:59.100
it's not even the fucking diet.
It's the,
once you get to your weight,

695
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.880
what do you do?
Then?
You know,
once you get down to your weight,

696
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:04.680
at some point you're going to be looking around.

697
00:45:04.681 --> 00:45:08.580
It's like you got out of jail and there's some ice cream right over there.

698
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:13.980
You were an adult.
You don't have to go,
mom,
can I have some ice cream?

699
00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:17.550
Right?
That's how you become a fat fuck is an adult.

700
00:45:17.551 --> 00:45:20.100
There's no one to say you had enough cookies.
So on,

701
00:45:20.101 --> 00:45:24.120
you got enough booze put on a condom.

702
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:25.283
It's all on you.

703
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:29.640
You gotta be your own fucking parent until you get a lady and your life.

704
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:34.150
Then she starts fucking nagging at you.
Take shoes are on.
Hey,

705
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.570
I give out the rug up.
Fuck you lady.

706
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.810
Where did you become so angry?
Um,

707
00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:51.170
so that would be my advice
when you're just on,
if right now,

708
00:45:51.171 --> 00:45:53.960
if you'll listen to this shit and you're on a bad fucking road.

709
00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:58.610
I'm telling you one of these days in the future,
you're going to wake up,

710
00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:00.710
you're going to be sitting down on the side of your bed.

711
00:46:00.711 --> 00:46:03.980
You're going to glance it to a mirror and you're going to be like,
what the fuck?

712
00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:07.490
What have I done to myself?
You can stand up real quick.

713
00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.060
You can try to suck it in and try to deny the truth that you just saw.

714
00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:15.231
You hear that?

715
00:46:15.231 --> 00:46:19.940
That's the steam engine coming back on the fucking racist genocide.

716
00:46:19.941 --> 00:46:20.774
One on one.

717
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:23.623
<v 4>MMM.</v>

718
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:24.781
<v 6>The fuck am I to,
yeah.</v>

719
00:46:24.781 --> 00:46:27.810
Just make yourself eat an apple or just eat a fucking salad.

720
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:32.500
You gotta you gotta turn that.
You got to turn the boat around.
Um,

721
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:33.510
that's what I'm trying to do.

722
00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:35.053
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

723
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:35.671
<v 6>I got to do what?</v>

724
00:46:35.671 --> 00:46:39.750
I fucking went back up to like almost a buck 90 an hour back down to like the

725
00:46:39.751 --> 00:46:42.990
mid one seventies.
I got to,
it's the fucking worst.

726
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:45.660
Just trying to lose like 15 pounds is the fucking worst.

727
00:46:45.661 --> 00:46:50.070
I can't imagine people who got a got to lose more than that.
So,
uh,

728
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:55.330
you know,
I dunno.
I Dunno how this became more of a weight loss podcast.
Um,

729
00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:59.010
but I think it's working though.
This guy actually sent me a letter.
He said,
uh,

730
00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:02.220
podcast success story.
Dear Wilbur,

731
00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:06.900
you sir are a god amongst men.
Ah,
Jesus.
I wish that was true.

732
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:11.610
He goes,
I used to be a depressed piece of shit.
You're a,

733
00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:15.420
your typical,
the world is against me.
Nobody likes me.

734
00:47:15.421 --> 00:47:18.090
Nobody wants me fucking moron.
That's who I was.

735
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:23.360
But your advice on stepping back and making fun of every negative annotation I

736
00:47:23.401 --> 00:47:24.360
have.
Is that a word?

737
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:29.890
Did he write that d type that correctly or am I in boy annotation?

738
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.510
I Dunno not to make you depressed again.
I don't know how to spell.
Um,

739
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:38.530
he goes,
I have fucking changed my life.
I'm 80 pounds lighter.

740
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:42.460
I got a great girl and I've gotten two count them two promotions.

741
00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:45.770
You're a comedian.
You're not obligated to be Oprah Maury,

742
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:47.740
but you're still making a difference.
Thank you,
sir,

743
00:47:47.741 --> 00:47:52.210
for knocking me back into cohesion.
Uh,
you probably make 20 times more than me.

744
00:47:52.211 --> 00:47:56.620
I doubt that Sorority,
the big promotions there.
Um,

745
00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:59.620
but I know,
but I owe you a drink next time I see you.

746
00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:03.670
If you're in Canada or being tamps,
you stay classy,
sir.
Oh,
that's great.

747
00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:07.150
Good for you,
sir.
Look at that.
He turned it around

748
00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:13.510
somehow my negative,
whatever the fuck my shaming,
my fat shame,

749
00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:18.640
my fishing has been working.
Um,

750
00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:23.420
all right,
enough about that shit.
So that's what I'm doing.
I'm drinking the,
I'm,

751
00:48:23.421 --> 00:48:28.000
I'm doing that fat,
sick and nearly dead juicing thing and uh,

752
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:31.060
it's like all green stuff.
It's Kale,
celery,

753
00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:35.200
a couple of handfuls of parsley,
cucumber,
Zucchini,

754
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:39.070
and then alignment to take the bitterness out.
And uh,

755
00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:42.040
I got to tell you it's fucking delicious.
I love it.

756
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.400
And um,
I dunno,

757
00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.670
I think I'm going to incorporate this in every couple of months.

758
00:48:48.671 --> 00:48:49.840
Just go back to that.
Well,

759
00:48:49.841 --> 00:48:54.070
just juice for like four or five days just so I stay out in front of it just so

760
00:48:54.071 --> 00:48:57.790
I don't have to have a sit down one day and have that fucking beach ball.

761
00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:02.140
I got a thing on my button down shirts.
It's the one,
two third button down.

762
00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:06.490
When that button's starts to look like it's doing the iron cross between both

763
00:49:06.491 --> 00:49:10.840
sides of my shit of my shirt.
That's one of my guy.
He fucking jerk off.

764
00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:12.370
All right.

765
00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:15.280
And then what happens is they lay off the beer and then I just start slamming

766
00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:18.190
whiskey.
Like that's my initial when I've,

767
00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:22.510
we've began our initial descent until our dieting is,

768
00:49:22.511 --> 00:49:25.630
I go from drinking Pale Ales to whiskey.

769
00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.510
I really am a freckled mess.

770
00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:28.803
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

771
00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:32.610
<v 7>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

772
00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:36.900
It's bill burr and it is the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

773
00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:41.160
October 12th,
2009 and uh,

774
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:45.570
I am in a fantastic fucking mood.
Ah,
isn't that nice?

775
00:50:45.571 --> 00:50:48.210
Isn't that nice when you run into somebody on a Monday and they were in a great

776
00:50:48.211 --> 00:50:52.530
mood rather than the usual country run into what work.

777
00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:54.690
Hey Jerry,

778
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:56.830
<v 8>Well,
you know the fucking week,</v>

779
00:50:57.550 --> 00:51:01.500
Yo girl filled with beer butoh weaken care.

780
00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:05.180
Believe patriots loves due to food for 12 Rudy.

781
00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:07.150
Rudy most would would open.

782
00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:11.590
<v 7>Shut up.
You think I give a fuck about you?
I was just saying hello.</v>

783
00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:15.220
I was being friendly because we were walking in opposite directions.

784
00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:19.690
Pass each other and our eyes happened to meet.
Huh?
That's all I was saying.

785
00:51:19.691 --> 00:51:21.730
No one gives a fuck about your host.
Stupid Day.

786
00:51:21.731 --> 00:51:26.731
So I'm in an awesome mood and I'm going to tell you why because I've been on the

787
00:51:27.071 --> 00:51:31.570
road for six of the last seven weeks tightening up my act the way bill

788
00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:34.930
Belichick's gonna tighten up that Patriots' defense over the year and we'll

789
00:51:34.931 --> 00:51:39.070
challenge for a fucking title
sometime next year,

790
00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:42.700
but it's still a good thing.
I haven't packed it in yet with the Patriots now.

791
00:51:42.701 --> 00:51:45.580
I've been on the road and I was on the road for the last 10 straight days.

792
00:51:45.581 --> 00:51:49.140
Everybody,
do you have any fucking idea what that's like?
Has any,

793
00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:51.670
you ever gone out there?
You have a gun out to Disney world?

794
00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:53.380
What a fuck do people go for it?

795
00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:58.310
<v 1>10 days.
Oh my God.
I went to Ahca Poco.
It was awesome.
We sat on the beach,</v>

796
00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.880
we were tanning.
We didn't do anything.
We dressed like,
who is,

797
00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:06.440
who was we just like absolutely.
Absolutely,
totally.

798
00:52:06.441 --> 00:52:10.100
100% who is,
we didn't pay for a drink.

799
00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:13.940
I had no pubic hair.
I barely had a bikini bottom on.

800
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:19.150
I had this island guy put corn roads in my hair and I did fucking things that

801
00:52:19.761 --> 00:52:22.040
would explain the cows on my knees,

802
00:52:22.041 --> 00:52:25.730
but I'm not going to because it was in a different country and it doesn't

803
00:52:25.731 --> 00:52:26.630
fucking count.

804
00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:32.500
<v 7>Well,
what I did was look at me with all the fucking energy.
You know what?</v>

805
00:52:32.501 --> 00:52:34.300
I thought I had a meeting this morning at 10 in the morning.

806
00:52:34.301 --> 00:52:37.900
It turns out it was fucking yesterday.
Same clean shaven and I am dressed,

807
00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:43.180
dressed to impress for this fucking podcast.
And,
uh,
anyways,

808
00:52:43.181 --> 00:52:45.640
I've been on the road for the last 10 fucking days.
And,
uh,

809
00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:50.830
I finally got to sleep in my own bed,
saw my girl,
I saw my dog,
you know,

810
00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.980
I came home,
I watch some sports yesterday,

811
00:52:53.981 --> 00:52:57.250
even though fucking Red Sox and the Patriots lost,

812
00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:02.020
you know,
good for the angels,
by the way.
All the people out here in California,

813
00:53:02.021 --> 00:53:03.370
man,
good for you guys.
You know,

814
00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:06.640
I know what it's like when you can never beat a team.
Granted,

815
00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:10.210
I wish you still couldn't beat us,
but I know what the fucking deal is.

816
00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:15.160
I watch to pay a fucking red sox lose to the Yankees for the first 80% of my

817
00:53:15.161 --> 00:53:19.780
life without first 36 years of my life could not beat the sons of bitches.

818
00:53:19.781 --> 00:53:24.650
So,
uh,
congratulations to you.
I hope you'll beat the Yankees and uh,

819
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:28.140
you know,
I really hope you do,
but the fucking Yankees look really good too.

820
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:29.453
They really do.

821
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:33.240
There are $200 million team is just plugging away against that $60 million

822
00:53:33.241 --> 00:53:36.750
fucking Minnesota twins.
That's right.
Check.
Can't some bring it up.

823
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:37.680
But you know why?

824
00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:42.680
Because none of the announcers due to share as having a hell of a bat Jeters

825
00:53:42.691 --> 00:53:46.350
aren't first.
Ah,
Jesus Christ has taken a lead off the third base.

826
00:53:46.351 --> 00:53:48.390
He better watch out.
He's still got that robe on.

827
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:52.290
It's not even fucking competition anymore.
You know?

828
00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:56.250
And I know the red sox are part of the fucking problem,
but Jesus Christ,

829
00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:01.590
Jesus Christ,
really?
Um,
anyways,

830
00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.210
let's plow ahead.
Good luck,
Minnesota.

831
00:54:03.211 --> 00:54:06.990
You really should be up two games to one if you didn't fucking blow it,
you know,

832
00:54:06.991 --> 00:54:10.800
but what do you guys care?
How,
what do you guys care?
You got the mall of America,

833
00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.980
he can go down there and ride the Ferris wheel right across from the stride rite

834
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:16.500
outlet.
Um,
so anyways,
yeah,

835
00:54:16.501 --> 00:54:19.610
I've been on the fucking road for the last 10 days and I swear to God,
um,

836
00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:21.480
I figured it out in the last three weeks.

837
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:26.510
I have done 22 sets of an hour or more and I was,

838
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:31.630
my final night was Saturday night at the Improv in Pittsburgh,
which,
um,

839
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:36.620
is really becoming one of my favorite cities out there.
Uh,
it's just,
uh,

840
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.070
it's just a great sports city.

841
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:40.950
It's one of the greatest views when he calls it the Fort Pitt tunnel.

842
00:54:40.951 --> 00:54:45.180
I don't know what it is.
A,
you always come through the tunnel,
right.
You know,

843
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:48.450
after you drive down the fucking roadway there,
whatever,

844
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:51.030
when I can't come out of the airport and get on the highway,
there we go.

845
00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:52.170
You know,

846
00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:55.290
the only thing that sucks about Pittsburgh as they're really big on having

847
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:59.280
whatever the numbers of lanes are,
when you get on the bridge,

848
00:54:59.281 --> 00:55:03.420
there's one less lane.
They're really into that bottleneck thing.
Um,

849
00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:05.730
three lanes that goes down to two,
four goes down to three.

850
00:55:05.731 --> 00:55:09.510
That type of ship when anyways,
when you go through the tunnel,
when you come out,

851
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:11.560
um,
you think you're just going to be coming,
you know,

852
00:55:11.561 --> 00:55:14.370
up underground like you know,
like the Holland tunnel on the Lincoln tunnel.

853
00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:17.220
When you come into New York City,
feel like a fucking rat.

854
00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:20.360
You just come up and you're right at street level.
But in,

855
00:55:20.361 --> 00:55:22.800
in Pittsburgh you come through like this,
uh,

856
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:26.310
I don't know if it's big enough to say it's a mountain.
It's a fucking hill.

857
00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:29.010
And they dug a tunnel right through it.
And as you come out,

858
00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:32.600
right as you get to the other side,
the whole city is right out in front of you.

859
00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:36.680
This panoramic view of the whole city and look,

860
00:55:36.830 --> 00:55:41.190
you look to the left is Heinz field where the Steelers play and next to it is

861
00:55:41.191 --> 00:55:44.010
that a,
the ballpark where the AAA pirates play,

862
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:49.940
where the Yankees and red sox actually have trained vultures circling the

863
00:55:50.191 --> 00:55:52.500
stadium.
And when anybody hits a triple,

864
00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:56.820
we both dive bomb and to see who can snatch the first.

865
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:03.870
It's a tragedy,
man.
Major League baseball is a fucking tragedy.

866
00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:08.460
You know.
What do you think the red sox are going to do this off season?

867
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:11.340
$120 million.
All we spent last year,
one 25.

868
00:56:11.341 --> 00:56:13.230
You think we're not going to get back up to a buck 80?

869
00:56:13.231 --> 00:56:16.410
Like we usually do better watch out.
Oh,

870
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:20.810
you little fucking teams around the league were coming.
We got our checkbook.
Um,

871
00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:25.080
it's horrible.
Anyways,
plowing ahead.
Um,
yeah,
the whole,

872
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:28.270
they have like all these bridges,
all this great steelwork that,
you know,

873
00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:31.030
people actually live in the town if they didn't die when they were building them

874
00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:32.080
falling off the bridge,

875
00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.300
cause they had to smoke weed because they were afraid of heights but couldn't

876
00:56:34.301 --> 00:56:38.760
admit it because they're a man.
Um,
all those bridges are there.
And uh,

877
00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:42.910
this is nothing about Pittsburgh.
Very,
very,
very underrated delis.

878
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:46.300
Whenever you hear about great like Pastrami,
corned beef or whatever,

879
00:56:46.301 --> 00:56:49.360
you always hear,
you know,
go to a New York,
you know,
New York Deli.
Oh,

880
00:56:49.361 --> 00:56:53.380
I'll make you fucking hero.
But Pittsburgh,

881
00:56:54.130 --> 00:56:57.130
I dunno what's going on out there,
but for some reason they have kept it a,

882
00:56:57.140 --> 00:57:00.220
why doesn't that guy fee area go there?
You know,

883
00:57:00.221 --> 00:57:04.780
and take a big fucking bite out of that shit cause I'm telling you incredible,

884
00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:06.560
incredible.
A Deli meat.

885
00:57:06.590 --> 00:57:10.300
I went to a Cayman a day early and went to the Pittsburgh penguins verse,

886
00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:14.140
the Phoenix Coyotes,
one of the worst hockey games I've ever been to.

887
00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:18.640
They didn't fucking show up cause they were resting cause they had the flyers

888
00:57:18.641 --> 00:57:21.790
the next night.
Let's just go easy.
They're bankrupt.

889
00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:25.060
We'll just let them win tonight.
That's basically the game I went to.

890
00:57:25.061 --> 00:57:28.750
But it was fun to go to the old thing.
So,
uh,
I'm just babbling.

891
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:32.650
I'm babbling like a fucking fat chick who just got an engagement rank,
you know,

892
00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:35.950
that's what's going on here.
That was really mean and uncalled for.

893
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:42.310
Um,
so anyways,
this is what I have to talk.

894
00:57:42.311 --> 00:57:43.360
Do you know what I want to do this week?

895
00:57:43.361 --> 00:57:47.260
I want to take some time out to talk to you guys about what it's like to fly

896
00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:51.130
from fucking Pittsburgh to Los Angeles.
Basically,

897
00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:54.490
there's one show in town and the show's name is us air.

898
00:57:55.210 --> 00:58:00.180
And um,
I went in,
I mean,
you are,
Sarah is,

899
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:03.420
it's a fucking rinky dink.
Caroline.
Who's kidding?
Who,
you know what I mean?

900
00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:05.153
<v 9>Okay.</v>

901
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:10.010
<v 7>Like if they,
if they were in baseball,
they would be like the pod race,
you know,</v>

902
00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:13.450
no friends to,
you know what I mean?
That in an offensive way.

903
00:58:13.451 --> 00:58:17.680
There's no comedy clubs in San Diego.
W what am I really hurting?
You know?

904
00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:22.960
Um,
this is what I did.
I show up and I go to check in,
um,

905
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:27.670
and I'm bringing my bag along and uh,
I'm checking a bag.
Basically,

906
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:31.120
you know how much they want for first checked bag.
Go ahead.
I'll wait.

907
00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:36.370
Take a guess.
What'd you say?
15 [inaudible] higher.
2020.

908
00:58:36.371 --> 00:58:39.430
You say their guy in the back even more.

909
00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:43.960
25 bucks for the first bag checked.

910
00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.150
Now do they bring that up?

911
00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:49.140
Is that anywhere on the Internet as you're going to make your fucking die?

912
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:50.980
I didn't,
I don't know who do I know I fucking,

913
00:58:51.730 --> 00:58:55.270
I call my travel edge at all I know is they don't fucking bring it up until you

914
00:58:55.271 --> 00:58:58.000
get to the airport and then you go to give it to the bag and then they go,

915
00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:01.840
that'll be $25 and they got you.
They got ya.

916
00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:03.370
It's a total fucking shakedown.

917
00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:06.880
And that's the exact song that went through my head cause I was thinking,

918
00:59:06.881 --> 00:59:10.170
why don't you just make this part of the ticket?
You know,

919
00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:13.420
it's kind of like 1995 plus shipping and handling.

920
00:59:13.421 --> 00:59:17.890
So you don't see that it really costs like 27 bucks.
Then you'd be 27 bucks.

921
00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:23.150
That's not worth that onion chopper thing.
If there's a one in the beginning,

922
00:59:23.151 --> 00:59:25.700
I'll definitely fucking buy it.
Right?
That's what they're doing to me.

923
00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:30.410
And I'm tired of it.
Total fucking shake down those fucking cops.

924
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:34.460
And I say to Lego,
you gotta be kidding me.
It's 25 bucks for the first thing.

925
00:59:34.461 --> 00:59:38.600
She goes,
yeah,
I know,
I know.
She goes,
well it's only 20 if,

926
00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:42.050
if you go on the Internet.
And it's like,
yeah,

927
00:59:42.051 --> 00:59:46.760
and then you don't have a job.
And she goes,
I know I go,

928
00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:49.340
so why would you tell me that?
She goes,
to be honest with you,

929
00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.490
the people above us say,
we have to tell people that.

930
00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:58.670
All right.
And we also have to suggest that they use the automated machines.

931
00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.490
And I go,
that's unbelievable.
She goes,
yeah,
and you know what?

932
01:00:01.491 --> 01:00:05.060
The people above us get a commission for the amount of people who use the

933
01:00:05.061 --> 01:00:07.280
automated machines and we don't get anything.

934
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:09.230
Do you realize how fucked up that is?

935
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:12.500
All you fucking people who argue with me about those automated machines,

936
01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:15.170
do you see what they're doing?
They're pitting us against each other.

937
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:19.190
People's bad financial positions.
That lady behind the counter,

938
01:00:19.191 --> 01:00:20.360
she wants to keep her job.

939
01:00:20.361 --> 01:00:24.500
So she literally has to teach people how to phase her out of a fucking job.

940
01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:26.483
<v 0>You know?</v>

941
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.520
<v 7>I Dunno.
The whole time I was in now all I here,</v>

942
01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.100
I kept hearing the Unilad ACDC song,
shakedown,

943
01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:37.250
nervous shake down off of a flick of the switch.
You know how it goes.

944
01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:40.950
You don't,
you don't know how.
You don't know how it goes.

945
01:00:40.951 --> 01:00:43.860
You guys weren't fans of that shit.
Here it is.
Here it is right here.

946
01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:52.320
Yeah,
it's $25 for the first bag.
Yeah.

947
01:00:52.321 --> 01:00:54.960
We didn't tell you because we knew you wouldn't pick this fucking airline.

948
01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:00.790
That's all I heard in my head.

949
01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.450
Then I'm on the fucking flight and this old lady goes,
oh,
I'm a little chilly,

950
01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.720
sweet little old lady.
Right?
Could I have a blanket in the law?

951
01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:10.840
And the stewardess said,
that'll be $7

952
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:15.833
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

953
01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:16.890
<v 7>that's what they should have.</v>

954
01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:19.570
That's the song that they should have had this second phase,

955
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:22.960
close the cabin door.
It's fucking brutal.

956
01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:26.700
$7 $7 for a blanket.
Everybody on us here.

957
01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:31.240
But then somebody told me that's actually because of the swine flu because of

958
01:01:31.241 --> 01:01:33.190
the swine flu.
And I was like,
wait a minute now,

959
01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:36.790
didn't we put small pox in blankets and give them to the Indians?

960
01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:38.733
<v 0>You know?</v>

961
01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:44.290
<v 7>So maybe there was something.
I don't know.
I vaguely remember reading that,</v>

962
01:01:44.291 --> 01:01:48.460
that you can wipe out a whole group of people if they're,
if they're cold,

963
01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:50.770
it's very easy to do.
You just put,

964
01:01:50.771 --> 01:01:55.630
you just sneeze on some blankets and you hand it to them and then they start

965
01:01:55.631 --> 01:01:56.770
dropping like flies.

966
01:01:56.830 --> 01:02:01.830
And the ones that survive run a Casino Ronit Casino when they cry about litter.

967
01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:07.150
So see,
there you go.
People.
Okay,
now it gets worse.
So I'm on this fucking plane,

968
01:02:07.151 --> 01:02:08.500
right?
Is 25 bucks.

969
01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:11.003
<v 0>MMM.</v>

970
01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:13.780
<v 7>25 bucks for the first bag.
$7 for a blanket.</v>

971
01:02:13.781 --> 01:02:16.270
The people in my row was saying that there's a rumor they're actually going to

972
01:02:16.271 --> 01:02:19.770
start charging for the bathroom,
which I think is bullshit.
There's fucking way.

973
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:25.590
We're not to that point.
Are We?
Um,
and then when we go to land,

974
01:02:25.591 --> 01:02:28.380
this is the greatest fucking thing ever.
I go to land,
I'm like,
thank God,

975
01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:31.950
thank God I have made it.
I am back here in La.

976
01:02:31.951 --> 01:02:35.010
I'm going to sleep in my own bed and we see my baby and we see my dog.

977
01:02:35.011 --> 01:02:36.030
Everything's going to be gray.

978
01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:41.430
I fucking standard down their foot waiting for the bag that I paid $25 for.

979
01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.120
That should come out of the fucking thing on its own little pillow for that

980
01:02:45.121 --> 01:02:49.680
amount of money.
Right.
I had to wait half hour for my bag.

981
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:52.890
Still nothing.
No one,
not Smith from anybody,
nothing.

982
01:02:52.890 --> 01:02:56.010
So I finally walk into the thing and I'm like,
excuse me,

983
01:02:56.011 --> 01:02:57.900
do you know what's going on here?
She goes,
yeah,

984
01:02:57.901 --> 01:03:01.890
we kind of Sunday we kind of have like a skeleton crew.
So I make a joke,

985
01:03:01.891 --> 01:03:05.130
what do you got?
Like one guy on loading the plane,
she goes,
yeah,

986
01:03:05.131 --> 01:03:06.810
one guy for 200 bags,
you know,

987
01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.080
and I don't flip out at those people behind the counter because I know that

988
01:03:10.081 --> 01:03:13.560
their job is to basically sit there and get yelled at by people who don't

989
01:03:13.561 --> 01:03:17.730
understand that they don't make the fucking policy.
Right.
So I leave,
alright,

990
01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:20.640
half hour in,
another 20 minutes goes by,

991
01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:23.670
I'm standing there for almost a fucking hour,
no bag,

992
01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.740
and everybody stand around like zombies.

993
01:03:25.741 --> 01:03:29.880
Occasionally somebody would be fucking walking in there.
And,
uh,

994
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:33.480
I finally walked in there and I was just like,
all right,
um,

995
01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.430
I know you don't have anything to do with this policy,

996
01:03:35.431 --> 01:03:40.431
but do you have a form that I can fill out so I can ask for my $25 back please?

997
01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:46.020
And Lily's like,
um,
no,
there's no form for that.
I have a number here.

998
01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:49.830
And I go,
how many people do you have working right now on a Sunday?

999
01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:54.810
And she's like,
I don't know.
I don't have access to that information.

1000
01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:57.780
Um,
do you do this every Sunday?

1001
01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:01.920
Just so I know in the future when I go to travel that I won't fly us Aaron on a

1002
01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:06.450
Sunday.
Do you know,
do you do this every Sunday?
Yeah.
I don't know.

1003
01:04:06.451 --> 01:04:11.220
I don't usually work Sundays.
Do you know what's going on with the bag?

1004
01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:15.030
Yeah.
I don't know how to contact the people.

1005
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:16.710
Every fucking thing I asked her,

1006
01:04:16.711 --> 01:04:19.200
she couldn't give me a fucking answer and I was like,

1007
01:04:19.201 --> 01:04:21.510
do you think this is a smart way to run a business?

1008
01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:27.120
I mean I don't have a problem working.
Yeah.

1009
01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:32.730
Fucking morons.
So I go just gimme gimme gimme I'm becoming that person.

1010
01:04:32.731 --> 01:04:35.640
I fucking complain all the time.
Right.
Um,
I'm gonna,
I got the thing,

1011
01:04:35.641 --> 01:04:38.810
I'm going to get my $25 back.
I got to figure out how to do it.

1012
01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:41.340
I don't think I'm going to be able to do it via email.

1013
01:04:41.341 --> 01:04:45.570
I think I need to get on the phone and I go,
I want money back.
I'm sorry sir.

1014
01:04:45.571 --> 01:04:48.450
We don't ask for refunds.
I'm sorry.
I know you're sorry.

1015
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.750
You guys are always sorry,
but none of you guys can fucking help.
All right.

1016
01:04:51.751 --> 01:04:54.450
I can't curse.
So I realized you're sorry.
I'm sorry to,

1017
01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:56.790
is there someone above you that I can speak to?
Well,

1018
01:04:56.791 --> 01:05:00.150
I would like to speak to them and just keep going up and up and up and become

1019
01:05:00.151 --> 01:05:01.200
such a pain in the ass.

1020
01:05:01.201 --> 01:05:03.990
And the key is you don't curse because if you don't curse,

1021
01:05:03.991 --> 01:05:05.070
they can't hang up on you.

1022
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:07.583
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

1023
01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:09.730
<v 7>Well my buddies had a great fucking line the other day.</v>

1024
01:05:09.731 --> 01:05:12.640
He was on one of these 1-800-NUMBERS and he was,

1025
01:05:12.641 --> 01:05:14.450
and he was having the same problem.
He goes,
yeah,
I,

1026
01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.220
I want a refund and I'm sorry we don't refunds.
Um,

1027
01:05:18.221 --> 01:05:19.870
is there anything else I can help you with?

1028
01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.490
[inaudible] anything else you can help me with?

1029
01:05:22.491 --> 01:05:24.680
You haven't helped me with anything yet.
You fucking Twat.

1030
01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:29.600
And of course she hangs up cause he said the f and the t word.
Um,

1031
01:05:29.601 --> 01:05:33.570
so anyways,
uh,
I don't even know what I'm talking about right now.

1032
01:05:33.571 --> 01:05:36.480
I think the only fucking way to get back at these corporations is you have to be

1033
01:05:36.481 --> 01:05:38.820
like those little old ladies who just won't go away.

1034
01:05:38.821 --> 01:05:41.670
And you really just have to complain and just say that it's completely

1035
01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:43.080
unacceptable.
I mean,
what the fuck?

1036
01:05:43.081 --> 01:05:47.040
Kind of an airline doesn't have enough guys to unload their fucking airplane.

1037
01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.950
You know,
I love too is such a jam packed fucking airplane.

1038
01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:53.490
And I know it's a tough time.
I didn't know they're probably even losing money,

1039
01:05:53.491 --> 01:05:57.090
but those fucking assholes at the top are still make it just as much money,

1040
01:05:57.390 --> 01:06:00.630
just as much money as they were.
A guarantee at those fucking CEO,

1041
01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:04.950
CEO douchebags never take any,
they never take a fucking pay cut.

1042
01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:08.190
They got me standing down there for an extra fucking hour.

1043
01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:13.380
Did I say I was in a good mood this week?
I actually am in a good mood,

1044
01:06:13.381 --> 01:06:14.214
but um,

1045
01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:17.610
I'm more pissed off at the fucking people who challenged me on those automated

1046
01:06:17.611 --> 01:06:18.301
things and all that.

1047
01:06:18.301 --> 01:06:22.410
You don't even realize you're leading yourself and the rest of us down this

1048
01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:24.570
fucking path and that's what it's going to be in the future.

1049
01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:28.140
There's going to be nobody there and there's going to be one robocop and if the

1050
01:06:28.141 --> 01:06:29.460
second you start complaining,

1051
01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:33.150
they're going to somehow connect the dots with you when the al Qaeda and you're

1052
01:06:33.151 --> 01:06:36.090
going to get shot.
All right?
Maybe that's,

1053
01:06:36.091 --> 01:06:38.490
maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration,
but you know what I mean.

1054
01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:43.410
Whatever happened to the customer is always right.
Fucking old lady next to me.

1055
01:06:43.411 --> 01:06:45.750
She was,
she put newspaper on her legs.

1056
01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:50.840
I don't fucking know what,
what,
what are you going to do?
All right,
let's,

1057
01:06:50.850 --> 01:06:54.720
let's move on with the podcast.
And if you like that song,
nervous shakedown,

1058
01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:58.790
which I don't know why you wouldn't,
you know,
why wouldn't you like that?

1059
01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:03.710
Why does that sound good?
Dat,
Dat,

1060
01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:08.910
Dat,
Dat,
Dat,
dat,
dat about Abu.
Um,
all right,

1061
01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:11.940
let's get on with the podcast.
So if you knew my podcast,
um,

1062
01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:15.000
most times I'm in a country mood and sometimes I say I'm in a good mood and I

1063
01:07:15.001 --> 01:07:19.770
still sound a little bit cunty.
Um,
last week a lot of people really enjoyed,
um,

1064
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:24.950
when Joe de Rosa was a guest hosting cohosting was being,

1065
01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.790
uh,
Joe McMahon and uh,

1066
01:07:26.791 --> 01:07:31.791
we got a big debate over what was less healthy doughnuts or pancakes and a,

1067
01:07:32.071 --> 01:07:37.071
I was on the pancake side and everybody seemed to agree with me and one person

1068
01:07:37.111 --> 01:07:42.090
actually sent me a little linked to show how donuts are made after they make the

1069
01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:42.930
dough and all that.

1070
01:07:42.931 --> 01:07:47.010
Evidently they fucking deep fry them for like seven days before they even add

1071
01:07:47.490 --> 01:07:49.330
the jelly and the,
and the,

1072
01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:52.740
and the guru and the coconut and the crap that they put on them.

1073
01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:58.100
And fucking Joe to Rosa is trying to tell me that Bisquick some eggs and some

1074
01:07:58.531 --> 01:08:01.860
butter and a little bit of Syrup is,
is,
is,
is worse than that.

1075
01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:07.410
I don't know the Syrup Mai Tai.
It's,
it's,
it's damn close.
In order to like,

1076
01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:12.600
this is what it's like pancakes or the red sox and donuts at the Yankees.

1077
01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:17.090
You know,
it's basically the difference.
Probably 180 million and 200 million.

1078
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:23.420
Um,
oh look at that.
I got an email from the ACDC official store.
I'm 41.

1079
01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:29.040
Let's see what they have to say.
Oh,
they have a limited edition ACDC tee shirt.

1080
01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.940
That's actually fucking cool.

1081
01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:36.941
They wrote ACDC on like a Marshall amp preorder the ACDC backtracks two CD.

1082
01:08:40.570 --> 01:08:42.170
Oh Wow.
They're getting fucking old.

1083
01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.570
Remember they used to say that they never fucking release shit.

1084
01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.450
Rerelease material.
They don't like doing it.

1085
01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:52.280
The ACDC backtracks amplifier tee shirt.

1086
01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:54.471
What is going on?

1087
01:08:54.471 --> 01:08:57.230
Let me get back to the podcast and I'm fucking look at this later.
All right.

1088
01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:58.280
We've got a lot of shit to get to.

1089
01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:02.370
Cause last week I shot the shit with Joe to Rosa and,
um,

1090
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:06.080
I didn't get a chance to answer a lot of questions or whatever.

1091
01:09:06.081 --> 01:09:08.240
One of one of the people actually had a great solution.

1092
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:11.690
Remember last member a couple of weeks ago on a,
on,
I read that,
um,

1093
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:18.130
I read that story where that that guy was flicking the ear of the boyfriend of

1094
01:09:19.071 --> 01:09:22.670
a,
of a sister,
you know,
and they were a little drunk.

1095
01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:26.450
They would come from the cubs game.
I'll do a little recap here.
And the,
the,

1096
01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:31.150
the boyfriend was driving,
telling the dude to stop and he kept fucking doing it.

1097
01:09:31.151 --> 01:09:33.980
And then the kid just snapped and he turned around and punched him in the face

1098
01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:39.590
and knocked his teeth out.
So the brother of the sister,

1099
01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:45.290
um,
says,
now I have to kick the shit out of that kid and it has to happen.

1100
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:49.790
The kids been ducking me and I know I'm going to do it,
but,
um,

1101
01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:54.200
I just need you to help me explain it to my sister,
why it has to happen.

1102
01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:58.820
So I offered a,
Oh yeah,
that was last week.
That was last week.
See,

1103
01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.790
10 days on the road,
you don't even know when the fuck it was.
It was last week.

1104
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.230
So me and Joe de Rosa tried to give this guy some solutions and I hope he's

1105
01:10:06.231 --> 01:10:09.590
still listening this week and he didn't get pissed off.
But,
uh,

1106
01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:13.340
this guy has got a great ear flick solution.
All right.
He says,
Bill,

1107
01:10:13.341 --> 01:10:16.850
I have a great way to resolve the fight between the two friends in the last

1108
01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:21.650
week's podcast.
Two words,
flare,
chop.
All right.

1109
01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:22.310
For all your rent,

1110
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:26.360
raw wrestling fans out there are originated by the nature boy ric flair.

1111
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:27.470
You simply,

1112
01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:31.700
you simply wind up and backhand the person in the chest.

1113
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:38.510
My cousin,
brother,
and I use it to resolve all arguments between us.

1114
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:41.690
The reason it's effective is that hurts like a bitch,

1115
01:10:41.691 --> 01:10:45.260
but only for a short period of time.
It's hilarious for all that.

1116
01:10:45.261 --> 01:10:48.830
Watch it and leaves the raised imprint on the person's chest.

1117
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:52.430
After you flare chop someone all malcontent melts away.

1118
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:57.530
I think that's a fucking hilarious,
hilarious idea.
So all you gotta do,

1119
01:10:57.531 --> 01:11:02.510
explain to your sister what the flare chop is.
And,

1120
01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:06.650
uh,
I think that's perfect because it's not going to be anything permanent.

1121
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:11.360
I think it's going to get away.
A lot of anger is going to get out.
You can,

1122
01:11:11.361 --> 01:11:15.690
you guys can start over and uh,
cause whose kitten heel?
You know,

1123
01:11:15.691 --> 01:11:18.030
I'd rather have my ear flicked and get my tooth knocked out,

1124
01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:19.830
but you were kind of being a cunt.

1125
01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:23.190
So this is a great way to resolve it and it's fucking hilarious.

1126
01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:27.120
Maybe you can turn it into a funny youtube video and I'll probably get a lot of

1127
01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:31.440
hits.
So my hat is off to that wonderful fucking solution.

1128
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:33.720
They should give you one of those judge shows.

1129
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:37.920
I think you really got a really got a knack for it to flare.

1130
01:11:37.921 --> 01:11:42.630
Chop the nature boy ric flair.
All right,
here's something else.

1131
01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:46.240
Somebody sent me this week and um,
I dunno,

1132
01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:49.230
I didn't really fit into the advice.
It didn't really fit into questions,

1133
01:11:49.231 --> 01:11:53.640
but I thought it was a great point.
So this is kind of an op ed piece.
Um,

1134
01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:56.070
all right.
It says,
dear bill,
this past week,

1135
01:11:56.100 --> 01:12:00.540
I attended game one of the series between the Dodgers and the cardinals.
Uh,

1136
01:12:00.541 --> 01:12:04.890
before the game started there was of course the national anthem.
They Gab,

1137
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:08.910
they gathered,
uh,
let me move this closer to my eyeballs so I can read this.

1138
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:14.030
They gathered probably 50 to 75 or so sailors from the u s navy locally based

1139
01:12:14.911 --> 01:12:17.940
and they hurled out this huge flag.
Um,

1140
01:12:17.941 --> 01:12:22.410
fast forward to about the fifth inning when they are doing the cheesy jumbo tron

1141
01:12:22.411 --> 01:12:27.000
spotlight and they put the troops up on the screen,
everyone in the stadium,

1142
01:12:27.001 --> 01:12:28.290
cheers and applauds.

1143
01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:32.430
That's when I noticed that they had these navy guy where they had these navy

1144
01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:36.870
guys seated.
They were seated in the very top section in the nosebleeds.

1145
01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:38.670
This is just bullshit to me.

1146
01:12:38.850 --> 01:12:42.090
We say we love our troops and they had the greatest citizens yet we can't afford

1147
01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:47.091
to upgrade them to at least the outfield or even the second level fuck the MLB

1148
01:12:47.371 --> 01:12:51.060
for using the troops as a way to show their corporate patriotism and then

1149
01:12:51.061 --> 01:12:53.170
sticking them at the very top of the state.

1150
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:58.350
Is it really that much to ask for an organization such as the MLB or the
Dodgers?

1151
01:12:58.530 --> 01:12:59.070
Who am I?

1152
01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:03.390
Who am whomever the decision is up to to lose just a little bit of money.

1153
01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:07.920
Um,
on some seats.
The right field bleachers were not even sold out.

1154
01:13:07.921 --> 01:13:12.240
Fucking ungrateful,
fake patriotic cuts.
Um,

1155
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:14.520
I don't know about you guys,
but I thought he made some great points there.

1156
01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:17.070
I've seen that a lot of times they do.

1157
01:13:17.071 --> 01:13:20.640
Whenever there's a large group of people be at the troops or some inner city

1158
01:13:20.641 --> 01:13:22.920
kids,
the,
you know,

1159
01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:27.870
they always fucking stick them all the way up at the top of the stadium.
Uh,

1160
01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:31.200
you know,
that's,
that's capitalism for you.
You would think though,

1161
01:13:31.201 --> 01:13:35.340
you know what I mean?
You would think with the troops,
the least they could do.

1162
01:13:35.470 --> 01:13:38.160
Yeah.
Stick them on the,
there it's stick them on the mezzanine level.

1163
01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:42.790
You know what I mean?
I may look a team like the Yankees.
I mean those,

1164
01:13:42.791 --> 01:13:46.240
those seats around,
who's kidding,
who those things are like 1500 a whack.

1165
01:13:46.241 --> 01:13:50.320
There's no fucking way you could do that.
Um,
so yeah,

1166
01:13:50.321 --> 01:13:52.600
stick them on the middle level.
I think that's decent,
right?

1167
01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:56.710
A lot of this shit around the uh,
around home plate.

1168
01:13:56.711 --> 01:13:58.090
Those are season tickets.

1169
01:13:59.450 --> 01:13:59.900
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1170
01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:00.621
<v 7>Maybe they could do that.</v>

1171
01:14:00.621 --> 01:14:03.500
They could actually have those corporate cons and some of those rich bastards

1172
01:14:03.501 --> 01:14:05.930
who have season tickets give away their tickets for one night.

1173
01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:07.760
Maybe they do a nice little switch.

1174
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:11.590
That'd be a great little thing as a thank you.
You know,
they switched seats,

1175
01:14:11.591 --> 01:14:14.560
they let him sit down there and then the corporate guys could pat themselves on

1176
01:14:14.561 --> 01:14:18.340
the back of what great people they are as they fucking trudge their way up to

1177
01:14:18.341 --> 01:14:22.960
the top and look down on all of us the way they've always wanted to.
All right,

1178
01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:27.720
now let's move on to the next section.
This is getting really choppy.

1179
01:14:27.721 --> 01:14:31.380
I'm trying to think of anything interesting happening.
Anything interesting.

1180
01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:33.540
That's something me and my girlfriend always talk about.

1181
01:14:33.541 --> 01:14:36.300
You remember that bugs bunny cartoon where a,

1182
01:14:36.301 --> 01:14:39.330
you know the monster that actually had arms but you couldn't see him.

1183
01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.450
He wore the chuck Taylor high tops.
He was all brown and all the hair.

1184
01:14:42.970 --> 01:14:45.690
And you remember that time when bugs bunny just sat him down and started doing

1185
01:14:45.691 --> 01:14:49.560
his nails and doing his hair going month.
There's such interesting,

1186
01:14:49.561 --> 01:14:53.660
people must be so interested in Gbm onstar.
Do you remember that?
Um,

1187
01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:56.940
do you know?
I didn't think so.
All right.
What happened?

1188
01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:01.020
This I just lost all momentum.
I was doing so fucking well,
I don't give a shit.

1189
01:15:01.021 --> 01:15:04.560
I'm psyched to be home.
I'm really psyched to be home.
And if you have a pit bull,

1190
01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.370
you really have to watch out for their head because it's like a fucking bowling

1191
01:15:08.371 --> 01:15:10.920
ball.
And when they get excited,
they swing that thing around.

1192
01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:15.060
It's going to catch in your chops,
it's going to hit you in the throat and a,

1193
01:15:15.061 --> 01:15:17.130
you're gonna have to lay on the ground for a minute and then they're going to

1194
01:15:17.131 --> 01:15:22.131
come up with that paintbrush sized fucking tongue and practically drown you with

1195
01:15:22.621 --> 01:15:26.280
it.
So,
um,
if you're thinking about getting,

1196
01:15:26.281 --> 01:15:29.280
getting a pit bull when you come home after not seeing it for 10 days,

1197
01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:32.660
you really,
you gotta Kinda,
I,

1198
01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:37.710
I come from behind and what I do is I make sure I have my head away from its

1199
01:15:38.321 --> 01:15:41.890
head.
Even if you get it to the side,
it's like a fucking alligator.

1200
01:15:41.891 --> 01:15:42.910
Just swings it around.

1201
01:15:44.370 --> 01:15:45.203
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1202
01:15:46.210 --> 01:15:48.070
<v 7>I Dunno.
Things a maniac.</v>

1203
01:15:49.090 --> 01:15:49.923
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1204
01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:53.180
<v 7>All right,
let's go.
Okay.
Interpreting dreams.
Um,</v>

1205
01:15:53.210 --> 01:15:55.820
this is like a new segment that I thought it was going to be great and it never

1206
01:15:55.821 --> 01:15:59.930
really took off.
Uh,
here's a dream that somebody has.
Okay.
Bill,

1207
01:15:59.931 --> 01:16:04.000
last night I dreamt that there,
oh,

1208
01:16:04.001 --> 01:16:07.210
last night I had a dream that was so damn weird on so many levels.

1209
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:11.350
Basically I was back in the early eighties.
I was born in 1990.

1210
01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:17.140
Okay,
so he's born in 1990 for yet,
for some reason he's in the 1980s.
I mean,

1211
01:16:17.170 --> 01:16:19.390
I might need some help on this one.
Um,
and there were,

1212
01:16:19.930 --> 01:16:23.650
they were gangs all around where I used to live in Reno,
Nevada.

1213
01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:27.970
It was almost exactly like that movie,
the warriors.
But I'd never in my life

1214
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:32.000
till today seen that movie.

1215
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:36.470
I didn't really think much of it till I watched a movie this morning and I swear

1216
01:16:36.471 --> 01:16:39.020
to fucking God that was so similar to the dream I had.

1217
01:16:39.021 --> 01:16:43.580
It weirded me out to the point that I'm pretty sure I just failed a biology test

1218
01:16:43.581 --> 01:16:46.970
today at school because all I could think about was the damn dream.

1219
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:51.450
Just the fact that I basically dream something that had already been created and

1220
01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:55.370
then I had just heard they are making a remake is pretty fucking strange.

1221
01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.233
Any thoughts?

1222
01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:58.353
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1223
01:16:58.490 --> 01:16:59.060
<v 7>Um,
yeah,</v>

1224
01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:04.040
I think you've been working out and you really want to wear a vest with no shirt

1225
01:17:04.041 --> 01:17:05.770
underneath it and a,

1226
01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:10.610
you just grew up in a generation where that's unacceptable on all fucking

1227
01:17:10.611 --> 01:17:14.660
levels,
even during Halloween.
So,
uh,

1228
01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:19.700
in your dream you were wishing that you were born during a time when a way you

1229
01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:23.450
could,
where you could wear a fucking leather vest without a shirt underneath it.

1230
01:17:24.710 --> 01:17:29.600
You know,
maybe join a gang,
maybe sing some doo-wop around a burning trashcan.

1231
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:33.770
I think that's what your dream meant.
It means that,
you know what I think it is.

1232
01:17:33.771 --> 01:17:38.720
You were born in 1990.
I bet in your past life you are actually a member of a,

1233
01:17:38.721 --> 01:17:41.090
of a,
of a gang,
you know,

1234
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:46.100
as opposed to some regular kid who just goes to college out in fucking Reno and

1235
01:17:46.101 --> 01:17:50.330
is bored shitless with his life.
Right.
So he jerks off to porn on the Internet.

1236
01:17:50.331 --> 01:17:52.670
Isn't any,
any of this,
you know,

1237
01:17:52.671 --> 01:17:55.120
I'm going to do is I'm going to parachute out of this fucking business.

1238
01:17:55.230 --> 01:17:57.530
This is where I'm going to do right now.
Okay?
I'm going to fucking,

1239
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:59.480
I'm going to do one of those.
What are those?
What are those?

1240
01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:03.800
What are those fucking chicks who look like men who tell your future?
You know,

1241
01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:08.210
they get the little snow globe in front of them where they take the dandruff out

1242
01:18:08.211 --> 01:18:11.240
of it and then all of a sudden they can see your future.
This is what they do.

1243
01:18:11.241 --> 01:18:15.350
They get a little,
they get a little information about you and uh,

1244
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:18.650
next thing you know,
they just start piecing some shit together.
There you go.

1245
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:21.620
I should put on some gypsy scarf right now.
That's right.

1246
01:18:21.621 --> 01:18:26.000
In your past life you were the member of a gang and uh,

1247
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:32.150
you know,
you've got,
you've got fucking stabbed to death and uh,
he had plans,

1248
01:18:32.151 --> 01:18:33.950
he had plans to bring all the gangs together.

1249
01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:35.450
That's what the fuck you wanted to do.

1250
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:39.770
And you're the guy who got shot by fucking Cyrus.
Was that his name?

1251
01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:40.970
That's what it is.

1252
01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.950
You wish you were born in a different era as opposed to now where you live this

1253
01:18:45.951 --> 01:18:49.280
very safe life.
You want to be a road warrior and you can't,

1254
01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:51.741
what's the matter?

1255
01:18:51.741 --> 01:18:54.560
Was there some girl you wanted to talk to but you didn't have the balls to,

1256
01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:58.650
you know,
so when your dreams,
you're trying to become like this hard ass,

1257
01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:01.430
I guess you weren't in a drain.
You weren't in a gang and your dream,

1258
01:19:01.450 --> 01:19:06.080
I don't fucking know.
I Dunno.
Send me more dreams.
I'll get better at it.

1259
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:11.810
You know what?
Maybe why.
That's why that segment didn't take off.
All right,

1260
01:19:11.811 --> 01:19:14.030
let's get back to something a little more proven.
This is like,

1261
01:19:14.210 --> 01:19:16.820
don't stand up right now.
That was like a new bit.
It bombed.

1262
01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:20.780
And I'm going to go to a proven joke that I've told 600 times and make it sound

1263
01:19:20.781 --> 01:19:25.310
brand new.
All right,
here we go.
Advice Bill.
Uh,

1264
01:19:25.311 --> 01:19:29.330
I recently got dumped by my girlfriend,
um,
through behaving like an idiot.

1265
01:19:29.690 --> 01:19:30.950
To be honest in her shoes.

1266
01:19:30.951 --> 01:19:33.680
I would have done the same thing with the difference that I would have given.

1267
01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.790
I would have given me a second chance for the record.
No,
I didn't cheat on her.

1268
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:42.710
Instead,
I found myself getting quite broody.
I think that means depressed,

1269
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:46.130
uh,
with all the heaviness that goes with that.
Um,

1270
01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:49.220
who knew that that can happen to men too?
I certainly didn't.

1271
01:19:51.710 --> 01:19:55.700
What does broody mean?
What does it mean to be brooding?

1272
01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:59.690
Isn't that what's his face did and rumble fish,
Matt Dillon.

1273
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:03.560
Isn't that how he got out?
He got all his,
his,
uh,
his acting work.

1274
01:20:03.561 --> 01:20:07.950
They used to always say he had the,
the brooding good looks.
So what happened?

1275
01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.310
You'd be in the apartment with your girlfriend,

1276
01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:15.180
she'd be trying to talk to you and you'd be leaned up against one wall.
You know,

1277
01:20:15.181 --> 01:20:19.560
one foot on the floor of the other one up against the wall and she'd be like,

1278
01:20:19.561 --> 01:20:23.370
what do you want for breakfast?
And then just sort of look,
you know,

1279
01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:28.320
he looked to the sat,
I don't know,
just doesn't feel right.

1280
01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:33.060
Did you have a cigarette pack rolled up in your tee shirt?

1281
01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:37.980
What the fuck is broody?
I don't know what that is.
Anyway,
see,
uh,
she goes,
um,

1282
01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:39.240
he goes,
I believe

1283
01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:44.610
I'm through that madness now and yet while I was only with her for about three

1284
01:20:44.611 --> 01:20:48.720
months,
I miss her companionship terribly.
I think he means he was depressed.

1285
01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:51.630
Anyways,
he goes,
I sent her some flowers to say I was sorry,

1286
01:20:51.631 --> 01:20:54.000
but she says she doesn't want to see or talk with me,

1287
01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.870
although she says she will contact me in the future when some other,

1288
01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:00.930
other heavy shit she's going through right now is over.

1289
01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.600
Um,
I feel I owe the situation one last roll of the dice at the very least.

1290
01:21:06.601 --> 01:21:10.530
Do you have any suggestions?
Yeah.
You guys need to not be near each other.

1291
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:14.640
All right.
First of all,
if you want her to call you back,
don't call her,

1292
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:16.380
all right?

1293
01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:19.980
Because you're going to sound even more brooding is you're standing there crying

1294
01:21:19.981 --> 01:21:22.800
with a bouquet of flowers or whatever,
whatever the fuck you going through.

1295
01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:24.090
And then this whole thing was,

1296
01:21:24.091 --> 01:21:28.530
she says she'll contact you in the future when some heavy shit she's going

1297
01:21:28.531 --> 01:21:32.520
through right now is over with.
You know,
I'm thinking of that movie.

1298
01:21:32.521 --> 01:21:37.170
Barfly you guys both like alcoholics.
What does the heavy shit,

1299
01:21:37.171 --> 01:21:40.710
she's got to get through the fucking 12 pound meat hammer.

1300
01:21:40.711 --> 01:21:44.610
She's going to be riding tonight.
I'm not trying to be a dick,
but,
um,

1301
01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:48.540
look,
well,
you got to do right now,
okay?

1302
01:21:48.541 --> 01:21:51.150
If you're out there Bruning and you're all depressed,

1303
01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:54.000
you're probably not coming across as someone she wants to mate with.

1304
01:21:54.150 --> 01:21:57.210
Who's going to bring her some strong offspring,
okay?

1305
01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.040
To get all discovery channel on you.

1306
01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:01.590
So what you gotta do is you've got to show her that you're a man.

1307
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:04.530
So what you gotta do is just let her go.
All right?

1308
01:22:05.190 --> 01:22:09.510
It start going to the fucking gym.
All right?
Getting eight hours sleep.

1309
01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:12.660
He started eating right.
You Start and you can make yourself look good.

1310
01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:16.140
You make improvements in your own life.
So the next time she sees you,

1311
01:22:16.141 --> 01:22:19.540
if you run into are you look great.
All right.

1312
01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:23.670
What was that fucking Rodney danger,
danger field thing.

1313
01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.820
What was that movie where they're doing the Cyrano de Bergerac Shit.

1314
01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:31.650
Remember that Chico Telia and the man remember that?

1315
01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:35.190
That's what you gotta do next time she sees you.
You're the fucking confident.

1316
01:22:36.930 --> 01:22:40.410
Nah,
that's bad advice.
What are you gonna pretend to be confident?
I don't know.

1317
01:22:40.411 --> 01:22:43.650
I'm just saying you know what?
To focus on yourself.
Get your own shit together.

1318
01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:46.530
You know,
and don't wait for her to call you.
You know,

1319
01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:51.660
start working out eating right,
getting some sleep.
Go do some shit.

1320
01:22:51.661 --> 01:22:55.620
You always wanted to fucking do,
you know,
and go out to the,
you know,

1321
01:22:55.621 --> 01:22:56.371
go out to clubs.

1322
01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:59.880
Start talking to girls who are quote on quote way out of your league.

1323
01:23:01.230 --> 01:23:03.360
See what,
see what the fuck happens.
You know?

1324
01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:06.580
But the last thing you want to do right now,
I swear to God,

1325
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:11.140
is to sit around thinking about that girl or calling her or sending her flowers

1326
01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:14.920
in a box of chocolates and all that shit because,
uh,
you know,

1327
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:17.890
she needs a break from,
yeah,
I think,
and granted,
once again,

1328
01:23:17.891 --> 01:23:22.390
I give out this advice knowing that I didn't really go to college.
I did,

1329
01:23:22.391 --> 01:23:23.560
but it doesn't really count.

1330
01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.740
And I have no background whatsoever and I know fucking read.

1331
01:23:26.741 --> 01:23:28.630
So you're on your own.
If you take my advice,

1332
01:23:28.631 --> 01:23:32.500
I take no responsibility for this shit whatsoever.
All right.

1333
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:35.470
And not to mention this,
a zillion fucking chicks out there.

1334
01:23:35.471 --> 01:23:37.300
Why don't you go join one of those dating services?

1335
01:23:37.301 --> 01:23:40.270
That's a great fucking way to get laid.
You know,

1336
01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.490
someone was talking to me about that the other day,

1337
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:45.583
<v 12>you know,</v>

1338
01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:47.630
<v 7>there's like two of them.</v>

1339
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:51.170
One of them's about really getting into a relationship and the other one's just

1340
01:23:51.171 --> 01:23:55.820
about fucking join the one that's just about fucking and uh,
go by.

1341
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:59.810
Go down a Bj's wholesale and get some condoms and bang away.

1342
01:24:00.650 --> 01:24:01.610
All right?

1343
01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:05.180
But the last thing you want to do is to get all fucking depressed about this

1344
01:24:05.181 --> 01:24:09.380
shit and waste another couple months of your life brooding.
Alright.

1345
01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:14.900
Dust yourself off.
Get back in the game.
All right.
All right,
next one.
Hey Bill.
Uh,

1346
01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:17.360
I've got an interesting uh,
situation going on.

1347
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:21.860
I've been really good friends with this guy friend.
I'll do this is a,

1348
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:25.400
this is a fucking great question.
I don't even know if I can answer this one,

1349
01:24:25.401 --> 01:24:28.520
so I'm going to need some help.
All right.
Uh,
hey bill.
I got a,

1350
01:24:28.521 --> 01:24:30.050
an interesting situation going on.

1351
01:24:30.051 --> 01:24:33.890
I've been really good friends with this guy friend of mindful for like four

1352
01:24:33.891 --> 01:24:37.130
years.
We're super tight.
Talk all the time.

1353
01:24:37.131 --> 01:24:41.840
Say I love you regularly finish each other's sentences,
that sort of crap.

1354
01:24:42.050 --> 01:24:42.231
Well,

1355
01:24:42.231 --> 01:24:47.231
one day I call them and found out that he had stopped mid hookup with a girl to

1356
01:24:47.391 --> 01:24:50.030
answer my phone call.
When I asked why,

1357
01:24:50.031 --> 01:24:55.031
he said it was because I was the most important girl in the world to him right

1358
01:24:55.581 --> 01:24:58.520
in front of the girl he was getting play from.

1359
01:24:59.530 --> 01:24:59.860
<v 12>Yeah.</v>

1360
01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:01.210
<v 7>My question to you is,</v>

1361
01:25:01.211 --> 01:25:05.050
does this do dig me or is he just a great friend?

1362
01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:10.680
And if he does,
why has any ever made a move?
Ah,

1363
01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:15.840
wow.
Wow.
Okay.
All

1364
01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:18.940
right.
There we go.

1365
01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:22.630
It's not an original fucking question in a way,

1366
01:25:22.631 --> 01:25:27.520
but it is because this is what two dudes now.
Yeah.

1367
01:25:27.521 --> 01:25:32.110
Jesus Christ had a fuck.
Do I answer this one?
Uh,
yeah.
Joel,

1368
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:34.420
there's something fucking going on there.
The way you write about it.

1369
01:25:34.421 --> 01:25:37.120
It sounds like you're in a relationship.
You guys are in a relationship.

1370
01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:41.850
It sounds like a,
yeah.

1371
01:25:41.851 --> 01:25:46.280
I don't know what his deal is.
He's definitely curious.
I can tell you that.

1372
01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:49.860
Uh,
I dunno,
I,

1373
01:25:49.861 --> 01:25:52.880
I've never tried to figure out if a dude like me like that,

1374
01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:57.860
but this is really making me uncomfortable.

1375
01:25:57.861 --> 01:26:01.430
That's why I liked this fucking question.
Um,
yeah,

1376
01:26:01.431 --> 01:26:06.260
I think you got to figure out what's going,
you know,
but I,

1377
01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:08.090
I gotta be honest with you if this will,
yeah,

1378
01:26:08.091 --> 01:26:10.610
I'll give you the same advice that if you will,

1379
01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:15.080
if this was like a woman and she keeps acting like that around you,

1380
01:26:15.081 --> 01:26:18.890
but she's hooking up with some other guy,
then I'd be like fuck or walk away.

1381
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:22.820
So I'll give you the same advice.
Fuck this dude.
He hasn't,
you know,
if he is gay,

1382
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.790
he's not ready to admit it yet.
And what are you going to do?

1383
01:26:26.650 --> 01:26:30.140
Stand around like some fucking,
uh,

1384
01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.860
some fucking guy who stands around fuck dead.

1385
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:37.760
Go down to a fiddle sticks,
whatever,

1386
01:26:37.761 --> 01:26:40.100
whatever the fuck they was actually a gay bar called that.

1387
01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:43.190
I remember there was a standup Gig in Boston.
Someone of my friends did it.

1388
01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:48.590
It's called,
it's called fiddlesticks.
Um,
yeah,
fuck debt.

1389
01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:53.960
Yeah.
Got Out of the bar.
Do what you guys do.
Work Out,
get the fucking abs going.

1390
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:58.550
Put on a tight shirt.
Just don't hook up with a creepy older guy.

1391
01:26:58.551 --> 01:27:01.070
That's something I noticed when it living in New York,
in La,

1392
01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:04.790
there's always like a creepy older guy with the young,
younger gay dude.

1393
01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:08.530
Like he's teaching them how to be gay or something and they're like gold drink,

1394
01:27:08.770 --> 01:27:10.980
dig and gay guys out there.
Cause I really don't want,

1395
01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:14.960
cause guys are visual fucking people.
You know what I mean?

1396
01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:19.220
So I,
I don't know how the fuck that goes down and I'll tell you right now,

1397
01:27:19.221 --> 01:27:22.430
I don't want to,
so whatever do,
I don't know what your deal is.

1398
01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:26.720
Confront him or fucking move on.
Cause uh,
you know,

1399
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:30.170
if he actually is gay and he's still out there banging women,
uh,

1400
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:34.970
you know when I'm telling you you're only on earth for a very short period of

1401
01:27:34.971 --> 01:27:36.440
time,
your time is valuable.

1402
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:40.070
You got to put a value on it just like that guy before you.
Okay.

1403
01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.810
They're check fucking took off.

1404
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.940
Now he's standing there walking around trying to hand her flowers.

1405
01:27:46.130 --> 01:27:49.220
She's still giving him the Heisman.
And then that's when you gotta be like,

1406
01:27:49.221 --> 01:27:53.480
that's when you,
you got to get some fucking self esteem and be like,
look,

1407
01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:58.070
I'm better than this.
I'm the shit.
I'm telling you the solutions,

1408
01:27:58.071 --> 01:28:00.980
you always go to the gym.
He listened to some fucking music.
That's how I do it.

1409
01:28:00.981 --> 01:28:04.370
You know,
if I can get some sleep,
you start looking good,

1410
01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:07.790
you feel good about yourself and then you go out and you talk to somebody who

1411
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:12.320
really,
you have no business talking to and they shoot you down.

1412
01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:14.960
Then you have a couple more drinks and you start thinking about the person that

1413
01:28:14.961 --> 01:28:17.810
made you want to do that in the first place and you go back into the depression,

1414
01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:22.310
but you wake up the next day and you do it over again.
It's six weeks people,

1415
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:23.060
six weeks.

1416
01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:25.970
You've got to tough it out for six fucking weeks and you'll get out of it.

1417
01:28:25.971 --> 01:28:29.060
So good luck to the both of you.
All right,
next question.
Hey Bill,

1418
01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:30.980
this a hockey question.
Um,

1419
01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:34.610
it's another reason why I'm saying to you back on the road is now I can finally

1420
01:28:34.611 --> 01:28:38.030
actually watch some hockey games ordering the NHL package today.

1421
01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:42.170
Much to my girlfriend's Chagrin,
um,
hockey question.
Hey,
bill,

1422
01:28:42.171 --> 01:28:45.590
you seem to be a knowledgeable person when it comes to hockey.

1423
01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:49.700
So I figure,
uh,
it would be best to ask you,

1424
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:52.183
um,

1425
01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:57.380
being that I live in New Orleans where there's no hint of an organized hockey

1426
01:28:57.381 --> 01:28:58.940
and very few televised game,

1427
01:28:58.941 --> 01:29:01.860
I am very limited on my knowledge of the sport even though I love it.

1428
01:29:02.090 --> 01:29:06.150
I basically,
I basically cheer for Detroit,
the Kings,
the avalanche,
the devils,

1429
01:29:06.151 --> 01:29:07.650
and the mighty ducks.
All right?

1430
01:29:07.651 --> 01:29:09.960
You can tell you don't know a lot about hockey if you chew,

1431
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:13.470
if you root for both the Redwings and the avalanche,

1432
01:29:13.471 --> 01:29:17.280
that's like rooting for the buckeyes and the Wolverines,

1433
01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:22.560
the red sox and the Yankees,
the Longhorns,
and the sooner you know,

1434
01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.710
the troops and the al Qaeda,
the different sides.

1435
01:29:25.930 --> 01:29:28.950
Do you got to pick a side on that one?
Anyways,
let's get to his question.

1436
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:32.610
Now my question is,
what is wrong with the mighty ducks?

1437
01:29:33.630 --> 01:29:36.060
Why are they not considered a respectable team?

1438
01:29:36.330 --> 01:29:40.560
I went to a buddy's house to watch a hockey game this weekend and was basically

1439
01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:43.200
booed.
That's funny.

1440
01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:46.200
You get booed and delivering on boot into oblivion because I was wearing a

1441
01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:49.500
duck's jersey in parentheses because it's the only one I own.

1442
01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:53.700
I was told by him as well as the seven other people president at the reason for

1443
01:29:53.701 --> 01:29:56.640
hating the ducks was,
has nothing to do with the way they play,

1444
01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:59.400
but rather it's the fact that the ducks are not a real team.

1445
01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:03.930
Is this a general feeling amongst real hockey fans?
Uh,

1446
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:06.270
or am I just dealing with some bonehead friends?

1447
01:30:06.271 --> 01:30:10.680
Let me know and thanks in advance.
All right.
This is the deal.
Um,

1448
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:12.570
I don't know how old you are,

1449
01:30:12.571 --> 01:30:17.430
but do you remember the mighty ducks was a movie was a Disney movie starring

1450
01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:22.050
Emilio Estefan as [inaudible],
however the fuck you say his name,

1451
01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:27.420
and it was a kid movie.
It was basically the bad news bears on ice,

1452
01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:31.290
which is,
was very,
I mean,
the worst fucking collection of kids.

1453
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:36.590
Emilio Estefan has probably had relationship problems and he learned a lot about

1454
01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:39.060
himself while working with the kids.

1455
01:30:39.061 --> 01:30:42.900
And then for some reason there's this unbelievable hottie who's really into the

1456
01:30:42.901 --> 01:30:47.070
fucking kids and see something in him that he didn't know happen.

1457
01:30:47.071 --> 01:30:50.370
And then they hook up and then somewhere along the line they have a big fight

1458
01:30:50.610 --> 01:30:54.060
and then he has to get her back.
And meanwhile there's some big hockey game.

1459
01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:57.600
And uh,
I imagine the coach of the other team,

1460
01:30:57.601 --> 01:31:00.750
Emilio Estefan is already fucking knows on some level.

1461
01:31:01.230 --> 01:31:06.180
And that dude always wins in life.
And now this is his chance.
You know what?

1462
01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:10.830
I bet the coach from the other team is dating that hot girl and then they hook

1463
01:31:10.831 --> 01:31:15.180
up.
Is that how it works?
Is that how the movie was?
I can never watch it.

1464
01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:18.030
Cause by the time it came out I was like fucking 25 years old.
Yes,

1465
01:31:18.031 --> 01:31:21.870
I'm that fucking old.
So anyways,
yeah,
the team.
So the movie was,

1466
01:31:21.871 --> 01:31:25.950
I evidently a big hit.
They made like two or three of them.
And along the way,

1467
01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:27.930
Disney bought a hockey team.

1468
01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:32.370
And because of the corporate cunt mentality,

1469
01:31:32.610 --> 01:31:36.570
they named it the mighty ducks.
Okay.

1470
01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:41.790
That's the,
the history of that team.
Now,
the NHL,

1471
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:46.500
the history of the NHL is,
it used to be six teams and six of the angriest,

1472
01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:50.760
most psychotic fucking cities in North America fighting was legal.

1473
01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:53.820
You smashed,
sticks over people's heads,
you know,

1474
01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:57.900
Teddy Green had to get a plate and his fucking head,
it's a maniac fucking sport.

1475
01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:02.770
And then they show up like high were those Ma,
where are the mighty dark play?

1476
01:32:03.010 --> 01:32:04.150
Some up fuckers.

1477
01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:07.690
It's already difficult when you have this many teams because they really are out

1478
01:32:07.691 --> 01:32:12.370
of ferocious animals to name teams after.
So,

1479
01:32:12.810 --> 01:32:12.820
um,

1480
01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:17.720
now they're kind of naming them after different kinds of weather or general as

1481
01:32:17.721 --> 01:32:22.060
you know,
like,
uh,
the storm,
the thunder,

1482
01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:27.010
the lightning,
the cold front and on the fucking,
you know what I mean?

1483
01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:31.030
Or they categorize the predators.

1484
01:32:31.810 --> 01:32:35.410
I still don't know what a thrasher is.
What is a thrasher?

1485
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:40.330
That's a kind of metal speed metal,
right.
Anyways,
so anyways,
that's why people,

1486
01:32:40.570 --> 01:32:43.780
they don't like the ducks because,
um,

1487
01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:49.330
hockey is like a rogue sport.
And,
um,
it's never been accepted,

1488
01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:53.490
accepted by the mainstream,
nor will it ever.
And uh,

1489
01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:57.340
then all of a sudden they came in with the mighty ducks and a,

1490
01:32:57.341 --> 01:32:59.080
they really left themselves wide open.

1491
01:32:59.081 --> 01:33:01.810
But the thing about they got rid of the mighty,

1492
01:33:01.811 --> 01:33:03.710
so now they're just called the ducks.
And the,

1493
01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:07.150
the funny thing about the ducks is the kind of hockey that they play.

1494
01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:10.990
They play like a really physical in your face.
Like I,

1495
01:33:10.991 --> 01:33:15.991
I love the style of hockey that they play and I even know they just traded

1496
01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:19.570
fucking Chris [inaudible].
Um,
you know,

1497
01:33:19.571 --> 01:33:23.500
I gotta admit I'm starting to like the Philadelphia flyers because there's

1498
01:33:23.501 --> 01:33:27.280
something about them that I can relate to in my life.

1499
01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:30.850
And that's the fact that in the mid seventies,

1500
01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:35.290
they won two Stanley cups by beating the shit out of people.
Okay.

1501
01:33:35.291 --> 01:33:36.400
That's not what I'm relating to.

1502
01:33:36.401 --> 01:33:41.401
But they had an angle that was successful and since then they have failed

1503
01:33:42.401 --> 01:33:45.040
miserably with the whole,

1504
01:33:45.041 --> 01:33:48.970
we're gonna beat the shit out of you to win a Stanley Cup.
But God damn it,

1505
01:33:48.971 --> 01:33:49.990
it doesn't stay,

1506
01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:54.991
have not diverted from that game plan one iota since 1974 75 they are still

1507
01:33:58.241 --> 01:34:01.300
trying to,
even though the league has changed completely,

1508
01:34:02.110 --> 01:34:06.100
they are still trying to beat the shit out of people.
And you know,

1509
01:34:07.150 --> 01:34:09.910
they added Chris pronger cause they think this is why we're going to be able to

1510
01:34:09.911 --> 01:34:14.260
compete against the fucking capitals and the Pittsburgh Penguins.

1511
01:34:14.261 --> 01:34:15.460
And what are they?
Do they,
they,

1512
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:18.760
they fucking lose six to five and then they have a big fight at the end.

1513
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:24.270
And I relate to that because I have certain things in my life that I've been

1514
01:34:24.461 --> 01:34:29.410
trying to solve with the exact same approach.
And I fail every fucking time,

1515
01:34:29.411 --> 01:34:33.670
but I for some reason can't get out of this Rut.
So,
um,

1516
01:34:33.850 --> 01:34:36.220
I'm getting the NHL package today and I'm telling you,

1517
01:34:36.221 --> 01:34:40.780
if you want to get into hockey,
watch the penguins,
flyers,
games all this year,

1518
01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:44.020
there's not going to be one boring one.
Um,

1519
01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:48.070
and a lot of people don't like when I talk about sports,
but I don't give a fuck.

1520
01:34:48.071 --> 01:34:49.660
I gotta tell you,
I'm concerned about my Bruins.

1521
01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:53.410
I don't know why they traded Phil Kessel.
I don't get it.

1522
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:58.950
Why you would trade a young guy who's your number one goal score and you trade

1523
01:35:00.531 --> 01:35:04.190
them for draft picks.
I could see if he was 35 and he was past his prime,

1524
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:08.510
then you're like,
hey,
we gotta get young.
But so many draft picks,
they don't,

1525
01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:10.040
they turn out to be nothing.

1526
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:15.770
And you actually had a young guy who scored like 39 fucking goals and he missed

1527
01:35:15.771 --> 01:35:19.670
some games last year,
man.
Stupid fucking stupid.

1528
01:35:20.330 --> 01:35:23.390
And I like it.
I don't like it.
All right,
so there you go.
Do,

1529
01:35:23.391 --> 01:35:25.220
that's why they don't like the duck.
So fuck them.

1530
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:28.040
Just learn a little bit more about hockey then you won't say things like,

1531
01:35:28.041 --> 01:35:32.540
I'm an I like the Redwings and the avalanche.
Uh,
but good for your man.

1532
01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:37.310
Good for you.
Like in hockey down there in New Orleans.
All right,
next question.

1533
01:35:37.311 --> 01:35:41.150
Hey Bill.
Um,
I mean a little bit of a dilemma.

1534
01:35:41.151 --> 01:35:44.330
I'm 35 years old and I have a 30 year old said,
oh Jesus Christ.

1535
01:35:44.331 --> 01:35:47.780
I'm reading the one from last year.
Am I all out of,
did I scroll down too far?

1536
01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:52.220
I thought I had some questions here.
Oh,
there's the questions.
All right,

1537
01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:56.230
here's some questions then.
I'm going to end the podcast here.
Um,

1538
01:35:57.490 --> 01:36:02.270
oh wait a second.
Yeah.
Here we go.

1539
01:36:02.271 --> 01:36:04.400
Questions Bill.
If your family,
siblings,

1540
01:36:04.401 --> 01:36:08.940
parents and close friends are turning into zombies,
um,

1541
01:36:08.941 --> 01:36:10.370
then you could kill them.
I mean,

1542
01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:13.130
like totally kill them because if they zombies they wouldn't,

1543
01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:17.060
they would technically be dead also.
In addition to that,
uh,

1544
01:36:17.061 --> 01:36:18.260
would you have to kill you?

1545
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:22.100
Would you have to kill them in a special way because they are special to you?

1546
01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:26.420
Like a quick death bullet to the head or would you just take a baseball bat to

1547
01:36:26.421 --> 01:36:29.160
them?
Would you look forward to it?
Um,

1548
01:36:29.170 --> 01:36:32.990
I know I'd love it if someone I didn't like became a Zombie so I could have a

1549
01:36:32.991 --> 01:36:36.350
legitimate excuse for killing them and getting away with it.
Yes.

1550
01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:40.940
Some people I'd love to take my time with.
Okay.

1551
01:36:40.941 --> 01:36:42.500
That's a fucked up question.
All right.

1552
01:36:42.501 --> 01:36:47.330
He's basically asking me if my all my friends and loved ones turned into
zombies,

1553
01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:52.820
could eat what I kill them.
Um,
all right.

1554
01:36:52.821 --> 01:36:56.600
In the old days when zombies could just walk slowly,
I would run away from them.

1555
01:36:57.170 --> 01:37:00.470
And unless cornered,
like in the Michael Jackson Thriller Villi Video,

1556
01:37:00.471 --> 01:37:04.250
obviously yes,
I would kill them rather than sitting there getting eaten alive.

1557
01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:08.230
Now with today's Zombie 2.0 uh,

1558
01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:11.360
where they can run and that type of shit,
uh,
without a doubt,
yes,

1559
01:37:11.361 --> 01:37:14.690
I would kill him cause it isn't them anymore.
And uh,

1560
01:37:14.691 --> 01:37:18.740
I want to live and what I do at quickly,
I try to do a quickly,

1561
01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:23.330
but if I didn't have anything,
if I only had something that would go slowly,

1562
01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:27.290
then I would use something that would go slowly.
You know,

1563
01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:32.060
I don't know.
You know what?
I was actually on the road and I saw that,

1564
01:37:32.061 --> 01:37:36.830
that Zombie movie,
what does that one,
uh,
Zombie land or something like that.

1565
01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:40.430
And I don't know,
cause I wasn't in a crowded movie theater.
I was a little,

1566
01:37:40.431 --> 01:37:44.780
little,
little disappointed,
but I heard this something out there.
This,

1567
01:37:44.781 --> 01:37:49.160
this new ghost movie called like photosynthesis or something paranormal.

1568
01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:54.350
Evidently it's supposed to be the scariest movie of the last 10 years and I'm

1569
01:37:54.351 --> 01:37:58.590
going to go see it before somebody fucking ruins it for me.
Um,
so with that,

1570
01:37:58.591 --> 01:38:00.930
that is a podcast for this week.
Um,

1571
01:38:02.130 --> 01:38:06.940
please try to avoid us air if you can.
American Airlines is also another,
um,

1572
01:38:07.050 --> 01:38:11.280
airline that,
that is also $25 a bag.
And,

1573
01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:12.210
um,

1574
01:38:12.210 --> 01:38:17.210
I'm going to complain and I would like to encourage all of you because they

1575
01:38:17.371 --> 01:38:20.670
really put you in this position where you feel like there's nothing you can do.

1576
01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:25.470
I think that a regular customers really need to get more vocal.

1577
01:38:25.530 --> 01:38:29.520
This is just my opinion.
I'm not getting preachy here,
but,

1578
01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:34.140
um,
I really see no end to these greedy cons.

1579
01:38:34.170 --> 01:38:38.190
Just taken another bite out of your ass until we pushed back a little bit.

1580
01:38:38.730 --> 01:38:43.170
So,
um,
next time you get fucked over,
asked for a website,

1581
01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:47.340
send some emails,
do whatever the fuck you can.
Um,

1582
01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:52.800
I dunno.
I Dunno what the fuck to do.
I'm really,
um,
I'm really,
I don't know what,

1583
01:38:52.830 --> 01:38:54.410
so what you don't want me to do right now?
I'm going to thank you.

1584
01:38:54.411 --> 01:38:58.350
Everyone who came out to see me over the last six weeks.
Okay.
From,

1585
01:38:58.351 --> 01:39:01.560
from Stockholm to Boston to Philly,

1586
01:39:01.890 --> 01:39:05.850
all the people in Addison who came out to see me,
um,

1587
01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:09.960
all the people that distress factory in New Jersey who've been coming out to see

1588
01:39:09.961 --> 01:39:13.470
me for years and in Pittsburgh,
which all of a sudden,
man,

1589
01:39:13.471 --> 01:39:17.580
I mean that's a really hard ticket for Comedians to sell out.

1590
01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:21.120
They're sold out two shows and the other two shows where all the way to like

1591
01:39:21.121 --> 01:39:26.010
literally the last row and um,
you know,

1592
01:39:26.011 --> 01:39:29.730
it's seriously,
man,
no jokes here.
It's,
it's,
it's an unbelievable feeling.

1593
01:39:30.330 --> 01:39:30.721
You know,

1594
01:39:30.721 --> 01:39:34.380
I worked 17 years to get to this point to actually have people like my comedy,

1595
01:39:34.381 --> 01:39:37.740
the way you guys do and to come out to my shows is fucking awesome.

1596
01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:39.330
And I got to met,

1597
01:39:39.331 --> 01:39:42.420
there's always a little bit of panic every time I walk into a showroom where I'm

1598
01:39:42.421 --> 01:39:45.840
like,
fuck,
is this the week where there everybody's over me?

1599
01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:49.770
And it goes back to 25 fucking people,
you know.
So,

1600
01:39:51.250 --> 01:39:55.050
um,
that's it.
Thank you for keeping the dream alive for another fucking week.
And,

1601
01:39:55.860 --> 01:40:00.840
um,
and I think,
I think that's it.
And,
uh,
I also wanna thank uh,

1602
01:40:01.170 --> 01:40:06.170
Jim and Randy at wd VIII in Pittsburgh for hooking me up with the unbelievable

1603
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:10.110
corn beef sandwiches.
And let me run my mouth on your great radio show,

1604
01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:13.380
the OPN Anthony show.
Uh,

1605
01:40:13.410 --> 01:40:16.380
who the fuck else I got to start thinking those radio shows cause those guys

1606
01:40:16.381 --> 01:40:20.790
really fucking really helped me out.
And uh,
um,

1607
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:25.320
and also,
um,
I want to thank everybody who came out for the,

1608
01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:27.630
I got a bit of buddy of mine who's,
who's,
um,

1609
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:32.070
he's really battling sickness right now.
And uh,

1610
01:40:32.071 --> 01:40:33.780
I went up and did a benefit of giggles,

1611
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:38.030
which is a great comedy club if you live up in the Boston area.
Um,

1612
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:41.340
my Clark Linny Clark's brother runs it and we did this great benefit for this

1613
01:40:41.341 --> 01:40:45.900
comedian Kevin Knox,
just one of the great fucking comedians.

1614
01:40:46.230 --> 01:40:50.130
I'll tell you a quick story.
I started in this business in 1992 and one I did,

1615
01:40:51.150 --> 01:40:56.110
it was basically at the end of the 1980s a comedy boom.

1616
01:40:56.890 --> 01:40:59.770
It was almost like the housing market or the,
uh,

1617
01:41:00.010 --> 01:41:04.870
Internet bubble in that there was a bunch of people making way more money than

1618
01:41:04.871 --> 01:41:08.200
they should have been and there had to be a correction in the market.

1619
01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:13.200
So basically I started in 1992 and when I was working during the first couple

1620
01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:15.580
years of my career,

1621
01:41:15.610 --> 01:41:20.610
I worked with a lot of guys who used to be making way more money and used to be

1622
01:41:21.281 --> 01:41:23.170
headlining.
Um,

1623
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:27.310
sort of the guys like the B and c level headliners.

1624
01:41:28.130 --> 01:41:29.860
All right.
And I gotta tell you,

1625
01:41:29.890 --> 01:41:34.890
there was a number of them who I will say we're not so nice to work with.

1626
01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:39.670
Basically,
they tried to discourage me from being a comedian.
You know,

1627
01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:42.040
I'm not talking about the big guns.

1628
01:41:42.041 --> 01:41:44.950
The big guns who were in Boston still were drawn and they were still doing well.

1629
01:41:44.951 --> 01:41:45.784
But there was like,

1630
01:41:46.150 --> 01:41:49.540
there was some B and c level guys that I ran into when they would say shit like,

1631
01:41:49.541 --> 01:41:50.020
you know,

1632
01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:53.620
you'd be there on like a Thursday or a Wednesday night gig and they'd be like,

1633
01:41:53.621 --> 01:41:57.130
fucking 30 people in the crowd.
40 people and they,
they'd be the gold.

1634
01:41:57.140 --> 01:42:00.490
Look at this shit man.
Y'All tell you man,
two fucking years ago,
three years ago,

1635
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:04.900
they would have been a line around the block.
You know,
I'll tell you,
man,

1636
01:42:04.901 --> 01:42:08.200
if I was your age,
I wouldn't even get into this shit.
You know,

1637
01:42:08.330 --> 01:42:10.090
I'd quit right now,
man,
if I was your age,

1638
01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:12.160
if I could do this over again and never would had done it yet.

1639
01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:15.190
And I sort of guy used to live there with like a gun in my mouth,
you know.

1640
01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:19.960
But um,
you know,
there was this one comic,

1641
01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:21.460
this Guy Kevin Knox,

1642
01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:25.960
I used to go down to his show and he was just a fucking great guy and he would

1643
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:29.530
absolutely,
you know,
just,
just a fucking great guy.
Totally encourage you.

1644
01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:33.910
Positive guy.
Not a,
not a jealous bone,
not an envious phone.

1645
01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:37.420
Competitive.
None of that shit just to fucking great dude.

1646
01:42:37.930 --> 01:42:42.700
And me and all my buddies used to go down and he put us up on his show.
And,

1647
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:44.320
uh,
not only was he great guy,

1648
01:42:44.321 --> 01:42:47.830
I really learned how to follow somebody or attempt to follow somebody because

1649
01:42:47.831 --> 01:42:51.940
this guy was so fucking funny.
You know,
when he hosted a show,

1650
01:42:51.941 --> 01:42:54.160
we used to joke that he didn't host a show.

1651
01:42:54.161 --> 01:42:57.790
He used to take breaks from killing cause that's what he would do.

1652
01:42:57.930 --> 01:43:00.700
He'd go up and he would just be killing and then I'd be like,
all right,

1653
01:43:00.701 --> 01:43:02.680
I'm going to bring up your next act.
And then,
you know,

1654
01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:06.490
he'd bring up a fucking 23 year old me and I'd be,

1655
01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.560
I'd have to go up there and hang on for dear life.

1656
01:43:08.561 --> 01:43:12.580
And it really helped me out when I went down to New York and I had to go on

1657
01:43:12.581 --> 01:43:16.960
after like,
you know,
I go on after guy who had his own TV show and you know,

1658
01:43:16.961 --> 01:43:20.830
the nervousness of that when you first start out being a comedian.

1659
01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:25.580
Um,
and I was a much better common cause,
uh,
cause he gave me,
you know,

1660
01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:30.430
the opportunity to like,
you know,
be on shows and stuff.
And uh,
so anyways,

1661
01:43:30.431 --> 01:43:31.810
we had a big benefit for them

1662
01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:38.050
up in Boston and giggles comedy club and it was a huge success.
And uh,
you know,

1663
01:43:38.051 --> 01:43:42.820
he's battling some shit right now.
So my prayers are going out to them.
And a,

1664
01:43:42.821 --> 01:43:44.980
I want to thank my Clark for having that great benefit.
