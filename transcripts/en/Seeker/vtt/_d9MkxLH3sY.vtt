00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.350
People often ask me, “Julian, just how much
of your brain can you live without?”

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.240
But they always say it in kind of a mean way.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.490
Hello people with brains, probably, Julian
here for DNews!

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.770
Imagine this scenario: the zombies are coming
and they want what any zombie wants.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.770
Your brains.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.770
If you had to give up some of your brain to
distract them while you make your escape like

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.380
a lizard losing its tail, what could you actually
afford to chuck at the moaning hoard?

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.449
Definitely not the brainstem, that’s for
sure.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.960
That little bit at the top of your spine controls
your heart, lungs and blood pressure.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.030
Injuries to it are extremely serious.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.910
There is actually a case of a boy who lived
for 12 years with nothing but a brainstem.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.719
Trevor Waltrip was born in 2001 with a condition
called hydranencephaly.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.079
He was blind and couldn’t speak, had to
eat with a feeding tube and have therapists

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.969
stimulate his muscles and joints.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:49.969
But he lived.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.889
He was a rare case, but demonstrates that
if you want to be alive, you better at least

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:54.889
have a brain stem.

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:58.400
If you have more brain to work with, losing
parts of it aren’t as severe because of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.219
the brain’s ability to rewire itself.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.769
People have lived mostly normal lives with
large bits of brain totally absent.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.130
Like a woman in China, who was born without
a cerebellum, the little cauliflower looking

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.009
bit at the back of your brain that controls
voluntary movement.

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.979
She started walking and talking late, but
still didn’t even know part of her brain

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.689
was nonexistent until she was 24 and went
into a hospital complaining of nausea and

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:20.689
dizziness.

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.159
She’s one of nine people to have lived without
a cerebellum... that we know about.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.380
Don’t forget that your brain doesn’t just
control your body, it’s also responsible

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.560
for who you are as a person.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.671
Take the famous case of Phineas Gage, a railroad
worker in 1848 who had a 43 inch long (109.22

00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:37.260
cm) iron spike shoot through his skull.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.670
He was using the inch and a quarter wide (3.175
cm) death-javelin to pack dynamite into a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.140
hole because apparently safety wasn’t invented
until the 1950s.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.520
When the totally predictable happened, he
was left with a hole through his left cheek

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.570
and out the top of his head, the tamping iron
had bored a hole clear through parts of his

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.570
frontal lobe.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.710
He survived, but the accident… changed him.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.569
He was more impulsive and profane because
the part of his brain responsible for executive

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:04.500
functions like planning and response inhibition
were suddenly feeling a bit drafty.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.789
He lived for another 11 years but died after
a series of seizures.

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.490
But these are just bits and pieces.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.920
You want to know just how much of your brain
you can do without, right?

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.320
You could live a nearly normal life with about
half less brain, according to the late John

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.730
Freeman, a neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins University.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.080
In fact, some people are even better off with
half a brain!

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.710
An anatomical hemispherectomy, which is exactly
what it sounds like, is used in cases where

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.670
people suffer from frequent seizures that
are not responsive to medication and originate

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.280
in one side of the brain.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.330
If left untreated, the seizures could cause
damage that spreads to the other side, so

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.790
sometimes the best option is to take the hemisphere
out entirely and let the void fill with cerebrospinal

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.790
fluid.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.430
Usually the procedure is done on children
between the ages of 5 and 10, and amazingly

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.770
their memory and personality develop normally.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.550
In fact, many even improve academically.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.650
There are downsides: patients lose the use
of the hand and visual field opposite of whichever

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.020
hemisphere was removed.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.930
The left hemisphere also handles language,
so if it’s taken out the right brain has

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.430
to take on those functions and patients may
have trouble with their speech.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.980
Otherwise though, you’d never know half
their head was empty.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.600
Don’t misunderstand me, you can’t just
go around banging your head into table corners

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.850
and be totally fine.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.500
But if something does happen, at least you
know you’re brain’s a pretty amazing thing

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.660
and it’s got your back…

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.660
Literally…

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.040
It’s connected to the spinal cord.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.730
Obviously you’re here because you care about
your brain and want to nourish it with interesting

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.730
facts.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.790
But how do you nourish it with nourishment?

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:40.230
Julia covers the best way to feed your 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.790
brain here.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.060
So, back to that zombie scenario: what part
of your brain would you give up to stay alive?

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.090
Motor functions, vision, personality?

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.090
Let us know in the comments.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.400
Or if you’ve a person whose brain works
in an unusual way, we’d love to hear about

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400
that too.
