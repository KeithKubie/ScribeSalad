Hey guys, it's grant jumping in to remind you

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.089
There's still one week left to win this galaxy s 9 plus smart phone. It could be yours

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.928
There's a link down in the description to get your name on the list to qualify. Best of luck. We'll see you around

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.729
Hey guys. I am Nate. We are at the dome once again with another experiment using molten salt

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.560
We're going to see what happens. If you combine molten salt with eggs in a couple of different ways

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.709
We'll see what happens if we pour a molten salt on to an egg

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.260
We'll probably try dropping a whole egg into

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:32.129
our crucible full of molten salt and then I think we'll try pouring some molten salt onto our frying pan and then see if we

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.040
Can fry an egg on that salt we have all of our equipment and supplies and eggs. Let's fire up the furnace

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.830
Our salt is just about melted so let's put some eggs into our little pot here. I'm gonna try something a little odd

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.789
I'm gonna try having two cracked eggs and two whole eggs

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.460
And I'm just gonna pour the salt on top and that way we'll be able to see the effect on both of those at once

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.100
Ready? Three, two, one. Whoo!

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.940
Something cracked immediately. I'm not sure what that was

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.499
Just right as I poured it into the pot something made a cracking noise and I assume

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.439
That was something from the moisture in the eggs themselves

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.440
Tell you what, that does not smell really great; that egg shell is still in place. This egg shell is partially not in place

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.080
It’s not exactly cooked thoroughly

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.060
But it’s still very hot. So of course things could still be cooking in there. In fact this part of the shell opened

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:09.199
Still ucooked inside there...try and dump the whole thing out salt and eggs onto our frying pan here

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.199
That worked pretty good. So we've got all of our salt right here we've got some

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.319
I'm gonna say overcooked egg right here. This part it looks like we've got some

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.020
fairly nicely cooked egg

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.270
mixed with raw egg

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.309
Well, let's move on to the next thing

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.060
All right

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.119
We're gonna drop an egg into the molten salt in the crucible and quickly back away because I don't know what's gonna happen

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.459
Three, two, one

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.010
Wow!

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.129
Let's do another one. Three, two, one

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.399
I guess it did cool down a little bit. Oh that smells so bad

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.200
There’s our egg already partially cooked through

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.299
The first egg exploded violently the second egg, not so much

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.650
So our egg shell kind of got coated in some of the melted salt

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.820
Definitely stuck to it a little bit. It's kind of gross. So this is the shell with the salt stuck to it

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.850
This is the actual egg which burned in parts and is raw in parts. I’m just gonna squish it

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.490
It's a step

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.400
Beyond eggs over it easy right there

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.930
So now I've got a final batch of salt heating up in the furnace I'm gonna pour that

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.480
Right on to our frying pan and then I'm gonna try and crack an egg onto that and see if I can cook the egg

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.559
Get a nice fried egg, maybe even try and flip it over in the pan

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.668
That looks so frickin’ awesome

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:29.919
Glowing orange liquid. All right, let's let that salt cool down just a bit because I'm not trying to destroy these eggs

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.359
I do want a hot surface, but I want to actually cook them and

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.329
Possibly eat one. So I think as long as it's still glowing orange. It's probably too hot

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.869
I'm going to try cracking one right there some get a good spot

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.740
Got space for one more

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.090
Well, it is spilling off the side a little bit but we've got some nice cooked looking egg at the bottom

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.509
I'm just not sure if there will be enough heat to cook all the way through

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.979
for me to try and

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:18.889
Really get this thing cooked. I also don't know anything about the nonstick properties of salt. So this could be

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.949
Very stuck or not at all stuck

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.979
Actually seems to come off pretty easily

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.310
Not holding itself together very well though

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.610
I don’t know if that piece is hot so it might not be doing anything to cook it it might just be resting on it

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.360
This is definitely starting to get cooked through/though

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.450
Let's see if I can flip this egg over. I don't think I'll be able to smoothly get under it

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.450
So it's gonna get a little torn up as I try

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.330
Mmm my salt might be cooling down a little too much

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.950
This one is just completely fallen apart. So I don't think I can really flip anything

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.470
That yolk isn't even a little bit cooked

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.840
when this portion of the egg

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.479
Looks like it has cooked. Not really a good-looking cooked egg, but it's something

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.480
Cheers!

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.680
Basically fried egg actually pretty good

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.780
Very salty, I might have added too much salt because it might have already been salted

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.580
Didn't really test that. Let’s try a bit that I didn’t get much salt on

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.440
I think it did. I think it picked up some of the salt

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.730
Using molten salt to cook eggs in a few different varieties

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:06.399
We tried pouring molten salt into a pot that had some cracked eggs and some uncracked eggs in it something

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.700
Cracked the moment I poured the salt into that. I'm not sure what that was

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.630
Maybe just one of the shells breaking open

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:18.550
Maybe that was some steam forming harder to really tell. I really liked the look of the glowing orange molten salt surrounding the eggs

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:24.609
That was pretty freaking cool. We then tried dropping a whole egg into our crucible full of molten salt

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.820
and the first one we did I

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.820
Dropped it in and immediately it exploded and kind of went flying out of the crucible. That was also really cool

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.210
I dropped another egg into there after the first one popped out. It didn't pop

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.109
It didn't really crack much but it did just sit in there and burn quite a bit then

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.860
I tried pouring out the molten salt onto a frying pan and cracking a couple of eggs

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.570
on to the salt after it had solidified to try and cook the eggs right on the salt and

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:51.789
Overall, even this is best of the three methods for using salt to cook an egg. It's really not a good plan

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:57.489
You don't get anywhere very useful. If you've got any ideas of things that you want to see us do with molten salt

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.640
Let us know down in the comments and if we use your idea, we will send you 25 bucks

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:07.450
Hey, what's up guys is grant here with a brand new Galaxy S 9 plus smartphone that I'm giving away to one of you for

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:11.679
Subscriber appreciation. I've got a link down the description so you can get your name on the list and qualify to win
