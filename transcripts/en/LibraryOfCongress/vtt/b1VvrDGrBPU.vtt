&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren:
Good evening and thank you

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.980
for attending our
annual awards ceremony

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.000
for the National Collegiate
Book Collecting Contest.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.580
I'm John Van Oudenaren,
the director of the Center

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.920
for the Book in the
Library of Congress.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.920
And I'm here to welcome you.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.500
A word about the
Center for the Book.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.480
The Center for the Book
was established in 1977

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.760
with the mission to promote
books, reading, libraries,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.910
and literacy nationwide.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.880
We do that through a network
of affiliates in every state,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.240
the District of Columbia,
and the US Virgin Islands.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.560
And we're also working on
an affiliate in Puerto Rico.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.420
Hopefully we'll hear
about that soon.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.440
The center also plays
a major role

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.700
in the library's
national book festival

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.710
and administers the Library
of Congress Literacy Awards.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.700
The Poetry and Literature
Center,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.170
home of the US Poet
Laureate is also part

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.640
of the Center for the Book.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.920
The National Collegiate
Book Collecting Contest was

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.870
established in 2005 by Fine
Books and Collections Magazine

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.810
to recognize outstanding book
collecting efforts by college

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.820
and university students.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.220
The program aims to
encourage young collectors

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.170
to become accomplished
bibliophiles.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.580
Of course, you're going to hear
more about the latest generation

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.340
of these -- group of
these bibliophiles

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.810
and their accomplishments.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.170
But before we can do that,
I want to acknowledge

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.250
and thank our institutional
partners.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.020
The Antiquarian Book Seller
Association of America,

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.570
The Fellowship of American
Bibliophilic Societies,

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.060
The Grolier Club,
and the Rare Book

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.690
and Special Collections Division
of the Library of Congress.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.540
I'd also like to say a word
of thanks to Guy Lamolinara

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.060
from the Center for the Book.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.510
He's the doer who makes
all these events happen

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.770
in the Center for the Book.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.130
And last but not least, I'd

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.720
like to make special
mention of the Jay I.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.020
Kislak Foundation.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.950
The foundation has generously
supported many activities

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.250
and exhibitions at the Library

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.330
of Congress including
this program.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.690
Unfortunately, as
many of you may know,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.170
Jay Kislak passed away
earlier this month.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.550
One needs only to visit the
great hall in this building

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.740
to see the Kislak on permanent
display to witness the extent

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.580
of Mr. Kislak's generosity
and also the degree

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.620
to which he himself
was a great collector.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.990
So please join me in
thanking the Kislak Foundation

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.510
and all our partners.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.330
[ Applause ]

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.310
And we have back here,
Arthur Dunckleman

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.690
from the Kislak Foundation,
and I just wanted

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.990
to acknowledge Arthur.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.440
On behalf of the Library

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.470
of Congress I congratulate
the winners

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.720
and their accomplishments
as bibliophiles.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.350
Speaking of bibliophiles,
we will soon hear

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.920
from renowned book
collector Glen S. Miranker.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.510
Thank you, Glen, for joining us.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.000
I'm now supposed to turn the
program over to John Cole

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.260
as you see in your program.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.140
John Cole was the
Director of the Center

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.150
for the Book for 39 years.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.230
I'm not going to be in
this job for 39 years.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.670
I just started in March
and I don't think --

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.340
I don't think I'll
make 39 years,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.090
but John was the moving
force behind the Center

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.950
for the Book for all that time.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.210
Unfortunately, he has been
called away and wasn't able

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.510
to make it this evening.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.070
So, we'll skip John and go
right to Mark Dimunation,

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.440
the Chief of the Rare Books and
Special Collections Division,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.440
who will introduce our speaker.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.740
Mark.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.230
&gt;&gt; Susan Benne: Spoiler
alert, I'm not Mark.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.550
Oh, the mic?

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.610
Oh okay. The other mic.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.360
Let's see, does this work?

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.110
Okay. So, spoiler
alert, I am not Mark.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.410
I'm Susan.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.250
And I work for the Antiquarian
Book Sellers Association

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.670
of America.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.770
Every year we try to find a
speaker who has a collection

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:25.070
that has a connection to their
collection that will speak

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.180
to the winners of this contest.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.510
And this year we
have Glen Miranker.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.340
Glen has had a storied career
in the tech sector in addition

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.950
to being a bibliophile.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.810
Glen has a Bachelor in
Computer Science from Yale,

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.360
as well as a Masters
and Doctorate from MIT.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.470
He grew up in New York,

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.850
but after completing his
studies he moved to California

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.800
and held several positions
in Silicon Valley startups.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.860
He was recruited by Steve
Jobs to join NEXT computer

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.060
in 1990 and Apple in 1996.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.530
He was active in hardware
development and retired as --

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.340
excuse me -- was Apple's
Chief Technology Officer prior

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.990
to retiring.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.340
Glen is a long-time bibliophile.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.480
He has a collecting
focus on Sherlock Holmes.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.930
He is also an expert on
cryptology and is the Director

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.070
of the National Cyrptological
Foundation.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.510
Thank you so much
Glen for being here.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.450
[ Applause ]

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.450
&gt;&gt; Glen Miranker: Just Glen.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.630
Not very impressive for a
high-tech guy huh [laughter]?

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.230
Can't even more a microphone.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.770
So, just want to let you
folks know, a personal note,

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.220
that when I did retire, I
retired with the idea --

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.850
I had a vague notion, god
knows I won't call it a plan,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.680
that I would spend the balance

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.530
of my life indulging
the two things

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.270
that I really enjoyed other
than building computers.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:14.290
And that was collecting,
studying, being around books --

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.320
particularly Sherlockian.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.070
And the history of cryptography.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.730
And I gave it a try
for about a year

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.090
and I found it completely
absorbing and satisfying

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.620
and worthwhile, so I
haven't gone back to work.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.870
And I don't have any intent
of going back to work.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.050
But what I would like
to say is that you know,

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.940
when collectors talk about
the thrill of the chase,

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.610
we usually mean the
pleasures of pursuit,

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.750
the satisfactions of ownership.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.490
We mean things like
scrutinizing auction listings,

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.620
pouring over catalogue after
catalogue, visiting book stores,

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.360
antiquarian book
shops, all in the hope

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.280
of tracking a particular
volume, finding a surprise gem,

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.700
and adding it to our library.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.350
There are lots of reasons
to collection books

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.770
and as many kinds
of collections as --

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.280
ten times as many collections as
there are people in this room.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.270
Among my favorite examples,
is I know a collector

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.570
who collects books on kissing.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.980
And one member of the Book Club

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.360
of California has a wonderful
collection on medical quackery.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.040
I even know a collector who
has assembled the definitive

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.930
collection of Duncan
Hines recipes [laughter].

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.970
Collectors as opposed
to accumulators,

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.620
assemble collections of books
and ephemera that they love.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.850
Subjects that transfix
them, topical areas

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.150
that they want to
know more about.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.220
I collection Sherlock Holmes.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.300
I love the stories,
the atmospherics,

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.980
being transported back
to 19th Century London.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.200
Conan Doyle's brisk storytelling
and his dazzling deductions,

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.760
but it's not why I collect.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.270
The reason I collect
is I have no choice.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.950
I have a disease.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.140
I suffer from the malady Nick
Basbanes captures perfect

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.950
in his book <i>A Gentle Madness </i>.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.660
But questing and acquiring are
only part of my bibliomania.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.200
Many books have a tale to
tell beyond what's printed

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.220
between their covers.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.820
And tracking down the backstory

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.040
for a book is another
thrill of the chase for me.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.250
And it's a good deal less
costly than acquiring the books.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.570
My becoming one of the
gently mad happened in 1976

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.030
when my wife Cathy
gave me a gift.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.410
My collection at that point
was absolutely nonexistent.

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.420
I had shown an unhealthy,

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.610
unnatural interest
in Sherlock Holmes.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.030
I belonged to a couple of
societies where we met and ate

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.360
and drank and discussed the
cannon and other things.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.990
But my entire Sherlock
Holmes library consisted

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.300
of the two volume complete
stories, Doubleday --

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.320
1950, whatever, Doubleday
edition.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.480
That was it.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.480
And as Cathy handed me this
copy of the American Case book,

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.640
I started at it and I remarked,
you mean, you don't have

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.450
to be J.P. Morgan
to collection books?

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.750
This was a new idea for me.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.320
Well, since that moment I
found more attractive copies

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:30.300
than that 1976 gift.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.650
Yet it remains one
of my favorite books.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:37.310
It's not the words on the page
that interest me as a collector.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.800
I'm after things that you
can't see at first glance.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.800
I seek out books that
are more than books.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.640
Books that are fascinating
and remarkable

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.790
because of a backstory.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.810
Many books have a tale
to tell beyond that --

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:54.060
what's between their covers.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:58.350
Tracking down the backstory for
my books is the principle thrill

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.500
of the chase for me, and
it's a good deal less

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.800
than acquiring them.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:10.020
Each book in a different way
is a portal into times past.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.930
An interest for conjuring
up glimpse of the thoughts,

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.100
the sensibilities,
emaciations, even the crimes

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.490
of previous owners or readers.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.710
A book can be a variable
time capsule of the year

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.970
and the place it was written,
published and distributed.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.940
The discovery of the
back stories for these

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.720
and other books in my
library is a work in progress.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.750
Certainly, a quest without end.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.150
just the way I like it.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.790
Let me show just a
couple of examples.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.830
I think my compulsion will
start to make sense to you.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.830
Let's consider the second
Sherlock Holmes story <i>The Sign</i>

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.930
<i>of Four </i>.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.400
If we overlook the
printing errors,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.080
the text in the seven-dollar
Penguin

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.200
or the free eBook edition,
it's no different than the text

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.620
in the story's first appearance
in <i>Lippincott's Magazine </i>.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.180
But the backstories are
what make the editions

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.900
of the <i>The Sign of Four </i>,
particularly fascinating.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.470
First is the story about how
it even came to be written.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:11.620
Any of you familiar
with it by any chance?

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.720
Besides Mike [laughter].

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.320
<i>Lippincott's Magazine </i>had
decided in 1890 that they wanted

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.880
to -- that they needed
to expand their business,

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.120
and so decided they
were going to off --

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.550
going to start offering
an English version of --

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.740
British version of
their publication.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.570
And they were also looking
for new fresh authors.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:36.760
And so, they decided to send
an agent, Mr. J.M. Stoddard

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.810
to Great Britain to seek
out some new young authors

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.130
and commission some new work.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.610
And so, Mr. Stoddard took two
young authors out to dinner.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:52.400
This was the summer of 1890.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.000
One of those authors
was Author Conan Doyle.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.120
They struck a deal and some
six, seven weeks later,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.010
Author Conan Doyle
delivered the manuscript

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:03.820
for <i>For the Sign
of Dorian Gray </i>.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.950
The second author
also struck a deal

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.820
with Mr. Stoddard
at that dinner.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.360
A fellow named Oscar Wilde.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.280
And a year later he
delivered the manuscript

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.580
for <i>The Picture
of Dorian Gray </i>.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:22.790
Conan Doyle's story was only
a modest success in the UK.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:27.040
It sold fewer than 1000
copies in its first year.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.120
But it was wildly popular
in the United States thanks

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.380
to its illegal publication
by a myriad

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.710
of American pirate publishers.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.160
These sales were very brisk

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.030
and although they brought
ACD no income in the US,

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.750
it did cement his popularity.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.590
This is a fascinating area
in US publication history,

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.210
endlessly fascinating to me.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:52.710
Opacious, brazen,
unregulated, phenomenal profits

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.540
for some pirateers,
and bankruptcies

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.660
for most of them though.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.070
The backstory of pirate
publishing is well represented

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.150
in my collection.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.840
I have more than 1200 distinct
pirated editions from more

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.540
than 45 different
American publishers.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.840
Of the word --

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.390
of the Sherlockian works
of Arthur Conan Doyle.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.050
The first authorized
American edition

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.920
of <i>The Sign </i>did not
appear until two years

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.980
after its magazine
publication in <i>Lippincott's </i>.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.640
But in the meantime, the
pirates were churning out books;

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.490
paperback, hardcover books.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:32.040
In fact, the champion of them
all was an expat Canadian

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.780
by birth named John Lovell.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.460
He was by far the
biggest in terms of number

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.590
of volumes actually
shoved out into the public.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.430
Now, this was certainly
not his motivation,

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.800
but these pirateers actually
did a great public service.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.680
They made literature
widely affordable.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.530
Before the pirateers, a book
cost five, six, seven dollars,

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.800
which at the time
would be equivalent

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.100
to 100 glasses of beer.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.230
So, it was a lot of money.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.860
And they were churning out these
books at a quarter, a dime.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.580
If you subscribed to
a whole bunch of them,

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.670
even as inexpensive as a nickel.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:21.450
In 1895 I believe it was, John
Lovell published nearly half

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.710
of the hard-bound books in
the United States of America.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.040
His nickname by the way,
was Book a Day Lovell.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.110
By his competitors.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:34.610
There's a particular book
I'd like to share with you.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:36.600
This copy of <i>The Sign
of Four </i>was pirated

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.570
by The United States
Book Company.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.500
This was one of Book a
Day Lovell's imprints.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.290
You can see that it's warmly
inscribed by Conan Doyle.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.340
Yet I promise you, Conan Doyle
with authors like Mark Twain,

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.200
Rudyard Kipling, and other
contemporaries despised the

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.090
American Pirateers.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.240
So, why did Conan
Doyle sign the pirate?

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.170
Where? When?

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.790
Whose book was it?

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.380
This signature, surprising
and inappropriate

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.600
as finding a pickled
caslet in your cornflakes.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.560
This is the second backstory

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.230
around <i>The Sign </i>I
would like to talk about.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.870
I've only been able to locate
about six pirated books

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.050
that Conan Doyle inscribed.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.370
Curiously, they were all signed
when Conan Doyle was in Chicago.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:32.260
He made a grand tour of
American in late-1894.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.930
They're all United States
Book Company Publications.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.070
This particular edition -- this
particular book is inscribed

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:43.160
to one Harlow N. Higinbotham.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.360
Now, who the heck is
Harlow N. Higinbotham?

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.430
Well, it turns out, he was
a very important figure

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:50.730
in Chicago.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:54.430
He was a leading businessman,
civic leader, philanthropist.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.770
He was a senior partner in the
Marshall Field department store.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.150
He was the founder
of the Field Museum.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.360
And he was President of the
World's Columbian Exposition.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.390
The World Fair that was
held in Chicago in 1893.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.370
This fair by the way,
brought us words like midway,

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.040
and also brought
us an attraction

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.940
which we now call
the Ferris wheel.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:19.370
So, how did the Higinbotham's
and Conan Doyle Meet?

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.800
Well, here's the story I
pieced together with help

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.370
from Frederick Kiddel's
monograph,

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.410
<i>Arthur Conan Doyle
Visits Chicago </i>.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.230
And from contemporary Chicago
newspapers that I found

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.970
in the Newbury Library, where
Fred's collection now resides.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.850
And I have to credit the
enthusiastic help of librarians

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.140
and curators Autumn
Naylor, Katie McMann,

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.880
and Jenny Swartzburg, without
which I'm not sure I would have

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.930
managed to do the
research on this book.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:49.290
Conan Doyle first toured
America in 1894 and he stopped

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:55.990
in Chicago three times between
October 2nd and December 8th.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:59.860
His name by the way,
was incorrectly reported

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.780
in Chicago newspapers as Arthur
Canon Doyle, as a consequence

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.380
of which people started
referring to him

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.290
with the honorific reverend
for the balance of his trip.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.630
His first official undertaking
in the Windy City was a talk

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.950
on October 12th for Chicago --

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:20.470
at Chicago 20th Century Club
entitled, Facts and Fiction

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.070
About Great English Novelists.

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:26.140
The club met in a little bijou
theater on the third floor

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:30.550
of Higinbotham's
Michigan Avenue mansion.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.930
It was there that the
author inscribed three books

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.870
for Higinbotham;
<i>Study in Scarlet </i>,

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.380
<i>The Sign of Four </i>,
and <i>Micha Clarke </i>.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.620
All pirated editions.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.740
New York bookseller James
Cummins who was the source

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:47.960
of my inscribed copy
sold the three in 1991.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.190
Cummins got the books from
an elderly Chicago elector

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:54.250
who had relocated to New York
some years before and asked

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.530
that his identity be
kept confidential.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:59.400
So there the trail
of provenance ends.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.440
The two gentlemen were
again together at dinner

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.810
in Conan Doyle's honor
after Conan Doyle's lecture.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.990
I surmise that Higinbotham
purchased the books especially

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.530
for the occasion.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:20.860
Why? When we take a close look
at the ownership signature,

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.720
we find it's dated October
12, 1894, the very day

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.670
of Conan Doyle's lecture.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:30.430
So, conjecture, Higinbotham
ran out,

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.610
quick got a couple Conan Doyle
books and brought them back home

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.820
to get them signature -- signed.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.120
Now we're left with
a problem though.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.480
How do we know that the
ownership signature is correct?

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.130
Well, Higinbotham
was the president

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.030
of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.320
and as the president
he had his signature

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.180
on every admission ticket.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.780
And a search on eBay
readily turned one up.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:00.360
So, I had the admission
ticket to compare to the book.

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.900
As we discussed earlier, the
novel of study which sold

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.700
for a mere 50 pounds,
and <i>The Sign of Four </i>,

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.730
which is only a modest
success in the UK,

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.230
the stories that changed Conan
Doyle's fortunes were the

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.140
Sherlock Holmes short stories.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.050
The first dozen appeared

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:24.160
in the <i>Strand Magazine</i>
, 1891 to 1892.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.630
And they were collected
into a book in late-1892,

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.340
<i>The Adventures of
Sherlock Holmes </i>.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.080
Let's have a look

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.010
at a particularly interesting
copy of the adventures.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.280
The first edition

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:47.610
of the adventures sold some
10,000 copies in its first year.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.370
And the success also
ignited the sales

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.140
of Conan Doyle's earlier titles.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.540
For example, within one
week of the appearance

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.340
of the adventures, 3000
copies of <i>The Sign</i>

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.160
<i>of Four </i>were sold in the UK.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.100
That's three times as many
copies as the entire run

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.120
of the first edition
just two years earlier.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:09.310
If we open this book,

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:13.730
we see that this copy has
been inscribed by the author.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.940
With Arthur Conan
Doyle's kindest regards.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:23.000
What's particularly fascinating
is the date of the inscription.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.700
October 6th is the -- is eight
days before the book's official

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.630
publication date.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.660
So, likely this volume
is what you

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.400
and I would call an
author's sample copy.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.010
As an author sample
copy presented

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.100
to some relative of friend.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.950
I have other copies
of the adventures

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:45.750
with interesting
backstories, but there's one

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.770
that I give the prize for
being the most dramatic.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.020
Because of its bibliographic
importance,

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.930
and because of the human
drama that surrounds the man

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.780
who owned it just before me.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.450
This is the third backstory
I'd like to explore.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:04.040
I'm rushing because I have not
been given the usual three hours

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.340
for my presentation [laughter].

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.180
What you see here is
the only known copy

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.480
of the true first edition,

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.360
first state of the
adventures in a dust jacket.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.740
Since Sherlock Holmes
first inspired the birth

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:25.130
of Sherlockians and we students
of Sherlock, and Watson,

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.230
and the cannons call ourselves,

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.200
it's been unclear whether
this edition was issued

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.390
with a dust jacket.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.890
Sherlockian's, collectors,
book sellers have searched

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:38.010
and debated the question
for decades and decades.

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:42.000
But when this book finally came
to light in the Spring of 1984,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.170
the dust jackets
existence was indisputable.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:50.500
This bibliographic
discovery emerged as part

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:55.410
of another story; the story
of a man named Mark Hoffman.

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:57.170
He was the owner before me.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:58.470
I hear from the chuckles
that some

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.890
of you are familiar
with Mark Hoffman.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:07.800
Mark Hoffman again, shortage
of time, was the Mormon Forger.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:14.900
He was -- he would -- oh got
ahead of myself, so sorry.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:21.050
Yes, the FBI called him the best
forger that's ever been caught.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.780
He forged all kinds
of materials.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.720
And I won't go through
the list, it's staggering.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:32.320
The Daniel Boone letters, Emily
Dickinson poems, et cetera,

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:38.590
which all passed extremely
detailed expert examination.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.880
But his most steady customer,

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.700
his most easy mark
was the Mormon church.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:51.110
He would miraculously
produce letters, documents,

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:57.290
bibles with handwritten family
records on the end paper,

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:59.390
[inaudible] paper,
with great regularity

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:01.980
and of course the Mormon
church was very eager to gather

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.780
up any materials
related to their history.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.200
But he was even cleverer
than that.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.740
He would always put one little
fact in it that was embarrassing

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.350
to the church orthodoxy
[laughter].

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.850
So, he was absolutely certain
that the church would buy it

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:20.400
and send it into the basement
where nobody could see it.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:26.040
Well, things caught up with him.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:33.150
He had accepted a very large
advance from the Mormon church

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.580
in order to find this
rumored very large cache

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.260
of early Mormon letters.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.220
As the months went by and he
did not come up with the goods,

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.910
finally the church
ran out of patience

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.130
and asked for their money back.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:52.690
Now, nobody knows for sure,
but the speculation is in order

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:55.430
to take the eyes off of himself,

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:58.310
Mark Hoffman decided
what he should do is blow

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.960
up a few people.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.680
And he built a couple of bombs

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.670
and two people were
actually killed.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.630
And he had a third bomb,
we don't know for sure

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.760
who it was intended, but he
evidently had an accident

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.660
and he blew himself up.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.030
Not fatally, grievously injured.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.800
At any rate, to jump

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:25.110
to the punch line,
this is his new home.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:33.540
It's the -- he was
recently moved

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:38.510
to this Draper, Utah
penitentiary.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:42.210
Slightly less austere
than his original home

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:44.840
which was the Orem
state pen Given

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.700
that he defrauded
the Mormon church,

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:52.040
that he murdered a
couple of devout Mormons,

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.110
and he's in Utah State Penn,

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:58.890
I don't think he's going
to get out on parole.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:03.490
And to make reparations, Hoffman
who had his own book collection,

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.080
it was sold off and
the proceeds were used

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.360
to reimburse the Mormon church.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.660
I was fortunate enough

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:13.110
to acquire what's known
as "the blue book".

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:17.750
But, you know, my time is up.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:21.950
So, as you might suspect, I am
happy to talk further about any

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:24.350
of these stories and of course
answer any other questions you

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.690
might have about my
collection, collecting,

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:30.110
or any of the other bizarre
books that are in it.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.910
Thank you.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:40.060
[ Applause ]

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.810
Six minutes under my allocation.

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:45.460
Six seconds under my allocation.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.230
Any questions?

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:48.530
Yes, ma'am?

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:49.830
&gt;&gt; Tell us [inaudible].

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.130
&gt;&gt; Glen Miranker: Oh,
that's the blue book.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:52.430
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's the one
that you showed?

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:53.730
&gt;&gt; Glen Miranker: Yes,
because of the jacket.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.030
&gt;&gt; Is the jacket a forgery?

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.330
&gt;&gt; Glen Miranker:
Great question.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:58.400
We've looked very,
very carefully

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.860
and as best we can tell no.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.430
But -- and it seems -- it seems
unlikely he would have a forgery

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:06.730
in his own collection.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.530
But it's possible.

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:14.010
The book actually has been --
I have traced its provenance.

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:17.730
It actually -- somewhat
back in time.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.130
It actually -- which is
not say this isn't a copy

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.480
of the real thing.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:27.510
But the book first turned up
in a bookstore in Chicago.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.610
The book dealer is long gone.

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:33.370
It may be familiar by name to
some of you, Larry Kinetka.

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:37.360
And, but he never spilled the
beans about where he got it.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:43.290
And I've even been in touch with
a couple of folks that worked

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:47.990
in the bookstore at the
time in the early 70s,

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:52.020
and neither of them has any
recollection of the book.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:58.190
&gt;&gt; Did you put a dust jacket
protector on that book?

00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:59.490
&gt;&gt; Glen Miranker: No.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.540
I am -- I'm sorry?

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.840
&gt;&gt; How do you feel about it?

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.140
&gt;&gt; Glen Miranker: Oh, I
have dust jacket protectors

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.660
on almost all my books, but
that dust jacket is so tender.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.920
It's in a nice clamshell --

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:16.130
no, no, it's in a
clamshell and all by itself.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:20.900
I don't have the courage to put
it into a dust jacket protector.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.510
Well, thank you.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:50.090
[ Applause ]

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.390
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Can
I close your computer?

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:52.690
&gt;&gt; Glen Miranker:
Oh yes, actually --

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:53.990
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation:
Thanks very much.

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:55.290
Hi everyone, I'm
Mark Dimunation.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:56.590
I'm Chief of Rare Books.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:59.750
For those of you who weren't in
the division, we just had a bit

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:03.550
of a frolic over in Rare Book
and Special Collections division

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:07.500
where we were looking at
collections that had been given

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.260
to the Library of Congress
by previous collectors.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.570
I like to frame it that way,
because there's always a --

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:17.720
what is it picking up?

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.140
My phone? It's picking up --

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.270
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.570
My personality [laughter].

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.990
Okay. So, we're going to
flip the order of the awards.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:39.610
Mostly because Samuel said he
really liked a lot of drama

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.170
and really wanted to
wait till the very end.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.480
Where are you Samuel?

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.780
There you are.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.200
So, to appease the
first prize winner,

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.050
we're going to have
him come up last.

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:51.720
Which means we're going to
start off with our essayist.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.610
If you'd like to come up.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:58.200
It's picking up something.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.190
You're going to -- I'm
going to talk about you.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:04.980
Don't be so -- I'm
not going to hurt you.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.280
There good.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.580
&gt;&gt; Ena Selimovic: Maybe
I could read with you.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.880
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: You wrote
it though, so it [laughter] --

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.940
I just want to talk a
little bit about the nature

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:16.060
of the competition this year,
which was really interesting.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.730
We seem to have struck a moment
in a generation of collectors

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.560
in which book collections
have become very personal

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.170
to their experience.

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:28.440
Every single one of the
award winners today collect

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:32.220
collections that in some
very direct way, speak either

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.980
to their ancestry
or their identity,

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.800
their current identity.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:42.150
Whether it be relatives from
Sicily, whether it be growing

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:46.790
up as a hyphenated American,
or something in between.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.970
Each of these collections has
a very personal connection,

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:55.160
and as a result, when Ena's
essay came up we thought

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.350
that it really reflected
directly the experience of many

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:00.250
of the collectors
and as a result,

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.090
we don't always give
essay prizes,

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:04.040
so congratulations on that.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.800
I want to give you just a
taste of it and then I'm going

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.450
to ask her really extremely
difficult questions.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:13.480
her essay goes into a bit
of a discussion of what it's

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.650
like to live in a culture

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:19.040
in which you don't initially
have a fluency and how you go

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.500
about obtaining that fluency.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.740
Whether it be through language

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.280
or ultimately through
literature.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.400
And there's a paragraph
that I was really struck

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.280
by in this essay, and
I'm just going to read it

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.570
and then the rest is your show.

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:32.370
I hope I do justice to it.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.160
I discover hospitality

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.310
in migrant exile
and war literatures.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:40.170
Especially the tragic
comic in each.

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:42.270
The convergence of these
literary traditions

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:45.470
and the many languages in which
they materialize reflect not

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:49.160
only my own experience of the
divided self, but also my life

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.960
within a pluralist
conception of home.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.260
In my collection are books

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:57.070
that showcase how contemporary
US literatures travel beyond two

00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:00.390
nation states and among
many nodes of a network,

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:04.230
the multiple vibrations
within a single text.

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.780
It's a lovely essay

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.900
that introduces a collection
that's very personal.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.410
Come up to the mic.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:14.940
So, I would like you just to, if
you would, give us a little bit

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.090
of a description of what
your collection entails

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:20.230
and what your essay covers so
they can share that experience.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:23.190
&gt;&gt; Ena Selimovic: So, it
started out as a collection

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:27.250
about colonialism of Africa
and Caribbean, and then now

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:29.830
because of my dissertation
project I'm trying

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:33.620
to re-evaluate what
colonialism means globally.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.960
So, I'm looking at
different forms of colonialism

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.950
on a global scale,
being sensitive

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.080
to historicizing them in depth.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.420
So now I'm looking
at the Balkans

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:48.330
through a post-colonial lens by
involving the Ottoman Empire,

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.460
the Austrian-Hungarian
Empire and these empires

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.090
that don't usually get
talked about when we talk

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:55.390
about post-colonialism.

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:57.390
So, that's the new obsession.

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.440
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Yes, and
the essay will give you --

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.740
&gt;&gt; Ena Selimovic: And Kafka.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.040
Always Kafka.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.340
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: The
essay will give you a taste

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.640
of the fact that this comes

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.350
from among other things a very
personal experience of growing

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.360
up in a situation
in which languages

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:14.890
and identity have fluidity
and meaning at the same time.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.990
And is a really profound
I think coverage

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:19.540
of the collecting impulse

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.850
that we've seen throughout
the program today.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:24.510
So, could you please have a
round of applause for her?

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:31.050
[ Applause ]

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.850
Thank you very much.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:36.730
[ Applause ]

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:39.030
Third place.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:44.880
Hanaa. Fire from the eyes.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.180
Fire from the heart.

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.690
My life as a Syrian-American
Muslim.

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:51.290
As I mentioned --
congratulations.

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:52.590
&gt;&gt; Hanaa J. Masalmeh: Thank you.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:53.890
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation:
As I mentioned,

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:57.600
each of the collections that
won awards were tried directly

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.300
to the experience of
an individual collector

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.750
and speaking out of a
certain kind of identity.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.640
In many cases, trying to
reconcile that identity

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.630
with citizenship
in America as well.

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:14.010
And as a hyphenated American
myself, I had a great deal

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:18.630
of sympathy which much of
the time was being expressed.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:23.240
Hanaa's essay introduces a
collection that's very personal

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.980
in terms of her ongoing
experience

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:30.040
with the literature
of her childhood.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:33.820
And it tells the story of
growing up in Portland,

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.700
but being taken back to Syria
I guess as a way of saying it,

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.870
first under objection and then
ultimately under an effort

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:43.530
to make sure that she was
both fluent and literate.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:47.950
So, the collection includes
stages of her life and books

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.400
that have meaning
in each of those.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.750
So, fairy tales that were
translated by her mother

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:58.990
into Arabic so she would have
Arabic text to read as a child.

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:02.070
Then going on to books that
were collected while in Syria,

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:07.910
then coming back and reading
more classical poetry in Arabic,

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:12.480
and on to I would almost say a
kind of comic sense of identity

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.000
that appears throughout.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.440
I just wanted to share
one aspect of this,

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.500
which I related to entirely.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.300
And it comes out early
on in which she says,

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:27.170
growing up in Portland she
was surrounded in essence

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:30.640
by those things that you would
expect to find in Portland.

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.600
And that there was some fear
that she would drift away

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.720
from her Syrian heritage.

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.020
If you just replace Syrian

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:40.380
for Ukrainian you would
know my upbringing.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.080
At the same time,
I was embarrassed

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.980
by my Syrian heritage.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.160
I would watch Disney Channel
and wish for a grandmother

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:50.910
that would wear pastel cardigans
and bake chocolate chip cookies.

00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:52.930
Instead, I got a grandmother

00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:56.800
who made couscous while telling
stories of the Six Days War.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:01.400
I wonder Hanaa if you can give
us a bit of an understanding

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.700
of what's in the collection

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.370
and how you ultimately
accumulated some

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:06.670
of these materials.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:07.970
There's some great stories
in these collections.

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:09.270
&gt;&gt; Hanaa J. Masalmeh: Amazing.

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:10.570
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: I'm going
to -- not out of rudeness,

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:12.230
I have to sit every
once in a while.

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:15.110
I will pay attention, but
I give you the podium.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:16.410
&gt;&gt; Hanaa J. Masalmeh: Thank you.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:18.890
Thank you so much for
having me here Mark.

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:23.750
Thank you to the Antiquarian
Book Sellers Association.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:28.420
I really love the process of
putting this collection together

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.860
and putting this essay together.

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.920
And it's funny, the first
thing that came to my mind

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:38.640
when I was writing
this essay is the fact

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.430
that my parents despite
being Muslim,

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.870
worshiped the Holy Trinity;
doctor, lawyer, engineer.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:50.120
And I think so much of the
immigrant narrative gets caught

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.480
up in that sense
of working hard,

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.990
becoming successful,
in a new country.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:58.800
But I really wanted to
illuminate the common aspects

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.530
of it to give this really
colorful, three-dimensional idea

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:05.930
of what that heritage looks
like beyond what you might see

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:09.290
on the 6 o'clock news
or in history textbooks,

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:12.160
or often times in
library collections

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.700
that are really representative
of the Middle East and also

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.630
of the Arab-American experience.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:22.090
And so, as Mark mentioned,
my collection starts off

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:26.310
with these picture books that my
mom would bring back from Syria

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:29.550
as well as these Arabic
textbooks that she'd use

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.340
to teach me and my
siblings Arabic

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.060
when we were in the
United States.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.360
You know, I was born
and raised here,

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:39.160
but my mom was insistent
that, you know,

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.050
we would learn how
to speak Arabic.

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:42.350
And we did.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:46.060
But, you know, I
did by, you know,

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:49.100
the skin of my teeth kicking and
screaming because I didn't see

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.620
that value in that heritage.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:53.600
And I think that, you
know, because my mom,

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.270
because my dad made
such an effort

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:58.050
to keep bringing these
books back for me,

00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:59.480
eventually I caught that bug.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:03.490
I became one of the gently mad.

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:06.170
And I started collecting
books on my own.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:08.030
And of course, the
irony is that by

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:11.250
that time my family could
no longer go back to Syria

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:15.040
because of the civil
war going on there.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:19.690
So, it really became a test of
my commitment to my identity,

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:24.400
but also a test to my creativity
in finding these materials

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.290
and selecting these materials.

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:28.010
And this is a period
in my collection

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:31.170
where I actually start to go
a little bit more bilingual.

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:33.990
Because I'm sharing these
books with my friends.

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:37.820
I want them to see what
my heritage is as well.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.060
And so, this collection
is really a reflection

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:43.640
of that inner process of coming
to terms with my identity

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:47.080
and eventually learning
to value it.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:51.530
And I am so honored
to be here today.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:55.240
And I'm also, you know, so happy

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.930
that there are also these
incredible young book collectors

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:02.140
around me whose stories are
fascinating and incredible.

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:05.140
And just really speak
to, you know,

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:10.450
how personal experiences can
be so well embodied in books.

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:12.440
Which even though
they're not alive,

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:16.520
really come to have
a life of their own.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.320
Thank you.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:24.390
[ Applause ]

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:25.690
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: So, this

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:27.220
of course is a collegiate
book collecting competition,

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:30.280
so Ena comes from Washington
University St. Louis,

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.290
and Hanaa comes from
Harvard University.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:35.510
We're going to turn our
attention to the middle

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:38.300
of the country only by
adopting a university.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.110
He has locations elsewhere.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:44.610
But we're turning to KU, not UK.

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:46.630
Kansas University.

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.760
Paul Schwennesen.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.350
I told him I'd been practicing
German all day and then I find

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:54.510
out it's Americanized
like everything else --

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:59.490
came in as a second award
winner for his book collection

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:03.030
which was entitled Borderlands:
A Manifesto on Overlap.

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:04.330
You want to come up?

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:06.130
And give him a round
of applause please.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:10.190
[ Applause ]

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:12.030
This is a different
kind of identity

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:14.730
that Paul is searching of.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:17.230
In this case, he's rooted
in the land, but he's trying

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.410
to understand about the
generations of family

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:22.660
that preceded him and those
that came before him have

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.260
in connection to the land.

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.890
So, it's a book collection
that documents the borderlands.

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:32.390
A family cattle ranch along
the region of Arizona,

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:33.910
New Mexico, and Mexico.

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:36.880
Correct? Which are
divided as Paul refers

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:39.770
to by artificial lines.

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:43.790
And then goes on to build a
book collection that documents

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:47.320
in essence, the various layers
of populations and impacts

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.380
on this land starting
with Aztecs all the way

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:55.020
up to the lost Estadon
who wanders from Florida

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:59.340
to Mexico in late-16th Century.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:02.230
Has materials about the
first domestic livestock

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:04.040
that are brought
onto this vast land.

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.900
And ultimately goes
into exploration

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.660
around indigenous backgrounds
of Spanish Colonialism,

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.960
current conservation
issues, and others.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.610
It's an impressive
and broad collection.

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:18.360
I wonder if you could
talk a little bit

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.950
about the impetuous behind
it for you personally.

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:23.300
&gt;&gt; Paul T. Schwennesen: Sure.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:27.460
I should know better than to try
to bring out a literary aphorism

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:29.990
in front of a group
of bibliophiles.

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:32.590
But Samuel Johnson once said
something to the effect of,

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:35.470
"nothing so concentrates the
mind as the certain knowledge

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:37.980
that one will be
hanged in a fortnight."

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:40.960
And there's a little bit
of that here too that --

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.750
slightly less dramatically,
but it's hard

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:46.390
to quite understand your
homeland, where you're really

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:47.840
from until you leave it.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.980
We've probably all experienced
that to one degree or another.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.680
And this is certainly
my personal case.

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:56.080
I came to the University
of Kansas

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.690
through some complicated
personal machinations

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:02.700
that led me there and
this book collection --

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.000
I supposed I shouldn't
reveal this,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.190
but this book collection was
not actually a collection

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:09.490
in the traditional sense.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:12.330
I only realized that
I had a collection

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:14.560
by putting together this essay.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.420
I realized that I
had been collecting

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.820
in a non-linear fashion.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.890
That this collection
was sort of building

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:24.760
in the background, right.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.490
So, this wasn't a laser
focused ambition of mine

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:30.770
to generate a collection
that spans the borderlands

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:32.520
of the American southwest.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:37.710
But it runs out in sort of after
thought that it actually was.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:42.710
That there was a surreptitious
subliminal act going on here

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:44.010
of this book collecting.

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:48.200
And it was a joy to realize what
I had and what it meant to me.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.410
And what my home meant to me.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:53.380
And that it only
meant that much to me

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.140
by being separated from it.

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:58.820
So, I appreciate the
opportunity to sort of reveal

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:02.980
to the wider reading audience
and it's been an absolute joy.

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:06.510
And thank you for
making this happen.

for our first-place winner,

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:24.690
Samuel Vincent Lemley of
the University of Virginia.

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:25.990
Congratulations.

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:27.720
Let's give him a hand.

Whose essay and collection is
surrounded around the concept

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:38.790
of collecting Sicilian printing,
Biblioteca Genealogica:

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:42.280
Sicilian Printing, 1704-1893.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.830
In this Sam -- is
it Sam or Samuel?

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:47.130
&gt;&gt; Samuel Vincent Lemley: Sam.

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:48.430
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Sam.

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:49.910
Sam discusses a bit

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:53.030
of the impetuous behind this
collection, which in fact is

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:58.000
to represent his
heritage, all the members

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.950
of his historical genealogy
by a book that's published

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:04.090
in Sicily in their year.

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:08.310
Which is a rather unique
approach to a book collection,

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:11.590
but it's fascinating in what
he manages to pull together.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:15.050
So, over the span of
time from 1704 to 1893,

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:18.840
1704 being the earliest
family that can be traced,

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.460
he began the process of tracking

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:25.310
down publications
printed in Sicily.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:28.850
And he has a gathering
that covers everything

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:31.540
from devotional literature
to constitutional history,

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:33.680
from the study of
astronomy all the way

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.500
up to the study of
river mollusks.

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.050
I think that's my favorite.

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:41.550
And discovers many things
about local printing.

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:45.300
Sicily in fact, being very
much a region of local printing

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.900
in which materials really
aren't intended to go

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.770
out into the larger world.

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.000
And as a result, have
a very kind of local

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.550
and in some ways
ephemeral feeling to them.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:57.870
But I just want to read
a little from his essay

00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:01.190
and then we'll let him
chatter even longer than me.

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:03.400
In assembling this
collection I've sought

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:07.160
to represent my ancestral past
by gathering material products

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.020
of my ancient culture.

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:12.460
Invariably, book bear traces
of their human makers,

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:15.680
sometimes literally but
always figuratively.

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:19.260
Books are hieroglyphs of
an absent human presence.

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:22.880
Evidence that cultures far
off or forgotten wrote, read,

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.290
thumbed, and discarded
books and we do.

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:27.490
In this vein, I have sought

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:31.430
to follow G. Thomas
Tinsels primary rationale

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:35.970
for collecting, albeit in a
narrower genealogical sense.

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:39.760
Each title listed here tells
something about a human being

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.470
who lived in a particular
time and place.

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:46.240
In this case, the human beings
happen to be my forbearers.

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.630
So, I wonder if you
could tell us Sam,

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:50.360
a little bit about this process.

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.680
It's a very interesting
gathering.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.560
It's a great catalogue
put together.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.680
If you could talk a little bit
about your experience of hunting

00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:58.980
down Sicily if you would.

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:00.280
&gt;&gt; Samuel Vincent Lemley: Yeah.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:04.220
So, I should say that my
collection was inspired a

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:05.520
continuous to be guided

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.600
by grandfather's genealogical
research he's been working

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.620
on for decades, and
actually just published

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:14.530
in book form three years back.

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:17.050
So that's -- that sort
of underwrites everything

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:18.570
that I've managed to do.

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.590
In terms of gathering
and collection,

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:25.560
most of it actually I bought
from Italian dealers online.

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:28.140
A lot of the materials
are still in Sicily.

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:31.160
As you'd imagined, the
Sicilian books aren't typically

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.350
as collectable, and desirable.

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:36.510
Because of that, I've
been able to acquire a lot

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:40.250
of things fair inexpensively,
which is great.

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:43.140
Yeah, I think just
the idea being

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:47.050
that the motivation behind
the collection being this sort

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:49.350
of desire to find
a material link

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:53.130
with my ancestral past
that, you know, is my own.

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:56.330
Is, you know, innately mine,
but also inaccessible in a way.

00:45:56.330 --> 00:46:05.510
So, trying to find some link
to my ancestors, my family.

or collector, understand
the sentimental nature

of this for all of us.

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:35.720
The fact that book collecting
can speak to another generation

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:39.450
with passion and personality
is very reassuring.
