00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.360
In this unit I'm going to talk about how geometric objects are define for

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.299
rendering. Along the way I'll discuss points, and vectors and how these get used

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.633
in computer graphics. Let's dive right in, there are two distinctive

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:15.395
mathematical objects that we use in computer graphics all the time points, and

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:19.260
vectors. I'm going to focus on the 3D aspect since that's what we commonly use

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.445
3D computer graphics. Working in 2 dimensions is similar, 3D is just 50% more

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:28.389
interesting. To start, we'll define a 3D point as a location in space. A 3D

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:33.156
vector defines a direction in space. A location in space has to be defined with

00:00:33.156 --> 00:00:37.092
respect to something else. For example on the earth we define a location in

00:00:37.092 --> 00:00:42.134
terms of its latitude,longitude and altitude. This is a spherical coordinate

00:00:42.134 --> 00:00:46.550
system, in that the lines of latitude and longitude wrap around a sphere, the

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.993
earth.
