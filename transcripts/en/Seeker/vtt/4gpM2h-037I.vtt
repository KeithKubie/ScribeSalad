00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.919
Anthony: Hey guys Anthony here for Dnews, in St
Petersburg at the Imagine Cup

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.580
A world young inventors competition. I
got Alex here with me from the Argentina

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.109
team.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.200
You guys created something that I think
is

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.420
really really amazing. Tell me a little
bit about it. Alejandro: Our application is called uSound.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.070
uSound is an application that takes
advantage of the phone's processing

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.210
capability to work

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.470
as at a digital aided program hearing aid. What it
does it lets people that has a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.810
hearing impairment, instead of using the standard hearing aid

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.050
uSound with this

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.930
headphones which are much cooler. Anthony: My
father wears a hearing aid and it was like a

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.730
three thousand dollar hearing aid. How
much does it cost to use your phone as a

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.020
hearing aid?

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.750
Alejandro: Well our application costs three dollars
and ninety nine cents which is

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.180
a little bit less than that. Anthony: So tell me a
little bit about how it works. Alejandro: What

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.590
it does it lets you

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.470
input audiometrics test that an audiologist gave you.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.949
Or if you don't want to you can go to a
quiet place and

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.800
do that uTest which basically does
the same that an audiologist does

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.250
but this is just an estimate. Afterwards
well uSound lets you like

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.880
correct the audio like
level it up and compensate all the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.650
frequency that you have a problem. You attend a call

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.850
this would recognize which ear has been
used. Anthony: Whatever ear you put it up to it

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.780
corrects

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.290
the algorithm for that ear. Alejandro: If you want to listen to music

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.619
you could use the uSound player and
listen to

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.409
the music to your specific level. What
your way does is it lets you

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.500
sit anywhere in the classroom and leave the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.520
phone whatever the professor says can
still listen. Anthony: How did you come up with the

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.030
idea? What made you guys wanna do this?

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.469
Alejandro: We have a friend of ours in
University and he was

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.880
actually really smart but he ended up
quitting University

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.920
because of his hearing impairment. We want
its

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.409
that people that has his problem where
we're able to a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.659
keep studying. So that's why we
decided to implement

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.240
uSounds. Anthony: Tell me about Argentina and
the tech community there.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.549
Alejandro: Well actually the tech community is
going up right now.

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.969
Alejandro: We are from a place, a really small
place called Cosquin in Argentina.

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.240
We have 35,000 people in there.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.880
And this is the first time someone
from that place

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.610
actually does something for the
world. Anthony: That's awesome. Alejandro: We are pretty happy about

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.150
that. Anthony: What are you looking to get out of
the Imagine Cup?

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.680
Alejandro: We can get to finish up this project and
we can

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.840
put it in the whole world so that
people with hearing impairment can

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.160
get access in some solution like this. Anthony:
Excellent.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.819
Well best of luck to you, Alex. And remember we have
more from the Imagine Cup

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.569
all week here on Dnews. There are so
many amazing inventions. Also,

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.459
amazing games. So go check out YouTube.com/rev3games

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.950
