1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,230
The Joe Rogan experience. Is
there something you wrote? Yeah,

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:06,060
that's in high school.
Oh my God.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,010
That you wanted to be a comedian.
It says, I want it to be,

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:11,820
I want to be a quantity.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,260
I want to stand up comic and to
work with comedy on television.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,620
Yeah. I'm willing to do whatever
it takes. Make It. Yeah.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,730
So that says I want to do anything. I
like what I'm hearing. Whatever it takes,

8
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:28,590
whatever it takes. Look at, I wrote below.

9
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:33,591
I want you to wear a track suit with
no underwear and meet me at the doc.

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,580
Got It. We're going to get on my
yacht and you got good time. Let's go.

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,560
And I got a part for you
to read my script. Oh,

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,880
you imagine some guy takes you out on
his, on his yacht. You're like, wow.

13
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:49,230
So you really think my tape was good.
My Ah, yeah, you tape was amazing.

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,410
We're going to show them,
what do we say? Our listening,

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,050
any ae brings you this script.

16
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,350
It tells you what's required of you.
Yeah.

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,520
And then you're out there in the middle
of the water bobbing around staring at

18
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,290
this guy and he got a couple of
glasses of wine. He was like,

19
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:08,550
I'm gonna make you a star. I need to get
my dick sucked. Okay. I get that shit.

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,160
I get it. I did write in high
school anything it takes.

21
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,470
Now imagine being a woman
and you're in that situation.

22
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:15,930
You think you're gonna be able
to sweet talk dot guy, right?

23
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,070
That's why you were flirting with them
and that's why you got close to him.

24
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,380
You're going to get a part,
you have to play him and gonna get apart.

25
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,170
Next thing you know you're on that ocean.
Well that feels creepy.

26
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:29,070
That feels rapey. It is rapey. Right?
When you're a dude, you'd be like,

27
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:32,250
fuck that guy. Fucked up.
Just sacrifice, man. That's,

28
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,860
I'm understanding for the role that
I'm saying. It's a different feeling.

29
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,783
Totally right,

30
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,290
but still dangerous because if the guy
finds out that you're not willing and

31
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:45,291
then you might be hostile and then he
might be hostile back like your two dudes.

32
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,340
One Dude want to get his
dick sucked by a dude,

33
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:51,570
but they're both two dudes and it's a
real hair raising situation for both of

34
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:53,640
you. What are you paying for
him? It's hair raising, right?

35
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:55,440
You try to get this guy to suck
your Dick and the guy said,

36
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:56,970
I'll fucking kill you and you're like,
Jesus,

37
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,930
now I've got to drive this guy back
in my boat. It just me and him,

38
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,620
a guy who said he would kill me in
a 20 foot long little boat. Yeah,

39
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:07,290
you got to sit while you got to make
him set up by the bow and you just drive

40
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:11,820
quiet. What do you do? Jump in the
water. That's where people kill people.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,800
Like you know he's going to tell people.
Yeah, totally. That's how he gets it.

42
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,860
That's why. That's where that
kid from Iowa goes missing.

43
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,430
Went to Hollywood for big dreams.
Never came back. Is that on the water?

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,920
Cement shoes my friend put on these shoes.
Yeah.

45
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,270
I guarantee that's happened.

46
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,170
But I guarantee you had guys tried to get
a guy to suck his dick and the guy who

47
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:32,310
tried to fight him and they fought
to the death. He kidding me.

48
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,800
I'm sure it's happening now. There's
got to, right as we're speaking,

49
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,910
there's got to be a nice
listening to this hallway.

50
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,340
Murder Jay guy is choking him to death.
He doesn't want anyone to know.

51
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,570
Don't go on the boat unless you really
know the guy. That's my message.

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,600
That's my message.
How well do you know the guy man or women,

53
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,960
if the guys that producer and he takes
you on the boats don't go on the boat.

54
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,930
I feel like that about, and how well do
you know the guy with the boat? Not that,

55
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:01,300
well, I'm not going on that guy's
boat. I was on a show once in,

56
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:06,010
there was a guy who was kind of a,
he was a, I don't want to be mean,

57
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,653
but he was sleazy.

58
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,950
You just Hollywood calling out
someone for being fucking sleazy.

59
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,600
Sleazebag but it's the, the
most stereotypical version
of, ah, yeah. And, uh,

60
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:19,000
there was a gal who is also
working on the television shown,

61
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,800
choose young and flirtatious
and the next thing you know,

62
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,000
they were on his boat for the weekend
working on the script and they came back.

63
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,620
We were like, wow, like you really
just said that. Yeah, we are,

64
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:33,280
we're guys creatively,
oh guys,

65
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,830
we're going to creatively just out in
the middle of the water and the water

66
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:38,800
gives me and Unis the water
makes me feel a type of way,

67
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,700
but it's like normal stuff. Like that's
what people did for US business. Yeah.

68
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,823
He used to be,

69
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,430
but Jamie wanted to bring this up because
you can sort of talking about that and

70
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,410
we never, oh, well this was a different
subject, but related. I'll save it.

71
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,740
This is a Ed buck. Do you
know who that guy is? Who?

72
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,180
I know he's like this democratic.
Uh, he's a a donor. Oh, right.

73
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:05,800
Oh yes. Right. And they were 10 to
two dudes had been found dead there,

74
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,320
um,
from drug overdoses.

75
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,450
So though they'd come over and one
guy said that, what did he say?

76
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,520
That. I don't know what
they've said, but like they,

77
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,940
I think what makes him do drugs or,

78
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,850
or he's taken them in while
they're already super high
and he's helping them out

79
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:25,580
or something. They die and they ended
up dying. Why bother? There comes,

80
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,620
he's claiming that he's helping
to people that think coincidence.

81
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,750
Maybe he's telling the truth.

82
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,270
Maybe he goes out there and
finds really high people.

83
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,460
Nice people trying to save people
in the middle of the night.

84
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,220
What are you cynical bro? Yeah,
Dude. What do you think is happening?

85
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,930
You want me to take a wild guess?
Yeah,

86
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,600
I bet he goes out looking for people that
are real fucked up to get back to his

87
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:47,530
apartment to get some
fucking Dick. What? No Way.

88
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,070
And then that side that's, and then
they say, do you have any more drugs?

89
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,930
And he goes,
you bet I got more fucking drugs.

90
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:58,240
They do more drugs together and they die
and he dies and he stays alive. Whoa.

91
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,100
You sure? Case closed, your honor. Are
you direct? I rest my second gentleman.

92
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,000
Mr. Buck. Okay, well it looks
like a fine man. Don't show that.

93
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,890
Looks like he doesn't do anything,

94
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,910
anything like he's got a nice gold
tooth shining in the back of his mouth.

95
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,810
Like a,
what's his name,

96
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,160
the wet bandits from home alone
investigators found multiple sex toys,

97
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:22,150
multiple syringes and clear plastic
bags with suspected suspected

98
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:27,100
methamphetamine in a toolbox
roll cabinet in the living room.

99
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,830
He's got a tool box fill with syringes
and sex toys. Let's go to work.

100
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,990
Clear plastic bags with meth more has
been homeless and how that worked out.

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,990
How it says Ma bags.

102
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,350
Clear plastic bags like more than many.

103
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,240
He's got bags of speed.

104
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,950
He'd been homeless and and worked
as an escort. Yeah, that's,

105
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,240
he was on that Gigolo show. Season Four.
He was one of the main guy. He's the guy.

106
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,640
I become addicted to.
Drugs in the Bush is the one to thank you.

107
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:01,070
Gave me my first
injection of crystal meth.

108
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:05,480
I become addicted to drugs and
the worst one at that. Well,

109
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,600
I don't know if that's true. Yeah,
but it's crazy story that the,

110
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,020
what we do know is true as two
people died over there. Yeah.

111
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,150
That's fucking insane. He's
like, hey man, just gee,

112
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,720
is there, there's different standards,
right? Like here's the, here's the thing,

113
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,100
like if that guy,

114
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,470
if he was a heterosexual guy and
two women had died at his house,

115
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,720
prison for life, what are the odds
that they wouldn't arrest him?

116
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,810
It zero. Zero, zero. Zero. If, if,

117
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,360
if one woman is found dead in
your fucking apartment. Yeah.

118
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,380
If you go going to go to Paris, hookers
and shoot them up with Meth, yeah,

119
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,790
you go to jail, you go to prison.
But if you pick up mail, okay.

120
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,720
It's like what we were talking about
earlier. Yeah. If it's a guy like, ah,

121
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:50,510
you're a Russian model, you came
over here to that work, Bro.

122
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,040
Fuck the old ladies come on. Like,
that's, it's true with these guys.

123
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,860
Two guys are dead and
everybody's like, Hey, you know,

124
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,910
that's the fucking game they're playing.
They a play in that shoot the math game.

125
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,020
Munch. You shoot John, you, he's
only killed two guys. What the fuck?
