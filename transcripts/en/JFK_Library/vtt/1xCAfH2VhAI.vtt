LIZZY COOPER DAVIS:
For showing up.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.600
We appreciate it.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.290
And we have a lot to
talk about, clearly.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.380
There's two quick
remembrances that we'd

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.280
like to do before we get
started that we thought

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.700
would be an important way to
frame our conversation today.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.280
The first remembrance is
a land acknowledgment,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.220
a practice of beginning public
gatherings by acknowledging

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.280
and honoring the native
land on which we sit,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.670
one that some folks have been
doing for a very long time.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.930
For others of us,
it's a newer practice.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.900
But one connected
to this conversation

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.830
about understanding and
undoing racism and oppression,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.530
which as I'm sure we'll talk
about, part of that work

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.850
is changing our sense of
how we tell our story of who

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.330
and where we are.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.830
So this land acknowledgment
is one we use at Emerson.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.010
It says, we are on the
ancestral and unseated lands

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.280
of the Massachusett people
whose name was appropriated

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.360
by this commonwealth.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.910
We pay respect to the
Massachusett elders

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.380
past and present.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.440
We acknowledge the
truth of violence

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.540
perpetrated in the
name of this country

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.000
and make a commitment to
uncovering that truth.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.820
The second remembrance
we want to offer

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.990
is for John O'Neal, who we lost
just last month on February

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.740
14th.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.180
John was a co-founder in 1963
of the Free Southern Theater,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.510
which was a cultural arm of the
Student Nonviolent Coordinating

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.570
Committee, or SNCC, during
the Civil Rights Movement.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.480
In the 1980s, he changed
the Free Southern Theater

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.760
into Junebug Productions,
a company that

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.170
still lives and works very hard
in New Orleans around issues

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.660
of oppression and injustice.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.000
Without him, we
would not be here.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.400
This conversation
would not be here.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.280
So we want to honor him.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.350
Keith, tell us more
about this play.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.090
I haven't seen it.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.990
I've read it.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.570
It's an extraordinary story.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.000
Tell us a little bit
more about where it goes

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.190
and what it's urging
us to grapple with.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.440
KEITH HAMILTON COBB: It's
about to be seven years old.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.070
And it will be when we bring
it to New York this fall.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.070
And American Moor tells the
story, in simplest terms,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.900
of a large, powerful,
middle-middle-aged

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.080
African-American male who
finds himself auditioning

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.280
for the role of Shakespeare's
iconic black eponymous

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.450
hero, Othello, with all
of the ups and downs

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.500
that that introduces
to any conversation.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.690
And as is most
often the case, he

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.240
finds himself auditioning
opposite a much

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.830
younger white director
who proceeds to tell him

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.930
who and how Othello should be.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.970
And so in the 10
minutes of the audition,

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.300
he has an hour and a
half inner monologue

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.880
that the audience is privy to.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.180
And that is the
crux of the play.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.700
And of course, that
allows us a platform

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:14.410
to discuss issues of race
and implicit racial bias,

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.930
issues of empathy, whose
perspectives are important,

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.600
who gets to make art.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.710
Issues of love.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.800
What does it look like?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.670
How is it manifested between us?

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.000
Issues of the American theater.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.140
What theater are we making?

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.040
Why are we making it?

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.630
How are we making it?

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.520
For what reasons
is it being made?

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:44.380
Even when we are reaching out
in supposedly directions meant

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.680
to support and uplift
us as a culture,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.320
is that happening for
the proper reasons?

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.000
Are we doing the introspection?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.430
And if we are, are our support
mechanisms strong enough

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:05.350
to support us in the muddy,
icky, difficult work of getting

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.700
at the truth in plays
about these issues?

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.900
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Yeah.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.760
I have to say that,
just in reading it,

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.589
I was reminded of Du
Bois's 1903 statement

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.910
about double consciousness
and this experience of twoness

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.750
that black folks and other
folks, hyphenated Americans,

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.580
have of having both always
the experience of ourself

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.460
and the experience of
how we're being viewed.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.335
This peculiar
experience, he calls it.

00:04:36.335 --> 00:04:38.210
And another thing so
wonderful about the play

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.800
is how it takes a very personal
experience of the audition room

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.400
and uses that as a window
into all of the complexities,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.080
just as you said.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.840
David, I wonder what
you want to add,

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.750
what the view is from
there as far as being--

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.220
not in the audition room but
being an institutional leader.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.200
DAVID HOWSE: So
I'll start by saying

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.250
that I was never going to be
that one who talked about race.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.610
I spent a lot of time not
trying to have the conversation.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.280
But as they say, the things
that you try to stay away from

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.740
are often the things
that you're called to.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.200
And so here I am,
having this conversation

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.640
with you and with you.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.490
And it's a pleasure to
be in the conversation.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.610
I'd like to say that
I've been exempt

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.690
from racial oppression or
aggressions or inequities.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.670
But that would not be the case.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:34.480
In fact, both as a
performer and as an arts

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.250
administrator, as a leader of
various cultural organizations,

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.110
I've experienced its
burden on many occasions.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.740
And, much like this inner
voice, this character

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.840
that we hear throughout the play
who has some anger, some rage,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.820
I have to say that there exists
anger within me at times.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.290
It was James Baldwin who
said, and I paraphrase,

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.170
but if you're a Negro
and consciously living

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.900
in this world, you live with
a constant state of rage.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.750
And I jokingly tell people
that my rage sits right here.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.610
And it's not the fact that
we have anger or rage.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.400
It's what I choose
to do with that rage.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.180
We can actually
engage it consciously,

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.190
or we can surrender to it.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.290
And I choose to
engage it consciously.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.230
So we are experiencing
a time where

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.910
we are no different from past
history but in a new moment

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.790
where we're experiencing these
aggressions in different ways.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.100
And I'll say, one of
the experiences that I

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.470
had when I joined the
theater world originally,

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.050
from the music world,
and I was invited

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.340
to my first meeting of theater
directors here in the region.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.880
And so I readied myself, and
I went over to the meeting.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.630
And just to set the context,
I walk into the room,

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.030
and the room- the
tables are white.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.297
The chairs are white.

00:06:56.297 --> 00:06:57.130
The walls are white.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.690
You know where this is going.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.930
And everybody at
the table was white.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.090
And so, of course, I take my
rightful place at the table.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.770
And a very kind and
well-meaning, I believe,

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.850
woman, white woman, leaned
over to me and said kindly,

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.860
this is the director's meeting.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.180
To which I was consciously
engaging my rage

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.920
and said to her, I know.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.170
It's shocking, isn't it?

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.520
And I left it at that.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.850
So these are one of the many
experiences that we have

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.160
that we have to
understand personally.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.890
I have to understand how to
deal with it, how to manage it,

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.410
and to hold onto my dignity
in those situations.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.860
And so I appreciate
and certainly can

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.620
connect with this
particular character

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.390
in Keith's role in the play, of
someone who harbors feelings.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.540
Not always, but on
regular occasion,

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.580
and how to manage
that and engage it

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.830
in a way that
honors my experience

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.908
and then connects
me to other people.

00:07:56.908 --> 00:07:57.950
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Yeah.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.887
I really appreciate that
language around rage.

00:07:59.887 --> 00:08:02.220
And it's good to know that
your rage that's right there.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.428
DAVID HOWSE: It's right here.

00:08:03.428 --> 00:08:05.015
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Noted.

00:08:05.015 --> 00:08:08.810
And to not deny that it's
there but to recognize

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.920
that we have a choice about how
we engage and respond to it.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.840
And so for all of
us up here, we've

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.210
made a choice to do
that with theater,

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.190
with the performing arts.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.670
And so I think we had discussed
the importance of beginning

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.800
by talking about, well,
why is that the choice?

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.200
Of all the tools that
we have as individuals,

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.280
as a city, as a society,
to grapple with this stuff,

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.320
why theater?

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.250
Part of the origin story of
the Free Southern Theater

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:40.490
is John O'Neal and other
artists who made the choice

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.100
to join SNCC and
go south in the 60s

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.740
were grappling with these
two identities, their artist

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.250
self and their activist self,
and how to reconcile that.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:53.180
And John said, well, if theater
means anything anywhere,

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.580
it ought to mean something here.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.940
And then they went about the
work of figuring that out.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:03.980
So continuing that question,
what does it mean here and now?

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.870
Why is it the tool?

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.970
How and why is theater useful?

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.920
DAVID HOWSE: I'll just
say for me, it's theater.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.270
But arts in general,
I think, are a vehicle

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.350
that allows us to have
a shared experience,

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.120
to let down our guards
just for a minute

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.480
and walk in someone
else's shoes,

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.900
to actually see each other and
see our common humanity if we

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.180
choose to, in a
way that we don't

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.130
have in our daily experiences.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:39.070
We live in isolated communities,
in isolated experiences.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.500
And I think the arts has a way
for us to see and experience

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.600
things in a new way.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.210
And again, more importantly,
to let down our guard

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.610
and take that moment
to open up our hearts

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.850
and open up our minds
to experience something

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:59.400
in ways that we don't have those
experiences on a daily walk.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.830
And so for me, it's
been a real tool.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.080
And again, there's
an argument on art

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.950
for art's sake and art as a
vehicle for something else.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.570
Yes, and, right?

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.700
If art for art's sake
matters, I believe in that.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.430
But I also think if
it has an opportunity

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.470
to connect us more
deeply to who we

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.690
are as individuals
and as a community,

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.940
then why would we miss
out on that opportunity?

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.610
So a lot of the work
that we do at ArtsEmerson

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.650
really comes out of that spirit.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.140
We made a commitment
several years ago

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.690
to be a part of
a citywide effort

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.150
around civic transformation
through race.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.440
And so a lot of the
work that we present

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.088
comes out of that commitment.

00:10:39.088 --> 00:10:41.380
But that's just to say that
there are many conversation

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.470
that we have through the
theater and many issues

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.670
that we try to tackle.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.440
But knowing that we
live here in Boston,

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.320
and we live in a society
where the fabric,

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.810
the American fabric, the fabric
that keeps Boston together,

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.960
is constantly being eroded
by this racial tension.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.420
We've chosen to engage it.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.820
But the common thread, I
think, through our work

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.580
is this one of common humanity.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.940
And I often quote the
poets because I love them,

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.640
but Maya Angelou-- it's as if
she were speaking for me when

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.490
she says, in all of my work
and everything that I do,

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.320
I choose to believe
that we as humans are

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.960
more alike than we are unalike.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.910
And then to use that statement
to tear down the walls

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.280
that we build between us
because we are different.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.400
And so we are choosing
to use a theater platform

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.970
as a prompt to conversations
that actually allow

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:33.480
us to connect more deeply
to one another in an effort

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.030
to create a more thriving,
more vibrant, more

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.640
equitable, and more just,
and more compassionate--

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.660
I could go on.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.280
A more compassionate
community for everybody,

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.430
not just for those
who are typically

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.710
ones to be patrons of the
arts but for everyone.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.190
And so I could go
on about that role,

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:55.050
but I think it's a critical tool
that we have at our disposal

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.090
in our communities
that we often leave off

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.000
the table when we're thinking
about civic challenges.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.550
And so we are here to
say, let's make arts

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.250
a part of that conversation.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:04.680
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Great.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.180
Thank you.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.800
Keith, how about you?

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.550
Why theater?

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.050
What's useful about having this
conversation in the theater?

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.467
KEITH HAMILTON
COBB: What he said.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.720
The difference
between us, David,

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.130
is that I wasn't called
to do anything else,

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.105
to express my humanity
any other way.

00:12:24.105 --> 00:12:25.480
When you were
being introduced, I

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.060
was sitting here
listening to all

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.510
of the ways in which you
could have applied yourself

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.460
and still can.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.250
All that I do is towards
artistic expression

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.300
of some form.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.440
I make furniture.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.010
Now there might be some way that
I can make furniture and lend

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.910
it to this discussion
or it can reflect

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.470
this discussion in some way.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:53.060
But theater seemed to be the
most ready form of expression.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:57.050
And if we're talking
about the actor using

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.260
what his experience
is, her experiences,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:05.560
to embody other characters,
I can only start with myself.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:10.210
And myself is this experience
here in this culture.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:11.950
So that flavors everything.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:17.830
And depending on how aware
the ensemble and the director

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:22.810
and the production
team is to that,

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:29.980
then our social activism
becomes evident in whatever play

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.750
we pick up to do on some level.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:38.290
DAVID HOWSE: In many
ways, you're very humble.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.050
But in my experience,
and it's been

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.270
said that artists are the
gatekeepers of truth, right?

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.640
Civilization's radical voice.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.630
And so artists actually
speak truth to us

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.100
and can see the world--

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.420
very special people with
sensitivities that some of us

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:56.260
don't have.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.500
But then to reflect
who we are back to us

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.660
and allow us to engage
it, not because you're

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.630
trying to do social work,
but you're literally just

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.370
trying to show us who we are.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.840
And it's our choice
to engage that.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.485
I think being close to art--
if you're not close to artists,

00:14:10.485 --> 00:14:11.860
you need to get
close to artists,

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.670
because they will
tell you the truth.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:16.027
And if you listen deeply
enough, you will see yourself

00:14:16.027 --> 00:14:17.110
and you'll see each other.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.600
So I feel that artists
have a special role

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.660
and have for decades
and years, years.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.690
A role in society that
allows us to enter

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:30.180
a space that wouldn't exist
without those storytellers.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.220
So that's who you are.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.262
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Yeah.

00:14:32.262 --> 00:14:34.100
Across cultures, as well.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.760
What has your experience
been doing this play?

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.980
Speaking these kinds
of truths, looking

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.260
for these kinds of truths.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.170
The impact it's had,
conversations it started.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.006
How has it been touring
this conversation?

00:14:47.006 --> 00:14:50.107
KEITH HAMILTON COBB: This
is a very particular play.

00:14:50.107 --> 00:14:50.690
Listen, y'all.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.760
This is an extraordinary play.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.490
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS:
Extraordinary.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.440
KEITH HAMILTON COBB: Yeah.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.300
And I need you to
know right here

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.010
that I don't say that
about anything else

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.040
in my entire body of work.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:08.520
And I will not until something
beyond this play comes along.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.230
But it is unique
in several ways.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.400
It is unique in the nature
of the stage picture.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.300
It is unique in its
voice and the story

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.520
it tells, the experience that
it tries to impart to you.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.510
And it does it in some
ways that I can't even

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.130
sit here and say,
hey, I'm a genius.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:25.850
I did all that.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.200
I was sort of a conduit.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.280
It happened.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.240
And immediately, people
began talking back

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.540
to it who were not
African-American male actors,

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.110
who I thought were the only
people going to like this play.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:43.040
They were from all other walks
of life and age spectrums

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:50.810
and sexual spectrums
and racial identities.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.615
And talking about how
they saw themselves.

00:15:53.615 --> 00:15:55.490
So this gets back to
what you were saying, is

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:59.600
they were all looking at
me doing me and saying,

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.870
that truth is true to all of us.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:08.750
And that has been
the salient energy.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.910
It affects people
very viscerally.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:13.560
And they need to speak back,
and they need to speak up to it.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.410
So it generates discussion.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.980
It also answers questions
that don't get asked.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.610
I think we are
perpetually, at least

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.880
now at this point in
time, we're reaching

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.360
some sort of odd
critical mass of energy

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.070
on the race issue
in this country

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.440
and what it's going to do.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.450
Like global warming, like any
other crisis that's pending.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.390
It's something that we're
all feeling on some level

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.970
and trying to talk about it.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:46.640
But it's very, very difficult
for a myriad of reasons.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.840
One of the biggest to me,
one of the most salient,

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:58.550
is that the heinousness of the
crime upon which all of this is

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.130
established and built
cannot be discussed.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:03.110
It almost has to
remain nameless because

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.000
of the size and nature of it.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.760
When we think that all
of this is predicated

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.089
upon the ownership of
black bodies, every dime

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:16.250
that every one of us has in our
pocket somehow comes from that,

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.750
then it is impossible
to own that.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:18.849
It is impossible.

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:21.470
It is far beyond inconvenient.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.060
It is just not a
discussion that we

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.130
have the time to have
when life is tough enough.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.630
And we have to get
through our days,

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:28.280
and we have to get
to the next place.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.690
And there's all
sorts of other crises

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:30.773
that we have to deal with.

00:17:34.378 --> 00:17:34.920
I don't know.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.045
I lost my train of thought.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.870
I get started with that--

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.430
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Yeah.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:47.470
When you go to the trauma
that all of this is built on,

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.680
I wasn't sure if
you were talking

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.220
about this, the United States
of America, or the Americas.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.230
Or if you're talking about
the American theater,

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.147
or if you were talking
about black performance

00:17:57.147 --> 00:17:58.440
in particular.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.980
I wonder if either one of you
want to take us there and talk

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.020
about that twoness
of being an artist,

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.400
a truth teller but also being a
black artist and truth teller.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.750
Wrestling and reckoning with
the origin of black performance,

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:17.700
which is slave ships, auction
blocks, minstrel shows,

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:18.390
all of that.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:19.340
Yeah?

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.900
KEITH HAMILTON COBB: Yeah.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:32.670
Just to put a cap on
that last thought,

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.630
audiences come to this play
unable to ask the questions,

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.730
because the questions
are so big and so dark

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.980
and mean taking on
such responsibility

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.650
if the answers are
not convenient.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:47.760
And so the play says, just
sit and watch and listen.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.210
And it answers a lot of the
questions that don't get asked.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:54.120
I find that audiences, having
this communal experience

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:59.610
in that forum, feel almost like
they've been given the gift

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.710
to feel and understand
things that is not

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:07.050
convenient to live on any level
outside of the theater space.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:11.080
So that's where I
was going with that.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.080
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Yeah Did
you want to respond to that?

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.830
DAVID HOWSE: Yeah.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:20.920
I'll speak from my
role as a presenter

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:25.590
and as an African-American
man in the presenting world.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.620
I live in conflict most of the
time, this dual consciousness.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.180
And when you talk
about the stories

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.490
that we get to tell in
the American theater, who

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:37.140
gets to tell them and what
gets told, I'm in conflict.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.280
And I'm of two minds.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.560
On one hand, a
lot of the stories

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.562
that we tell about
the other experience,

00:19:42.562 --> 00:19:44.520
whether that's a black
experience or any person

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.170
of color experience,
is one that's

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.630
steeped in suffering and trauma.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:52.440
And there's an important
aspect of making visible

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.740
that suffering and that trauma.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.330
Because in telling
those stories,

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.330
we are confirming that
we are indeed humans.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.900
So that's on one hand.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:06.540
But on the other hand, we are
not defined by that suffering

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.820
and by that trauma.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:12.150
And people of color, and
black people and others,

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.050
are bigger than the suffering
that has defined them

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.350
and the suffering that
they've endured over time.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.270
And so I find
myself in conflict,

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:23.820
wanting to be able to tell
the stories that say, see?

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.650
This is a hard experience.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.890
But also saying, but I am
so much bigger than that.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.590
We have resilient stories and
stories of triumph and stories

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:32.700
of celebration.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.710
Unfortunately, people
are not as comfortable

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:40.730
with those stories of triumph
and joy and celebration.

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.860
There's a deep
comfort that makes me

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.710
uncomfortable in the suffering.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:46.910
I call it black suffering.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.452
Other people call
it black suffering.

00:20:48.452 --> 00:20:50.190
Of delivering that
pain and drama.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:53.300
There's a comfort and there's
an expectation around it.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.340
And in many ways,
by only offering

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.610
one story of an experience,
we are in many ways

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:03.120
confirming the very things that
we are trying to break apart.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.870
And so when I'm actually looking
for work with my colleagues

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:09.410
at ArtsEmerson, we're
looking for both stories.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.797
And I have to say that it's
harder to find those stories.

00:21:12.797 --> 00:21:14.630
And when we find those
stories that are just

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:18.760
talking about celebration
and success, people say,

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.800
there's no story there.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.930
There's no drama.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.340
Where's the conflict?

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.710
Because we're looking for
those confirming statements,

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.310
those prejudices and
deeply ingrained social

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.860
understandings of what
others' experiences are.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:36.370
So I sit in conflict with
this dual consciousness

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.212
and work actively to
support and promote work

00:21:39.212 --> 00:21:40.420
that is telling both stories.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.315
And again, I'm not
saying in any way

00:21:42.315 --> 00:21:44.440
that we're trying to hide
a part of the experience,

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.940
because that is true and it's
lived and it needs to be told.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.210
But it's just not
the only story.

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:51.700
And I'd be interested,
Keith, because

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.270
in the American theater,
traditionally audiences

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:56.920
have been predominately white.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.320
And that still is the case
in many, many theaters

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.180
around the country.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.490
And the conflict
lies in that we have

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.620
to make sure that the
masses, the people who

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.660
are supporting
those theaters, are

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.110
comfortable in
these conversations.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.020
So how we then navigate
those two stories

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.960
and bring an audience along
is a constant struggle

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.260
and a constant opportunity
at the same time.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.660
So for me, I look at
these two opportunities.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:27.130
And I imagine, as a creative,
as a black creative,

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:28.540
I want both stories to be told.

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.720
I don't want to be
defined by that suffering.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.910
And if I want to just
write a play about love,

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:34.990
it just is about love.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:37.407
It doesn't have to be about
black love or black suffering.

00:22:37.407 --> 00:22:38.590
Love is just love, right?

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.920
But sometimes we're not
able to tell that story

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.990
without the other lens on it.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:47.950
And so this is the thing that
I struggle with as I actually

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.250
look to bring work
to a community that

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:55.600
is trusting us to actually
tell the full story

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.860
of the experience.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.902
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Yeah.

00:22:57.902 --> 00:22:59.650
I'm reminded, Keith,
of one of the--

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:03.190
I think it's from the opening
stage directions or opening

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.080
note in your script,
which you all

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.370
won't get to read or
experience when you see it.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.500
But you actually
have a note in there

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.260
to another actor who may do
it, or another director that

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.650
may work on it, about how
to approach the audience,

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.420
and exactly what you're saying.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:22.960
This relationship of, it's
going to be tough, y'all.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.150
And I approach it
with love and comfort.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.770
What is the
relationship to comfort?

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.830
It's, we're going to
struggle, but my heart

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.050
is open to you and for you.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:36.940
How do you navigate all of that
in the 90 minutes of the show?

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.490
We're hearing a bit
about David's experience

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.830
of that relationship between
comfort and challenge,

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:45.130
how you stay in relationship
through struggle, basically.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:48.250
How do you do that as a
performer in this show?

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:49.510
How do you think about that?

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.670
KEITH HAMILTON COBB:
Just in this show,

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:55.060
just in terms of pure
mechanics of the piece,

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:59.710
there is a prologue of
which you saw 3/4 just now.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.630
And there's another
couple of pages.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:05.043
And at that point, the director
calls him in to this audition.

00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:07.210
And the audience then follows
him into this audition

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:08.920
and goes on this
journey with him.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.398
And in that prologue,
he has done this work.

00:24:11.398 --> 00:24:12.940
And if it were
another sort of space,

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.315
I would be up
close to you, and I

00:24:14.315 --> 00:24:18.310
would be speaking more
conversationally with you.

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:23.800
And they understand after that
eight pages has transpired

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:29.960
that he's not typical in what--

00:24:34.405 --> 00:24:38.350
if there's such thing as an
average American white person,

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:45.970
and you said to them average
African-American urban male,

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.410
they would have an image.

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:52.660
And this fella, because
of how he speaks, because

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:57.230
of how he's dressed, because
of what he says does,

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.120
is atypical to that.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.880
And so there's this sense of
cracking open or catching them

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.300
off guard and then
talking in terms that,

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.280
again, are very embracing.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.690
Come with me.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.820
Let's explore this together.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.320
And they do.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.740
And again, I don't quite
know how we facilitated that.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.268
But it just tends to work.

00:25:17.268 --> 00:25:18.310
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Yeah.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.810
Yeah.

00:25:21.325 --> 00:25:24.670
DAVID HOWSE: I think there's a
role for the theater, actually,

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:27.490
to actually make space
and prepare that space so

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:32.080
that conversation between
the actor and the audience

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.750
is an authentic one.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.750
Oftentimes, we don't know
how to receive the work.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:41.240
And so I think it's up to
the theater to actually bring

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.038
their audience on
a journey to say,

00:25:43.038 --> 00:25:44.330
here's what we're experiencing.

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.300
And here's why we think it's
important for us to know it.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.620
And I I'm not sure that
audiences are always prepared.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.580
They see the headline.

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:53.390
They see a trailer.

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:54.350
And they run in.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:58.810
But the journey
hasn't been happening

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:02.050
for that audience as a community
to actually be able to embrace.

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:04.300
And we then leave
that experience

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.960
in all kinds of ways.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.960
And I think this is where
I feel like it's part

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.730
of our responsibility
as theater makers,

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:12.460
as presenters, to make sure
that we're in conversation

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.580
and dialogue with the
artists and with the audience

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.060
around what we are trying
to do collectively.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.810
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS:
Can you say more about

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:22.150
how ArtsEmerson
thinks about that?

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.630
Preparing an audience,
getting ready for

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.690
and continuing a conversation,
maybe with each show

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.340
or across a season, even?

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.520
What is it to really think
of the audience as somebody

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.720
in the conversation?

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.470
DAVID HOWSE: Yeah.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.780
So I don't know that
we're unique in this,

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.390
but I think we
think of ourselves--

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.330
we talk about
curatorial listening.

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:44.500
So we talk deeply
with the audiences

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.553
here and understand, what are
the things that are relevant

00:26:47.553 --> 00:26:48.970
and mattering to
you in your life?

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.010
And what we try to do
is then reflect that

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:52.510
on what we put on the stage.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:55.360
And we often go back and say,
have we gotten that right?

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.510
But we talk a lot
about the values

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.380
that we live in at ArtsEmerson.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:03.220
And we want everything that you
see to reflect those values.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.900
And so for those
audience members

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.650
who are with us in
multiple shows, again,

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:11.730
you can come to one show
and have a great experience.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.678
And we celebrate that.

00:27:13.678 --> 00:27:15.220
But for those people
who are actually

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:19.120
tracking what we are trying
to accomplish with our mission

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.780
around fostering this calm and
connectivity around difference,

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.830
I think it's a different
responsibility.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.070
So we do have
moments where we're

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.740
bringing the artist into
the community to actually

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:33.820
talk to the audience, to extend
a genuine invitation to people.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.070
But we're also then giving
the audience an opportunity

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:37.612
to be with that
artist to talk about,

00:27:37.612 --> 00:27:39.070
what are you trying to create?

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:41.350
And we do these through
engagement tools that

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:42.880
are outside of the theater.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.590
A play reading book
club, where people

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.050
who have no experience,
perhaps, with the theater

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:49.270
are invited to read the
play, to study the play,

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.280
to work with a teaching
artist, to actually

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.370
engage with the artist, to
perform and see the play.

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:56.110
By the time they get
into that theater,

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.300
they more about
the show than I do,

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.030
because they've spent
time in community

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:03.470
with people who have different
perspectives from them.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.400
So it's not like
we're all the same.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.150
I'm seeing this play
differently from you.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.610
And we're actually engaging
and creating dialogue.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:14.800
And so when I say that we think
about the art as a prompt,

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.850
we're literally using it
as just the first step.

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:22.270
And what happens for us
is, the conversation that

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:25.810
stems from that, is
really the point for us.

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.990
And again, those who are
tracking what we're doing

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:32.920
are seeing the energy and
want to be a part of something

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:38.230
that they're not seeing in
their own individual lives.

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:41.490
KEITH HAMILTON COBB:
It's a daunting task.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:43.870
What I think I
hear you describing

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:49.000
is that level of engagement
and community interaction

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.630
is really a reinvention
of the theater experience

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.100
in a particular community.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.437
And because we can't
do that in the nation,

00:29:00.437 --> 00:29:02.020
there's all this
other stuff out there

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.000
called theater that
is what theater

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.500
has become for Americans
that doesn't do that.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:14.680
It does not hold the same
place as a cultural nurturer.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.650
Other places, it is in
certain communities.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:22.462
And so you have a
Herculean thing.

00:29:22.462 --> 00:29:24.920
DAVID HOWSE: Well, it's the
work that we've been called to.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.810
And again, it's not
saying that every theater

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:28.820
needs to do it like we do it.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.980
We often ask the question,
what's to be done

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.540
and what's ours to do?

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.810
And ArtsEmerson was founded at
a time where this city was going

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:39.680
through a transformation, where
there was more people of color

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.950
than white people.

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:45.350
And in 2010 when
we were founded,

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:48.080
there are tons of theaters
doing amazing work.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.060
We had to try to figure
out what was uniquely

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.610
ours to do in this
city, in this moment

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:55.920
and how could we be a part of
rewriting the city's narrative.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.710
And so we've taken
it upon ourselves

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:00.280
to develop and promote
and support artists

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.780
who are telling the stories
that support the work that we're

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.550
trying to do here in the city.

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:06.440
So again, it's not
for everyone to do.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.480
And it's not that
we're any better.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.020
We have just a different
focus and a different vision

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.970
for what theater can become.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.700
We don't sit in judgment of
our colleagues or anyone else.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.160
But this is the work
that we've chosen to do.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.010
And we've been privileged
with amazing venues,

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:23.960
with amazing
artists, with a very

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:27.260
loyal and committed and
curious, more than anything,

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.480
audience who
understands what they

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.990
don't know and want to learn
about others' perspectives.

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:34.800
So again, it's Herculean.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.260
And it's just one part.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.960
I'm not saying that arts
is going to cure it all.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.640
We are part of a movement.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.430
And we believe that
arts has a role, just

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:47.865
like all the other interventions
in society's issues.

00:30:47.865 --> 00:30:49.490
KEITH HAMILTON COBB:
I understand that,

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:50.810
and I admire it.

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:52.610
And I think you're right.

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:58.500
I just wish-- for one who
feels that theater is almost

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:02.040
a cure-all, if it were
something that we could all

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.800
come to and engage in.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:08.240
And this sort of
homogenization and co-optation

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.410
of American theater
as a business,

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.280
as purely a business
concern, means

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:18.110
that you give audiences
what they're going to like.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:19.540
And that is insidious.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.540
That gets into things--

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.240
when I was doing a
production of Lynn Nottage's

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.330
Ruined in Denver--

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:27.868
and I had seen it off-Broadway.

00:31:27.868 --> 00:31:28.910
And she won the Pulitzer.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:30.590
And I thought, it's a good play.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.660
I enjoyed the production.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.120
But I got in it, and
I was playing the head

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.230
of the government forces.

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:43.698
This English-educated
Congolese man

00:31:43.698 --> 00:31:44.990
representing the wealthy class.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.630
And he's just this
sadistic monster.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:52.850
And I would go home and
look at YouTube testimonials

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:58.040
from women involved in the
mineral conflicts in Congo who

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:01.208
would look at camera,
and all the pain they'd

00:32:01.208 --> 00:32:03.500
experienced, that there was
no room for crying anymore.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:03.860
There's no room.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.120
It was all very deadpan.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.818
And they would relate
these experiences

00:32:06.818 --> 00:32:08.360
of these various
factions of soldiers

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.568
coming through their village.

00:32:09.568 --> 00:32:11.650
And the heinous ways in
which babies were killed

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:15.240
and children were
raped and bayonets--

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.030
and I would go back
to rehearsal and I'd

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:20.750
say, how can we present
that to the audience?

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:26.870
How do we show that that
is what our iPhones cause

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:28.183
and our iPads?

00:32:28.183 --> 00:32:29.600
and Because those
are the minerals

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.825
that go into these devices that
they are being killed over.

00:32:33.825 --> 00:32:36.200
And they didn't really have
an answer, other than to say,

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.370
well, you know, it's a musical.

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:38.412
And I said, yeah, I know.

00:32:38.412 --> 00:32:41.390
I know she wrote a musical.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:43.130
But it's about this thing.

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:44.120
And it's real.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.430
And how do we create the danger?

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:49.310
If they're all coming to commune
with us and make theater,

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:51.560
and we're making it together,
it's not just us up here

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.935
and you out there, and we're
presenting something to you.

00:32:53.935 --> 00:32:55.850
But we're involved
in this experience,

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:58.220
another oral
storytelling tradition.

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.410
How do we create the
energy that makes us all

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:03.710
leave thinking
something has to change?

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.290
Or are we just entertained
because it's happy

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:08.930
and it has a happy ending?

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:13.310
And I worry about
that because of what

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:17.450
we tend to do with just about
everything in our culture.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:22.810
Anything that we can co-opt
and turn into money, we do.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:24.810
DAVID HOWSE: And both
things can be true, right?

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:25.852
We do need entertainment.

00:33:25.852 --> 00:33:27.770
We need places to
go and release.

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:29.450
But we have to have a balance.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:31.010
And I think what
I hear you saying

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:35.080
is hungry for more of the
counterbalance of just

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:35.900
pure entertainment.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.220
Things that are safe
and are going to make us

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.762
feel comfortable and reconfirm
everything we want to believe.

00:33:39.762 --> 00:33:43.250
Where is the space for real,
honest dialogue around things

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:45.050
that don't make us feel good?

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:46.790
And I think that's
where we are now.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:50.330
We're in a moment-- and just
indulge me for a second--

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:53.930
where there's a lot of talk
in the American theater,

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:57.170
in arts in general, around
the role that race plays.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.490
Diversity, equity, inclusion.

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:01.040
Everyone has an
initiative right now.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.860
And my fear is that the
talk around these issues

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:12.050
is a cover for the things that
can perpetuate and reproduce

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.929
the same conditions in some way.

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:17.090
And so I'm very
eager, as are you,

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:20.462
to move beyond the talk of
that safe space of saying,

00:34:20.462 --> 00:34:22.670
we're talking about diversity,
equity, and inclusion.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:24.003
Let's pat ourselves on the back.

00:34:24.003 --> 00:34:25.210
Aren't we great?

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:29.480
Because we are denying the
history that we live on.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.431
And until we actually
begin to dismantle

00:34:32.431 --> 00:34:34.639
within our institutions,
within the American theater,

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:37.070
within our
organization, dismantle

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:41.570
those systems of
oppression, we are very much

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:43.679
perpetuating the status quo.

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.949
And I think there's
a moment where

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:49.340
we have to be truthful
about what we're doing.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:50.150
Are we doing good?

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:52.280
Are we doing damage
by presenting

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.080
these stories and these
spaces that are not

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.840
taking care of the stories and
taking care of the artists who

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.220
are telling those stories?

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:04.670
So I'm eager for people
to understand the weight

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:05.690
of the good intentions.

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:08.690
Because a number
of theaters-- we've

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.545
come a long way in
the American theater.

00:35:10.545 --> 00:35:12.170
Just in the New York
Times today, there

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:16.760
was an article about the
new four artistic directors

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.843
of color leading
major institutions.

00:35:18.843 --> 00:35:19.635
That's significant.

00:35:19.635 --> 00:35:21.650
There are more
playwrights of color

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:23.930
being presented and
produced than I've

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:25.190
seen in a very long time.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.530
Not that they
didn't exist before.

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:30.200
But we're just now recognizing
and dignifying them

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.440
with the work.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.460
So we've made
incredible progress.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.190
But I feel like we've
still got a ton of work

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.300
to do when it comes to
the American theater.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.630
So when we look at
institutions, we're

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:44.013
presenting work
that reflects what

00:35:44.013 --> 00:35:46.430
we think the world wants to
see around race and diversity,

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:47.347
equity, and inclusion.

00:35:47.347 --> 00:35:49.610
But when you peel
back the layers,

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:51.890
we haven't done our
own internal work.

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:55.430
And I wonder, what is the
accountability mechanism that

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:58.490
makes sure that when we
present works that tackle

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:02.435
ugly issues around race
and gender and classism,

00:36:02.435 --> 00:36:04.310
what is the responsibility
of the institution

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:08.015
to prepare itself and
have authentic space

00:36:08.015 --> 00:36:09.390
be able to deliver
these stories?

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:10.765
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS:
Well, I would

00:36:10.765 --> 00:36:13.040
love to hear more
about what that work is

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.170
that you're calling for
and that you maybe you

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:18.530
feel is necessary to reconcile
the tensions that you're

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:22.093
talking about between the market
and the truth telling task.

00:36:22.093 --> 00:36:23.510
That article in
the New York Times

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.760
today was really
interesting, because it

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.690
was celebrating all these new
faces in leadership positions.

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:32.390
And at the same time,
a couple of those folks

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:35.010
were saying, you know, slow
your roll a little bit.

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:38.900
We still have a long way to go
Thank you for celebrating me.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.180
And we have a long way to go.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:45.440
So what is the work that
you both feel is necessary?

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.440
From the institutional
level, perhaps?

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.040
In the creative spaces?

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.130
Whatever your perspective is.

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:55.130
KEITH HAMILTON COBB: Well, I
can't dictate for anybody else.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:56.810
I read the article, too.

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:59.580
And I'm eager to
see what they do.

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:05.960
But what will be truly
significant is what they do.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.750
And I'm a bit
jaded, because I've

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:12.140
come from seven years of
trying to sell against--

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:16.000
I'm sorry, y'all, this
extraordinary play.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.915
And you'll all come.

00:37:16.915 --> 00:37:19.040
You'll all come in April,
and you'll agree with me.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.320
You'll say, he wasn't
just blowing his own horn.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.910
Because it is that thing.

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:25.470
And putting it on
people's desks,

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:29.480
and nobody's talking
to me about this thing,

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.980
and pushing and
pushing and pushing.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:33.440
Because I'm nobody.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.150
If it was Denzel's play,
they'd be doing it.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:40.520
So you bring these people
into these positions,

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.480
and that's great.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:46.880
But that insidiousness
of the capitalist machine

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.790
that I was talking about
begins to overwhelm.

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:53.600
And you find that these new
brown artistic directors

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.830
are doing more of what
American theater has become,

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:58.130
which is putting butts
in seats and making money

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:02.090
with celebrity, with stuff
that's easy, with stuff that

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:04.850
doesn't take too long to make.

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:08.680
All the stuff that makes
theater kind of homogeneous.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.710
And we go.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:14.450
And critics are often
complicit in this.

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:17.180
The criticism in the
American theater,

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:23.000
I've found, judging from when
I was a student at NYU and now,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.290
has become much more of a
support for the theater.

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:32.360
They'll say, well, wasn't that
wonderful what our theater did?

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:35.750
It may not have been Death of
a Salesman, but it was great.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:36.360
It was great.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.400
It was great.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.170
That was a great thing.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:42.350
As opposed to really
taking it apart.

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:48.380
So I could tell you
what the work would

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.580
be for me, were I the
artistic director,

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.840
were I given that position.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:59.098
But it's completely unpractical,
what I'd like to do.

00:38:59.098 --> 00:39:00.890
The money I would like
to spend, the time I

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:04.460
would like to take with
actors to rehearse a play.

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:09.590
We were talking just earlier
about the intimacy direction

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:12.340
and the whole idea of--

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.420
she was talking about
working with her students

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:20.310
about issues of intimacy in
plays, particularly now, when

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:23.797
the sensitivity towards that
in so many ways has been upped.

00:39:23.797 --> 00:39:25.130
And how do you work with actors?

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:28.010
And how do you counsel them
to work with each other

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:33.160
in ways that will present to an
audience intimacy that is real,

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.380
that they recognize as real?

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.240
Closed door, behind
whatever form that takes.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.940
It's a very hard thing to do.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.740
But it's important to--

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.860
again, I take Othello
as an example.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.160
If we're going to tell
this story realistically,

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.210
if we're going to
tell a new story,

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.793
if we're going to
get to the end of it

00:39:50.793 --> 00:39:52.840
and feel like something
has been revealed to us,

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.700
as opposed to the
same cookie-cutter

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.520
play we've seen 15 times
throughout our lives,

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.410
then we're going
to have to explore

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:02.680
those moment-to-moment
realities with great depth.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.220
And it's going to be
uncomfortable and hard.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:09.330
And who's ready for that?

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:10.980
Who has who has that ability?

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.820
Who has that time?

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.160
And do we care?

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.810
Is it important enough to us?

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:18.540
If I keep telling you that
the culture will change

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.860
if we embrace theater
in a meaningful way

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:26.550
and give it money and
give it give it support,

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:28.290
will you believe me?

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:30.100
Will you go along
on that experiment?

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.142
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Yeah.

00:40:31.142 --> 00:40:36.270
I feel like part of what we're
longing for is a performance

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:41.220
tradition that in
its fullest, as far

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.020
as serving a role
in society, where

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:47.220
it is both the irritant that
gets you to look and listen

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:51.720
when you would rather not, and
the bomb that can soothe us--

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.050
quite honestly, I'm thinking
right now about the only two

00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:00.810
videos I've watched
from New Zealand, which

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:03.510
have been the performances.

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:07.350
One by students, one by bikers,
of a traditional Maori dance

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:09.330
and song of mourning.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:11.520
And the power of
that performance--

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:14.160
I think about the songs of
the Civil Rights movement.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.280
Those songs, one of
the most impactful,

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.680
organizing tactics
used in the movement,

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.710
I would argue, that
is simultaneously

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:25.800
healing and pushing.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.210
See us.

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:29.040
And it is healing as we do it.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.450
And see us.

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:31.920
It is both.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.840
It's healing and pushing.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:38.278
So how can we have a
craft and a business?

00:41:38.278 --> 00:41:38.820
I don't know.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:39.750
That's the question.

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:44.370
Can it be a business if
it maintains that role?

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:46.470
That feels like a
big question for me

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:49.437
and core to what
you're talking about.

00:41:49.437 --> 00:41:51.020
KEITH HAMILTON COBB:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:53.520
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: We're going
to open it up for questions.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.850
This is a warning that I'm
going to ask one more question

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:58.200
before turning it to you all.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.670
You ready for that?

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:02.450
No, they're not.

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.230
OK.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:07.120
That was a real warm
up to get you ready.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:17.350
I want to honor your call to
remind us to keep an eye on joy

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:21.640
and make sure that we end
this part just by asking you

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:26.530
each where and how
this work feeds you.

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:28.420
Because part of
the risk, I think,

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:32.140
is that it is depleting to
us and that we're always

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.050
focused on the rage and the
way that that can tire us out.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:36.610
How does it feed you?

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:37.900
How does it lift you up?

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:41.080
Either generally, or if
there's a particular instance

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.820
you can think of.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.220
Because why do it if
it doesn't feed you?

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:48.720
Where and how are you fed?

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:49.980
DAVID HOWSE: Shall I start?

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:51.106
Or should you go?

00:42:51.106 --> 00:42:52.606
KEITH HAMILTON COBB:
Sure, go ahead.

00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:00.360
DAVID HOWSE: Anything worth
anything is hard work.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.410
And for me, there's
incredible joy

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:06.610
in what we're trying to create.

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:12.410
And personally, I believe in
things I've not seen before.

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:15.160
And I really believe
that the arts has a role

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:22.300
to play in creating a world and
society and communities where

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:28.210
people are less burdened by our
history of racial injustice.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:33.700
And so that aspiration, that
deep yearning and urgency

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:38.650
for me, is what makes me spring
out of bed every morning.

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:41.200
The rage is there.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.060
Many of us live with it.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.010
How do we choose to engage it?

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:48.950
I find incredible hope in the
stories that we see today.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.710
I feel like there's
a huge opportunity.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:53.830
I feel like the world,
particularly the United States,

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:56.570
is listening in a new way.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:59.650
And it is our opportunity
to be truthful around what

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:01.600
we're hearing and
how we're actually

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.100
moving those stories forward.

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:07.630
So to be a part of a craft, to
be a part of an industry that

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:13.820
is privileged to lift up, to
make visible, to make known,

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:17.570
stories that have
been deeply embedded

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:21.950
and a rich part of this
culture but not having space,

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:23.840
for me, that is a huge honor.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:28.910
And I take that with incredible
sense of responsibility

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:30.630
with a bunch of other people.

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:32.840
And I think for me,
that is incredibly

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.580
inspiring and hopeful.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:38.840
And there's so many more
stories that need to be told.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:43.130
And we're telling those
stories to understand others,

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:45.500
then to understand
ourselves and understand,

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:48.590
how do we create a more
just and beautiful world?

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:52.550
So for me, I've chosen
my service as art.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:54.350
Others choose other things.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:56.780
And what a joyful place
to be, to actually

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:58.700
be inspired and re-inspired.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.790
But what the artists are
showing us, revealing to us,

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:03.650
and telling us,
and the direction

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:05.060
that they're taking us in.

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:07.850
And so to be a part of
that support network

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:12.720
that allows art to
do that is a joy.

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.370
And it overshadows,
on most days,

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:19.820
all the other drudgery that
we have to deal with just

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.830
to come to our places.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:24.920
So doing this work in
spite of the challenges

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.540
is what keeps me going.

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:30.140
And I hope what gives
us all hope for what

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:34.760
can be if we choose to
respect, love, and embrace

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:38.860
each other across
difference but connecting

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:40.100
to our common humanity.

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:44.645
So I'm excited about the work.

00:45:44.645 --> 00:45:46.520
KEITH HAMILTON COBB:
It's a wonderful answer.

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.792
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS:
Yeah, thank you.

00:45:48.792 --> 00:45:49.292
Keith?

00:45:51.733 --> 00:45:53.650
KEITH HAMILTON COBB:
Again, I feel like I just

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:54.567
could say, yeah, that.

00:45:54.567 --> 00:45:56.530
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS:
What he said.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:58.583
DAVID HOWSE: You're
the truth teller.

00:45:58.583 --> 00:45:59.666
KEITH HAMILTON COBB: Yeah.

00:45:59.666 --> 00:46:00.420
Yeah.

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:09.950
And for me, the truth is this
odd thing that you're always--

00:46:12.685 --> 00:46:14.200
it's like the nature of spirit.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.700
It's this thing
that's always there.

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:17.658
And there's layers and
layers and layers to it.

00:46:17.658 --> 00:46:19.593
You never can quite
define what it is.

00:46:19.593 --> 00:46:20.260
But there it is.

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:21.160
And you're always looking at it.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.243
And you're seeing it in
all that you walk through.

00:46:23.243 --> 00:46:24.785
You walk through
life, and you see it

00:46:24.785 --> 00:46:26.980
in everything and
everybody and everything.

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:29.980
And artists cannot not look.

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:33.830
They cannot not
contemplate what that is.

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:36.550
And being an artist,
the making of art

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:43.530
seems beyond that inspection
of all that life is.

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:47.820
It seems to be this sort
of purposeless compulsion

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.050
until it's not.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:53.280
Until you're up there embodying
a role and saying, ah.

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.400
That was the purpose.

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:55.900
Ah.

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:57.090
This moment.

00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:01.470
All the stuff around it is hard
and ugly and not fun to me.

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:04.480
And many, many ways
I could tell you

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:09.300
how I don't feel like this
life has been particularly fun,

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.270
because it has been this life.

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:14.010
But the character
in American Moor

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:16.970
talks about feeling the
holy pleasure of God

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:19.530
in doing what he does.

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:21.960
And I don't have a
better description of it.

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.830
When it's working,
when I'm engaged

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:30.180
in a theatrical experience,
and all the pieces--

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.140
everybody's behaving.

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:32.640
Everybody's doing
the work together.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.710
Everybody's collaborating.

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:37.290
And it is messy, and it is hard.

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:41.610
And we're all there sacrificing
and suffering and holding it

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:44.160
up to the world together.

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:53.150
I can do no other.

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:54.950
If there's joy in it,
that's where it is.

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:55.992
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Yeah.

00:47:55.992 --> 00:47:58.370
There is something so beautiful
about a group of people

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:03.050
who come together to tell a
really compelling story when

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:04.130
it's going well.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.680
And if it's rooted in
justice and getting us

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:07.760
all free, all the better.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.670
DAVID HOWSE: Yeah, that's right.

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:10.940
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Great.

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:11.960
Shall we open it up?

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:12.710
DAVID HOWSE: Sure.

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:14.377
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS:
Shall we open it up?

00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:23.000
What's the practice here?

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.962
Do I just call on folks?

00:48:24.962 --> 00:48:25.670
Oh, there's mics.

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:27.450
So folks should
line up at the mics?

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:27.950
Lovely.

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:32.370
So there's a mic
in either aisle.

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:33.630
Yeah.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:34.260
Great.

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:34.620
Sorry.

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.420
I should have let you
all know that before.

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.280
I didn't know.

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:39.960
That's how I should
have said get ready.

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.230
Get ready and line
up at the mics.

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.990
Now we know.

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:43.490
Great.

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:46.120
So let's start on this side.

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.910
And we'll go back and forth.

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:49.200
Join the resistance.

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.910
I think that's you.

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:53.320
I was reading the t-shirt.

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:53.940
Yeah.

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:55.038
Let's start with you.

00:48:55.038 --> 00:48:55.580
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:56.570
I can start first.

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.110
When I was in junior high--

00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:04.150
I was brought up in New York.

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:05.325
New York City.

00:49:05.325 --> 00:49:08.530
And when I was in junior
high, one of our teachers

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:12.270
said, well, we're going to
take you to the theater.

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:14.730
I said, OK.

00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:20.020
And the very first thing
I ever saw on the stage

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:23.750
was the Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theater.

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:26.930
My eyeballs popped
right out of my head.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:32.420
I don't think one word was said
during that entire performance.

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:38.500
And yet, the absolute--

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:41.200
I mean, virtually everything
you could possibly

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:45.880
imagine-- all of your emotions
came through from these people.

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:49.000
And as time went by and I
got more and more and more

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.020
into the theater--

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.600
I am not an actor--

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:56.260
I started to understand
more of what it was like.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.810
And I can understand
where you're coming from.

00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:03.640
Bringing these things
together and moving people

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:08.980
towards a better
way, instead of--

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:12.280
when I was a kid, we had
all the stereotype things

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.535
and all that other junk.

00:50:13.535 --> 00:50:15.160
And it didn't just
go for black people.

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.900
It went for everybody.

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:21.460
And it was idiotic
now that I look at it.

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:24.440
The intellectualism
wasn't there.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.800
And not to say
the comedy is bad,

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:31.670
but you can have
intelligent comedy, too.

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:36.810
But I can understand and
can really connect with you

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:41.420
when you're saying that
you're trying and succeeding

00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:43.560
in connecting with other people.

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.740
And that is probably
the most important thing

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:50.690
we can do to move towards a
better and more peaceful world.

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:52.872
And I thank you for that.

00:50:52.872 --> 00:50:54.330
KEITH HAMILTON COBB: Thank you.

00:50:57.238 --> 00:50:59.030
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Do
you want to respond?

00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.240
No?

00:50:59.240 --> 00:50:59.930
Thank you.

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:00.820
Great.

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.300
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:07.650
I really appreciate what you're
saying about your generation

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:11.010
and how you're
approaching changing

00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:18.180
things, both issues of race
and intellect and the arts.

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:22.080
As an aging white guy who just
happens to be a visual artist,

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.460
I can get up in
the morning and I

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:27.480
can look outside and be
very happy with what I see

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:31.260
and then go into
the studio and play.

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:39.180
As it relates to theater and
teaching young people today,

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:43.050
how do you feel about
where they're coming from?

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:46.170
Are they angry enough--
and I use that more or less

00:51:46.170 --> 00:51:47.790
in quotes--

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:51.570
about the general situation
today to lash out?

00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:57.030
To get out there and
really make some noise.

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:59.430
Will they help to
save, essentially,

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:02.490
what we haven't been able
to save with the horror

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:04.030
show that's going on today?

00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.530
Thank you.

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:14.280
KEITH HAMILTON COBB: I tell
young actors and theater makers

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.140
that they can.

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.870
I don't know if they
are angry enough,

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:23.710
or if the opiates of the current
age are overwhelming them.

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:26.610
I wonder about that, if
there are just too many ways

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:28.800
to distract.

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:32.820
But we do see younger
and younger activism,

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.020
which I am excited about.

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:39.898
But I tell theater makers,
and this may be cynical of me,

00:52:39.898 --> 00:52:41.190
but I say, we've screwed it up.

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:42.898
It's not going to get
a whole lot better,

00:52:42.898 --> 00:52:43.890
the theater we make.

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:46.320
So learn your skills
well, because it's on you.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.095
It's on you to make theater
that saves the planet.

00:52:53.700 --> 00:53:00.020
There's too much to
un-entrench in the way

00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:03.090
that we make our theater and why
we make it and all that stuff

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:04.860
that we were just discussing.

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:12.220
But if they are young
and energized and have

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:14.860
issues and an
intention that they

00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:16.710
want to get at the heart at--

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:19.600
the interesting thing about
American Moor, when I first

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.200
started doing it for
college audiences

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.980
and performing arts
programs, many of them

00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:30.910
had been programs where
a handful of actors

00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:32.860
are chosen for each
of the three or four

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:34.240
plays that they do each year.

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:37.630
And they dress them up,
and they move them around,

00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:39.970
and they do Oklahoma
or whatever.

00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:42.748
And they engage them in
theatrical competitions

00:53:42.748 --> 00:53:43.540
around the country.

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:46.930
Maybe they go somewhere and win
some awards or some scholarship

00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:47.567
money.

00:53:47.567 --> 00:53:49.150
But they had never
seen a guy standing

00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:52.080
on a bare stage doing
90 minutes of a play.

00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.760
Nothing's there but
a guy and a story.

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:59.890
And they were struck by that.

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:00.880
And I said, yeah.

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.140
That's all you need.

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:04.560
That's all you need,
is the intention

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:08.950
and the support and the
thing that you need to say.

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:10.540
And people will hear
you and feel you

00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:13.930
and the vibration will
reverberate among any audience

00:54:13.930 --> 00:54:16.717
you put together.

00:54:16.717 --> 00:54:17.550
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:18.925
DAVID HOWSE: And
I would just add

00:54:18.925 --> 00:54:24.000
that I do think there is
enough urgency and frustration

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.200
and anger that we will see.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.810
And we have seen
movements and the youth

00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:30.270
really taking the
world by storm.

00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:32.940
But I'm not ready to give
up on the older generation.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:36.450
We can't actually just wait for
the younger people to do it.

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:38.130
We have to start with ourselves.

00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:41.100
And so it's not too
late to figure out

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.780
what your role is in it.

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:46.073
Because as silent as you are,
you're actually perpetuating.

00:54:46.073 --> 00:54:47.490
Not that that's
what you're doing,

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:49.500
but I wouldn't just wait
for the younger ones

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.120
to change it for us.

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:54.060
We have to figure out what
role we've played in it

00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:57.180
and how we begin to undo
that and acknowledge

00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:00.840
that role in order for
us to move forward.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.590
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS:
And it was just Friday

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:05.190
that all the students walked
out for climate change, right?

00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.760
DAVID HOWSE: That's right.

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:06.802
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Yeah.

00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:10.240
Yes?

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah, hi.

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:15.510
I'd love to have a
beer with you guys.

00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:18.520
But I just want to point
out a couple of thoughts,

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:22.750
that part of the
tragedy of the situation

00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:27.190
is that I would bet my bottom
dollar that everybody here

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:28.900
gets it.

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:33.340
The people who wouldn't come
here on a bet don't get it

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:36.250
and probably never will.

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:39.730
I think what we have to do
with this white privilege

00:55:39.730 --> 00:55:46.570
bullshit is that we have
to light a candle every day

00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:52.840
in our insignificant lives,
then curse the effin darkness.

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:57.160
And I think we all have
a debt and an obligation

00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:01.600
to humanity to
really push forward

00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:07.170
and make sure that
anybody in our universe

00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:09.720
knows where we're coming from.

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:12.930
And if they can't carry
that, get rid of them.

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.208
You want to comment on that?

00:56:19.208 --> 00:56:20.250
KEITH HAMILTON COBB: Yes.

00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:20.700
DAVID HOWSE: Pick me!

00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:21.350
Pick me!

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:22.392
KEITH HAMILTON COBB: Yes.

00:56:24.690 --> 00:56:27.090
If your theater is good enough--

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:28.620
and that's a broad term--

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:31.500
if your theater is
striking enough,

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:39.300
if it invades the body
on a visceral level,

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:42.660
it does still change
hearts and minds.

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:45.790
Not everyone, because
what we're up against,

00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:50.940
in certainly this culture and
probably the world, is fear.

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:53.520
This human animal is fearful.

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.020
The flesh is fearful.

00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:56.430
The self-preservation, the need.

00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:59.340
And when you get that
big brain and the ego,

00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:02.250
that becomes this whole mess.

00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:05.010
And there are people
who've sat in my play who,

00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:08.910
just as I was saying before,
it is inconvenient for them

00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:11.800
to take the message.

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:14.220
But they came, and they watched.

00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:18.780
And others who will
say, you know, I've

00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:20.960
been looking at this all wrong.

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:23.700
And I'm going to have to go
back and think about this again.

00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:26.160
And I'm sure that's not
easy for somebody to say.

00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:31.503
And many people have said
it over the 6 1/2 years that

00:57:31.503 --> 00:57:32.420
we've been doing that.

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:42.000
So I think there's
hope more universally,

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.580
I just think we have to
make a better product.

00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:50.180
And critics that speak back
to bad theater and say it's

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:52.470
bad for these reasons.

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:53.990
And we need to have that debate.

00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:58.610
AUDIENCE: I wish real life
was like a Hollywood movie,

00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:00.783
but it ain't.

00:58:00.783 --> 00:58:02.200
KEITH HAMILTON
COBB: No, it ain't.

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:04.010
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: David,
do you want to add to that?

00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:04.760
DAVID HOWSE: Yeah.

00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:08.640
AUDIENCE: We fight the
fight every damn day.

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:09.140
Thank you.

00:58:13.078 --> 00:58:14.620
DAVID HOWSE: I'll
just say one thing.

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:19.030
One, you started by saying
everyone in the room gets it.

00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:20.530
And I would say we're all--

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:21.890
I don't know most of you.

00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:23.050
But we're on a journey.

00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:26.430
Part of our challenge
is, we think we get it.

00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:28.890
And we actually don't
actually spend the time

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:33.030
to really understand
what we don't get.

00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:36.390
And sometimes in liberal
Boston, our liberal-mindedness

00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:40.470
can be in direct conflict with
our racist actions and values.

00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:43.920
And that's not implicating
anyone here, because we get it.

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:47.340
But I think that's the truth
of how the brain works.

00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:51.960
When we've positioned ourselves
as the woke ones, the ones who

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:55.210
get it, we are also missing
out on our own learning.

00:58:55.210 --> 00:58:58.167
So the fact that we are here, it
means we're just on a journey.

00:58:58.167 --> 00:59:00.000
And the second thing
I'll say, that each one

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.675
of us in this room has
someone who is not here

00:59:02.675 --> 00:59:04.800
and wouldn't want to be a
part of the conversation.

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:08.490
It is our responsibility as
individuals who care and get it

00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:10.500
to help those who don't get it.

00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:12.528
So we actually--
each one, teach one.

00:59:12.528 --> 00:59:13.320
Somebody said that.

00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:13.800
I don't remember who.

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:14.055
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Somebody.

00:59:14.055 --> 00:59:15.480
DAVID HOWSE: But
we actually have

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:18.090
to go out and bring those
who don't want to know.

00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:20.340
But we also have to be curious
about their experiences

00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:21.138
as well.

00:59:21.138 --> 00:59:22.680
This is not about
just, we are right.

00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:23.460
You're wrong.

00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:25.980
But let's talk about
what we see differently.

00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:28.900
And I know it sounds
Pollyanna-ish.

00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:30.490
But I think that's
where we have to be

00:59:30.490 --> 00:59:34.630
able to have really
honest discourse in places

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:36.280
that allow us to do that.

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:39.160
And we believe that
arts is a place that

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:43.060
allows us to have that honest
discourse across difference.

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:46.420
And put this notion
that we all get it,

00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:48.280
because I don't know
that we actually do.

00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:51.972
And I think that prevents us
from really moving forward.

00:59:56.310 --> 00:59:58.767
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Or
if it's even get-able.

00:59:58.767 --> 00:59:59.850
DAVID HOWSE: Yes, exactly.

00:59:59.850 --> 01:00:01.433
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS:
The idea that it's

01:00:01.433 --> 01:00:06.270
a journey that has an end point,
that it's a constant journey.

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:08.550
AUDIENCE: I'm very enticed
by the play American Moor.

01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:11.760
And I'm so happy that you
have taken on this role.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.860
But the blackness of the
Moor is only one dimension

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.280
of the personality.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.530
The other one that no one
seems to be talking about

01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:23.250
is, a Moor is also a reference
to a Moroccan and likely

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:26.610
an Arab Moroccan who probably
has a Muslim name as well.

01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:29.460
What Shakespeare calls Othello
probably in today's world

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.870
would be Abdullah.

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:34.350
So what about the unseen
part of the Arab nature

01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:38.000
and the Muslim connotation
to the character?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.670
And how about my rage as
an American Muslim living

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:44.550
in this country who
is told that this

01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:46.500
is a Judeo-Christian country?

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:50.490
Where my religion, poised to
be the world's largest maybe

01:00:50.490 --> 01:00:54.090
in another two decades, goes
unseen and unacknowledged.

01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:56.310
So when you talk about the
Moor, yes, the blackness

01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:58.200
is a very important component.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.440
But you also have to accept
that the Moorishness means

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.540
Arab and Islamic affiliation.

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.700
KEITH HAMILTON COBB:
Of course, you do.

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.160
And how about your rage?

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.350
I am with you.

01:01:10.350 --> 01:01:12.930
And I have not yet
had the opportunity

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:14.850
to direct the
production of Othello

01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:17.760
where those issues that you just
so eloquently put on the table

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.580
can be explored in
that supported forum,

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:24.690
where we are looking at
this person as an Arab.

01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:28.470
Arab by way of Iberia,
perhaps, and ultimately

01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:29.860
finds himself in Venice.

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:35.920
He probably speaks his Arab
language of origin, Spanish.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.700
He's speaking Venetian
with the Venetian senate.

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:43.590
So this is a man of many
skills and many talents

01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:47.250
and great intellect who they
are calling Othello because that

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:48.660
has somehow become his name.

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:50.790
And how does that affect
him as a human being?

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.207
He has to hear it
again and again.

01:01:52.207 --> 01:01:53.700
He knows that's not his name.

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:55.560
But that's what his
name has become.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.458
And this is exactly--

01:01:57.458 --> 01:01:59.250
what you're putting on
the table is exactly

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:02.250
the sort of exploration
that would allow an audience

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:07.380
to consider some things that,
in the 25 productions of Othello

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:09.797
that they have seen
here in America,

01:02:09.797 --> 01:02:11.130
they have never had to consider.

01:02:11.130 --> 01:02:13.410
Because nobody has had
that expansive scope of

01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:15.690
thought to put
that on the stage.

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.520
But it absolutely
needs to be there.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.670
And guaranteed, the
audience leaving would say,

01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:26.160
I've got to go home
and think about this.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.140
The next time I see
a man like that,

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:31.465
I'm going to feel
something different.

01:02:31.465 --> 01:02:33.090
I'm going to think
something different.

01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:35.050
I'm going to engage
in a different way.

01:02:35.050 --> 01:02:36.990
DAVID HOWSE: I just
have to say, I love it.

01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:38.550
This is exactly what we need.

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:40.380
This is exactly what we mean.

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.180
Understanding
different perspectives.

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:46.230
Your energy-- first
of all, the stage

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:49.530
is a great place
to explore this.

01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:51.390
But I think this is
exactly what we mean.

01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:53.350
You're seeing it from
a different perspective

01:02:53.350 --> 01:02:56.310
that many people would not
even have had a lens into.

01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:58.920
And the fact that we're actually
able to have a conversation

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:01.530
and agree and disagree
with each other

01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:03.390
reveals the common humanity.

01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:06.690
And so I love that you
shared it so passionately,

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:07.830
your perspective.

01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:09.660
It's exactly what
we need to happen.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:11.010
It's the prompt.

01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:14.580
This play was a prompt for this
conversation that many of us

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:16.680
would not have been privy to.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.900
So I thank you for
sharing that perspective

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:22.830
and say that we need more
of that in this country.

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:30.300
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Yes?

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.810
AUDIENCE: Hello.

01:03:31.810 --> 01:03:39.100
I'd like to know, when
you direct, produce,

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.890
or write, and work
collaboratively

01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:47.140
with others, directors,
producers, when you're

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:52.970
trying to send a certain message
to the audience, that message

01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:55.550
that you're sending
out to the audience

01:03:55.550 --> 01:04:02.330
to hopefully make a change in
society, is that same message--

01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:08.900
is that effective behind the
scenes with your co-workers,

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.532
your directors, producers?

01:04:10.532 --> 01:04:12.740
DAVID HOWSE: You're going
to get somebody in trouble.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:22.100
AUDIENCE: Because it appears
that, from my perspective,

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:25.430
that it doesn't seem
to be as effective.

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:32.180
But since you're working in
those roles behind the scenes,

01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:35.010
I wanted to hear from you.

01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:39.440
Has the message that you put
your whole heart and soul in

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:44.010
and try to get that message
out to society actually working

01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:46.600
behind the scenes
with all those people?

01:04:50.255 --> 01:04:51.380
KEITH HAMILTON COBB: May I?

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:52.340
DAVID HOWSE: Please.

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:55.730
KEITH HAMILTON COBB: Well,
what David said a minute ago

01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:58.430
I think is very cogent to this.

01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:02.780
And that is, everybody
kind of thinks they get it.

01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:05.660
But we really don't
know what we don't know.

01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:12.800
And nobody can be blamed for
being part of a culture where

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.690
these issues of race
bias, a lack of empathy

01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:22.860
across perspectives
of privilege,

01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:27.300
is so insidious and so big
and intertwined in everything

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:31.560
that we go about thinking we're
woke in many ways, when we're

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.370
not.

01:05:32.370 --> 01:05:35.580
And the American theater
likes to pride itself

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.530
on its liberalism
and its ability

01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:44.460
to champion gay rights and
women's rights and all that.

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:53.160
But it exists in a culture where
paradigms and ideology that

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:59.020
is as old as the slave trade
still prevails in many ways.

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:02.130
So it's very important for
us, if we're theater makers

01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:04.110
and we're all involved
in the same project,

01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:08.280
to figure out ways to call
each other on our bullshit.

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.980
And we have the ability to do
that if we're all coming there

01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:12.060
for the same reason.

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:15.330
That's part of the
rehearsal work, too.

01:06:15.330 --> 01:06:17.280
Getting in the room
and saying, hey,

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:20.130
let's spend a couple of days
figuring out why we're all here

01:06:20.130 --> 01:06:23.520
and make it clear that it's
all good and it's all love.

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.670
Let's go find the
truth together.

01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:29.250
But all of it.

01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:33.750
All of the evolution and
spiritual up-leveling

01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:38.880
of the culture is work and
takes constant introspection.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:39.900
You've got to do it.

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:41.120
I've got to do it.

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:42.910
And I guess we'll get there.

01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:43.660
DAVID HOWSE: Yeah.

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:47.490
The American theater is
an institution in America.

01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:50.490
So it lives in a racist bubble.

01:06:50.490 --> 01:06:52.860
And it is not exempt
from those issues.

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:56.730
I will say that when I--

01:06:56.730 --> 01:06:58.420
ArtsEmerson, for
example, we want

01:06:58.420 --> 01:06:59.760
to curate these conversations.

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.830
It was very clear to
us that, until we've

01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:03.990
done our own work
internally, until we've

01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:05.760
been on our own
journey, we really

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:08.250
are irresponsible to try
and make space for that.

01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:10.470
And so we started
3 and 1/2 years ago

01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:12.660
with unconscious bias,
an easy way for people

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:14.640
to enter into a conversation.

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:18.150
Three years later, we were
doing undoing racism training.

01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:22.410
And the staff has been on a
journey of discovery for self

01:07:22.410 --> 01:07:24.090
and also for the team.

01:07:24.090 --> 01:07:27.350
And it has transformed the way
that we engage with each other,

01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:30.240
and that we engage in
our own personal lives.

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:33.240
And so it's again, not
everyone's business

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.065
to do that work.

01:07:34.065 --> 01:07:36.690
But for us, we thought, if we're
going to actually try and tell

01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:38.730
these stories, we
have to make sure

01:07:38.730 --> 01:07:41.610
that we understand
our role in it.

01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:44.970
And so my hope is that more
organizations are actually

01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:46.470
looking inward.

01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:48.710
Because there's something
called virtue signaling.

01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:50.460
We put something on
stage, and we want you

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:52.650
to believe this is who we are.

01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:54.515
But when you peel
back those layers

01:07:54.515 --> 01:07:56.640
and you see leadership
structures where they're all

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:59.370
white, when you see decision
makers at the table who are all

01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:02.130
white, when we invite
a playwright of color

01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:04.890
and surround them with
an all-white team,

01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:09.120
what service are we doing to
that artist, to the theater,

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.830
to our audience,
and to the field?

01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:13.320
So I think we have
a lot of work to do.

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.540
And again, I'm hopeful.

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:15.690
There's progress.

01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:19.950
But when you think about pulling
back the curtain, we might be--

01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:21.490
or maybe we wouldn't
be surprised

01:08:21.490 --> 01:08:23.490
at what you see when you
pull back those layers.

01:08:23.490 --> 01:08:26.370
So there's still work to be
done in the American theater,

01:08:26.370 --> 01:08:27.779
much like there's
work to be done

01:08:27.779 --> 01:08:30.718
in all American institutions.

01:08:30.718 --> 01:08:31.260
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:34.890
Well, thank you, because I was
hoping that the next time, when

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:38.760
you go into an all-white
room with all white furniture

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:41.880
and with all white people,
that no one will ask you

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:48.267
or tell you and say, this is
a meeting just for directors.

01:08:48.267 --> 01:08:50.350
DAVID HOWSE: I'm looking
forward to that day, too.

01:08:53.611 --> 01:08:54.569
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: OK.

01:08:54.569 --> 01:08:58.080
I think this is going have
to be our last question.

01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.790
I'm getting the eye.

01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:04.830
AUDIENCE: Well, I just saw
recently Mr. Joy on tour.

01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:06.729
And it was terrific.

01:09:06.729 --> 01:09:08.130
I really loved it.

01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:11.410
And I would like you to
talk a little bit about it.

01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:13.890
Also, people in the
audience, at least in my--

01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:15.029
so I went to another one--

01:09:15.029 --> 01:09:16.305
I went to Mattapan.

01:09:16.305 --> 01:09:18.180
And some people in the
audience have seen you

01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:20.380
for the fifth time.

01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:22.350
So it was really terrific.

01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:24.990
And also I think one of the
issues with theater in general,

01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:26.100
it's expensive.

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:28.380
Not all the people
have recourses.

01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:30.479
They don't have the money
to go to the theater.

01:09:30.479 --> 01:09:33.510
And ideally, how are you
going to bring that theater

01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:35.640
from outside the theater?

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:36.487
In the streets.

01:09:36.487 --> 01:09:37.779
We need theater in the streets.

01:09:37.779 --> 01:09:41.880
So do you have any other
projects after Mr. Joy?

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.410
Which was absolutely great.

01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:43.600
DAVID HOWSE: Sure.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.060
I'd be happy to
talk about Mr. Joy.

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:48.000
Mr. Joy is a project that
we've been working on

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.200
for several years.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.029
It started in our
downtown venues.

01:09:51.029 --> 01:09:53.640
It's a one-person,
one-woman show

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.433
who embodies eight
or nine characters.

01:09:55.433 --> 01:09:57.100
Our artistic director
is here somewhere.

01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:58.860
He could probably talk more
about this than I could.

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.485
But embodies eight
different characters

01:10:00.485 --> 01:10:03.480
and engages issues
related to gentrification,

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.180
to sexism, to
racism, to classism.

01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:07.110
You name it.

01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:10.002
And it's a play that
actually speaks to you

01:10:10.002 --> 01:10:11.460
and speaks to
everyone in the room.

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:12.810
You can actually see yourself.

01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:16.380
But again, it's a prompt to many
conversations that can come.

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:17.805
We started downtown.

01:10:17.805 --> 01:10:19.180
And people saw
the play and said,

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:20.800
we need to see
this my community.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.810
My community needs to
have this experience.

01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:24.640
So then we created
the first year

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.310
a tour where we were going
to the various neighborhoods.

01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:29.920
Mattapan, Dorchester, Brighton.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.920
Someone in the METCO program
saw the show and said,

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.870
we need this in
the METCO system.

01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:37.240
And so then, we have now
a partnership with METCO

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:41.270
where we're actually taking
it out to the METCO districts.

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:42.550
Cohasset.

01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:43.510
We've been to Whalen.

01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:48.310
We've been to
Newton and Scituate.

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.910
Thank you.

01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:52.510
And other places, because it's
a show that actually opens up

01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:54.910
many different
conversations and creates

01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:56.890
an opportunity for
people to understand

01:10:56.890 --> 01:10:58.558
how they relate to
these very issues

01:10:58.558 --> 01:10:59.600
that we're talking about.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.390
So I'm glad that
you saw Mr. Joy.

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:02.840
We try to do it every year.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:03.560
It just closed.

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:07.330
It had its last show
this weekend up in Salem.

01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:08.675
And so we'll be doing it again.

01:11:08.675 --> 01:11:10.300
And if you haven't
seen it, it's a show

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:12.040
that you will not want to miss.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:12.790
So thank you.

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:15.790
There's the economic
aspect of the theater.

01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:18.040
And I know many theaters
have different efforts

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.890
to make sure that it is
affordable for as many people

01:11:20.890 --> 01:11:21.730
as possible.

01:11:21.730 --> 01:11:24.250
I just read, I think,
in The Globe today

01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:25.690
that the Huntington,
for example,

01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:29.317
is making their tickets to
Romeo and Juliet for anyone 25

01:11:29.317 --> 01:11:31.150
and under, it's completely
free for the rest

01:11:31.150 --> 01:11:32.870
of the run the show.

01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:33.370
I know.

01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:36.060
That's great.

01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:39.760
At ArtsEmerson, there's
always a ticket for $25.

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:43.210
So no matter where
you want to come in,

01:11:43.210 --> 01:11:44.835
there's always a ticket at $25.

01:11:44.835 --> 01:11:45.710
And there's a secret.

01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:48.100
We have this thing
called $10 at 10.

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:49.750
So I shouldn't be
telling this broadly.

01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:52.330
But at 10:00 on most
days, if you call in,

01:11:52.330 --> 01:11:53.680
there are tickets for $10.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.180
So we want to make
sure that this is

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:57.186
affordable for-- what's that?

01:11:57.186 --> 01:11:58.100
AUDIENCE: Most days?

01:11:58.100 --> 01:11:59.500
DAVID HOWSE: Most days, yes.

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.750
We want to make sure this
is affordable for everybody.

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:05.310
But there is an
economic aspect to it,

01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:08.040
because as you make space for
more people in the theater,

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:12.480
those people who have
been long-term patrons

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.520
feel like it means
it's no space for them.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.250
So it's like a zero sum game.

01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:18.750
If you let those people in with
the cheap tickets, then what

01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:20.130
about my experience?

01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:22.140
And so we have to create
audiences that welcome

01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:24.150
and embrace people from
all over the areas.

01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:27.420
But I know that the
financial barrier for entry

01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:29.730
can be problematic for people.

01:12:29.730 --> 01:12:32.970
And we have to figure out a
way to find funding mechanisms.

01:12:32.970 --> 01:12:35.670
Look at the funding structures,
look at the support structure,

01:12:35.670 --> 01:12:39.060
so that we can make sure that
this is the people's work.

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.470
Not some people's work.

01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:41.910
But everybody's work.

01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:45.240
And that takes all of
us lobbying, advocating,

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:48.480
supporting, making
noise to say, we need

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.760
to make these
institutions and the work

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.190
that these institutions are
creating in partnerships

01:12:53.190 --> 01:12:55.470
with community-based
organizations,

01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:59.152
make sure that it's
available for everybody

01:12:59.152 --> 01:13:00.235
LIZZY COOPER DAVIS: Great.

01:13:03.190 --> 01:13:04.900
Thank you all so
much for showing up.

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:07.690
I want to say one last
thing about showing up.

01:13:07.690 --> 01:13:10.870
It's part of our
responsibility to this work.

01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:12.490
So showing up for
the conversation,

01:13:12.490 --> 01:13:14.770
yes, this is a conversation
that lots of folks

01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:16.390
are having in this city.

01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:20.140
I want to name just a few and
say, show up for them as well.

01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:23.260
Front Porch Arts is a really
important new black theater

01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:23.800
company--

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.500
I think I see some
folks in the house--

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:29.290
committed to advancing
racial equity in Boston

01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:30.250
through theater.

01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:31.990
There's a really
interesting conversation

01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:33.940
about Asian-American
experience happening

01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:36.220
in Boston right now with
Vietgone, coming soon

01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:39.070
from Company One, which is
another company very much

01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:40.960
committed to this conversation.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.630
Endlings, which just
left at the A.R.T.

01:13:43.630 --> 01:13:45.850
The Dragon Cycle,
coming to Oberon.

01:13:45.850 --> 01:13:48.580
The Theater Offensive is
an extraordinary leader

01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:51.670
locally and nationally
around queer, transgender,

01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:56.380
nonconforming stories, often
featuring and focused on PoC.

01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:59.050
Local director Megan
Sandberg-Zakian

01:13:59.050 --> 01:14:01.570
is one of the founders
of Maia Directors,

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:05.140
a national collective of
four theater makers of Middle

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:07.210
Eastern-North African
descent working

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:10.430
to bring more of those stories
to the stage and screen.

01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:12.280
And when Keith
Hamilton Cobb shows up

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.750
with American Moor to
a theater near you,

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:16.300
show up for that as well.

01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:19.050
Thank you for coming.
