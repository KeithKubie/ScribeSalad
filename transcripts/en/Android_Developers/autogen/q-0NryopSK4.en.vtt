so I'm going to be starting you off here
 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.269
so I'm going to be starting you off here
with some of the latest and greatest

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279
with some of the latest and greatest
 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:13.220
with some of the latest and greatest
tools that we have so I'm going to take

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230
tools that we have so I'm going to take
 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.589
tools that we have so I'm going to take
you on a bit of a journey here bear with

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599
you on a bit of a journey here bear with
 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.330
you on a bit of a journey here bear with
me this is going to be fast and furious

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340
me this is going to be fast and furious
 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.220
me this is going to be fast and furious
and I'm going to be throwing a lot of

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
and I'm going to be throwing a lot of
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.070
and I'm going to be throwing a lot of
information at you and a lot of it's

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
information at you and a lot of it's
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.870
information at you and a lot of it's
gonna be quite high-level the idea here

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
gonna be quite high-level the idea here
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.759
gonna be quite high-level the idea here
is to kind of get this on your radar if

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769
is to kind of get this on your radar if
 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.759
is to kind of get this on your radar if
you've not heard of these tools yet some

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769
you've not heard of these tools yet some
 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.760
you've not heard of these tools yet some
of them maybe you're already using and

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770
of them maybe you're already using and
 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.870
of them maybe you're already using and
we'll be talking a little bit about best

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880
we'll be talking a little bit about best
 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.180
we'll be talking a little bit about best
practices as well but essentially

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
practices as well but essentially
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.850
practices as well but essentially
envision this being a buffet I'm gonna

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860
envision this being a buffet I'm gonna
 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.049
envision this being a buffet I'm gonna
set up a variety of dishes and tasty

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059
set up a variety of dishes and tasty
 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.510
set up a variety of dishes and tasty
treats some of it you might like some of

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
treats some of it you might like some of
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.580
treats some of it you might like some of
it you might not like and it's

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590
it you might not like and it's
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.560
it you might not like and it's
completely up to you as to what you

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
completely up to you as to what you
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.290
completely up to you as to what you
think will benefit you and your team to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300
think will benefit you and your team to
 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.369
think will benefit you and your team to
make the best game you possibly can so

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379
make the best game you possibly can so
 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.010
make the best game you possibly can so
here you'll see we're gonna be talking

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020
here you'll see we're gonna be talking
 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.799
here you'll see we're gonna be talking
about pre-launch launch window and post

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809
about pre-launch launch window and post
 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.620
about pre-launch launch window and post
launch

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630
launch
 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.640
launch
so first we'll dive into pre-launch and

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650
so first we'll dive into pre-launch and
 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.390
so first we'll dive into pre-launch and
this is where I'm going to be spending

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
this is where I'm going to be spending
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.770
this is where I'm going to be spending
quite a bit of time because really

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
quite a bit of time because really
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.490
quite a bit of time because really
here's where you are going to be forging

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
here's where you are going to be forging
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.190
here's where you are going to be forging
in the fire to create your best game

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200
in the fire to create your best game
 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.840
in the fire to create your best game
right this is where you're going to be

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850
right this is where you're going to be
 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.980
right this is where you're going to be
doing a lot of testing you're going to

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990
doing a lot of testing you're going to
 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.660
doing a lot of testing you're going to
be iterating a lot making a lot of

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670
be iterating a lot making a lot of
 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.020
be iterating a lot making a lot of
mistakes learning from it so here's the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
mistakes learning from it so here's the
 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.420
mistakes learning from it so here's the
opening mantra that I wanted to throw at

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
opening mantra that I wanted to throw at
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.440
opening mantra that I wanted to throw at
you which is test earlier test wider

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450
you which is test earlier test wider
 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.710
you which is test earlier test wider
test better so maybe the first and the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720
test better so maybe the first and the
 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.990
test better so maybe the first and the
third feel comfortable for you as a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
third feel comfortable for you as a
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.440
third feel comfortable for you as a
small team maybe the middle one not so

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450
small team maybe the middle one not so
 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.080
small team maybe the middle one not so
much so this is something that we've

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090
much so this is something that we've
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.780
much so this is something that we've
been advocating for for teams of all

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
been advocating for for teams of all
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.450
been advocating for for teams of all
kinds of sizes because we've built a lot

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
kinds of sizes because we've built a lot
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.010
kinds of sizes because we've built a lot
of tools that allow you to do this and

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
of tools that allow you to do this and
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.830
of tools that allow you to do this and
there's a benefit to test wider which

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
there's a benefit to test wider which
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.300
there's a benefit to test wider which
hopefully means you're doing a lot of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310
hopefully means you're doing a lot of
 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.399
hopefully means you're doing a lot of
problem-solving and eliminating

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409
problem-solving and eliminating
 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.950
problem-solving and eliminating
eliminating those unforeseen issues that

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960
eliminating those unforeseen issues that
 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.080
eliminating those unforeseen issues that
pop up once you have launched and

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090
pop up once you have launched and
 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.090
pop up once you have launched and
perhaps you didn't test as widely as you

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100
perhaps you didn't test as widely as you
 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.790
perhaps you didn't test as widely as you
you did so first let us start with

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800
you did so first let us start with
 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.940
you did so first let us start with
internal testing this is a really great

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950
internal testing this is a really great
 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.940
internal testing this is a really great
way and a great tool to use for your

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950
way and a great tool to use for your
 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.240
way and a great tool to use for your
team this is team testing this allows

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250
team this is team testing this allows
 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.330
team this is team testing this allows
you to launch a new build within seconds

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340
you to launch a new build within seconds
 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.280
you to launch a new build within seconds
versus hours very fast iteration you're

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290
versus hours very fast iteration you're
 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.470
versus hours very fast iteration you're
getting you're getting different builds

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480
getting you're getting different builds
 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.480
getting you're getting different builds
out several times a day if needed if

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490
out several times a day if needed if
 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.770
out several times a day if needed if
you're doing quick fixes and you're

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780
you're doing quick fixes and you're
 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.330
you're doing quick fixes and you're
really addressing that foundational

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340
really addressing that foundational
 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.810
really addressing that foundational
stuff early on next we move to close

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820
stuff early on next we move to close
 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.940
stuff early on next we move to close
testing this is where you broaden out a

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950
testing this is where you broaden out a
 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.480
testing this is where you broaden out a
little bit to maybe your your highest

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490
little bit to maybe your your highest
 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.790
little bit to maybe your your highest
engaged users those who are really

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800
engaged users those who are really
 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.200
engaged users those who are really
excited about your game may be friends

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210
excited about your game may be friends
 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.320
excited about your game may be friends
and family as well and here's where you

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330
and family as well and here's where you
 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.970
and family as well and here's where you
can start getting a sense of what your

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980
can start getting a sense of what your
 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.040
can start getting a sense of what your
your gamers are telling you this is this

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050
your gamers are telling you this is this
 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.070
your gamers are telling you this is this
is very foundational feedback that

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080
is very foundational feedback that
 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.440
is very foundational feedback that
you're getting initially from a very

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450
you're getting initially from a very
 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.820
you're getting initially from a very
small set of your user base this is also

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830
small set of your user base this is also
 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.900
small set of your user base this is also
known as closed beta so here we have our

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910
known as closed beta so here we have our
 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.790

friends that butterscotch shenanigans

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800
friends that butterscotch shenanigans
 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.690
friends that butterscotch shenanigans
talking about their experience and

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700
talking about their experience and
 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.280
talking about their experience and
essentially this has been crucial for

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290
essentially this has been crucial for
 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.060
essentially this has been crucial for
them in targeting those bugs and those

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070
them in targeting those bugs and those
 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.070
them in targeting those bugs and those
crashes so that they're launching a

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080
crashes so that they're launching a
 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.440
crashes so that they're launching a
product that they feel confident about

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450
product that they feel confident about
 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.110
product that they feel confident about
they feel good about it and the tool

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120
they feel good about it and the tool
 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.930
they feel good about it and the tool
really facilitates that for them what

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940
really facilitates that for them what
 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.230
really facilitates that for them what
this also does for you is it allows you

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240
this also does for you is it allows you
 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.650
this also does for you is it allows you
to start getting a little bit more of

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660
to start getting a little bit more of
 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.140
to start getting a little bit more of
that wider testing in their wider

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150
that wider testing in their wider
 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.640
that wider testing in their wider
variety of users so you're getting a

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650
variety of users so you're getting a
 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.920
variety of users so you're getting a
spectrum of feedback close testing also

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930
spectrum of feedback close testing also
 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.110
spectrum of feedback close testing also
is great because it gives you a chance

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120
is great because it gives you a chance
 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.240
is great because it gives you a chance
to not have any kind of ratings effects

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250
to not have any kind of ratings effects
 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.920
to not have any kind of ratings effects
okay so if you're wanting to take big

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930
okay so if you're wanting to take big
 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.590
okay so if you're wanting to take big
bold moves around feature testing you

want to you one of your your team
 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.500
want to you one of your your team
members has a crazy idea and you want to

members has a crazy idea and you want to
 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.180
members has a crazy idea and you want to
throw it out there into the wild within

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190
throw it out there into the wild within
 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.970
throw it out there into the wild within
this particular audience this is a great

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980
this particular audience this is a great
 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.820

questions about that and so this is open
beta so if let's say you spend some time

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909
beta so if let's say you spend some time
 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:28.029

great visibility you're not quite ready
to fully launch yet this is an

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:33.139
to fully launch yet this is an
 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.550
to fully launch yet this is an
opportunity to then move over into

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560
opportunity to then move over into
 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.510
opportunity to then move over into
that next phase of open beta and again

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520
that next phase of open beta and again
 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.250

this is where you can have a lot of

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:42.260
this is where you can have a lot of
 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.940
this is where you can have a lot of
freedom to still be doing testing to get

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.950
freedom to still be doing testing to get
 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.650
freedom to still be doing testing to get
a sense of what's working and what isn't

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660
a sense of what's working and what isn't
 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.790
a sense of what's working and what isn't
and not have any consequences of ratings

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800
and not have any consequences of ratings
 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.550
and not have any consequences of ratings
so the thing about Google Play is that

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560
so the thing about Google Play is that

so the thing about Google Play is that
if you have a rating at this stage in

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510
if you have a rating at this stage in
 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.010
if you have a rating at this stage in
the game it does stick with your overall

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020
the game it does stick with your overall
 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.260
the game it does stick with your overall
average rating so it's really important

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270
average rating so it's really important
 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.170
average rating so it's really important
to iterate as much as you can before

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180
to iterate as much as you can before
 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.450
to iterate as much as you can before

full launch when the ratings really do
 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.540
full launch when the ratings really do
start mattering and this gives you an

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550
start mattering and this gives you an
 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.460
start mattering and this gives you an
opportunity to make those mistakes and

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:12.470
opportunity to make those mistakes and
 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.560
opportunity to make those mistakes and
not have those consequences show up on

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.570

the fundamentals then you can broaden it
out a little bit close testing with a

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440
out a little bit close testing with a
 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.730
out a little bit close testing with a
very small group of your user base get

some really good detailed feedback then
 

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.530
some really good detailed feedback then
you can move into early access if you

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:38.540
you can move into early access if you
 

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.870

into open beta or open testing and
 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.610

you to be successful okay so now we're
 

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.180
you to be successful okay so now we're
in launch window so here's a couple

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:49.190
in launch window so here's a couple
 

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.680
in launch window so here's a couple
things

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:49.690
things
 

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.290
things
be touching on quickly that will give

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:52.300
be touching on quickly that will give
 

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.660
be touching on quickly that will give
you some thought starters and things to

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:54.670
you some thought starters and things to
 

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.870
you some thought starters and things to
check out maybe I'd say one or two

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:57.880
check out maybe I'd say one or two
 

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.060
check out maybe I'd say one or two
months before you're launched so maybe

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.070
months before you're launched so maybe
 

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.830
months before you're launched so maybe
we can make you a hundred percent

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:04.840
we can make you a hundred percent
 

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.870
we can make you a hundred percent
confident maybe not a hundred percent

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880
confident maybe not a hundred percent
 

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.300
confident maybe not a hundred percent
maybe way more confident than you have

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:12.310
maybe way more confident than you have
 

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.340
maybe way more confident than you have
been in the past I remember what that

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:14.350
been in the past I remember what that
 

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.860
been in the past I remember what that
was like to launch games and how

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:16.870
was like to launch games and how
 

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.800
was like to launch games and how
nerve-wracking that was and watching

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:19.810
nerve-wracking that was and watching
 

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.250
nerve-wracking that was and watching
user ratings and watching the stats on

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:23.260
user ratings and watching the stats on
 

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.490
user ratings and watching the stats on
the from the play console or from the

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:26.500
the from the play console or from the
 

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.140
the from the play console or from the
back end of whatever platform you've

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:28.150
back end of whatever platform you've
 

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.540
back end of whatever platform you've
launched on so hopefully we can minimize

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:30.550
launched on so hopefully we can minimize
 

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:34.080
launched on so hopefully we can minimize
those stress points here we are device

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.090
those stress points here we are device
 

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:38.310
those stress points here we are device
catalog and pre-registration so anyone

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320
catalog and pre-registration so anyone
 

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.520
catalog and pre-registration so anyone
used the device catalog raise your hands

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:41.530
used the device catalog raise your hands
 

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:45.150

users we have a huge variety of devices
 

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.290
users we have a huge variety of devices
out there that read the reach is

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:01.300
out there that read the reach is
 

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.660

incredible now we all know the downside

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:03.670
incredible now we all know the downside
 

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.680
incredible now we all know the downside
of that fragmentation can be a bit of a

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:07.690
of that fragmentation can be a bit of a
 

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.660
of that fragmentation can be a bit of a
nightmare especially when you are a very

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:09.670
nightmare especially when you are a very
 

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.030

small team it's it's very intimidating
 

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.650
small team it's it's very intimidating
and it's quite unruly so I encourage you

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:16.660
and it's quite unruly so I encourage you
 

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.910
and it's quite unruly so I encourage you
all to check out the device catalog

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920
all to check out the device catalog
 

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.800
all to check out the device catalog
because what this is is knowledge for

essentially what the device catalog is
 

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.540
essentially what the device catalog is
is within the play console this is

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:30.550
is within the play console this is

really reduce those pain points of the
 

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.570
really reduce those pain points of the
fragmentation of the ecosystem but also

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:54.580
fragmentation of the ecosystem but also

really great desire to want to get your
game into as many players hands which I

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:15.340
game into as many players hands which I
 

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.160
game into as many players hands which I
think is a really beautiful thing to

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.170
think is a really beautiful thing to
 

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:20.640
think is a really beautiful thing to
achieve and I would hate to see you

limited by that by devices and of course

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:22.900
limited by that by devices and of course
 

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.750
limited by that by devices and of course
that's going to depend on the game right

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:24.760
that's going to depend on the game right
 

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.070
that's going to depend on the game right
there's certain games that you just

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:26.080
there's certain games that you just
 

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.970
there's certain games that you just
can't run on certain devices so start

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:29.980
can't run on certain devices so start

will feel very scary and
counterintuitive but really what you're

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:37.330
counterintuitive but really what you're
 

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.100
counterintuitive but really what you're
able to do then is once you launch or

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.110
able to do then is once you launch or
 

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.290

or had no idea that their game was
 

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.750
or had no idea that their game was
performing quite well and that there was

an opportunity for them to optimize and
 

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.090
an opportunity for them to optimize and
