00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:30.400
 it's very bad in music or I was not 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.500
 so he had money 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.500
 a nice ranch 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.310
 Burrito 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.050
 you more 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.680
 and it did not break 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.110
 he delivered everything to the music and the stereo 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.410
 musical of colombia and composed songs 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.280
 as the totuma as evil spirit 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.730
 as flares as from the north by the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.830
 south and those songs were after 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.570
 performed by very famous artists 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.070
 that brought the songs to fame and 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.950
 they became ambassadors 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.620
 of Colombia in the world and 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:40.580
 they were never given credit because nobody 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:42.229
 I knew who had made them one day 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.970
 he faced during his career a 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.530
 completely racist music industry 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.320
 that closed the doors to 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.770
 music from the coast but they did it 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.939
 The whites 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.939
 to turn off 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.090
 he spoke 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:13.200
 I do not dream about that makes me cry 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:19.280
 also when I'm already singing and 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.280
 I lie down hard because I do not 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.060
 to old age 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.780
 fasting and praying 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.830
 tell me you go
