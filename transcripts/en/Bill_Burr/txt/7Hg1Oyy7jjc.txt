Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and ah ha ha ha. I'm checking in on you.

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       Youuu.

Speaker 1:          00:00:15       Oh, sorry. Uh, how are Ya? Um, and Health Helsinki. I'm in Helsinki. I got a, I just did Stockholm the other night. I did Copenhagen two shows the night before and fucking Iceland on Monday. Been having a great time. Joe Barton. Nick.

Speaker 3:          00:00:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:34       Comment over here. Like he's always been over here. I actually asked him, cause he's been crushing so hard and so not like in his head, you know, about being over here thinking of, I'm going to do a joke about ducks. Do they have ducks? Do I need to say Canard? He hasn't been doing any of that shit. And, um, he's been killing. So I asked him last night when we were in Stockholm. I was like, how many times you've been over here? And he goes, Europe, that's fight. Yeah. And he goes, never. That's why people love Joe Barton, Nick, because Joey B is Joey be no matter where he is. Um, yeah, he's been killing and I've been, uh, I've been having some good sets over here trying out the new shit, the race against him.

Speaker 4:          00:01:23       Time, you know, I heard Joe Rogan say the other day that he was, he put in six months of work and he's got a new hour that he's happy with, you know, cause this special came out and um,

Speaker 3:          00:01:35       yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:01:35       you know, I was, I don't know, I just get, I get like amped up when I hear shit like that, but uh, so I'm, I'm trying not to jump the gun. If you guys are you, if you want to hear my process, my process about building a new hour is I usually dump this shit on most sick of first. You know what I mean? And a, it's a weird time. It's a weird time for your act because what happens is you get really excited about the new stuff

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       stuff and then the old stuff still works and nobody's really seen it yet, but you, you, you know, you're getting rid of it. So you feel like you ever go on a date with somebody,

Speaker 4:          00:02:12       you know. And you know, you're going to break up with them and you're out to dinner and, and she's just like, you want dessert? You're like, no, no, let's wrap this up.

Speaker 4:          00:02:26       Um, that's how, that's, that's what you have to fight with your jokes. Like you start trying to wrap them up and then jokes that were funny or now not funny because you're trying to rush through them. So, um, I kind of figured that out the last couple of nights and, uh, had some great shows and, um, I dunno, I did stock home last night and some of this stuff people said to me on the stage was making me a little nervous where I was like, uh, you know, I said something, I'm not a big political guy, but, uh, I've been doing this joke over here where I just go, um, you know, and as you all know in America right now, we currently have our greatest president of all time. You know, and people usually laugh because generally speaking they don't like him. And it was sort of quiet. It's, there was a couple people who just went like, yeah, Woo.

Speaker 4:          00:03:17       It's just like really and hung out with some people afterwards and they will kind of say in that, uh Oh and I mentioned, I mentioned during the show, I was saying this is nothing against people from Stockholm that just let me know where people are kind of ad. And then it was saying I go, can I ask you a question? I go, is this bullshit? Gonna start up again over here. And they kind of got a little uncomfortable like and kind of said, yeah, I don't know if they were joking or what the bullshit meaning another world war.

Speaker 5:          00:03:49       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:03:50       I Dunno. It's weird. And then I kind of talked to some people afterwards and granted Allie talked to two people and it was their opinion, but they was saying that it's just kind of getting like racist or whatever. Not like it ever went away. I Dunno. People are fucking awful. But those two people I talked to a nice and you know, something, 90% of the fucking people that I talked to, one nice and you know, the rest are like racist or like hardcore feminists, you know, just people you can't even have a fucking conversation with.

Speaker 5:          00:04:23       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:04:24       Sounding really ignorant to walk through the fucking world thinking that you have all the answers and you're going to be the one that solves it. How long have people been on this planet? I Dunno. When did Jesus die? Fucking 2020 years ago. Then you had what, like 500 years before him? Is that what it was? I, you know, I have no idea how long people have been on this planet. Hang on a second. Let me look that up. How long have people,

Speaker 4:          00:04:53       it'd be funny just to leave it there to see what they suggest that I said, search here. How long have people, no suggestion then I can't say here. Right. That's even, that's even too stupid for Google. How long have people been on, on the earth? This'll take me to Scientology. Well, before we were in a spaceship. Um, how long have people been on earth? Do you imagine if Scientology is right? There was some spaceship, right? And then they just fucking dropped us down here with absolutely no fucking what I mean, how far, how far in advance would they be technologically?

Speaker 5:          00:05:29       Right.

Speaker 4:          00:05:31       Anybody? Can you hear me here? And then they just fucking leave you to start all over again. And then that would basically be the, this would be a global like survivor, like this big fucking reality show that they're watching.

Speaker 5:          00:05:46       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:05:46       Here's a question and he's signed to ologists listen to this. Here's my question that goes, how this reminds me of this Joe Rogan bit he used to do about Noah's, where he was talking about how many species of plant or on the planet, and if he had two of each, and he was like, how big is this fucking boat? Doesn't that kind of work with Scientology? Like do you guys have a finite number of members that you can have and at that point, like the spaceships not going to be big enough or is it going to be a whole fleet? I Dunno. I Dunno why that religion has been interesting meeting. Interesting me. Interesting. I think right there. I just got Gab. We don't need this guy. All right. How have, how long have humans been on earth? Why can't they just answer the question? This is what I fucking hate about smart people. They got to go on and on and on. It starts up while our ancestors have been around for about 6 million years, just give me a number. What am I buying a fucking car here?

Speaker 3:          00:06:50       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:06:52       While our ancestors had been around for about 6 million years, the modern form of humans only evolved about 200,000 years ago. Yeah. Weren't they like two different kinds? And one of them, uh, live than the other ones. Didn't. There's somebody beat somebody else. I don't know. The only part I don't think I know about that history is a movies, not even documentaries. That's how not read. I am. I don't even watch documentaries. A civilization as we know it. It's only about 6,000 years old. So what does that mean? Running water? That goes back to Roman times. They held the title for 4,000 years before they whacked Jesus. Was that their downfall? They killed Jesus. Is that what happened or do they stretch it out too far like Hitler? Did they fight a war on two fronts? I mean, I'll just fucking melts together after a while, doesn't it? All right about 6,000 years old and industrialization started in the, in earnest only in the 18 hundreds. Ah, Jesus.

Speaker 3:          00:07:51       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:07:52       Future generations are paying for that. But I'll tell you what a fucking life we're living flat screen TVs and fucking cell phones. Speaking of cell phones. Helsinki. I'm in Helsinki. This is where no Kia started angry birds. What else are they known for here? Hockey.

Speaker 3:          00:08:12       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:08:14       Valtteri Botox. Huh? Who fucking one? I got, I got to see that race. It's just going to be like the first year I watched when, uh, uh, Lewis Hamilton went up against the other guy there that Lily Ricky Schroder looking dude, Nico Rosberg and he fucking won beat Louis Hamilton. And then his girlfriend was like, I don't want you to do it anymore. And he was like, all right.

Speaker 3:          00:08:40       Oh.

Speaker 4:          00:08:41       Um, I don't think that's what happened because he's still stayed away. At some point he would have dumped her. He would have missed the sound of the engine. Right. All right. So I guess we've been around for 6,000 years as we know it 200,000 years ago. The first fucking humans.

Speaker 3:          00:08:54       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:08:55       I'll tell you what's fucking amazing about all of this is I have no idea why he fucking looked this up. I Dunno. Can you, can it really be this, this is my new thing, how I deal with my short term memory when I can't remember stuff. I just think, well, you know, if I can't remember it, was it really that important? Um, anyway, plowing ahead here. Uh, here's a great story. It's not a great story. It kind of itself. All right. Oh Wow. Why did they do that? Shit. We're going to make you watch this fucking ad. I don't want to watch it close the fucking ad.

Speaker 4:          00:09:34       I'm going to hit mute because they don't get paid. Is that what the fuck it is? Stop. Stop. Thank you. All right. Uh, venture fans brutally beat man outside cinema after he loudly revealed the surprise ending to the blockbuster end game movie. I love both sides of this story. I mean, that is just the ultimate conti thing to do with. So fucking funny. And then I got to admit, you have to respect how much people care about this franchise and if you're going to do something like that, I mean, he kinda got the ass kick and he deserved, right? Uh, thank God it was a mob and nerds who repeat fucking dead. Do you realize what you have to do? I mean, nerds is supposed to be these nonviolent people who just kind of sit around and be awkward all the time. I love that they fucking tapped into their inner chuck Norris.

Speaker 4:          00:10:30       You found the breaking point. You go in and you fuck with their superhero franchise. Look at them. They turn into their cavemen selves from 200,000 years ago. Look at me. Sounded smart all of a sudden. Um, I mean, they surpassed modern civilization as we've known it for the last 6,000 years and went back to our earliest ancestors at 2000 years. Listen to that, huh? The beginning of a Dennis Miller joke. I think I'm smart now. I'm a man, has reportedly been beaten outside, beaten up outside his cinema after loudly revealing the plot of the new adventure film to queuing fans. Q, u, e you ing. There you go. There goes all my dentist melanoma dummy again, uh, film queuing to queuing fans who hadn't seen it yet. So he walked out of a showing and they were all standing in line

Speaker 4:          00:11:23       and he went, the hulk is green because he has gunnery, ours, whatever the fucking, whatever the fuck he yelled up because they're all banging wonder woman. Is this even the right franchise? Um, someone was trying to tell me that they've made 23 of these movies, 23 of these fucking movies, just, just for all you other people who just watch sports, like make, um, just to give you a motive for how this guy turned a pack of fucking awkward nerds. So you could probably walk up, slap him in the head and take their fucking popcorn and they wouldn't do anything as long as they held onto their movie ticket. This guy found out what it was.

Speaker 3:          00:12:08       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:12:09       It reminded me of a long time ago, this guy ran for president that I voted for and I can't even remember his fucking name.

Speaker 5:          00:12:16       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:12:17       He was the guy that everybody blamed for the first George Bush for getting in. You know, cause everybody made the assumption that if you voted for this guy than there, than if you didn't vote for that guy, you would have voted for fucking Al Gore.

Speaker 5:          00:12:31       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:12:33       Forgetting the fact of how fucking horrific Al Gore was all fucking sweaty. Al, you didn't laugh enough in the last debate. You didn't smile. Then also was just like Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho looking like a fucking robot. Um, let me see. Well, looking back, that was a fucking era. We should, you know, I didn't give a fuck if you're conservative. I think we should've Gone Al Gore, you know, then maybe we don't go to Iraq and become bankrupt and have to give champions of sports fast food when they show up at the White House. I'll probably oversimplifying all of this, but you know, I'm a man who just learned how long you've been on this planet. So why, why are you listening to me?

Speaker 5:          00:13:14       MMM [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:13:16       all right. What the fuck am I talking about here? Yeah. So this guy found the fuck it's anybody's, he's been made 23 of these fucking movies. So let's just say the average movie is 90 minutes. Two hours long. Okay. These poor people standing in line had 46 hours invested into this wall. Wait,

Speaker 3:          00:13:38       yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:13:38       we'll say 44 hours plus the trap l all the fucking money that they spent. And this was the final one. And that fucking asshole. I've, I've, I wonder if he was even a fan if he just went in like this was like some sort of like, I mean, that's like something opie and Anthony would have come up with back in the day, like some brilliant fucking thing like that.

Speaker 5:          00:14:03       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:14:05       I don't know. This is one of these weird ones where I kind of see both sides of it. Like what that kid did was fucking hilarious and it was also horrific. Any deserved the ass kick. And I'm on both sides of the fence here.

Speaker 5:          00:14:17       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:14:18       I would love to interview this kid and ask. Just ask him, why did you do that? Did you know you are going to do it? Do you have Tourette's or something? Like why the fuck did you do that and what were you thinking when they started to attack you? Do you regret doing it?

Speaker 5:          00:14:41       MMM,

Speaker 4:          00:14:43       I dunno. I mean, if I'm sitting on that jury, I say that those fans had motive. I'm arguing. I mean, these days, I mean, that's like, you got to think how young the average fucking fan is of this. I mean, they invested half their fucking lives into this. This guy just came in and told them what, I don't know what chimney Santa Claus was coming down. I haven't, you know what I have no, I don't know. There's so many of these fucking things that people are telling you. You gotta. Why have you seen game of Thrones? Have you seen fucking ah, what is this one called the Avengers and you just get so like fucking hopelessly behind. It reminds me of my junior year in math class. No, my senior year, junior year, I still tried. I tried until October and it just gets to this, there's like a point where you're just so far behind that you just give up hope.

Speaker 4:          00:15:36       Like I'm not passing, I can't, I what the eye, I'm just too far behind like a, I don't think I'll ever see game of Thrones, which is a sad thing because I know it's really good. I t you know, what is it like 19 fucking seasons is something you've got to fucking, uh, I remember lost lost was the first one that I was just like, I was too far behind and I was just like, I, I'm not, I'm not fucking watching this. And then they fucked everybody on the ending of that. So that one I feel good about. Maybe that's the way you do it.

Speaker 3:          00:16:16       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:16:17       What'd you do is you let other people go on point and you let them watch the show for you and then they'll report back to you like, oh my God, that fucking ending sucked. What a waste of fucking time. Then you go, all right, we'll fuck that then. Right? All right, so avenger fence. Is it worth me? MMM,

Speaker 3:          00:16:40       yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:16:40       Sitting down for 46 hours. That should literally be like a fucking, you know, if anybody, you can stay awake for 46 straight hours and watch all avenger movies right in a row. The last person to fall asleep, the last person to fall asleep. I don't know. When's the two big green hulk fists, whatever the fuck you people are into. Ah, Shit. Somebody just sent me a text. I was trying to think of the name of this fucking comedian who I just doesn't do it anymore. It probably is into producing or something like that. Whatever. What do either way, I hope they happy. Just you have answers to somebody fucking head. Their face pops into your head. You know when you're like, what the fuck was that guy's name? I haven't seen him forever, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:17:30       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:17:30       So then you can look them up on Facebook and see what the fuck they're at and you see how much older they are and then you realize that you look that much older than them and you don't recognize any of the people that they're with. And it's like, did I ever even fucking know that person? You know? Then you just start thinking like, what is it all about? What the fuck am I doing out here? Is this what my life is going to beautiful cities for 17 hours and getting on another plane and leaving. Then you look to see if they got a late night menu and you start ordering bad food and you know, just start spiraling down. Um, no, I've been doing, uh, I, I didn't do well in Iceland. I was on vacation when I was in Iceland and then I, uh, oh, Billy was getting the, was getting the old belly coming back. But um, I dunno, I had a couple of fucking moments there. I've always like, I don't like going fishing. I like it, but then I don't like it. It's exciting and all of that. But like, I just don't like, it's weird because I've eaten so much fish in my life, but to actually fucking pull it out of the sea, see how beautiful it is, and then fucking kill the thing, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:18:45       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:18:45       man, I felt bad. I didn't even eat the fucking head too. It's like Jesus Christ, Dude. What the fuck? You know? I don't know. We through the rest of it into the fucking ocean, but it bugged me. The cows, I never been. I know cows were that good looking. So this is what I'm doing now. Because you know what's funny is I know all you guys are cringing going, oh my God. Is he going to start wearing Birkenstocks and become an bill Bergen stocks? Right?

Speaker 4:          00:19:11       Hey, he's going to get a fucking, I'm going to scotch tape a man bun to the back of my bald head and then I'm going to start preaching to you guys about fucking being a Vegan. Oh Dude, this is such a fucked up analogy, man. Um, cause I gotta tell you something like, you know how cruel they are to fucking animals as a carnivore and you just don't want to watch it. If you have any sort of heart, you just don't want to watch it and you just fucking block it out. I saw this thing where they are this, there's some conservative talk show hosts that got a fucking death threat. So I'm like, who the hell is this guy? I don't know who this guy is. So I looked him up and he did this fucking thing, some rant on like abortion

Speaker 5:          00:19:51       and you know,

Speaker 4:          00:19:54       he showed, I I saw like 0.5 seconds he showed a picture of an abortion. I was just like, dude, what the fuck?

Speaker 5:          00:20:03       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:20:04       You know, I'm not going to get involved in my views on that thing. I, you know, whatever you want to do is whatever you want to do. But uh, you might want to look at some photos. Jesus fucking Christ. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen. Um, I probably shouldn't have said that because now his fans are going to say, I'm not going to get involved in that shit. And I don't want to fucking sit there cause I don't, I don't know shit. All right, so don't fuck, I'm not an ally of either side of that fucking argument. I think it's your own fucking do whatever the fuck you want to do. Okay. But yeah, you should probably look at a slide show first.

Speaker 4:          00:20:37       It's all I can say. Um, so I haven't said that. This is what I'm going to do now. Um, I think when I'm on the road, I'm going to be vegetarian for the fee. Like for breakfast I had eggs. Oh, that's still vegetarian, right? No, that's a meet. I already fucked it up. Whatever. I was going to be tried to go veggie for the first, uh, for breakfast and then for lunch and then for dinner I'll have a laugh, something, you know, and uh, I'll see how that goes. I've been doing that for the last couple of days and it's good. I started, I'm dropping, fucking wait. You know, I'm not gonna lie to you. I'm shitting like a fucking race horse. It's ridiculous. It's like I'm going to a bathroom, like a fucking cocaine.

Speaker 4:          00:21:26       People looking at me waiting to snip. It's like, ah, you're looking at the wrong end. Damn. Um, alright. Abortions, shit jokes. Dead Animals. Where else did we go from here? World War three? I think we pretty much, I think it's time for some advertising. All right, let's do it here. Um, what do we got here? We got up. This is a long, long, hey look. You know right in about that, right in about fucking remember in faces, but forgetting the names and then you remember him and then you'd go on Facebook and try to look them up and just see where the, where the fuck they ended up. You know, whenever I do that, I just said, I pray to God, they happy. I want to see joy. That's what I want to see. You know, I'm not, I'm not as big a Qantas. Everybody thinks I'm all right.

I'm getting fresh, a fresh seasonal salad. Then I'm getting a salmon soup. So what am I'm fucking trying, I'm trying in, uh, any uh, vegetarians or vegans out there that, you know, you got some good meals that I can kind of toss it in there. I, I'd love to do it cause I'm feeling pretty good. Feeling light on my, on my freckled toes here, my freckled paste Ito's um, just don't give me any that Tofu shit.

Speaker 4:          00:29:51       All right. I don't like Tofu. I don't know what Tofu is. I don't know what it's trying to be. And I also don't like that shit where it's like, uh, you know where they have like the fake meat. Like I like a black bean burger, you know, or if you make a lentil burgers, it's actually made from something I don't like when they just mush a bunch of shit together and then try to make it look like meat. It's just like, you know, it's like be yourself, you know, be with the fuck you are. I have a great recipe for a, uh, uh, a lentil burger where it's also like, it's got beets in it, the is Cilantro and some other green shit that you put in there and a little bit of bread crumbs. It's fucking tremendous, but it's hard to eat that when you're out here on the road.

Speaker 4:          00:30:36       That was the one thing I did like about Iceland though, is as much as I didn't order anything like that, they did have plenty of options. So anyways, um, I'll see how this goes. You know, I think I'm always going to eat meat, but I think I'm going to do it like once a day as opposed to like fucking three times a day. And um, part of its cousin animals. I'll tell you what's weird about pigs is UBC a little piglet. They're fucking adorable. And then you think, I can't believe I eat that. But then you just see some fat pig and it's just like Adam gave a fuck. Give it to behind. It's pickier. Let's fuck it. Eat. Um, anyways. All right, that's it. Uh, thank you to everybody's been coming out on this tour, man. I'm playing these fucking really impressively sized venues over here that have been absolutely beautiful and it blows my mind that people are coming out here.

Speaker 4:          00:31:32       So I do want to take the time to say thank you for that. And I'm really looking forward. I got two shows here tonight and uh, in Helsinki and then it's on to Oslo, Norway. And then I'm in Amsterdam and we got the next day off and I'm in Amsterdam, although we are traveling to Tel Aviv. But, uh, you know, that's going to be fun. Put it that way, but I'm not drinking, you know, I think I'm going to eat like a pot cookie or something like that and just walk around the just city, mildly tripping. Uh, I will not be getting on a bicycle, but uh, yeah, that's what I'm going to do. I think that's what the fuck I'm gonna do you no good. Clean Fun. All right. That's it. Enjoy your weekend, your cons. Enjoy the music.

Speaker 6:          00:32:18       And we've got another half hour of the biggest hits Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast from a year ago. [inaudible] I always forget how it does. All right, let's see. I'm just somebody [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:33:17       hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, May 2nd, 2011. Um, how the hell are you? Um, this is a landmark week from me in my career and, uh, and in this podcast because for the first time ever, I'm actually, I have an advertiser, no bullshit. I have an advertiser, like a real live radio show on this podcast and I know what you guys are thinking, you're probably like, Oh gee, he's got advertising. So what does that mean, Bill? Does that mean you're not going to use the word content anymore? No, it does not. Does that mean you're going to tone it down? No, it doesn't. All it means is that it continues to be fucking free for you. Cheap motherfuckers. Not Kidding. A cheap, just a financially challenged motherfuckers. You still mother fuckers, you're still fuckers of mothers. But anyways, so this week for the first time ever I do have, I'm going to have some advertising and I'm actually working on some tee shirts and that type of thing.

Speaker 1:          00:34:26       I'm trying to take this thing to the next level. Maybe you have a merge page. Whatever the hell I got to do a, I appreciate everybody who's gone on to the [inaudible] podcast page and clicked on the donation button. Um, I appreciate it. I really appreciate it. So with that, um, this week, my one and only advertised to the first ever legends, one of these legendary moments in the podcast. Like when I, when I, I switched from a yapping on my phone as I drove down the street and I actually got a mixer. Um, this is the first advertiser and you're probably thinking, hey bill, what are you going to do? Are you going to advertise some booze? You can advertise some weed. Uh, no I'm not. I'm actually going to give a lot of guys out there. A little bit of a heads up. Mother's Day is coming up this Sunday, isn't it? I Dunno, I didn't look it up. I think it is.

Speaker 1:          00:35:19       See, this is what happens every mother's Day, right? Who Doesn't love their mother? Serial killers, right? Syrah killers don't love their mothers. Everybody else, you'll love your mother, right? But as much as you try every year, what happens? Mother's Day sneaks up on you and all of a sudden Saturday night you're out drinking a couple of couple of fucking Pale Ales and all of a sudden somebody mentions it, you know the waitress with their fucking cleavage, Chang and out. She'll mention, oh yeah, tomorrow. You know, you're trying to pick her up a, what do you, what are you doing tomorrow? And we should hang out, go play fucking horse shoes or some, you know, my brother's got a cottage up in New Hampshire, doe. She come up there and then she's like, I can't, I am. I'm spending time with my mother's tomorrow because it's mother's Day. And then what do you do?

Speaker 1:          00:36:09       You Go, Oh fuck, it's mother's Day. So what do you do? You run down to cvs, you know, any port in a storm, you run down to the local drugstore and you go and you try to find a fucking mother's Day card. But by the time you get down there, there's only two left, right? What do you got? There's the fucking one that has like a fart joke on it. And then the one that's so affectionate, it's borderline incestuous, right? So now what are you can now you get a shitty car. The fucking envelopes are all creased up, delaying laying all over the fucking place and your mother can see it. When you hand it to her, she could see it. It's not a good card. It's just like you, motherfucker. I carried you around in my fucking home for nine months. I raised your, Brad asked the entire fucking life, and this is what you do.

Speaker 1:          00:36:51       You get me the, the, the, the goddamn leftover card that nobody wanted at cvs. You couldn't even go to Walmart and get me a shack at to go along with it.

That was like old school. The hosts of the show was doing it like in the 1950s, you know, this is the crest toothpaste hour.

Speaker 1:          00:39:15       Hello folks. Say Your teeth falling out of your head. Did you not notice? Because you've been in a mine for the last 20 years and you don't belong to a union. Thank God for crest. It's got fluoride soon to be in your drinking water. So you're a lot more or less at days lackadaisical or however you say the fucking word and you're less likely to question authority. Um, I am in New York City people, uh, you probably like, why bill, why are you in, in New York City? I'll tell you why. Uh, me and Joe de Rosa and Robert Kelly, you heard last week we, uh, our film debuted in the prestigious Tribeca film festival and uh, I went to two of the screenings. I'm going to another screening tonight and uh, I gotta tell you something that is the most nervous I've ever fucking been. I'd have to go back to the first time I did Letterman or maybe the first time I even did stand up just the, the feeling of, of like, what if this goes bad?

Speaker 1:          00:40:09       And I have absolutely no control of it does. And uh, fortunately it went well and uh, I got up tell you something. I don't say this too often. I was really proud of, uh, I was proud of it. You know, I knew we didn't pull any punches, but when I sought watching it with the crowd was a whole different vibe. Plus watching it up against some of the other movies. Um, you know, I was really nervous cause their movies was, they were, they were great and some were really serious and I was just going, oh my God, what the, how the hell is ours going to hold up against in. Fortunately it did. And, uh, we've had a great festival and tonight is the last night and I gotta tell you people, I have never been more tempted to booze since I quit booze and then this goddamn week, but I got 200 days coming up. I didn't want to fuck that up. And then once I go over 200 days, that's it. I'm just gonna fucking, uh, I think I'm just going to pull myself out, you know, like cal Ripkin. I'm just going to say all right to hell with this shit. You know? Fuck it. What more do I need to prove? So like I have a drinking problem. I just have a huge head problems.

Speaker 1:          00:41:24       Do you guys know that? That's really the real reason why I quit. Not because I was getting drunk, coming home, blaming my day on Nia, slapping around a kitchen table and then later taken out a fucking frozen box of peas and putting it on the side of her fucking left titty. Cause I gave her a fucking uppercut. Right? That's not why. It's because I already have a giant head, a pumpkin head, as some of the people on the Internet have said,

Speaker 1:          00:41:55       which always makes me giggle. Um, that's why I quit drinking. I just got sick. There's something like, look, who's kidding? Who? You hit middle age and I don't give a fuck. You just don't look as good. But there's no reason to help it along. You know what I mean? It's pure vanity. That's why I fucking stopped. And uh, you know, you know the deal, you know in the broads, they fucking hit middle age. They've, they've, they've squeezed out a couple of fucking kids now they resent the fuck anybody who has free time, you know, because they made a decision to take a hot one right between the fucking legs, you know, that was your choice. So I want to have a kid, they're so cute and then they have one and then there are a bunch of fucking, it's mother's Day this week. Everybody, let's not lose sight of that.

Speaker 1:          00:42:45       This is going to go bed. Uh, Jesus. Um, yeah mothers are just, they're fucking pains in the air. Then another reason to go to pro flowers and give him a bouquet and shove it in their face. All right already we got it. You agree? You regretted your decision and I'm a fucking reminder of it. So anyways, um, I'm already picturing profile was people listening to it that's just such, lets you know, is this groundbreaking way of selling flowers? Cause it seems weird to me. Um, anyway, I'll talk about how people age, right? So what a women do. Okay. Then they have a couple of kids and they're so fucking God damn busy. All right. That not only do they not have time to do a sit up, they don't even have time to fucking wash their hair anymore. So they all go out and get that Wayne Gretzky haircut that he had when he got married. You know, I'll show it on the side like Adolf Hitler and then they poof it up on top. You know, the Katie Lang, they get that haircut and they're like, oh my God, I love it. I love it. It's so easy to deal with, right? Not knowing that when their husband, Ben's them over, they feel like they're fucking a dude.

Speaker 7:          00:43:55       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       a dude with tits, right? That's what you feel like. So that's how they age, you know? And then what happens with guys guys age like John Travolta and Alec Baldwin. It's very rare that a celebrity will actually just continue to fucking eat and booze and do what regular people do when just allow themselves to age the way regular people do. You know that shit. You know that deal way? Uh, I don't know. Eat like a pig all summer and then it comes the wintertime. You take out your button down shirt and you got a t shirt on underneath it cause you don't to sweat your way through it cause you're such a fat fucking booze bag at that point. And then you just, you don't even notice. And all of a sudden for some reason you used to be, you can only see a tee shirt up top near your neck.

Speaker 1:          00:44:41       Now you can see it in between like each button because the fucking fabric of your button down is stretched. So God damn far, that's why, that's why I quit booze. And I had, uh, you know, every year I buy like four or five button down shirts and those are my, I'm going to headline for an hour doing comedy shit, uh, shirts, right. And, uh, they usually last me a year, but I had this one and I didn't even notice. You know, cause you know, you put it on a couple of pounds a week, you don't fucking know. It's all of a sudden I was taking pictures and the, and the button that was right, you know, between my man tits was that the fabric was just, it looked like the shirt was going to explode. So that's basically why I, uh, that's why I quit the Busan. So, uh, I recommend it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:27       I recommend going off the sauce for a minute. Um, so now what I want to experiment with as far as my boozing, and I want to know if there's anybody tried this, I'm going to drink one day a month and when I do, it's, it's gonna be fucking epic. I'm going to get it all out, all out of the way in one day, beer and whiskey all at the same time. Giant chalices of fucking booze and a then I'm going to hate myself for like a day or two and then I'm just going to get on with my month. Has anybody been able to do that? Because I tried doing that last time and then it became a twice a month, three times a month. And next thing you know I'm doing a fucking keg stand and my face is turning red and I'm just like, what am I doing?

Speaker 1:          00:46:15       You know, but I don't think I'm an alcoholic. I just have a job where I can booze. You know, what's the worst that happens? I show up, hung over and I bitch about how I'm a fucking loser and then everybody laughs because they feel better about their lives. Like he's doing worse than us. This guy's awesome. So, uh, let me know if you guys out there, do you have any sort of, uh, do you have any sort of, I don't know, like, cause anybody been able to do that? Like just say, I'm, I'm, I only drink Saturdays or I drink one Thursday a month. Has anybody been able to stick with that? I Dunno. That's my thing. I'm afraid to go back to it because a, I was really, I was looking like, well, I don't look like a Baldwin, but my torso did. You know I had the Baldwin Torso, I the John Travolta Torso, you know, a Ted Kennedy Body.

Speaker 1:          00:47:08       That's why the fuck I was. Gino said that shit, by the way, Bill Maher's in rolling stone this past week and I read it and he said, how, you know, he just sticks to weed and they say, do you not like alcohol? And he basically, I'm paraphrasing here, he said he loves it. He said, but as a guy, after a while you just have to stop drinking or you end up looking like Ted Kennedy and it's fucking true. Especially a white dude. You get that WC fields knows, hey, my little chickadee. You don't want to look like that. All right. You get the yellow eyes. You get that fucking jaundice.

Speaker 1:          00:47:40       Oh God. But I miss it. Um, anyways, let's plow ahead here. Um, so anyways, I was talking about my, uh, can I say anyways any more fucking times on this podcast. Um, another thing that went on this week is we had the second antisocial comedy network show, um, that we did up at Foxwoods in a 4,000 seat theater. And we actually sold the thing out. I was a absolutely blown away by not only the amount of people showed up, but how great the crowd was. Everybody was talking about it. For those of you who are on the outside, the anti social network tours put together by a Jim Norton, little Jimmy from the wonderful opie and Anthony Radio program. Um, he put together this towards me, Jim brewer, Dave Attell and obviously Jim Norton. And um, we've been selling a ton of tickets and it's been great. Everybody does 20 minutes.

Speaker 1:          00:48:35       We come out, we hit you with our best stuff. And uh, we kicked the shit out of that crowd and they weren't, they were just a great crowd. They laughed. You could bring them up, you could bring them down. They were just a phenomenal crowd. And then we just do a little question and answering afterwards, I'm like, five minutes. And then we hold ourselves out afterwards, taking pictures, signing shit. And everybody goes back to gambling. And it was, uh, just this amazing theater. I was actually talking to brewer because I'd had this fucking upper deck and we immediately started talking about playing wiffle ball and about whether or not we could hit the upper deck from the, uh, from the stage man. And a, this one was, it was just close enough where it was a nice fucking poke. But, uh, uh, Jesus, that would've been a great time, except the people who run the theater would have thought it was obnoxious, you know?

Speaker 7:          00:49:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:25       Look at these guys. You get to tell jokes and play wiffle ball with the fuck what next? They can drink every night.

Speaker 1:          00:49:34       Uh, but I want to thank everybody who came down there and, uh, if that tour interest you, uh, we've been selling a ton of tickets down there and a Washington DC. We're playing there on May 13th. So get your fucking ass is down there. All right, look at it's so goddamn recession you get for comics for the fucking price of one. I am just whoring myself out on this podcast. proflowers.com now I'm hyping the tour before I've even brought you an hour's worth of comedy. How fucking dare I look at me. I'm becoming a corporate cont everything. What were you guys do if I just totally fucking sell out on this podcast? I stopped saying cunt. I actually build a cubicle around my bed.

Speaker 1:          00:50:20       I changed the name of the podcast. This is brought to you by the Halliburton Monday morning podcast that we do every day now because the higher ups are making us aid. Do you know Halliburton actually changed their fucking name? Um, that was a weird way of saying, um, uh, I was working down in Houston, Texas and that's where they have, uh, at least their United States headquarters. And uh, they used to have this giant sign as you went to a George Bush international, go fuck yourself. I love the Illuminati airport down there. Um, and they had this giant sign down there that would say Halliburton and they had such a bad public image is that they actually made the sign a lot smaller and they kept making it smaller and then now they just finally changed their names to like, uh, you know, grandma's cupcakes or something like that. Something just completely, yeah. Pedestrian. Um, you know, it's funny, I don't even know what they do. Isn't that typical? Isn't that just typical of several whiny fucking cunt? I have no idea what they even do. What do they do? What did they, as far as I know, this is my layman's understanding of what they do is basically,

Speaker 3:          00:51:33       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:51:34       they say to the Pentagon, will you guys blow it up? And then we'll rebuild it. We'll get our contractors in there, you know, and we'll build a little strip mall. We'll stick a Starbucks in there. And that way everybody's going to want to be American. Everybody's going to want you don't fucking fat. I feel right now. I just went to a steak house and there was these fucking real housewives chicks sitting up at the bar. These four white ladies, you know, just dress like horse. I'll tell you right now, if you're a mom and you still dress like you're out there trying to get fucked, you're just a terrible mother, you know, and they should really, they should repossess your fucking kids. And this is just going to all be about mothers this week as I try to get you to buy flowers.

Speaker 1:          00:52:29       You know, what are you doing with the tight fucking jeans? You know, you're fucking Goddamn hip hugger jeans, Goddamn c section scar just above your badassador belts for fuck sakes. Put some clothes on. You're a mother. It's over. You know, do you know I worked with someone recently, right? And, and they will fucking, you know, they mentioned that they had a kid. So I'm always asking about kids cause I'm seriously thinking about having one, you know, sticking him in the corner next to a vase. You know, just adding to like my, my possessions. I'll have my guitars. I've got a couple of guitars. What else do I have? I don't know. A lot of shit. I got a desk, I'll stick in between the guitars and the desk just that Monday they are. And like, you know when you have like those cakes that they have under glass at diners, I'll just a fucking baby in there. Every once in awhile it usually I'll lift the lid up

Speaker 8:          00:53:31       [inaudible] just

Speaker 1:          00:53:32       fucking put it back over, give it a bottle, knock it off. Hey, knock it off, visit awake and I'll just just tap on the glass. That's really creepy. No, I've been thinking about having a kid. Right. So, um, I ran into this mother after a show and she was talking about her son and she look young, right? She was like 30, 31 years old. And I go, uh, I go, how old is your son? She goes, 11. And then she mentioned she had a daughter. I go, how was your daughter? And she goes, 13. So I do the math. She had him at 18 to 20. And I was just like, Jesus Christ. I, yeah, you started young hunt. She winks at me. She goes, yeah, got it out of the way. She goes, now it's me time. I'm just thinking in my head, what do you mean me time there were 11 and 13 the fuck are you to, you know, that's why I really think it's a good thing that I, I haven't had kids yet because I'm a selfish cunt and I'm really into doing shit for myself.

Speaker 1:          00:54:35       And it's just a lot of people out there. I Dunno. I think they just have kids and then they that are all, they stick them in front of the TV, watch a little Teletubby, you know, and they're just bad parents. And then every once in a while you see a great fucking parent who's really involved with this kid. Like this youtube video that somebody sent me this week, this guy sent me a youtube video of his seven year old son, uh, is a drama. This kid is this shit. Not only can he play, cause I've seen kids play before, but he actually sings along with the song and he has a lookup passion on his face. It's fucking awesome. Uh, you can watch all these videos, by the way, on the [inaudible] podcast.com. Um, the only thing I will say to this to the dad is you've got to get that kid some sort of a, you got to get them earplugs.

Speaker 1:          00:55:19       You gotta get them those, uh, those Vic first earphones that you just put, it looks like the kids get to use a weed whacker. Just have them wear those. It'll seem weird for the first couple of days, but I'm telling you that the kids ears are going to be fucking junk if you let him play without earplugs. Uh, take it from me. I suffer from, uh, tonight is a Tetnis, however the fuck you say it. And that's that ringing in the year. Um, but you know, there's nothing better than when you actually see good parents. And I get it. I get nervous, said I'm not going to be a good dad. Um, and whenever I see, you know, whenever I see a bunch of fucking women who are mothers just dressed like they're out there looking to get banged, it's just like, there's no way you're a good mom.

Speaker 1:          00:56:04       You can't be a good mom. You get dress too nicely. You know, moms look, they wear comfortable clothes. They have that fucking look on their face like Jesus Christ. What did I do with my life? That's a mom. You got sit down there with Ed Hardy panties and then going out? Yeah, my, my dad or just graduated the seventh grade. Really? The fuck are you doing? What are you out here riding on the back of the Harley with your Goddamn ass crack showing you're not a mom right there. You ought to get a warning. You know, you should get a warning dress like a mom. Get the fuck Outta here. Sitting here drinking your God damn booze in the middle of the day. How would your Bra straps showing the fuck is wrong with you lady? Uh, am I wrong thinking that? Am I just being selfish? Because you know, when I become a dad, I still want to have a cool car.

Speaker 1:          00:57:02       I don't have that fucking van. I wouldn't have a car. That's cool. And my kids aren't allowed in it. And when they asked me why, I'm going to say, because at your age you're still a fucking animal. Look at you. You got cheerios all over your face. You got ice cream on your fingers. I don't even remember. You have an ice cream. What is that shit you think you're going to get my dodge fucking challenge. I'm just going to have one nice car. That's going to be for me and Nia when we go out and we get a sitter, right? That's, that's the uh, let's pretend we don't have responsibility car and we'll go out and have a dinner and come back in a couple hours and then we'll just have some shit fucking van, uh, Shit van with those fucking Nascar Formula One seat belts that criss cross in front of you, both for safety and also so those little bastards can't get up. You know, I still think I'm going to be a good dad despite the horrific shit of sand right now.

Speaker 1:          00:58:07       Um, somebody sent me a great, oh, by the way, my specialists still showing, still streaming on Netflix, by the way. I want you guys' opinion. I'm thinking the next time I do a special, I'm sending my special directly to Netflix because I think when I sent it to channels where they have commercials and they censor it, you're not getting the re the full on ignorant Bill Burger experience are you, you know, it just, you know, you really want to see the level of more on that. I am. You have to have the uncensored version. So I'm thinking that that's the future. I'm loving it because people will watch Netflix or are there if they seem like they're getting the real special to me, which means they either absolutely love it or they think I'm the dumbest person on the planet. Uh, with that, let's get into advice for this week. This podcast is going to be a little shorter than the recently I've been doing like an hour and 20. I think they're too fucking long. Um, so I'm going to try and do about an hour. Come right in and about an hour. You know, let's just long enough for your commute.

Speaker 1:          00:59:08       Um, Oh, before I read the advice that I'd tell you guys, I'm working, I'm trying to work on my temper now that I got the booze on the control, uh, and now I'm going to work on my temper. See, this is me slowly giving into the fact that I'm going to get married at some point. I can't even say that I'm going to get married. Then I'm going to get married at some point. I'm going to have kids. All right. First thing I had to do is I had to stop drinking. Like I was pledging a frat. That was the first fucking thing I had to do. You know? Although when I have kids, I'm going to be really tempted at the end of my long workday doing absolutely nothing as a comedian, you know, not to just pour that scotch with the one fucking ice cube in it. I don't want to do that in front of kids. Maybe I'll have a shed out back.

Speaker 7:          00:59:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:56       And that's what I'll do. All my Busan. Right. And then eventually, you know, I'll think that I'm fooling everybody and then I'll have a bottle in the back of the fucking half bathroom in the basement, you know, in the back of the toilet. Then everybody had no on Busan. And then eventually when they have the intervention will be out there in that shit. Bill thinks he's doing a documentary and I'm going to be fucking sitting there a walk in. This is why I do most of my drinking and I'll be all noble about it. I never do it in front of my kids. You know, my, my kids fear everything could be, you know, eventually I'm going to stop, right? And then I go walking in there. My whole disappointed family's going to be sitting there next to a band saw.

Speaker 1:          01:00:46       And I'm a stubborn Irish mother fucker. I'm not going to rehab. Go Fuck Yourself. You go to Rehab. Oh, we're all walking out. God, more booze. Money for me. Um, I ain't know what the hell I'm talking about right now. Have you guys been watching the playoff hockey? Congratulations to everybody's team or moved on to San Jose Sharks. The Detroit Redwings, the Nashville predators. Who would've thought, oh, what a fuck it thought. Who the hell are they playing out? Their kings are out. Ducks are out. Oh, Vancouver, Vancouver. And then over in the east to one cheese. I don't know who wants series last week. A Tampa Bay lightning, Washington capitals, Philadelphia Flyers. And I think that's it. I think that's the, uh, those are, oh, wait a minute. Oh, Jesus. I almost forgot the Boston Bruins beat the fucking fuck. Fucking fucking Montreal Canadians. Oh, was that enjoyable? What a tremendous series. Round of applause for playoff hockey. It went seven games. Like you knew what was gonna and I thought it was a tremendous series, although I was a little disappointed with the certain members of the Montreal Canadians with that bitch level of hockey, that fucking Hammer Lik Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       I thought he was in some fucking slap stick movie. What was he doing out there? Anytime you went, move fucking skate, the wind of you skating by the guy would just fall down of funny. Was that when, what's his face? The Bruins announcer. I can never remember his name. John, whatever. When he fucking Egos here, Millette goes down like he was shot jet up. I'm not a fan of that over the top sort of fucking announcing, but I, that was so fucking called for when he said that it was fucking ridiculous. But uh, but it was just a, it was a phenomenal series and I knew it was going seven, seven games and I was hoping we were going to win. I'm not even going to talk shit, you know, I'm not even going to talk shit. Whenever you play the Canadians, they have fans, even if their team sucks, they take them to the next level was a fucking awesome series.

Speaker 1:          01:03:08       And uh, that fucking sue bond guy man is the shit. That guy is a star. And I loved the way he plays the game. I even love that annoying shit. He does. I love it. He's a Gamer. He's just trying to knock you off your fucking game by being a cunt. I love it. And he can play the game. And that fucking goal that he scored to send it into overtime was, uh, there was just a fucking laser beam. But I gotta tell you, there is some sort of unwritten NHL rule that if the Montreal Canadians are down by a goal in a deciding game, I don't give a fuck whether you committed a penalty or not. You're going to be short a man. They just, I mean, how many fucking years in a row can they do that for that team? It's ridiculous. Wasn't it enough that for all those fucking decades they got first shot at every French born Canadian player?

Speaker 1:          01:03:56       Wasn't that enough that they got, they had their own draft pool. It has six team league this so fucking overrated with their goddamn history. And I love that. When Bruins fans talk to him now all Canadian fans have is their history. What's, what's the historical playoff series record? Yeah, that's right. Go back a quarter to have a fucking century. Since the last time you dominated us, you fucking French cunts. You got nothing. You haven't dominated us since 1987 it's over. It's fucking over now. If you want to trash us for not winning a cup, I don't have a dog in that fight. We're fucking horrific. It's pathetic. We haven't won in one in almost 40 years. You're 100% in the right. But if you're going to try and sit there and act like your in the way, you're not. Go do your fucking homework there. Frenchie all right, we've played you guys 11 times since 1988 we beaten you seven fucking times.

Speaker 1:          01:04:52       Have four and seven against us. We'd beat you in a seven game series. We'd beat you all three overtime games and last time we played you, we swept you when the last two games at home. So I don't know what the fuck you're talking about and Dan Shaughnessy you lazy mother fucker. If you're not going to watch hockey, stop writing about it. You know that son of a bitch when we want to game seven, he still figured out a way to shoehorn in the curse of the Babe Horse that he always writes about. There's nothing funnier than watching Dan Shaughnessy writing about hockey. He knows nothing about it. He started bringing up Johnny Pesky, you know, ted Williams. Bucky Dent. He then the man can only write one fucking story if there's not a ghost, a Goblin or a or in it. He doesn't know how to write the fucking article.

Speaker 1:          01:05:38       You know, it's fucking ridiculous. Why? Why don't you address the real problems, Dan Shaughnessy like how the Bruins resented free agency. Not only didn't, didn't play the game, they fucking resented it. They didn't want to fucking pay anybody. Why don't, why don't you talk about that? Or the Canadians drafting first pick of every French born Canadian player. Why don't you bring shit up like that as opposed to sounding like you're pitching a show to go on after ghost hunters. Oh, somebody get that guy a hot comb and a fucking book on Goddamn hockey. All right, let's plow ahead here. Um, advice, advice for the week. Um, oh wait, I promise these guys. I was going to read it. Now that I've said con 20 times, I promise that I was going to read this thing three times during the podcast. So we're at the halfway point. Everybody open yourself up a beer.

Speaker 1:          01:08:08       Okay? You get a vase, you know women shit. Alright, and vase is, it's just another thing. Oh my God, he got a vase with it. He really does love me. All right, that's the commercial at the half hour seat. Look at this. Look at this. I'm getting the information in. I'm keeping it funny. I'm still saying cunt. It's just phenomenal. All right. Uh, advice for this week. Dearest bill, my entire life, I've jumped from one long relationship to another. Oh, geesh. At the ripe age of 30, I've started to see a pattern. Good for you. There you go. That's right. You've seen a pattern. Now see people, this is how you improve your life rather than blaming others. It's like being a comedian. How many times can you bomb and say in this crowd sucks. At some point you've got to look at yourself. You gotta you gotta look, go to the mirror and look at your fucking booze bag.

Speaker 1:          01:09:03       Freckled face like me a few months ago and say, listen, I've got to lay off the booze. I gotta I gotta I gotta work on my act here. Um, so this is what this guy's doing. Exactly. You keep pulling fish out of the same poison pond and you getting tired of it. Good for you, sir. Here's the pattern. He goes, I start when I start dating a woman, she's dialed up. She's in great shape. She's fun to be around. She's always willing to go the extra mile by doing little things to show you. She cares and she's willing to explore, enjoy, and share my interests. All right. Starting off a little myopic. She dresses nice in lights to do this shit. I though, all right. After a few months, one year or two, one year, she does up about 50% of the time. She's still in good shape. She's fun to be around.

Speaker 1:          01:09:51       She's a willing, she's willing to explore and share my interests. One year on little by little, things start to disappear. She does up 10% of the time. She's an average to pudgy shape. She's fun about half the time and she's only the willing to share interests there are that are already developed. Oh, so she doesn't want to do any new things. Each girl seems to stray further and further away from their month one personalities at different rates. Yet it, it seems to always stray away into the negative zone. Oh, it never gets better. I again find myself in a new relationship, things that, okay, so he gets out of that one. One year in he goes, hey again, find myself in a new relationship. Things are fan fucking tastic. I'm living the dream yet I find myself terrified. Oh, so I guess he's in a new relationship.

Speaker 1:          01:10:42       When will she stop dialing up? When will she stop being easygoing? When will that little pouch start to grow above her belt? I'm jaded and scared. Bill. Does the month one girl ever stick around? Am I doing something to turn these perfect girls into comfortable couch potatoes? I don't want to see another one transformed. What do I do? I know it's human nature to get comfortable, comfortable, sooner or later to be able to function as a normal human being. It's impossible to keep that one month girl around, but can't they just stay in the one month, a year category? Do they have to go beyond the one year? Oh, as far. And he said, okay, am I ready to get billed? Burned. People liked that one. I forget what the other one was. It was a wait, I got it here at the top of the page.

Speaker 1:          01:11:30       Uh, ah, ginger or odd ginger. Snap. Um, those are my catch phrases. Everybody. Um, all right, let's plow ahead here. Uh, what am I up to? Oh, by the way, I'm probably going to forget this. So if my web guy is listening, please remind me to put up the youtube videos of that red headed kid. There's some poor bastard. This kid, I don't know how old he is. He's like 12, 13 years old and he makes these videos and he's just, he doesn't know any better. He lives in the middle of nowhere. He's just making a total ass of himself. So every time he, and he's a redhead, you know, he's already in an awkward age and he's a red head and he's a redhead mail. So, you know, that's just a fucking hail storm. I lived through it. It's not a pretty sight.

Speaker 1:          01:12:23       San Jose sharks go up to nothing. Sorry, got the game on in the background. Um, so anyways, yeah, that's, that's not a fun time. It's not a fun time for fucking anybody unless you know, you're just one of the popular kids. So this kid keeps making these videos. So what happened was, was people started trashing them because that's what happens. You know, you put yourself out there, you basically, the second you get on a stage or you film yourself, you've, you basically, you put yourself on a Dunkin stool and given the world a bunch of baseballs, that's basically what you've done. This kid didn't realize it, so they start fucking trash in them. And rather than ignoring it, he's been responding to it and he's yelling into the camera. This is a message for all you haters out there. I can make as many videos as I want, but all going to continue making videos.

Speaker 1:          01:13:16       So fuck you. He's doing that. And he has faces all fucking freckled and red. He looks like a young Malakai from church, children of the corn. He sings songs. Um, actually I got a name, a name here, a Aziz from a parks and recreation was down. Uh, I gotta give him, I gotta give him credit a Aziz and sorry, Gee, he hooked me up with these videos. He goes, you got to check these out. Cause I was telling him, you got to watch that guy at the del Taco who gets knocked out three fucking times in this battle. Royal. Um, so whatever, see, we got, I, I'm hyping that video and I hope that I remember, uh, to tell my web guy about it. If not, I hope he's listening to this podcast and they put it up cause it's fucking hilarious. So anyways, let's get back to this guy.

Speaker 1:          01:14:02       Um, he basically asked me how do I, how does somebody stay in the one month thing? Well, let me ask you this, sir. How do you do over the year? Do you put on any weight? What are you, do you know? This is the thing about relationships that I learned is that they're fucking work. And it's what you're discovering is that what happens is you meet somebody and yeah, it's exciting. It's new. It's like a, I don't know, you go on vacation, so he never been to Miami. You go to Miami Beach, it's going to be fucking exciting. All right. He got another vacation. You go to Miami beach again. It's still exciting, but it's not quite as you keep fucking doing the same thing. It's just natural that you start taking things for granted and it works on both sides. Um, what I would do is if you want your girl to stay in shape is I would keep myself in shape and uh, I, if you're into a girl that stays in shape and there's nothing wrong with that, by the way, there's always on those women's shows that that's superficial and blah, blah, blah, and guys should look beyond it.

Speaker 1:          01:15:05       Fuck you. You're lazy and you want to eat ice cream and you still want to get the same amount of love like you, like you have an hourglass figure, you know, that's just women pimping guys. Okay. If you want a woman who's in shape, why don't you fucking date someone who likes to work out? That's what I would do. Who's into that type of shit? Who to considers that type of thing important. That's what I would do. And then you kept saying shit like she's willing to explore, enjoy and share my interest. Well that's all well and good. As long as you're willing to do it with her. And also I would say that, you know, you know what's a great thing to do in a relationship is to have interests outside of the other person. And the two of you fuck off for for an hour or two every day.

Speaker 1:          01:15:51       You know, like I can tell you if I'm in a relationship, all right. And I joined a gym. I don't want my, I don't, I don't want my girl joining the same fucking gym. I don't, I want two hours by myself. Who's kidding? Who, 20 minutes on the treadmill and be, ah, lift weights tomorrow or whatever, say like an hour to myself. I listen to my music, you know, I'm looking at at the, at the fucking ass and titties of other girls, right? That's legal, you know, they're walking around in their sports bras. I can do that, you know, listen to my ACDC fucking get pumped, lie to myself, like, dude of the summer on putting up to 25 kid fucking two plates on both sides stowed. I could lie to myself, you know, but I definitely think, uh, look, I would just say, you know, the next time you're, you're, you're tell, tell your girl that's, that's, that's your fear said, yeah, look, I, I just keep being in these relationships and everything just sort of winds down everybody, you know, people are in good shape.

Speaker 1:          01:16:57       I went, you know, I don't know. That's kind of a tough thing to say, to be like, are you going to become a fatty in a year? Um, I don't know, Dude. You ever thought about just being single and just tagging a bunch of chicks who were in shape and every night will be exciting and new. Come aboard. I'm expecting you. So ride my single fucking Goddamn cock. Um, every, evidently the way you can get herpes while still wearing a condom is, is I guess that the, uh, the party at Dick that's behind the Maginot line there basically the part, you know, you put a condom on, you roll it down. You always have it at fucking three quarters mass, don't you? Even if you stretch it all the way down, it doesn't fucking cover your whole Dick. There's always going to be the Goddamn Ma, you know, eighth of an inch of shaft.

Speaker 1:          01:17:51       You know, unless you got a huge fucking Dick and you bought the wrong condoms and half your dicks hanging out, hanging out. Right. And the condoms on top of your head and you have Dick looks like fucking Arnold from happy days. Remember that? Had he used to wear or big al? Um, I guess that's how you can get it. I don't fucking know. I don't want to hear about STDs. It just makes me happy. I'm going to fucking relationship, you know. Um, anyways, let's plow ahead here. Next, next question here. Next fucking question. Uh, Bill, big fan of your comedy podcasts. Listen to it every Tuesday on the way home while I'm stuck in traffic. Anyway, here's my deal. I moved to us in order. I just realized, I forgot to tell you guys how I'm working on my temper. I decided to break it up into chunks rather than just trying not to lose my shit. I just realized I gotta I, I just got to attack it and chuck, so this is how I'm trying to do it. I'm just working on my temper in the car. That's it. And I've been meaning to get a post it and I'm just going to draw a smiley face on it and just stick it on the dashboard.

Speaker 1:          01:18:58       That's what I'm trying to do. And I did it this morning. I was able to do it. I was returning a rental car and uh, you know, it's Sunday morning, I get up, I jump in the car, Ford Fusion, great fucking car to man getting this car. And I, uh, they should be no traffic. I should just shoot right up, get the car back by nine 30 so I don't have to pay for the extra day. And what happens, there's all this construction and I got to admit, it took me a while to lose my shit, but when the fucking Douche cut into my lane, I, that was it. I just fucking without even thinking, just, just

Speaker 9:          01:19:42       [inaudible], just

Speaker 1:          01:19:42       pushing down on the horn and a, when I stopped, I was like, oh fuck. I lost my temper. I guy, I gotta, I gotta stop and then somebody else did something and I fucking laid on the horn twice. So, so I failed. You know what the fuck that's off sides through the officiating has just sucked in the NHL, this whole fucking place. How bad were the fucking calls first game? Uh, on both sides, by the way. On both sides. At least. That first period is what I really watched, um, of the, uh, Bruins flyers by the way, which is by the time I, uh, you listened to this podcast, let's do it on Tuesday. That series is going to be one, one going back to Boston. I think this is going to be a great series. Uh, and I think it's going to be one of those series where, yeah, I dunno.

Speaker 1:          01:20:31       It's weird. The Bruins are weird. They're just on their game right now. But when they're not on their game, they, they just, I dunno. It's like they're playing the fucking ice out in the ice. Capades so I don't know. I'm nervous about that happening. And I also with the flyers did to us last year, but the thing is is the flyers have no fucking goaltending as a right now. So, uh, Tim Thomas is just fucking ridiculous. So I think we're going to win the series. I actually think we might take it in six games. If we win game two, we went into six. If they win game two, uh, this fucker's going seven. That's my prediction. Everybody, for those of you want, don't watch hockey, you probably don't give a shit to you. All right, Bill, big fan of your comedy podcasts. Let's do it every Tuesday and the way they work. Anyway, here's my deal. I moved to Austin, Texas about three fucking years ago because of a job I had just broken up with a long time on again, off again, girlfriend, and was finally done with the relationship. I made the decision to be single for a while and enjoy the single life in Austin. Worked out well, but I soon meadow lane,

Speaker 1:          01:21:36       she turned out to be the girl from me and I was soon shopping for rings. So we're getting married in the fall. Congratulations. And I moved in about six months ago. You see, my girl is a real hard worker as am I. Uh, Jesus. Crisis is fucking long. Settle in everybody. No one has ever given us anything in life. And we both worked hard to earn what we have. And because of our hard work, we both have successful careers, careers. My Boston accent just came out their successful careers. So she's busted her ass through college, got a job, and bought a house in her own. Impressive because she was only 24 at the time. God Damn it. I wish I lived in Texas and could buy a house at 24 middle of fucking nowhere. Anyways, and since then we have worked hard to make it a home together.

Speaker 1:          01:22:22       All sounds good, right? Yeah, that sounds great. Well there is a catch. Oh Jesus. Here we go. She has this friend who she's known since childhood and they grew up together. This sounds like a fucking romantic comedy. They are like sisters, blah, blah, blah. She let her friend move into the house before we met. Oh No. And was barely charging the girl rent at all. She also had her sister moving, but as soon as we decided to live together, as sister moved out, like a normal fucking person. Anyways, so this friend of hers is still living in the house. Even six months after we got engaged and moved in together. Not only did she stay, she also had her boyfriend move in while living there and while living there she bought a cat and a dog. Well, I mean, what the fuck dude? How come you're not saying anything? Oh, well here's the next sentence. I had a million talks with my girl about it and how it's wildly inappropriate to have these people and animals living in our house when we're trying to start a family, but she feels responsible for the wellbeing of her friend and doesn't want to throw her out on her ass. Oh No.

Speaker 3:          01:23:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:23:37       Holy Shit Dude. How big is this house? Anyways, eventually I talked to my girl and just sitting down with her friend and her boyfriend and kindly tell them it's time to start looking for another place to live. They agreed and everything was all good, so three months later the friends still doesn't have a job and her boyfriend is only working part time. As far as I can tell, they haven't started looking for jobs or a place to live. I've heard her complaining to my girl about not wanting to sign a lease on a dump because she is planning on getting a job and we'll be able to afford a nicer place soon. Yeah, she's stringing you along. It's bullshit. She's the laziest bitch I ever met. Sounds like a dude. The way you're describing and I already hate her. I'm coming home every work day. Uh, I'm going wrong for work everyday. And her boyfriend, her and her boyfriend are sitting on the couch playing video games.

Speaker 1:          01:24:31       Oh my God. I also recently found out that my girl is not charging her friend any rented all and that boyfriend only pays 200 a month, which is nothing compared to what he could be making with the fuck what we could be making with the roommate. And he's a fucking loser as well. 30 years old and never had a fulltime job in his life. He brags about not having any debt all the time, but it's because he's a loser and he's been living off his girlfriend's student loans and my girls kindness for the past two years.

Speaker 3:          01:25:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:25:01       Do I have to read the rest of this? Let me blow through the last two paragraphs in Murcia [inaudible] and this thing, people try to keep the shortage. I suck at reading here. Um, I would be constantly bitching about these people to my girl, but it kills her to, to know,

Speaker 3:          01:25:15       okay

Speaker 1:          01:25:15       that I'm not happy. She spends a lot of time trying to make my life better and I can, I really can't stand to see her sad or frustrated. She stuck in a tight spot. Yeah. Do the same thing she's doing with you that she hates to see you, not happy and she wants to keep you happy. She's still in that with her friends. She has to make a stand here. So he says, so to make a point, I've been leaving my stuff out in the kitchen, in the living room and not cleaning up after myself and in front of everybody. I tell my girlfriend to leave it that she should, that they should have to clean it up because we're doing them a favor for letting them live there. I've pretty much been a cock sucker openly to them everyday for the last three months.

Speaker 1:          01:25:55       But they haven't gotten the hint. Yeah, they have their fucking dead beats. So just ignoring it. So anyways, but me behaving like that makes my girlfriend uncomfortable. Comfortable too. So I backed off a bit. So the latest is that they finally are starting to pick up on the fact that we want them out in or making provisions to move out. But I've recently found out that they are planning on moving in with my girl's mom just down the street. Her mom's thinks of the friends is a daughter or a good family friend in is allowing this. This pisses me off because I know they're just going to mooch off from mom just like they did my girl. So now I know I'm planning on having another talk. No, don't do that. Don't do that. So now I'm planning another talk with them about starting their own life separate from my girl or her family.

Speaker 1:          01:26:41       But I know they wouldn't get the message unless they came out and became a complete Dick, which would totally killed my girlfriend. What should I do? This is what you do. Alright. Um, let him move into your, my girlfriend's mom's house. Let them fucking do it. Get it out of your house. All right? Eventually there will they, they will wear out their welcome at your mom's house and then they're gone. It's, it's, but the thing is right now is if you, if you tell her mom that they fucking dead beats in that type of shit, [inaudible] if you'll either come off like a dick or she'll say, well then to hell with it, they're not moving in. And then there'll be like, well, we can move out of your place and now you're stuck with them. All right? You have the things that wouldn't leave in your fucking house and they're leaving.

Speaker 1:          01:27:30       Let them leave. Let them go down to your sister's mom's house. This is probably where your, you, you, I mean your girlfriend's mom's house. This is probably where she learned that fucking behavior from, you know, so that's her house right now. What it is, is you personally hate these motherfuckers and you want them to live in this shithole that they so rightfully deserve to live in. So what you're doing right now is you're letting your, your personal hatred of them get in the way of your ultimate goal, which is to get them the fuck out of the house, which is happening, okay? If her mother wants to take them in, let her do it, and eventually she will discover that they're fucking mooches. Now I know what you're thinking. Like what kind of a fucking future son in law, my, if I don't give her the heads up, and I'm telling you, just judging by the way your future bride is, this is just how they are.

Speaker 1:          01:28:29       They're giving people who get taken advantage of by mooches. And the same way your fiance is learning this lesson, your mother's going to learn the lessons. So these people are actually great that they came into your life because the, hopefully you'll be able to use them as an example, all throughout your marriage, whatever their fucking names are. You going to be like, well look, we're going to end up in another situation like Kathy and Michael. Fuck face. Remember that when they sat on the goddamn couch playing Atari for three fucking years? Um, yeah, dude, listen, you don't want to fight both those fights. You'll end up like America. You going to have two wars going on at once. You're going to go bankrupt. Don't do that shit. All right. [inaudible] is your house. Let him go to fucking Afghanistan. Don't fucking worry about it. Or vice versa. We went into Afghanistan first. I don't know how to fucking say it. I don't read. I don't give a shit a Douche bag of the week, by the way, is Hammernik from fucking the Canadians. That guy's an all star man. He knows better than that. Flopping around out there like he's on Fucking, I love Lucy or something. Doing a good Carol Burnett show. Doing a goddamn sketch.

Speaker 1:          01:29:40       Jared up. All right, last one. I'm going to read here. Everybody coming up on an hour keeping this one nice and tight. Hey Bill, I love you. Stand up comedy on your podcasts are freaking hilarious. Thank you very much. I love what you're doing and I hope you keep doing it, bro. Log [inaudible] thank you. I'm a junior in high school and I really have a problem with my mom's boyfriend. Uh, yes, I would think so for the obvious reasons, but we're not going to get into that because you're too young to talk about it. I don't know what to do because my mom used to be really cool and she would really listen to me when her boyfriend wasn't around. Now when he comes over, she makes, she makes me Cook my own dinner, which isn't that bad to do, but the fact that she ignores me and listens to him more than she does to me is what really gets to me.

Speaker 1:          01:30:27       This guy can be a real asshole to me and my mom, oh Jesus Christ. And the thing is that they fight all the time and yet they're still together. After five years, you can tell a Douche bag when you see one, and this guy really takes the trophy of number one douche bag in the country. All right, you know what? Fuck that Douche bag of the week is the due date in this kid's mom. He even yells at my mom's sometimes and I felt the urge to confront him one time and my mom is the one who gets mad at me for trying to defend her. I feel like this guy has changed my mom from a nice, cool mom to one of those reality show moms who don't really give a shit about their kids. Yeah. See this is why you gotta be careful who you let into your life.

Speaker 1:          01:31:09       This guy has kids and he treats them way worse than he treats my mom. I feel really bad for his kids for having such a bad father figure in their lives. Yeah. This guy's horrific. He's now, he's never gotten violent with my mom I think, but I think my mom has gotten dependent on him for some fucked up reason. Yeah. Cause he's probably doing that. He's working on a self esteem. He probably criticizes the shit out of her and he's turned a nice, positive, great mom into a negative person who's not paying attention to our kid. Yeah. She's got a dump. This guy, and I'm pretty sure it's taken a toll on what my mom is like as a person. I have no idea what my mom sees in him because they have practically nothing in common and he's a total asshole to her. And to me what I really need his advice on how I can handle this situation, what I can do to make this situation better for me and my mom besides choking this in the middle of the night. I would really appreciate some sound advice from you, even though you don't have kids.

Speaker 1:          01:32:08       I would also like to know if you were doing any gigs or any shows around southern California, because I really like to see in person. Thanks bill. All right. This is what you gotta do. All right. This is very tricky. One of the hardest things to do is when somebody you love is dating an asshole to approach them and say, Hey, I think the person you're dating is an asshole because they're going to get unbelievably defensive. All right? So I would leave that part out of it. What I would do is when that Douche bag isn't around, I would basically tell your mom what you told me, minus the bad shit about him. Just say, listen. You know, I just feel like you know, you're not listening to me as much as you used to tell your lover. Tell her she's the greatest mom. And just, just tell her that you felt like you used to be closer and that you're feeling like you're not as close as you used to be and that you know, you realize that you're her time with their boyfriend is important.

Speaker 1:          01:33:06       But I'd like to have a whatever schedule, schedule some hang time with you guys. And you know what, when you guys are out there having a good time, maybe she can, you know, slowly turn into that person she used to be. And then eventually you kind of trick her into talking about that guy and let her be the first one. This is, this is down the road. Let her, once you guys, you know, have your hang day, you know, and I'll tell you right now, if, if that guy gets in the way, which you probably will try to, cause he sounds like an insecure douche bag that if you guys are actually hanging out, you know there's a lot of like little Mussolini's run around the world. They just don't have the fucking charisma and the right cataclysmic moment in history to take power. So what they do is rather than ruining countries, they just ruined families.

Speaker 1:          01:33:52       Every one that they come in contact with. So this, that's what this cost is like. And he'll probably try and take that time away from you guys because he'll be convinced because in the back of his head, I bet he knows he's a fucking asshole. Um, or he's a paranoid psycho and he thinks everybody's talking about them anyways, which of course you attract what you fear in life. So I think, uh, just keep it about you and her. Tell her how great she is. Mother's Day is coming up. It's perfect. And just say, listen, you know, I'm getting older. These next few years are going to fly by. You know, I'd like to take advantage of this time. Let's spend time together. You know, just you and me. Like we used to just one day a week. I respect your time with your boyfriend, but you know, one day a week I'm your son for Christ sake.

Speaker 1:          01:34:33       We could do this. And like I said, during that time, um, that Douche won't be around. It'll be just the two of you. I bet the old her comes out a little bit. If you do it once a week, it's like therapy. And like I said, eventually you let you let her bring it up, let her bring up with that guy's an asshole. You know, he's kind of been a dick, you know what I mean? He just kind of sit there like, yeah, yeah, I don't know what you mean. And just respectfully call the guy and asshole. And as far as choking that guy in the middle of the night, don't do that now. Don't do that. Wait till you like high school years. You know, wait til you hit your growth spurt. You know, you start filling out, you start throwing the weights around. That's when you do it. You know, take a nice karate class. Go with the submission whole, that's what I would do. You know, you choke them out. They just go to sleep. You know, there's no concussion, there's nothing like, he just, he just takes a little nap.

Speaker 1:          01:35:28       I'm not advocating violence. Wink, wink. I'm all right. Youtube videos a week. That's going to be the podcast for this week. Here's a youtube videos for this week. Um, I already hyped that amazing seven year old drummer. Fucking awesome. Uh, these are all going to be on the MN podcast.com, the official fan page of the Monday morning podcast if you'd like to donate. All right, uh, to the podcast is that donate button right on the right hand side of the homepage, right underneath the Facebook, Twitter and all those logos. You just click on donate, whatever you want to give me. I don't give a fuck $1, 1000. I don't give a shit. I'll fucking take any of it. Um, and anyways, all these youtube videos, we'll be up there. Next one, greatest dance number ever filmed according to Fred Astaire, who was considered the greatest dancer of that time.

Speaker 1:          01:36:21       But, uh, he was a phenomenal dancer, but he was also a white dude. So he had an advantage like the Montreal Canadians getting first pick of every French born Canadian fucking player. Um, that's what white people were in Hollywood back then. Uh, but during this time, you know, and this is this, I think this is really cool that Fred Astaire said, this shows you what a cool guy. This was. This guy was that he gave a, he gave a shout out to the uh, Jesus Christ. Where the fuck's the video? Now what did I do? Oh Christ, what did I do? That's not the right one. That's not the right one. As fucking hang on a second. The hell did I do here? All right. Greatest. The Nicholas Brothers hope I'm saying that right. You got to watch this video. Even if you don't like all those fucking, so you think you can dance.

Speaker 1:          01:37:14       So you think you can do a split naviat twat stick to the floor. You know when I'll be the judge of that. If you don't like those fucking shows, you got to watch these guys. These guys are unbelievable. It's called the greatest dance number ever filmed at the beginning. You're probably not going to like it. Cab Calloway's in their scat singing. I fucking hate [inaudible] singing. I, I just don't like it. I don't think it's a talent skill. But at beam apple on abdomen dead baby, shut your fucking face. Learn how to play the trumpet. A shut the fuck up. I can't stand it. But at once he's done and he does his little fucking head bop. And I never liked that fucking guy. I used to like him. And one time I read miles Davis autobiography and he trashed cab Calloway saying that when a is he ratted somebody out for fucking haven't drugs on him, you know, which was basically the jazz musician version of those fucking assholes who ratted out actors for being potentially members of the Communist Party in the 50s to Joe McCarthy.

Speaker 1:          01:38:12       So fuck him. But once he's out of it, all right, with this stupid conch, when he gets the fuck out of the goddamn video, watch these two guys. It's unfucking believable, man. Just the, the, the level of talent that these guys have is insane. All right. And then, you know, last week I hiked those videos about the new planet of the apes moving comic movie coming out. Um, people sent in some smart chimp videos. These things are fucking awesome. Uh, one is of a chimp. Uh, they, they stick a peanut in the bottom of this giant graduated cylinder. And I gotta be honest with you, I couldn't figure out how to get this fucking thing out of there. And this chimp figures it out. Um, I think we're actually going to facilitate them taking over the planet if we keep to keep teaching them this shit.

Speaker 1:          01:38:59       At the very least, being smarter than half the people in shop class a. Then there's another video, another smart chimp trying to get them to work together. Human beings are so fucking stupid. The scientists out there trying to get chimps, trying to get them to help move, like move up a heavy piece, this heavy rock to get them to learn how to pull all in the same direction, teach them that fucking skill, you know, so right there they can get knee a bomb shelter back in the day if you, if you had all my God, they're the fucking chimpanzees are gonna rip met my, my God damn nuts off and my face off. He could go into your bomb shelter and clothes, that fucking metal. They're going to teach them how to open it up. And then there's the last one. Steve Vai Acoustic. I know you're here and this is a, I totally respect Steve Vai.

Speaker 1:          01:39:51       Um, he's one of those guys who, he was a hired gun during the hair metal days and he survived. He carved out his own niche. He never stopped creating and he goes around, he sells out theaters. He's making his money. I told you guys that are my favorite behind the music of all time was vanilla ice because he still had his money. I have to seeing all those broke down. I mean, most of the guys, a lot of guys still had them money. Molly Cruz still had their money. I liked that one. Um, Aerosmith's was great because they still had them on. I just hated seeing the guy I hate. I hate seeing people fail. I hate it, you know, unless it's the Canadians, the Yankees, the jets or the Lakers. Dude, if anybody can tell me how the Lakers aren't going to win the championship this year with the fucking old ass Celtics trading away, Kendrick Perkins and the spurs losing to the Er, the fucking grizzlies. It's over. There is no fucking way the Lakers aren't going to win the championship score. Detroit Redwings I'm trying to jinx the Lakers by saying that cause other than that, I don't think there's anything stopping them. Um, so anyways, what the fuck was I talking about? I totally lost my frame of thought, my train of thought or my frame of reference or in my world, my frame of thought. I'm a fucking moron. Um, the fuck was he talking about?

Speaker 3:          01:41:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:41:08       Yeah, it's gone. People, it's gone forever. That's how my brain works out, right in the end of the podcast, let's, uh, let's hype my dates. What do I got here? Uh, coming up. Oh, by the way, I told you guys I was doing David Letterman. Um, that is not going to be happening because believe it or not, guess who got called back for another episode of Glee speak in a dancing. See what you guys don't realize is when I sing on the podcast, I'm just fucking around. I actually have a wonderful voice and I am a triple threat. I can deliver the jokes, I can sing the songs and I can fucking a, I can do a little Shim Sham. I can dance.

Speaker 3:          01:41:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:41:53       Um, yeah. Um, that bringing me back to gleek and I'm actually doing the singing and dance number with a, that an androgynous kid who hangs out with that fucking angry blonde chick. We're going to be singing a, I want a new drug, but we're doing the club version. So it's going to be really, really sexy. And we wouldn't want to lose a v neck tee shirts that shows man cleavage. It's going to be awesome. So look for that. So I won't be doing Letterman because of that. And also I'm going to be at the antisocial comedy tour, February, um, February May 13th and a in Washington, DC. Go to antisocial comedy.com, uh, for all your tickets and all the links. Like I said, these tickets are selling very fast. I don't know how long we're going to be doing this tour or how long where uh, I dunno.

And I got right to the second one on my brain just shuts off cause it works in a straight line. Yeah. I don't know how long we're going to be doing this tour and how long this lineup is going to last.
