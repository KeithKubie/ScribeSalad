00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:34.830
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.080
Well, welcome everybody.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.580
And thanks for joining us for
"Behind the div's," a look at

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.850
FInd Your Way to Oz, one of
the new Chrome experiments

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.080
built by Unit9.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.930
My name is Pete LePage.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.980
I'm a developer advocate
on the Chrome team.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.830
And today, I'm joined by some
of the guys who built Find

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.870
Your Way to Oz from
the Unit9 team.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.220
To my left, I've got
Anrick Bregman.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.210
To his left, I've got
Yates Buckley.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.590
And then, Silvio Paganini, who's
going to show us some of

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.610
the cool tech stuff.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.260
If you haven't played with Find
Your Way to Oz, if we

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.080
could maybe put that URL
up on screen right now.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.330
It's FindYourWayToOz.com.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.300
And really cool Chrome
experiment.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.270
Really awesome way to go see a
little bit about the movie, to

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.990
try and go do some really
neat things.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.340
Why don't you guys tell us a
little bit about some of the

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.170
things that users can do when
playing around on the site?

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.870
And then, we'll talk about
how we built--

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.830
how you guys--

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.610
built some of these things.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.430
ANRICK BREGMAN: Sure.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.100
The beginning of the project
was really trying to figure

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.570
out, how could we tell a story
about this film without

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.490
telling the same story
as the film?

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.280
Or more, how we could make an
interactive experience that

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.950
leads you to the film?

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.630
And so very quickly, we began
to focus on the circus and

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.620
also, the storm scenes, which
were part of the film.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.240
We watched the film, and we felt
really attracted to those

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.485
two sections in the
film experience.

00:04:03.485 --> 00:04:06.330
And we felt, wow, there's a lot
of stuff that you can do

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.630
there that'll be fun
interactively.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.640
And so focusing on the
circus, first of

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.610
all, felt very natural.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.570
Very quickly, we became attached
to this line called

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.914
Find Your Way to Oz, which
became the main site URL

00:04:20.914 --> 00:04:21.279
eventually.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:25.350
And that's really the mission
for the user online.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.840
It's every step of the way,
everything that you do, takes

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.110
you one step closer to the
world of Oz on film.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.060
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.080
ANRICK BREGMAN: And so that
became a really fun

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.960
brainstorm.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.960
What can you do in a circus?

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.750
What are the things, the
attractions, that you

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.470
can have fun with?

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.950
And how could we infuse those
attractions with characters

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.870
from the film?

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.170
The first one would be a classic
character cut-out type

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.950
experience, which is
adding your face to

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.420
the characters' bodies.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.880
Then we came up with a
whole range of ideas.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.890
But we zeroed in on that.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.260
Then, it was really fun for us
to think about a musical

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.890
experience.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.470
And also, that was led
by tech as well.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.730
The web audio just felt like a
really fun, natural thing to

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.540
play with So a musical
organ became our next

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.040
focus, our next idea.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.210
And then finally, we had an idea
to create a movie type

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.050
capture attraction.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.070
And that came from the film.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.830
As seen in the film, where
Oscar, who was making his way

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.230
to Oz, has a zoetrope
in one of his tents.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.630
In his main tent.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.550
PETE LEPAGE: I think that was
when we were looking at some

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.380
of prototypes.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.700
The zoetrope was one of my
favorite things, just to see

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.120
that happen in real time
and get built up.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.230
We're going to talk about some
of the prototypes and that

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.150
kind of stuff in a sec.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.030
But Silvio, why don't you pop
over to the computer over

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.030
there, if you don't mind,
and just sort of

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.880
bring up the demo?

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.460
And let's have a look at some
of the things that are going

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.940
on within the demo, so that as
we're talking through some of

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.220
these things, we can sort of--

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.030
YATES BUCKLEY: The
website demo?

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.920
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah,
the website.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.180
Sorry.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.390
Yes.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.282
YATES BUCKLEY:The website.

00:06:10.282 --> 00:06:10.730
Yeah.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.773
The other interesting thing was,
while we were developing

00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:17.360
it, we actually came up with
many different prototypes.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.580
And I think the technology
breadth, in terms of the

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.930
exploration phase,
was very wide.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.030
But it was funny, because some
of the things we came up with

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.860
maybe were kind of like,
too tech for a

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.820
circus for that scenario.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.340
They didn't create that
dreamy space.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.900
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.480
Well, what's--

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.640
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.870
Here, we're looking at inside
of one of the scenes.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.640
You see, actually, that the
photo booth and some of the--

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.560
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.830
So if we go into the
photo booth--

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.440
can we get rid of the URL
on screen right now?

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.996
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah, so this
is the photo booth capture.

00:06:58.996 --> 00:07:04.220
And there's a really nice
transition into a lens change

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.770
there, in the 3D engine.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:08.390
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.960
YATES BUCKLEY: Sorry,
I'm looking--

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.190
PETE LEPAGE: So we're looking
at the screen here.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.920
And I know you guys
can't see us.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.340
Unfortunately, there's no camera
on the computer that

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.970
we're doing this demo on, so
it makes it a little bit

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.930
harder to show this off.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.172
But you can try this
on your own.

00:07:22.172 --> 00:07:24.250
Does the music box work for--

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.700
would we be able to give
that one a shot?

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.050
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.135
You should be able to
work the music box.

00:07:27.135 --> 00:07:29.900
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.240
ANRICK BREGMAN: In all of the
interactions that we had, and

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.960
all of the attractions, we had
a really nice mix of very

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.732
classic asset switches,
hand-painted textures--

00:07:39.732 --> 00:07:40.724
[CIRCUS MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:40.724 --> 00:07:43.452
ANRICK BREGMAN: --such as in the
photo booth, and also here

00:07:43.452 --> 00:07:46.690
in the music box, hand-painted
character textures, combined

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.802
with these WebGL models.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:52.290
And then, the interface on top,
which is something that

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.160
allows you to edit and change
what you're seeing.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.100
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:02.370
So that's actually a good
transition point as we look at

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.886
some of these things.

00:08:03.886 --> 00:08:05.680
What was building some
of these things like?

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.520
Because I remember seeing early
on, we had a whole bunch

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.840
of prototypes for some
individual things.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.760
And then we said, OK, well,
we're going to put all these

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.950
pieces together.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:19.070
And Silvio, if you want to come
on back, and we can talk

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.340
about some of those things.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.710
What was the process like
to build these out?

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.170
What were some of the things
that you guys went through?

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.260
I know there's a lot of WebGL
involved in this.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.080
There's a lot of
CSS animations.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.890
There's a whole bunch
of sprite stuff.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.260
What's going on?

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.090
How did you build some
of these things?

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.370
SILVIO PAGANINI: So basically,
we started prototyping most of

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.750
the technology we could
use in Chrome.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.550
And one really interesting
thing to use--

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.120
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.120
Can we pull up Silvio's
desktop?

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.170
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah, so
one of the first ones

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.750
was the card loading.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.120
So it's all a CSS3 transition.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.570
So here, you can see on the
fly all the values for the

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.240
WebKit transform.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:09.530
So as you hover your mouse,
you're just using the 3D

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:10.960
transformations of it.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.350
I could click and see the other
side of it, which is

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:17.420
basically the whole concept
behind the website, was two

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.640
sides of Oz.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.170
That was the first one,
[? this live ?] one here.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.670
We actually have another
prototype for 3D.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.100
Want to show some 3D as well?

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:27.590
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.130
Yeah, definitely.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.642
SILVIO PAGANINI: So actually,
we can go for the sprite

00:09:31.642 --> 00:09:35.410
sheets, maybe, for the
high-DPI devices.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.660
So one thing that was quite a
neat, the experience works for

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:42.670
both the normal screens and
the high-DPI screens.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:48.710
And one way to do this was to
use the sprite sheets and the

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.360
new CSS properties for that.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.010
So my screen's not high-DPI, but
we can't see this, but at

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.310
least we can see the whole
story about this.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.550
So we can see the sprite sheets
on my machine here.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.730
[? It's probably ?]

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:00.830
PNG.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.760
You can't see much.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.420
But all the assets are in one
PNG, and then you just control

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.790
them on the DOM.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:09.440
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.500
Cool.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.000
So if we can come back
to us for a sec.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.530
One of the things I think is
really fascinating was how you

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:22.160
guys did think through how to
deal with high-DPI screens, as

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.960
well as on non-high-DPI
screens.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.620
What challenges did you face
when thinking about that?

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.780
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah, I mean,
I think it's sort of an

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.120
infrastructure decision.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.840
A lot of things we had to deal
with technologically became

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.165
quickly kind of infrastructure
decisions.

00:10:41.165 --> 00:10:43.780
Like, how do we set this up so
we don't have to worry about

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.410
it later, and that the creative
team can just work

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.870
along and not have any bad
surprises later on?

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.360
So we were always double
thinking what might

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.020
go wrong in a way.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.120
And one of them was
the high-DPI.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.980
Which I think tied really well
with the sprite sheets

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.840
application, because then you
can just pick the right asset

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.970
on the fly and deal with
these kind of problems.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:07.930
Yeah, so--

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.710
PETE LEPAGE: Now, are you
sending high-DPI images only

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:14.800
to devices that deserve
them, and lower to--?

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.200
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yes.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.755
So basically, we load for
the normal sprite

00:11:17.755 --> 00:11:19.320
sheet for all devices.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.220
And if we detect that there is
a high-DPI device loading the

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.680
website, then we load
the new one.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.690
PETE LEPAGE: And how
did you do that?

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.940
What was the mechanism
you used?

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.586
SILVIO PAGANINI: If you can show
my screen, there's one

00:11:31.586 --> 00:11:36.010
[? comment ?] we found out,
which is window dot aspect

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:39.960
ratio device pixel ratio.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.600
And then these would
show the high--

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.350
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.850
SILVIO PAGANINI: --which
screen--

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.050
PETE LEPAGE: So you
can go through.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.620
OK.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.080
SILVIO PAGANINI: So on a
high-DPI screen, it'll show

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.100
here 2 as a result.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.785
And on my screen, of course,
it's showing 1 because I don't

00:11:51.785 --> 00:11:53.170
have the high-DPI one.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.430
So that's a trick that I used.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.520
PETE LEPAGE: Now were you
checking for the straight up

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.200
value of 2?

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.985
Or were you checking
for greater than 1?

00:12:00.985 --> 00:12:01.525
SILVIO PAGANINI:
Greater than 1.

00:12:01.525 --> 00:12:01.780
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.650
And that's the right
way to go.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:06.230
I was dealing with one project
a couple of months ago.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:12.070
And they had assumed that the
device pixel ratio value would

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.040
always be a whole number.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.540
And it was like 1.4 or 1.3.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.350
So when they were doing some
math on it, it was

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:21.130
coming down to 1.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.770
And everything just
looked wrong.

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.900
We were trying to figure
out what was going on.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.110
And as it turns out, that
was the reason.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.410
So you want to definitely make
sure when you're looking at

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:36.030
that number, be aware, it
might not be 2 or 1.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.180
It might be somewhere
in between.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.660
It might even be higher.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.790
At some point, hopefully we'll
get even higher DPI displays.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:42.535
SILVIO PAGANINI: At
some point, yeah.

00:12:42.535 --> 00:12:42.970
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.010
That would be really
kind of cool.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.500
Cool.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.180
YATES BUCKLEY: I think the thing
I really wanted to show

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.720
also-- it kind of falls in with
this idea of the DPI and

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.670
trying to handle problems.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.700
If you could throw
the first video.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:56.880
If you could launch that.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.980
Basically, a lot of the site in
it used a control panel to

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.781
control settings that were
critical to the experience.

00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:05.775
[GUSTING WINDS]

00:13:05.775 --> 00:13:07.763
YATES BUCKLEY: And it
was kind of bizarre.

00:13:07.763 --> 00:13:11.242
The team was a very big
team, actually.

00:13:11.242 --> 00:13:13.230
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.320
So it was very difficult with
certain problems you run into

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.300
to get everybody to agree on
what's really going on, what

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.380
really needs to be done.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.100
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.680
YATES BUCKLEY: Is that
video up now?

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.400
PETE LEPAGE: It just
finished running.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.650
So that's--

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.350
YATES BUCKLEY: Sorry.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:35.420
The video is the first one?

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.740
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.960
And after we do that, one
thing I do want mention.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.890
For people who are watching
this live, we do have a

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.920
moderator queue that you
can ask questions at.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.180
So Paul, when you get a sec, if
we could put the moderator

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.980
link up for the questions.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.050
Please post your questions
there, so that we can try and

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.230
answer some of your questions
live as we go today.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.090
We've got a computer up here
so that I can see what the

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:04.130
questions coming in are, and
we can go from there.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.490
So it looked like--.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:11.710
YATES BUCKLEY: So basically, the
story is that to make this

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.030
kind of content with a bigger
team, you need to have sort of

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.920
a middle ground.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.980
You need to create a middle
ground, which you can use to

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.130
tweak values or not and agree
together whether that

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:27.170
particular saturation, or how
strong one particular effect

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.290
or another can work together.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.990
Because every part of the team
doesn't necessarily have the

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.580
whole picture.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.040
So it was always kind of
iterating through things.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.970
And for everything we created,
we'd create an interface for

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.530
it, a live interface that people
could try changing.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:42.730
So I encourage people--

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.160
I think one of the most fun
aspects of the site is if you

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.150
look at the beginning of the
HTML5 Rocks site, is if you

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.150
call this site with the bug
equals on and then press

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.090
Control I, I think it is, and
then you'll have a drop-down

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:55.000
with all the controls
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:55.790
PETE LEPAGE: Oh cool.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.800
YATES BUCKLEY: --being
exposed.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.760
It's sort of fun to discover
what's been--

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.190
ANRICK BREGMAN: Well, it was
amazing for the team, because

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.630
we had a lot of distance
between everybody.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.690
Not just geographically, but
also in terms of, let's say,

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.840
the expertise that
everybody has.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.760
So a WebGL 3D team might not
necessarily get too involved

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.740
with the hand-painted skies
that we were making.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.210
And for that to be a kind of
feedback loop between those

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.450
teams constantly, trying to
adjust and perfect things,

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:25.850
kind of didn't make sense.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.720
It felt better for everybody to
be able to get their part

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.730
of the whole piece perfect first
before integrating it

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.630
with the greater project.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.530
So it was a very smart way to
give everybody control of what

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.910
they were making and to share
very quickly the kind of

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.880
perfect settings from
everybody's perspective.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.020
And then in the end, there's a
process of choosing one of the

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:46.920
several options.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.230
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:48.790
ANRICK BREGMAN: But that makes
it a fun process rather than a

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:49.795
very stressful one.

00:15:49.795 --> 00:15:50.220
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.600
And by being able to give
everybody that opportunity to

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.170
play and experiment on their
own, they really have that,

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.620
like, I can feel how my
value's going in.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.810
And then when we talk about it
as a team, we can really--

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:01.850
YATES BUCKLEY: Exaclty.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.540
ANRICK BREGMAN: And most
importantly, you can be wrong.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.620
Because it's obviously very
frustrating if you say, oh,

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.340
let's make it a 2, and then
it's actually 2 point--

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:07.750
oh, no, no.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.180
Let's make it 2.5.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:09.290
Oh no.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:11.170
Actually, let's make it 1.5.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.430
That becomes very stressful if
that loop goes through the

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.030
whole team and it takes
people's time.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.905
If it's you yourself,
you can experiment.

00:16:16.905 --> 00:16:18.190
You can play.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:18.920
You can go wrong.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.130
You can go back.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.760
But only when you're
comfortable, you can share.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.680
So that's a detail.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.480
It just makes sense.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.920
It just makes it easier and more
fun for the whole team.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.110
PETE LEPAGE: Speaking of the
team, how big was the team who

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.890
worked on this?

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:32.710
YATES BUCKLEY: It
was quite big.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:33.170
I mean--

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.450
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah, we
got probably 30 people.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.370
YATES BUCKLEY: We had this Skype
chat open with, it was

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.160
like, maybe about 12 people
on it at any one time.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.610
And it's been going
on for months.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:41.730
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, wow.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.080
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah, we
have different chats.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:43.530
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:44.660
We have different
chats as well.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.180
But there's one main one,
which is the main.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.080
There's a lot of people and a
lot of specialists that are

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:55.680
doing very particular work that
nobody else understands.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:55.860
So it's like--

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.710
PETE LEPAGE: And you guys were
also really distributed as

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:58.490
well, weren't you?

00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:58.690
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.430
PETE LEPAGE: So where was--

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:02.975
YATES BUCKLEY: So the back-end
team is in Poland.

00:17:02.975 --> 00:17:03.116
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah.

00:17:03.116 --> 00:17:04.810
We have the back-end
team in Poland--

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:05.650
YATES BUCKLEY: 3D in Florence.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.010
SILVIO PAGANINI: --which
was very--

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.990
and doing back-end and mobile.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.349
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:10.290
Back-end and mobile.

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:11.324
SILVIO PAGANINI: And then we
have the guys in Florence that

00:17:11.324 --> 00:17:11.580
are doing the 3D.

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.196
PETE LEPAGE: Wow.

00:17:13.196 --> 00:17:14.970
SILVIO PAGANINI: We
had the guys in

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.640
Stockholm doing the designs.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.609
We had the guy in Barcelona.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:20.513
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

00:17:20.513 --> 00:17:21.310
SILVIO PAGANINI: The
team in London.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.440
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.650
I think that's the main--

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:24.859
SILVIO PAGANINI: That's
the main thing.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:25.790
Yeah.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:26.629
ANRICK BREGMAN: And there
were a few other extra

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:29.090
bits here and there.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:32.490
It's sort of a lot of
specialists who come on board

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.170
for a certain time, then
somebody else takes over, and

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.090
then the first team comes
back and makes changes.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.720
And it's a really nice back
and forth that way.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.670
But everybody was very engaged
in a way that distance starts

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:45.590
to fall away when people are
really passionate about what

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:46.950
they're making.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.840
And when it seems to work, when
you sort of feel like

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.670
there's constantly progress,
everyone becomes very engaged

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:52.940
in spite of the distance.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.580
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.580
Yeah.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:00.270
Beyond some of the CSS Sprite
things, let's sort of pop over

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.860
to talk about some of
the WebGL stuff.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:07.450
Because this is such a beautiful
WebGL experience.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:07.700
Right?

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:12.250
Like it really does take full
advantage of the GPU to just

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.060
create real moving stuff.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.870
I think when we were talking
earlier Anrick, you were

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.690
talking about how just all of
the scenes are hand painted.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:22.050
And being able to get that
stuff in is just

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:26.130
such an art form now.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.210
And going to there is
pretty phenomenal.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:32.910
So why don't talk a little bit
about how that process worked.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.540
And I think we talked earlier
about maybe doing a--

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.790
let's have a look at this one.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:40.645
If we can switch to the laptop
up here for a sec.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.590
So do you want to tell
us what this is?

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.900
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.070
So basically, that was one of
the early prototypes we'd done

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:54.230
with the whole elements of the
scene plugged in from the 3D.

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:57.730
And that was just to see how the
camera movement would be

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.690
on the environment, while
deciding and see how many

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:04.320
objects it would load on real
time for the WebGL to handle.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.780
So it was one of the first and
most effective ways to see how

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.510
WebGL was going to perform
in every single machine.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.872
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:19:13.872 --> 00:19:14.490
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.210
Then we went through
iterations.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.380
We had to establish a
pipeline for the 3D.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.690
That was a very early critical
aspect to the whole project,

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.930
because the particular--

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.000
basically, it's still early
days in some of these

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.730
technologies.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:36.710
And so setting up a good
pipeline for WebGL, it's

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.655
something we hadn't
really dealt with

00:19:38.655 --> 00:19:39.870
at this scale before.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.420
And so, it was a bit of
tooling that went on

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:42.940
beforehand.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.150
We had to convert some tools we
had before to try to figure

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.190
out how to support things
like bones animations,

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:49.170
this kind of stuff.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:50.420
PETE LEPAGE: Now what are
bones animations?

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.990
YATES BUCKLEY: It means that
rather than animating every

00:19:53.990 --> 00:20:00.760
point, say, of a joint that's
animated, you can animate the

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.390
angle basically-- the change
in angle of one item.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:03.530
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, OK.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.700
YATES BUCKLEY: So basically,
it saves a lot of space.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:11.340
And it also allows you a more
intuitive control of the scene

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:11.900
in that sense.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.800
And you'll see that in the
balloon at the end.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.500
The balloon is bending
in a way.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.490
It goes through the wind.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.170
That's run by this
bone system, that

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.420
isn't by default supported.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.550
It's something that
we had to create.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:31.070
And then on HTML5 Rocks site,
we've sort of focused on--

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.790
wind was a very important theme
of the whole site, so we

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.810
focused on what we did to
create the wind effect.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:40.360
And if you go to HTML5 Rock's
demo site, there was a number

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.000
of prototypes, one of them we're
showing here, in which

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.140
you see how this noise
field is generating

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.825
this kind of mutation--

00:20:52.492 --> 00:20:56.460
it's actually a vertex shader
that we're changing the

00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:01.260
position of and modifying.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.550
And again, you have all these
settings open again, so that

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.970
we can figure out the detail.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.220
And the particles floating
around, as well, are affected

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.290
by the same kind of flowing
field beneath it.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:12.812
SILVIO PAGANINI: Maybe just
show this thing here.

00:21:12.812 --> 00:21:13.716
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:21:13.716 --> 00:21:15.690
If we could just pop over to
the screen for one sec.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:15.946
YATES BUCKLEY: Oh, OK.

00:21:15.946 --> 00:21:17.370
I thought it was on screen.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:21.065
Yeah, I think that is the demo
from the HTML5 Rocks--

00:21:21.065 --> 00:21:22.325
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah, that's
the complete demo.

00:21:22.325 --> 00:21:23.120
YATES BUCKLEY: That's
the complete demo.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.380
And we encourage
to look at it.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.640
It's not too complex
of a scene.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.380
And I think it's quite fun,
actually, because you've got

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.320
everything in it and
all the controls.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:34.660
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.786
You can play around with the
controls the same way you play

00:21:36.786 --> 00:21:37.580
with the website.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.680
So, we tried to do a seamless
transition for everyone to

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.980
understand the tools we're using
throughout the whole

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.370
website development.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.110
PETE LEPAGE: So what were the
tools you were using?

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:49.160
Like, I'm not a WebGL
kind of guy.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.900
I never got into it.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.240
And it sort of often
went over my head.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.230
So how did you start?

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.210
What was the process
for building this?

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:56.476
YATES BUCKLEY: What
we needed to do.

00:21:56.476 --> 00:21:59.390
This pipeline basically means,
OK, we had to find out in the

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:05.840
very early days what kind of
creative input could we get to

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.550
create the 3D world and
the WebGL world.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.770
So we actually went back and
tried to convert a tool that

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:12.680
we had created before.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.480
It was a Flash-based tool.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.940
And we converted that to
be able to support

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.870
the converting models.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.030
Basically, animations and models
from Maya, then were--

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.660
you could just go through it and
convert them into a scene.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.100
But it had to be read in a
particular way, et cetera.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.660
But once we did that, then it
was a matter of honing the

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:37.510
different effects.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.360
So I think in a way, we were
in parallel working on

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:45.195
optimizing a scene, and the
shaders that we had to--

00:22:45.195 --> 00:22:47.300
so, figuring out different
shaders for very particular

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.035
effects, whether it's a
particularl lighting effect,

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:54.090
or a particular like the god
rays, or we have a nice demo

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:55.090
for the lighting.

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:58.925
I don't know if you could
actually show that.

00:22:58.925 --> 00:22:59.940
Do you have that one?

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.285
OK.

00:23:00.285 --> 00:23:00.630
SILVIO PAGANINI: No.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:01.610
YATES BUCKLEY: No, OK.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:06.380
Anyhow, and including one of
the shaders for the storm

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.280
sequence, which is this sort of
twirling tornado, which--

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:09.430
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:11.090
If we could pull up
that for one sec--

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.736
YATES BUCKLEY: --has a strange
history to it kind

00:23:12.736 --> 00:23:13.720
of thing, in a way.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.330
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:15.350
Do you want to tell us a
little bit about that?

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.960
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.690
We went through many iterations
of different models

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:20.640
to try-- oh, gosh.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.840
I lost it.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.810
ANRICK BREGMAN: It was
initially a nice

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:23.820
idea to do a storm.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.540
And we felt very drawn
to the storm.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:29.090
And it became very quickly a
case of, OK, so how on Earth

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:31.620
are we going to make
this exciting,

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.940
intense, but also beautiful?

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.730
And how are we going to
make it interactive?

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.450
It was a big challenge.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.800
Plus, in the browser
dynamically

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.590
rendered as you go.

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:46.440
And so after a few interesting
demos and experiments, we

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.370
ended up with a shader
approach.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.780
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah,
so it was all this.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.050
And I'm also studying
neuroscience,

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.110
actually, in parallel.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:58.420
And we've been working on some
games for getting-- basically,

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.780
the idea is that people could
help us trace connectivity

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.360
between brain cells.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.220
And as part of that research--
which is not live yet, but I'd

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.010
encourage people if they're
interested to go to

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:11.630
brainflight.org and register
to keep updated on it--

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:14.270
one of the things we did is we
created a viewer that shows

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:16.670
the inside a brain
cell, basically.

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.810
You could navigate
through that.

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:23.260
We have a clip of it
that we could show.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.010
PETE LEPAGE: That's the brain?

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:24.370
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:25.300
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.940
YATES BUCKLEY: So this is like
very, very, very small.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.820
What you're looking through,
it's something like, I think

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.260
it's about 40 or 50 nanometers,
which is very,

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:33.940
very small.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:34.080
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, wow.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.260
YATES BUCKLEY: And you're going
through a connection

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.250
between one brain cell
and another.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:42.640
And the problem is that there's
so many of them, it's

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.550
not obvious how we're going to
get the manpower to actually

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.140
trace the connections.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.455
This is why the idea is maybe
make a game or something, get

00:24:49.455 --> 00:24:50.720
people to help us.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.410
But we started from
that, and we tried

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:53.750
adding a twist, actually.

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.130
Because it looked a little
bit like a tornado.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.000
It looked like the funnel
of a tornado.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.410
So we added a transformation,
like a twist to it, and added

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:00.030
some noise to it.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.600
And something came out that
was very tornado-like.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.230
So what then we just had to
figure out is how to give it

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.290
this wispy kind of
effect on it.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:12.360
And that was done just basically
by evaluating it

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.150
multiple times and mixing
these together.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.470
And then once you made that
tornado, which we showed

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:21.850
earlier in terms of that kind
of-- we then had to get it

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:22.640
inside the scene.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.130
And then, you could probably,
if you can, switch to this

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:28.830
machine here, we have a
picture of the tornado

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:34.302
overlapped with the Tokyo
Shibuya background that we

00:25:34.302 --> 00:25:35.260
grabbed from somewhere.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.210
So here, you see the tornado
just kind of on top of the

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.000
scene in the background.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:39.840
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.070
YATES BUCKLEY: And to create the
storm sequence, basically,

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:43.530
there are many layers
like this.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:47.460
There is a background, and there
are, like, drops on the

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.810
front screen.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:49.640
SILVIO PAGANINI: Some clouds.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.810
YATES BUCKLEY: There's clouds.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:52.590
And they're all different
techniques, actually.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.630
So the clouds are a
particle-based system.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.270
The clouds are low-hanging.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:00.510
While the tornadoes
is custom shader.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.070
The balloon is a layer that's
just for the balloon.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:06.800
It's very complicated to handle
the balloon correctly

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.820
when it goes into the tornado,
for example.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.660
Or for example, at one point,
we had to give the feeling

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.900
that you're being sucked
up into the

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.020
whirlwind of the tornado.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.830
And we couldn't do that because
of the way the scene

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:23.370
was structured.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:27.000
So what we had do was rotate the
world around the camera,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.950
rather than you rotate
the camera.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.320
Because a lot of the objects
we had were flat.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.976
So the background rotates at a
certain point, and it gives

00:26:34.976 --> 00:26:39.525
you that feeling of you being
taken up into this space.

00:26:39.525 --> 00:26:39.820
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.340
ANRICK BREGMAN: It's a very
nice mix of very new

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.680
techniques and very classic
techniques, very classic

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.980
filmmaking techniques.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:50.060
Lighting and matte paintings in
the background, layered up

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.920
with this very interesting
custom shading.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.240
And what I find amazing,
especially, is how, for

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.080
example, the classic
matte painting

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.790
mixes with the shading.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.470
It's something that's quite
surprising, because the

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:01.620
shaders are always changing.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.415
And so the background matte
painting is static, but the

00:27:04.415 --> 00:27:07.580
shader is constantly changing
the visual.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.870
PETE LEPAGE: That's
really cool.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.970
Well, there's a couple of
questions up in the moderator

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.150
queue that I want to take
a look at and get

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:16.700
your opinion on.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.350
So the first question is
from somebody in Italy.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:22.590
And they want to know, do you
think that WebGL is going to

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.580
affect a lot of the
future of the web?

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:25.980
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yes,
definitely.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:26.450
YATES BUCKLEY: I have
an opinion.

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:27.000
Yeah, go ahead.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.443
SILVIO PAGANINI: I think so.

00:27:28.443 --> 00:27:32.592
I mean, as long as Chrome and
the other browsers are trying

00:27:32.592 --> 00:27:34.340
to push this WebGL.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.850
The performance that I can
get here is amazing.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:39.530
Like the tornado scene, for
example, is the lightest scene

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:41.380
we have on our website.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.760
So if you enter the website,
the first carnival scene is

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.705
pretty heavy.

00:27:45.705 --> 00:27:48.710
My machine's really struggling
to keep up.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:51.110
And the tornado itself is
a main shader thing.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:52.920
And it's really heavy.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.950
You don't see any of the--
the fan is running crazy.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:59.720
So I do think in the near
future, the WebGL is going to

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.720
be a nice thing to do.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.320
YATES BUCKLEY: I mean, I think
the thing that's the

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.540
interesting story is the
relationship between the

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.350
high-DPI devices and 3D tech.

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.480
Because when you're making game
design, for example, if

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.740
you make it in 3D, then
you don't have to

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.330
worry about this issue.

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:17.310
And you don't have to worry
about the aspect ratio of the

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:20.220
phone so much or the device,
because you can just to

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:23.270
reposition the camera in one way
or another and manage to

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:25.410
make an experience that people
feel natural with.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.250
And I think that's a big driver
towards that kind of

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.790
technology [? and doctrine. ?]

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:31.100
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:31.290
Cool.

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:33.800
Yeah, well, somebody from Zurich
wants to know, what was

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.940
the most difficult part?

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.760
Was there a point where you
had to change the plan in

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.610
order to comply with the
technical possibilities?

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.040
I think I know the
answer to this.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.660
But I'll let you
guys sort of--

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.930
YATES BUCKLEY: There
were many parts.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:50.560
It was full of decisions.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.360
ANRICK BREGMAN: It was
a rollercoaster ride.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.690
It was absolutely a
rollercoaster ride.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.740
PETE LEPAGE: And I think that's
part of the point of a

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.180
Chrome experiment.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.770
With a Chrome experiment,
you're pushing the web.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.270
You're doing things that have
never been done before.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:05.350
You're taking the browser
to its limit.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.150
And there are always going to
be those places where you're

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:10.613
like, and we just fell
over the edge.

00:29:10.613 --> 00:29:12.563
Whoops.

00:29:12.563 --> 00:29:13.530
ANRICK BREGMAN: You
got to go back.

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:14.400
PETE LEPAGE: You got to pull
back a little, or maybe

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.300
rethink, or sometimes,
hopefully, you can get a

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.590
browser bug fixed.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.720
ANRICK BREGMAN: I think the
storm was probably the

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.240
trickiest to realize.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.980
We were pretty ambitious about
making a storm that felt as

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.580
beautiful and intense as
the one in the film.

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.250
Obviously, that story
is different.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.450
But we wanted it to live
up to the film.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.580
And I think there were a few
points where we thought, well,

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.640
we're not going to manage.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.600
And I can imagine Yates at home
on the weekend working on

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.940
brainflight.org and having a
kind of epiphany moment going,

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:44.560
wait a minute.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.860
This mouse brain looks
just like a storm.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.895
And he came into the office and
said, OK, whatever you're

00:29:49.895 --> 00:29:51.540
doing with the storm, stop it.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:52.780
It's not going to work.

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.270
We're going in a different
direction.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.736
So that was a key moment, I
think, where we turned the

00:29:56.736 --> 00:29:58.110
storm around.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.660
And there was a vision of
something that didn't--

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.690
well, it looked like
a mouse brain.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.710
But we were going to
make it a storm.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:07.530
And we had a mission,
and it worked out.

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:09.330
It was a big risk, but
it worked out.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:10.590
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.220
Well, we've got another
question here

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:15.990
from someone who wants--

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.380
I guess they were looking at the
optimization and wanted to

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.860
know why you didn't go with the
WebP image format instead

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:27.340
of PNG, since WebP can be up
to almost 25%, 26% smaller.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.690
SILVIO PAGANINI: The only reason
I didn't use it is

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:32.530
because we did not have a fall
back on the CSS for the

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:34.210
[INAUDIBLE] images.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.510
One other thing we did see for
the optimizations is, if you

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.060
look at the timeline on Chrome,
every time I apply a

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:45.090
style to a DOM element, you're
at peak of memory usage.

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:48.130
So if you don't have an
immediate fall back on CSS for

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:53.720
all the images, you [? inject ?]
the CSS for the

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.790
image on the element.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:58.110
So this would be like a
massive problem for

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.870
performances.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.220
So that's the main reason.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:04.100
Because this runs in other
browsers as well, so we try to

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:05.590
make it as--

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:06.360
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:06.680
Yeah.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.810
I think that's one ask that
I would have for other web

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:13.610
developers out there, is demand
WebP support out of

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:14.710
your browser.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:15.080
Right?

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.540
Whether it's Firefox,
whether it's

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.430
Opera, IE, Safari, whatever.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.610
We need more people
to support this.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:26.530
And we need the other browser
vendors to step up.

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:29.870
And as web developers, I think
it's our job to go and say to

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:32.800
the web browser vendors,
we want this.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.110
Give it to us.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:36.680
SILVIO PAGANINI: Even though
they don't give us, at least

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.310
the fall back [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.350
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.990
Or give us a good way to be
able to have a fall back.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:42.060
Something to that effect.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:42.900
Absolutely.

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.150
Absolutely.

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:48.960
So that's the end of the
questions that up out there

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.600
that people have posted.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.950
I'll leave that list
up for a second.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.030
But I just want to talk a little
bit about you guys.

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:57.680
So you guys are Unit9.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.060
You do projects like this.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:02.960
Do you want to tell a little bit
more about Unit9, some fun

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.680
things you guys do?

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.840
YATES BUCKLEY: This is probably
the peak of the

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.430
excitement in terms
of the jobs we do.

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.990
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:12.540
YATES BUCKLEY: I mean, to have
the client come in and say, we

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.280
want you to make an experiment
for us, is just like

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.802
a dream come true.

00:32:16.802 --> 00:32:20.110
It's like, OK, we're going to
go totally crazy here and do

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:23.640
everything we never dared
do in other situations.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:28.450
But yeah, we do this kind of
thing and these kind of jobs.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:30.560
And yeah, I've have been
doing it for a while.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.200
We like to work in
a very open way.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.670
You can find a full credit list
of everybody that worked

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:36.280
on this job, every name.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.890
If you go to the site,
it's on there.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:41.320
We're very open about other
collaborations.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.730
This job wouldn't have been
possible without support from

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:48.080
another other key partners
in this job.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.970
And so yeah.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:52.790
We believe in that video game
model, where you just get the

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:55.010
best people together and
do the best job.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:55.360
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.920
What's the website
for you guys?

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.670
YATES BUCKLEY: Unit9.com.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:00.770
PETE LEPAGE: Unit9.com So nice
and easy to remember.

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.590
One of the things that I also
want to call out is you guys

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:07.600
wrote a phenomenal HTML5
Rocks tutorial--

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.610
well, I guess it's more
of a case study.

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:12.940
But it went through how you
built a lot of these things.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.430
There's great code samples.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:18.110
There's a couple of things that
people can go in and play

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:20.800
with, diving deep into
this kind of stuff.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.020
So definitely check that out.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.280
It's up on html5rocks.com.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.900
You can go see that there.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:27.110
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.190
It's been very successful
as well.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.060
I really recommend it.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:33.040
We made an effort to pick out
and make prototypes that you

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.030
can chew on, so that you don't
have to get the whole code

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:37.320
base, and still can
have some fun.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.610
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah, if you
have a look on Google Code,

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:41.590
there's the full code for
everything as well.

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.894
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, phenomenal.

00:33:41.894 --> 00:33:42.510
Oh, cool.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.490
SILVIO PAGANINI: And the we have
the prototype codes for

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:45.010
everything there as well.

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:46.630
So just go and--

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:48.790
YATES BUCKLEY: Plenty
to look at.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:51.710
PETE LEPAGE: So if somebody were
to pull that down, could

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:54.130
they just upload it to their own
little server and get it

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:56.000
running reasonably well?

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.540
All right.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:56.820
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:59.220
The whole website's just
coded in CoffeeScript.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.020
So also, there's a Cakefile
which compiles

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.290
the whole thing up.

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:03.220
PETE LEPAGE: Sweet.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:03.680
All right.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.400
And you're hosting
it on App Engine?

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.650
SILVIO PAGANINI: App
Engine, yes.

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:08.139
YATES BUCKLEY: The App
Engine code is not

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:09.199
currently up there.

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:11.040
I think for security reasons,
we're sort of waiting on that.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:11.850
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, there's
some of the

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:13.190
back-end stuff is--

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:15.030
YATES BUCKLEY: But otherwise,
yeah, everything's there.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.590
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.090
Well, I think that's about all
we have time for today.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:20.790
We're just at about 30
minutes, 35 minutes.

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:23.250
I want to thank you guys
for coming in.

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:25.730
It was a really great
opportunity to learn a little

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:26.690
bit more about this.

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:29.380
I hope you guys watching live
learned something new and

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.429
enjoyed it.

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:34.880
Definitely go check the site out
at findyourwaytooz.com It

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.630
also works-- we didn't dive into
this at all today, but

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:39.429
the mobile experience
is pretty slick.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:42.830
I can pull it up on a phone or
tablet, whether it's an iPad

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.050
or whether it's a Nexus device,
an Android device.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.250
So definitely go
check that out.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.120
You can try it in Chrome
for Android.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.340
You can try it in a couple
other things.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.460
So thank you, gentlemen.

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.420
And thank you guys
for joining us.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.560
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.280
And we'll talk to
you real soon.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:58.800
Bye bye.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.050
Thank you.
