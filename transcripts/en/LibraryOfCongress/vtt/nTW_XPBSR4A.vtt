[Captioner standing by for 
presentation to begin.

00:00:44.638 --> 00:00:46.638
]

00:01:32.447 --> 00:01:34.447
to good afternoon

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.950
.

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:42.058
&gt;&gt;  It's the second in our 
ongoing PTSD 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.004
panel series in collaboration 
with the National Institute of 

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:49.005
Corrections 

00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:55.271
civilian life I'd like to 
welcome the

00:02:02.172 --> 00:02:04.641
-- it is the work they do that 
makes these types of discussions

00:02:04.642 --> 00:02:06.642
possible and so valuable.

00:02:09.757 --> 00:02:11.164
As an Army veteran, I know how 
untreated PTSD can affect a 

00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:13.165
veterans life.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.136
Our partners at the National 
Institute of Corrections know 

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.137
all too well how 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.070
PTSD can create problems with 
reentry into society and how it 

00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:26.155
can lead to run-ins with the law
and entry into the justice and 

00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:28.221
prison systems.
But as you learn today, it 

00:02:28.222 --> 00:02:32.553
doesn't have to be this way.  We
have pulled together several 

00:02:34.408 --> 00:02:36.408
experts who have seen first hand
how 

00:02:38.296 --> 00:02:40.296
treating PTSD and adding 
structure to a 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:44.416
veteran inmate's lives in the 
veterans inmates housing units 

00:02:44.417 --> 00:02:49.557
with break the cycle of crime 
and recidivism.  This panel 

00:02:49.558 --> 00:02:52.434
represents another example of 
how the Veterans History Project

00:02:52.435 --> 00:02:57.125
is working to illuminate the 
work done by a wide variety of 

00:02:57.126 --> 00:02:59.568
organizations that focus on 
assisting our veterans to move 

00:03:02.236 --> 00:03:03.454
forward with their lives and 
further enrich their life 

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:05.455
stories, which we 

00:03:09.171 --> 00:03:11.171
certainly hope they then choose 
to 

00:03:14.326 --> 00:03:16.974
donate to the library so others 
could learn from their 

00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:18.975
experiences.

00:03:20.608 --> 00:03:22.608
Our next speaker is Frank Laura 
of the U.S.

00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:28.745
bureau of  prisons.

00:03:31.017 --> 00:03:33.017
He's the veterans of the U.S.

00:03:34.074 --> 00:03:36.074
Marine Corps and is with the 
correctional programs division.

00:03:38.542 --> 00:03:41.374
He began his career as a 
correctional officer in 

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:43.444
Segalville Texas where he rose 
through the ranks, eventually 

00:03:43.445 --> 00:03:46.301
being named warden at the 
federal correctional 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.540
complex Bomont where he received
the new 

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:54.598
warden of the year award from 
the bureau of prisons.

00:03:58.287 --> 00:04:00.287
In prisons, he became the 
assistant 

00:04:01.755 --> 00:04:03.755
director of the correctional 
programs division.

00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:08.748
Please, help me welcome 
assistant director Laura.

00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:20.988
&gt;&gt;  Good afternoon.  Thank you, 
Karen, for the introduction.  

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.989
I'm honored to be here.

00:04:24.443 --> 00:04:26.689
The director couldn't make it 
and he had unplanned activities 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.137
that were on his calendar that 
showed up.  He regrets not being

00:04:30.138 --> 00:04:32.138
here.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.483
I did tell him this: You're 
sending a corporal.  That's 

00:04:38.484 --> 00:04:39.912
equivalent to a general in the 
Army.  He took that pretty good.

00:04:39.913 --> 00:04:41.913
[Laughter]

00:04:44.593 --> 00:04:46.593
As Karen mentioned I served the 
bureau 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.240
of prison for 26 years in 
various capacities.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.690
I've moved capacity times.

00:04:59.742 --> 00:05:01.742
I've worked two times at -- 
prior to 

00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:06.666
joining the federal bureau of 
prison I proudly served the 

00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:08.667
Marine Corps and 

00:05:09.924 --> 00:05:11.924
existed the and existed a 
corporal.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.067
I'm here on behalf of the 
federal bureau of prisons and 

00:05:15.068 --> 00:05:17.068
the staff and the 

00:05:18.074 --> 00:05:20.646
facilities nationwide.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.582
And Army corrections command 
where he maintained executive 

00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:30.615
management oversight of the Army
corrections system.

00:05:33.685 --> 00:05:36.529
Regardless of when or where they
served, or for how long, gave of

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.530
themselves to ensure that all 
Americans continued to 

00:05:41.455 --> 00:05:42.891
ensure the freedoms and 
opportunities, the foundation of

00:05:42.892 --> 00:05:45.572
this country.
I know first hand, some of the 

00:05:47.616 --> 00:05:49.853
challenges veterans face as a 
result of spending time in 

00:05:49.854 --> 00:05:51.854
places and 

00:05:53.313 --> 00:05:55.313
circumstances many cannot even 
imagine.

00:05:55.963 --> 00:05:57.963
We are here today to increase 
the awareness about PTSD.

00:06:02.074 --> 00:06:04.940
post-traumatic stress syndrome. 
Some of this men and women 

00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:08.242
struggle to adapt back into 
society after having served 

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:08.860
therefore country.  
Post-traumatic stress syndrome 

00:06:08.861 --> 00:06:10.861
can 

00:06:12.964 --> 00:06:15.416
also contribute to their 
involvement in the justice 

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:18.282
system.
Approximately 7% of 200,000 of 

00:06:18.283 --> 00:06:22.749
the people incarcerated in our 
nations jails and prisons are 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.750
men and women who have 

00:06:26.563 --> 00:06:28.659
served in the armied armed 
forces.

00:06:31.109 --> 00:06:33.109
A significant portion of the 
combat 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:36.638
troops are returning home 
affected by visible and 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:38.639
invisible battle scars 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.409
including high rates of PTSD and
traumatic brain injury, as well 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.643
as serious wounds.
Some veterans return home and 

00:06:44.644 --> 00:06:49.128
struggle and find themselves 
using substances and others 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:51.600
struggle with various forms of 
mental illness related to their 

00:06:51.601 --> 00:06:53.601
deployments.

00:06:55.672 --> 00:06:57.672
All these issues may in some 
cases 

00:06:58.688 --> 00:07:00.688
lead

00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:02.590
to the justice system 
involvement and incarcerations.

00:07:07.742 --> 00:07:09.194
Various housing units promotes 
opportunities to assist veterans

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:13.072
in preparation to return to our 
communities with skills and 

00:07:13.073 --> 00:07:15.312
confidence to be productive and 
contributing members of society.

00:07:20.638 --> 00:07:23.279
The bureau of prison houses 
nearly 11,000 veterans 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.280
nationwide across our 22 

00:07:26.293 --> 00:07:28.293
falsities

00:07:30.043 --> 00:07:32.043
nationwide facilities.

00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:37.396
We have devoted to meeting the 
needs of groups of inmates with 

00:07:37.397 --> 00:07:39.397
specialized needs.

00:07:42.482 --> 00:07:43.887
We have a wide variety of 
services for veteran inmates, 

00:07:43.888 --> 00:07:45.888
but we are in the 

00:07:48.423 --> 00:07:50.423
process of standardizing 
services nationwide.

00:07:51.915 --> 00:07:53.915
We developed a three-tiered 
services delivery model.

00:07:56.429 --> 00:07:58.429
Tier one delivery has just begun
to be rolled out nationwide.

00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:03.361
These are primarily these 
service in nature.  They 

00:08:03.362 --> 00:08:05.398
conclude training, best 
practices, guidance for staff, 

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:08.065
and forms and resources 
available to the inmate 

00:08:08.066 --> 00:08:10.066
population.

00:08:12.765 --> 00:08:14.404
Each facility will collaborate 
with veterans administration 

00:08:14.405 --> 00:08:16.405
staff to ensure 

00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:19.463
inmate veterans and families of 
inmates 

00:08:21.164 --> 00:08:23.164
of veterans have access to the 
information they need.

00:08:24.626 --> 00:08:27.085
Tier two will be rolled out 
later this year.  These are 

00:08:27.086 --> 00:08:31.613
outpatient services.  These will
be delivered in a group model 

00:08:31.614 --> 00:08:33.614
including a veteran support 
group 

00:08:36.096 --> 00:08:38.548
and veterans fitness vet.
Tier three will be the most 

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:41.027
intense in nature and include 
the piloting of a 

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.516
unit- piloting based residential
program.  We look forward to 

00:08:46.517 --> 00:08:51.882
collaborating with many of you 
as we roll out these services 

00:08:51.883 --> 00:08:53.883
nationwide.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.943
Today, it is my honor and 
pleasure to announce the 

00:09:01.944 --> 00:09:03.944
National Institute of 

00:09:06.594 --> 00:09:08.594
Corrections publication entitled

00:09:12.396 --> 00:09:14.008
Barrack Behind Bar Bars veterans
help veterans help themselves.

00:09:14.009 --> 00:09:16.885
This publication tells the story
of both 

00:09:20.783 --> 00:09:22.071
forward thinking sheriffs who 
have instituted veterans housing

00:09:22.072 --> 00:09:26.028
units in their jails and some on
of the veterans who have 

00:09:26.029 --> 00:09:28.555
benefited from these programs.  
We've seen a number of these 

00:09:28.556 --> 00:09:30.556
housing 

00:09:33.485 --> 00:09:34.507
units or dorms or pods for 
veterans implemented throughout 

00:09:34.508 --> 00:09:36.508
the country.

00:09:37.548 --> 00:09:39.548
This is designed to serve as a 

00:09:42.446 --> 00:09:43.255
resource throughout the field as
they consider veteran 

00:09:43.256 --> 00:09:45.256
programming.

00:09:46.572 --> 00:09:48.632
Another thing is the sequential 
intercept model adapted to the 

00:09:48.633 --> 00:09:50.633
justice involved veteran 
population.

00:09:52.168 --> 00:09:54.258
As you can see, each decision 
point provides resources and 

00:09:54.259 --> 00:09:56.896
represents an opportunity to 
intervene at the lowest 

00:10:02.199 --> 00:10:04.199
level possible to minimize the 
co 

00:10:07.356 --> 00:10:10.222
consequences of a veteran 
getting more deeply involved in 

00:10:10.223 --> 00:10:12.223
the justice system.

00:10:13.282 --> 00:10:15.541
Today, you'll hear some from 
folks included in the 

00:10:15.542 --> 00:10:17.542
publication, including 

00:10:19.489 --> 00:10:22.483
our next speaker, Peter 
Koutoujian, from middle

00:10:30.105 --> 00:10:31.982
from  Middlesex county, 
Massachusetts.

00:10:31.983 --> 00:10:33.983
It's the largest county in 

00:10:35.046 --> 00:10:37.046
Massachusetts, and if I'm not 
mistaken, 

00:10:39.125 --> 00:10:41.125
all of New England.

00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:44.042
He aims to increase politic 
confidence, providing a safer 

00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:47.888
work environment for staff, and 
improving the lives of those in 

00:10:47.889 --> 00:10:49.889
the county's custody.

00:10:52.373 --> 00:10:53.807
Including in 2016 the creation 
of the Humvee program, a housing

00:10:53.808 --> 00:10:57.929
unit for military veterans.
Ladies and gentlemen, sheriff 

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.400
Peter Koutoujian.

00:11:04.613 --> 00:11:06.613
[Applause]

00:11:12.147 --> 00:11:14.418
&gt;&gt; PETER KOUTOUJIAN:  Good 
afternoon.  Good afternoon.

00:11:14.826 --> 00:11:16.826
&gt;&gt;  Good afternoon.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.680
Peter  Peter

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.453
&gt;&gt; PETER KOUTOUJIAN:  I want to 
thank director Lloyd and the 

00:11:24.454 --> 00:11:28.980
Library of Congress.  This is 
truly an amazing building that I

00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:32.052
know is not nearly as 
appreciated as it should be.  I 

00:11:32.053 --> 00:11:35.918
appreciate it to a much larger 
degree now.  I thank you for 

00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:37.919
hosting today's event.

00:11:41.095 --> 00:11:43.095
To Steven and Amos and from the 

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:47.278
National Institute of 
Corrections, team his team at 

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:52.794
National Institute of 
Corrections help agencies like 

00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:54.795
mine to increase our knowledge 
and support and to sheriffs 

00:11:55.049 --> 00:11:57.049
across the country.

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.864
And for assistant director 
Laura.  Thank you for that 

00:12:01.865 --> 00:12:05.766
introduction.  I know you were 
afraid of my name and you did 

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.767
very well.  Thank you very much 
for that, sir.

00:12:11.711 --> 00:12:13.140
I'm truly honored to be here 
among such a distinguished group

00:12:13.141 --> 00:12:15.844
of leaders from across the 
country.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.600
From Cuyahoga County, to Orange 

00:12:23.546 --> 00:12:25.546
County, in Ohio, New York, 
Texas, and elsewhere.

00:12:28.251 --> 00:12:30.891
On behalf of all of us here and 
my Middlesex county office, to 

00:12:30.892 --> 00:12:32.892
all who 

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.350
serveed our country, I say thank
you for your service.

00:12:37.464 --> 00:12:39.927
I did not serve in the military.
My family has a history of 

00:12:39.928 --> 00:12:41.928
service that has always impacted
me.

00:12:45.719 --> 00:12:47.741
My family came here to flee 
genocide.  They sought refuge 

00:12:47.742 --> 00:12:49.742
and opportunity in this country,
and they found it.

00:12:53.084 --> 00:12:55.084
Three of their sons war the 
uniform uniform.

00:12:57.579 --> 00:12:59.579
My uncle Arson who died in an 
accident 

00:13:01.266 --> 00:13:03.266
while serving in the Philippines
at the age of 19.

00:13:05.345 --> 00:13:07.386
My grandmother who could barely 
speak English, was, for all 

00:13:07.387 --> 00:13:09.387
intents and 

00:13:10.865 --> 00:13:12.865
purposes, a gold star mother in 
the loss of her young son.

00:13:15.013 --> 00:13:17.867
Yet, my grandparents loveed this
country and everything it 

00:13:17.868 --> 00:13:19.868
afforded us, the truest of 
patriots.

00:13:22.764 --> 00:13:25.059
And if I can just take a moment 
of how proud they would be to 

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.499
know that their grandson is 
speaking at the Library of 

00:13:28.122 --> 00:13:30.797
Congress, as well.  Right?
It was that appreciation of 

00:13:30.798 --> 00:13:33.272
service that wanted me to do 
better for incarcerated 

00:13:33.273 --> 00:13:35.273
veterans.

00:13:36.337 --> 00:13:38.783
After becoming sheriff in 2011 I
discovered we were lacking in 

00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:42.657
verifyied demographic 
information on veterans.  At the

00:13:42.658 --> 00:13:44.904
time, the only way we knew if 
someone was a veteran, if they 

00:13:44.905 --> 00:13:46.905
told us 

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:51.528
they were a told

00:13:54.346 --> 00:13:56.346
veteran.

00:13:57.485 --> 00:13:59.921
We didn't know the scope of this
problem because we didn't have 

00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:01.922
verified numbers anywhere across
this country.

00:14:02.978 --> 00:14:04.978
This is incredibly ineffective 
because 

00:14:08.126 --> 00:14:09.345
we knew we would miss folks 
because sometimes as they were 

00:14:09.346 --> 00:14:11.346
coming close to 

00:14:14.097 --> 00:14:15.318
release they would let us now, 
but by then it was too late to 

00:14:15.319 --> 00:14:17.319
give them the proper supports 
they needed.

00:14:19.434 --> 00:14:21.084
We later learned that many were 
not identifying themselves is 

00:14:21.085 --> 00:14:23.085
because they were afraid of 
losing benefits.

00:14:26.024 --> 00:14:28.024
Some didn't know they were 
qualified 

00:14:29.895 --> 00:14:31.122
as others, or there was a stigma
of shame for having been in a 

00:14:31.123 --> 00:14:33.123
place of incarceration.

00:14:35.215 --> 00:14:37.255
I knew there was a lot more we 
could be doing to improve the 

00:14:37.256 --> 00:14:39.748
lives of these individuals, and 
their families, and their 

00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:43.677
families.  It was then we 
started speaking to the VA about

00:14:43.678 --> 00:14:45.678
how we could better identify 

00:14:46.936 --> 00:14:48.936
veterans and it began with a 
launch of 

00:14:51.642 --> 00:14:53.642
the VRSS, developed by the VA, 
that 

00:14:56.733 --> 00:14:57.997
allowed us to match the list of 
those in our custody against 

00:14:57.998 --> 00:15:00.444
federal databases.
On day one we had 19 men who had

00:15:03.925 --> 00:15:05.925
self-identified as having served
this country.

00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:09.461
VRSS immediately told us that 
number was wrong.

00:15:11.135 --> 00:15:13.135
We had another 44 in our custody
we didn't know about.

00:15:15.077 --> 00:15:16.489
In fact, two-thirds more than we
knew about were serving time 

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.490
with us.

00:15:21.841 --> 00:15:23.841
We had tripled the number of 
veterans in our custody.

00:15:25.917 --> 00:15:27.917
That's why VRSS is a critical 
tool 

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.809
that should be utilized by every
facility across this country.

00:15:36.515 --> 00:15:38.962
So designed in collaboration 
with administrators and staff 

00:15:38.963 --> 00:15:40.963
and the 

00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:44.024
incarcerated themselves, it was 
opened 

00:15:45.026 --> 00:15:47.398
in themselves and named by the 
veterans themselves.

00:15:51.734 --> 00:15:53.734
Ours is not the first and not 
the last 

00:15:54.809 --> 00:15:56.809
unit designed for veterans 
suffering 

00:15:58.473 --> 00:15:58.675
from so many ailments, including
post-traumatic stress syndrome.

00:16:01.738 --> 00:16:04.231
Sheriffs from all over recognize
specially tailored programming 

00:16:04.232 --> 00:16:06.232
for targeted population works.

00:16:08.877 --> 00:16:10.877
A unique population, unique 
solution, unique results.

00:16:12.627 --> 00:16:14.485
Veterans units, particularly, 
work so much more effectively 

00:16:14.486 --> 00:16:16.549
for a number of reasons.  One 
because of the staffs and the 

00:16:18.843 --> 00:16:21.357
officers, the volunteers and the
programmatic staff specially 

00:16:21.358 --> 00:16:24.634
trained to work with veterans.  
There are community resources 

00:16:24.635 --> 00:16:29.547
that can transition to 
postrelease to continue their 

00:16:29.548 --> 00:16:32.041
treatment, including the VA and 
many non-profits.  And most 

00:16:32.042 --> 00:16:34.042
importantly because of the 

00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:38.147
veterans themselves public, 
their own drive, their own 

00:16:38.148 --> 00:16:40.148
change.

00:16:41.616 --> 00:16:44.477
In Middlesex we found the sample
act of opening the doors opened 

00:16:44.478 --> 00:16:46.478
opportunities for rehad been  .

00:16:50.201 --> 00:16:52.232
The men in the Humvee said being
out of the general population 

00:16:52.233 --> 00:16:56.548
allowed them to let their guard 
down and showed them they were 

00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:58.549
not aalone, because they felt 

00:17:00.229 --> 00:17:02.082
to alone before, and led them to
open up about their trauma while

00:17:02.083 --> 00:17:04.915
in incarceration.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.649
They said it was very much like 
being in the service.  Where in 

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:14.097
other parts of the facility, you
had to watch your back.  In this

00:17:14.098 --> 00:17:16.141
unit, you knew you had someone 
at your back and you had someone

00:17:16.142 --> 00:17:18.142
on your left and someone on your
right and all 

00:17:21.276 --> 00:17:23.276
you needed to do was look 
forward.

00:17:23.713 --> 00:17:25.591
In our unit, it didn't matter 
whether you served in Vietnam or

00:17:25.592 --> 00:17:28.665
enduring freedom.  Whether you 
spent a year on a 

00:17:32.963 --> 00:17:35.213
submarine, involved in combat or
served state-side or discharged 

00:17:35.214 --> 00:17:37.864
Honorably or not.  In some 
instances, the issues that led 

00:17:40.304 --> 00:17:42.574
to a less than Honorable 
discharge are the very same 

00:17:42.575 --> 00:17:44.575
reasons that led to their 
incarceration, as well.

00:17:47.714 --> 00:17:49.766
If you swore an oath and were 
willing to protect our freedom, 

00:17:49.767 --> 00:17:51.767
we will consider you for our 
freedom.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.110
Our experience is not much 
different than our colleagues 

00:17:55.111 --> 00:17:58.820
around the nation, many of whom 
are here today and spoke with 

00:17:58.821 --> 00:18:00.821
such passion and knowledge and 
expertise.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.184
The work is changing lives and 
changes families and changing 

00:18:04.185 --> 00:18:06.185
communities and 

00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:08.541
making our communities safer and
saving our communities money all

00:18:08.542 --> 00:18:10.542
at the same time.
You can see in the data.

00:18:16.541 --> 00:18:18.541
Our own snap shot pegged our 

00:18:20.261 --> 00:18:22.261
recidivism at just 5% over two 
and a half years.  Two%.

00:18:29.015 --> 00:18:31.249
Not only that about we have a 
parol rate of about 95%.

00:18:34.154 --> 00:18:36.154
Sentences were actually lessened
by the courts themselves.

00:18:37.806 --> 00:18:39.806
We had a number of men able to 
remain 

00:18:41.063 --> 00:18:41.871
in our unit instead of going to 
the state prison system because 

00:18:41.872 --> 00:18:43.872
of the work 

00:18:45.558 --> 00:18:47.789
we had done with them in the 
belief in us by the court 

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.261
program.
That's consistent with other 

00:18:49.262 --> 00:18:51.262
programs 

00:18:55.365 --> 00:18:57.365
like Albany and an San Francisco
who 

00:18:58.877 --> 00:19:01.116
have also reported single-digit 
recidivism rates.

00:19:05.221 --> 00:19:07.221
You can see it in the stories 
and hear 

00:19:08.505 --> 00:19:10.505
it in the voices of the veterans

00:19:13.607 --> 00:19:15.607
themselves, like Mike, who was 
able to get out much earlier.

00:19:18.918 --> 00:19:20.757
I was walking at a Labor Day 
parade, waving at the people at 

00:19:20.758 --> 00:19:22.758
the sides of the parade.

00:19:25.246 --> 00:19:27.492
Suddenly as I walked by one 
corner on the section up on the 

00:19:27.493 --> 00:19:31.364
hill I heard someone yell out,  
"Humvee." I looked over and saw 

00:19:31.365 --> 00:19:33.365
a man sitting 

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.820
there with a woman giving me a 
thumb's up.

00:19:38.705 --> 00:19:41.558
I ran up and he was doing 
fabulously well.  We had allowed

00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:44.018
him this opportunity.
And John who was two inches 

00:19:44.019 --> 00:19:46.019
short of 

00:19:47.107 --> 00:19:49.742
killing himself with a short 
gun.  He said if he had another 

00:19:49.743 --> 00:19:54.661
two inches in his arm, we would 
have been dead.  He came to our 

00:19:54.662 --> 00:19:56.662
facility and at one 

00:19:58.922 --> 00:20:00.555
point was free to leave on a 
parol to a bed parol was 

00:20:00.556 --> 00:20:02.556
providing for him, but the 

00:20:03.622 --> 00:20:06.497
bed we were going to provide him
through veterans affairs was not

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:08.498
going to be available for 
another month.

00:20:11.021 --> 00:20:13.867
By  God, he stayed with us for 
another month in a place of 

00:20:13.868 --> 00:20:15.868
incarceration 

00:20:17.116 --> 00:20:19.116
because he knew we had a bed for
him 

00:20:20.604 --> 00:20:22.604
following and we had a bed for 
him 

00:20:25.117 --> 00:20:27.117
following that for treatment 
with his PTSD.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.311
There are ideas about veterans 
units popping up around the 

00:20:34.312 --> 00:20:36.312
country.

00:20:41.052 --> 00:20:43.052
Mark Lamp is a border sheriff 
and a

00:20:44.143 --> 00:20:46.143
true cow

00:20:50.708 --> 00:20:52.139
boy, and he had a "it's kind of 
funny because we're like the odd

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.140
couple.

00:20:58.535 --> 00:21:00.368
He's a democrat liberal from 
Massachusetts -- I'm not sure 

00:21:00.369 --> 00:21:02.369
that's 

00:21:05.546 --> 00:21:08.223
meant in the most fond way -- 
and I'm a conservative sheriff 

00:21:08.224 --> 00:21:10.508
from Arizona, but it shows how 
we work together in this 

00:21:10.509 --> 00:21:15.027
country.  With these initiatives
that show that veterans, while 

00:21:15.028 --> 00:21:17.028
they're being held 

00:21:19.308 --> 00:21:21.960
accountable for those actions, 
we also honor their services.  

00:21:21.961 --> 00:21:23.961
And as it is said in the 
branches of 

00:21:25.018 --> 00:21:27.018
the military, we leave no man 
behind.

00:21:28.299 --> 00:21:30.299
We show them we won't leave them
behind."

00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:34.413
It's my honor to introduce James
Wright.  I'll speak from a 

00:21:34.414 --> 00:21:36.414
summary of his 

00:21:40.742 --> 00:21:41.382
summarized summary, because his 
accomplishments are so 

00:21:41.383 --> 00:21:43.383
significant.

00:21:44.448 --> 00:21:46.922
He joined the Marine Corps in 
1957.  He became his first 

00:21:46.923 --> 00:21:48.923
member of the family to graduate
from college.

00:21:52.257 --> 00:21:54.257
He went on to earn a  Ph.D.

00:21:55.744 --> 00:21:59.197
in history and joined the 
faculty in Dartmouth College.  

00:21:59.198 --> 00:22:01.198
He served as the president of 
Dartmouth.

00:22:02.699 --> 00:22:04.728
For the last 14 years he's been 
working to support veterans.

00:22:08.797 --> 00:22:10.797
He's been recognized by the 
Army, the 

00:22:12.061 --> 00:22:14.061
Marine Corps, the the veterans 
or foreign wars.

00:22:16.955 --> 00:22:19.816
He's also returned to his work 
publishing books of those who 

00:22:19.817 --> 00:22:21.817
have 

00:22:25.123 --> 00:22:27.133
served, and those who fought 
wars.

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:34.517
It is my great honor to 
introduce James Wright.

00:22:35.727 --> 00:22:37.727
[Applause]

00:22:49.598 --> 00:22:50.223
introduce.
&gt;&gt; JAMES WRIGHT:  Thank you, 

00:22:50.224 --> 00:22:53.536
sheriff.  You're very kind.  I 
certainly want to add on behalf 

00:22:53.537 --> 00:22:57.613
of everyone in this room a 
salute to you for your own 

00:22:57.614 --> 00:22:59.614
creative and effective 

00:23:01.236 --> 00:23:03.236
leadership and in support of 
veterans.

00:23:05.984 --> 00:23:07.984
It's really quite improve what 
you've 

00:23:09.279 --> 00:23:11.279
done in Middlesex county.

00:23:13.133 --> 00:23:14.781
I'm pleased to be here in join 
Karen Lloyd and Frank Lara on 

00:23:14.782 --> 00:23:19.077
this program.  I thank them for 
their service and for their 

00:23:19.078 --> 00:23:21.078
continuing work on behalf of 
veterans.

00:23:24.213 --> 00:23:26.250
I applaud the commitment of the 
bureau of prisons and the 

00:23:26.251 --> 00:23:28.251
National Institute of 

00:23:29.981 --> 00:23:31.981
Corrections to veterans issues 
and I 

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.860
commend the report that Bernard 
Edelman 

00:23:38.558 --> 00:23:39.372
of Vietnam Veterans of America, 
and that organization's veterans

00:23:39.373 --> 00:23:42.409
committee have done.  I look 
forward to the panel, chaired 

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.180
by Jonathan Elias, with this 
special commitment to telling 

00:23:48.181 --> 00:23:52.262
the stories of veterans.
It is an impressive group of 

00:23:52.263 --> 00:23:54.263
panelists.

00:23:56.947 --> 00:23:58.947
group who daily engage and work 
to resolve these issues.

00:24:06.825 --> 00:24:09.075
My special thanks to Bernard 
Edelman and Greg Crawford for 

00:24:09.076 --> 00:24:11.328
their service and lifetime 
commitment to serving those who 

00:24:11.948 --> 00:24:14.614
have served.  They have made a 
difference and 

00:24:18.095 --> 00:24:20.095
they're not yet finished making 
a difference.

00:24:20.345 --> 00:24:21.577
Greg, thank you for all you've 
done to help organize and pull 

00:24:21.578 --> 00:24:24.410
together this program.
I also want to acknowledge our 

00:24:24.411 --> 00:24:26.411
hosts 

00:24:27.668 --> 00:24:29.668
here today, the Library of 
Congress, my 

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.749
personal thanks to Karen Lloyd 
and the Veterans History 

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.006
Project.  This is a very 
important program.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.566
In my book Enduring Vietnam, I 
acknowledge how valuable they 

00:24:42.567 --> 00:24:44.567
were in 

00:24:46.037 --> 00:24:48.037
providing personal experiences 
that 

00:24:49.893 --> 00:24:51.893
enrich my account of those who 
had fought in Vietnam.

00:24:54.016 --> 00:24:56.090
Special thanks to Megan Harris 
of this project for all of her 

00:24:56.091 --> 00:24:58.091
help.

00:25:01.397 --> 00:25:03.843
Let me do a brief personal 
account, because I think some 

00:25:03.844 --> 00:25:07.716
parts of it are relevant to the 
subject that we're engaged in 

00:25:07.717 --> 00:25:09.717
today.

00:25:11.183 --> 00:25:13.183
In the summer of.

00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:20.704
of 2005, I made my first visit 
to Bethesda navel hospital.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.360
The

00:25:29.676 --> 00:25:31.676
previous November I had been 
very moved 

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.116
and troubled by the battle of 
Fallujah and Iraq.  These were 

00:25:41.117 --> 00:25:43.811
the same age of people that I 
was when I was in the Marines.

00:25:47.263 --> 00:25:49.324
These were the same age as the 
students where I worked at 

00:25:49.325 --> 00:25:51.325
Dartmouth.

00:25:53.591 --> 00:25:55.591
Indeed, a son of a friend of 
ours had 

00:25:56.859 --> 00:25:58.859
been killed, a marine, in 
Fallujah.

00:25:59.917 --> 00:26:01.917
I thought I wanted to reach out 
in some 

00:26:05.024 --> 00:26:07.868
bay way to those who were 
serving.  A friend said why 

00:26:07.869 --> 00:26:10.118
don't you go down to the 
Bethesda hospital and visit with

00:26:10.119 --> 00:26:12.119
the marines there?  And I did.

00:26:17.594 --> 00:26:19.325
Since then, I've been to 
Bethesda Walter reed over 30 

00:26:19.326 --> 00:26:22.392
times to visit with veterans.  I
haven't been there for a few 

00:26:22.393 --> 00:26:24.393
years.  There are not as many.

00:26:27.704 --> 00:26:29.704
The wounded veterans pipeline 
has slowed significantly.

00:26:30.377 --> 00:26:31.192
Whether I would go to the 
hospital, my pattern was always 

00:26:31.193 --> 00:26:33.193
the same.

00:26:35.327 --> 00:26:37.327
I would go bed-to-bed and ask 
the patient what happened.

00:26:39.193 --> 00:26:41.193
And you know, I never once 
encountered 

00:26:42.242 --> 00:26:44.111
anyone -- and those of you who 
know Walter Reed know these were

00:26:44.112 --> 00:26:46.973
the most seriously injured and 
wounded, in most cases.

00:26:51.475 --> 00:26:53.302
I never had anyone balk at 
telling me what had happened.

00:26:56.652 --> 00:26:58.908
Then I would engage them about a
conversation about their future 

00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:00.909
and what they hoped to do.

00:27:02.758 --> 00:27:04.631
I kept reminding them you have a
great future ahead of you; let's

00:27:04.632 --> 00:27:08.106
think about what you might do.
I would ask them by their own 

00:27:09.344 --> 00:27:11.185
educational background and plans
and I would try to encourage 

00:27:11.186 --> 00:27:13.186
them to continue their 
education.

00:27:15.305 --> 00:27:17.734
I assured them that they'd 
already demonstrated their 

00:27:17.735 --> 00:27:19.735
discipline, their 

00:27:21.885 --> 00:27:23.514
commitment to serveing, and now 
they needed to prepare 

00:27:23.515 --> 00:27:25.515
themselves for the rest of their
lives.

00:27:28.564 --> 00:27:30.617
They still had so much to do, so
much more that they could 

00:27:30.618 --> 00:27:33.289
contribute.
I was able to set up an 

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:35.290
educational 

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.540
counseling program with the 
American 

00:27:41.723 --> 00:27:43.543
Council on Education at Walter 
Reed Bethesda and I went out and

00:27:43.544 --> 00:27:49.043
raised the money to get it 
started, and nearly 12 years 

00:27:49.044 --> 00:27:51.044
later it is still in place at 

00:27:54.153 --> 00:27:54.345
Walter Reed, now under the 
semper phi funds 

00:27:54.346 --> 00:27:56.346
organizationally.

00:27:57.829 --> 00:27:59.829
A few years after that, I was 
able to 

00:28:06.206 --> 00:28:08.206
work with senators Jim Webb and 
Jon 

00:28:14.306 --> 00:28:16.306
Warner and Chuck Hagel on the 
post 9/the

00:28:19.313 --> 00:28:21.313
9/11 GI bill.

00:28:22.809 --> 00:28:25.276
I encouraged them to include 
what ended up being called the 

00:28:25.277 --> 00:28:29.138
yellow ribbon program because it
gave the opportunity for private

00:28:29.139 --> 00:28:32.020
schools to contribute money of 
their own to match that of the 

00:28:32.021 --> 00:28:35.057
VA to make sure that private 
schools were an option for these

00:28:35.058 --> 00:28:37.058
veterans.

00:28:40.312 --> 00:28:42.312
And last year, the congress, 
with

00:28:45.883 --> 00:28:47.761
bipartisanship improved an 
extension and expansion of that 

00:28:47.762 --> 00:28:49.786
legislation.
It's important and I think 

00:28:49.787 --> 00:28:53.051
everyone needs to know and 
recognize that legislation such 

00:28:53.052 --> 00:28:55.052
as this, legislation 

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.170
such as the GI bill, this is not
a thank 

00:29:02.594 --> 00:29:04.594
you for your service

00:29:07.211 --> 00:29:11.063
gratuity.  It may provide an 
incentive to serve.  That would 

00:29:11.064 --> 00:29:13.064
be good.

00:29:14.532 --> 00:29:16.532
It may provide immediately a 
fully 

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:21.668
deserved acknowledgment of adone
so, enabling veterans back into 

00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:26.778
their transition into the 
civilian life.  Civilian also an

00:29:26.779 --> 00:29:28.779
investment into the future of 
this republic.

00:29:31.759 --> 00:29:33.380
What a resource these veterans 
can provide if we can enable 

00:29:33.381 --> 00:29:35.381
them and provide them the 
opportunity to pursue it.

00:29:37.262 --> 00:29:39.904
The ranks of the American 
military today are filled with 

00:29:39.905 --> 00:29:41.905
volunteers.

00:29:45.036 --> 00:29:47.036
They do not represent the nation
demographically.

00:29:48.086 --> 00:29:50.086
They tend to be more rural than 
urban.

00:29:51.951 --> 00:29:53.951
More heartland than coastal.

00:29:56.033 --> 00:29:58.033
They're largely from blue collar

00:30:01.326 --> 00:30:02.546
middle class backgrounds, and 
they tend disproportionately to 

00:30:02.547 --> 00:30:04.547
come from military families.

00:30:08.721 --> 00:30:11.391
They constitute less than 1% of 
the population.  These 21st 

00:30:11.392 --> 00:30:13.392
Century wars are the first 

00:30:14.687 --> 00:30:16.687
extended wars in American 
history, with 

00:30:18.775 --> 00:30:20.775
no designated tax to help pay 
for the wars.

00:30:22.904 --> 00:30:24.904
And no service requirement for 
citizens of this country.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.535
So much for George Washington's 
reminder that it is necessary to

00:30:31.536 --> 00:30:33.536
go -- if it is 

00:30:34.608 --> 00:30:36.608
necessary to go to war, all 
citizens 

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.553
should support this with their 
treasure and with their service.

00:30:42.621 --> 00:30:45.252
Not anymore.  Not for these 
wars.

00:30:49.124 --> 00:30:50.982
These veterans can come home and
spend a good part of the rest of

00:30:50.983 --> 00:30:54.672
their lives helping to pay off 
the debt of the wars in which 

00:30:54.673 --> 00:30:59.195
they fought.  And the vast 
majority of us go on with our 

00:30:59.196 --> 00:31:01.196
lives.

00:31:03.309 --> 00:31:05.309
Those who serve in the 21st 
century wars 

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:10.476
are the best educated of 
Americans to serve in any war.  

00:31:10.477 --> 00:31:14.791
They are better educated than 
their age group as a whole.  The

00:31:14.792 --> 00:31:16.868
armed forces expect at least a 
high school education.

00:31:19.913 --> 00:31:22.575
And that's a good positive step.
But you know, we all know, 

00:31:26.235 --> 00:31:28.235
unfortunately, a high school 
education 

00:31:31.334 --> 00:31:33.334
is insufficient in this modern 
economy.

00:31:37.069 --> 00:31:38.693
The recent pattern of veterans 
having higher unemployment rates

00:31:38.694 --> 00:31:42.024
than nonveterans has been 
largely the result of their 

00:31:42.025 --> 00:31:44.278
educational background rather 
than a negative judgment on 

00:31:44.279 --> 00:31:46.279
their military service.

00:31:49.409 --> 00:31:51.409
The parents and the grandparents
of the 

00:31:52.678 --> 00:31:54.678
current veterans came home from 
World 

00:31:56.128 --> 00:31:58.128
War II, Korea, Vietnam, and if 
they did 

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.500
not use the GI bill to pursue 
education, 

00:32:05.411 --> 00:32:07.644
they could pretty much count on 
getting some good jobs at a 

00:32:07.645 --> 00:32:10.285
local factory, a mill, or a 
mine.

00:32:15.838 --> 00:32:17.838
And they could really count on 
knowing 

00:32:18.914 --> 00:32:21.144
that if they worked hard, they 
could probably have that job 

00:32:21.145 --> 00:32:23.145
until they retired.

00:32:25.721 --> 00:32:27.721
And then when we did retire, 
they 

00:32:28.977 --> 00:32:30.977
would have some pension plan to 
help them.

00:32:31.833 --> 00:32:33.833
Let's face it.  Those 
opportunities are far more 

00:32:38.271 --> 00:32:40.731
limited today and there's far 
less likelihood of that lifetime

00:32:40.732 --> 00:32:42.732
security.

00:32:46.318 --> 00:32:48.537
The post 9/11 GI bill offers 
them an opportunity to set a 

00:32:48.538 --> 00:32:51.042
course for their future.  But, 
you know, I learned early on in 

00:32:56.208 --> 00:32:56.822
my conversations that while it 
is essential to provide the 

00:32:56.823 --> 00:32:58.823
financial 

00:33:00.372 --> 00:33:02.372
support for veterans to continue
their 

00:33:03.822 --> 00:33:05.920
education, there was a prior and
often more difficult counseling 

00:33:05.921 --> 00:33:07.921
need.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:11.990
This was to encourage them to do
this, 

00:33:14.571 --> 00:33:16.571
to assure them that they could 
do this.

00:33:17.431 --> 00:33:19.431
While nearly all of those who 
have 

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:24.227
joined the all volunteer 
military may be high school 

00:33:24.228 --> 00:33:27.112
graduates, most of them did not 
take college preparatory 

00:33:27.113 --> 00:33:29.355
courses.  They probably have not
taken 

00:33:33.116 --> 00:33:35.116
standardized ACT or SAT exams.

00:33:36.623 --> 00:33:38.623
They often feel unprepared for 
higher 

00:33:39.682 --> 00:33:41.682
education, and some of them may 
not be ready.

00:33:42.946 --> 00:33:45.589
But I have no doubt, I have no 
doubt, that they all can be 

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.590
ready.

00:33:48.661 --> 00:33:52.779
Counseling and convincing them 
of this is essential.  As is 

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.780
follow-up support to encourage 

00:33:57.516 --> 00:33:59.516
them to pursue and to succeed.

00:34:01.024 --> 00:34:03.049
You see, we have a national 
need, an obligation, to try to 

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.050
encourage all 

00:34:06.102 --> 00:34:08.356
students who have never been 
encouraged.  They can do this.

00:34:11.842 --> 00:34:13.842
And this is where those young 
men and 

00:34:15.924 --> 00:34:18.185
women with military experience 
can draw on some greater 

00:34:18.186 --> 00:34:20.186
self-confidence if we 

00:34:22.521 --> 00:34:24.521
can remind them why they should 
have 

00:34:25.727 --> 00:34:27.727
this greater

00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:31.334
they should confidence.
There's another part of military

00:34:34.392 --> 00:34:36.392
experience that we need to 
understand.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.460
All of the children in this 
country 

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:43.610
really, human beings across the 
world, 

00:34:45.346 --> 00:34:47.346
learn as infants to remember two
pretty constant things.

00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:52.069
One is to look out for 
themselves.

00:34:53.465 --> 00:34:58.368
Avoid any threatening risks.  
Don't go there.  Don't touch 

00:34:58.369 --> 00:35:02.891
that.  Look carefully.  Because 
cautious.

00:35:05.986 --> 00:35:07.986
And they are also told not to 
harm others.

00:35:11.343 --> 00:35:13.804
And the latter is more than 
parentsal guidance as it's 

00:35:13.805 --> 00:35:15.805
emphasized under threat 

00:35:17.515 --> 00:35:21.410
of law, as well as moral code 
and religious teachings.  Do not

00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:23.411
bring harm to other people.

00:35:25.271 --> 00:35:27.918
Think of it, a very small 
fraction of our citizens in 

00:35:27.919 --> 00:35:29.919
their late teens and 

00:35:32.015 --> 00:35:34.471
early 20s when they're mobilized
for war, they are told they have

00:35:34.472 --> 00:35:36.472
to suppress 

00:35:37.524 --> 00:35:39.524
these fundamental instincts and 

00:35:40.574 --> 00:35:42.574
principles when the situation 
demands.

00:35:45.072 --> 00:35:46.293
They must be willing to put 
themselves in harm's way without

00:35:46.294 --> 00:35:51.415
question or without hesitation. 
Go there and do it.  They go and

00:35:51.416 --> 00:35:53.416
do.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:59.837
They don't stop and reflect on 
it." This looks dangerous." 

00:35:59.838 --> 00:36:01.838
That's not their job.  They're 
told to go.

00:36:02.694 --> 00:36:07.199
And they must be willing to 
bring harm to others.  Lethal 

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.200
harm.

00:36:10.478 --> 00:36:12.478
Without any delay, any 
opportunity for 

00:36:13.939 --> 00:36:17.268
moral reflection  "should I be 
doing this?" This is their 

00:36:17.269 --> 00:36:19.269
assignment.

00:36:22.533 --> 00:36:23.999
Now, when they return to 
civilian life they're told to 

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000
return 

00:36:28.275 --> 00:36:30.275
to their first rules: To forget 
that 

00:36:31.525 --> 00:36:32.547
which they just learned and to 
wipe from their memory contrary 

00:36:32.548 --> 00:36:35.814
experiences.  Obviously, in each
of these instances, this is 

00:36:35.815 --> 00:36:37.815
impossible.

00:36:39.075 --> 00:36:41.715
The vast majority of combat 
veterans do return to civilian 

00:36:41.716 --> 00:36:43.716
lives 

00:36:44.971 --> 00:36:47.023
successfully, but they never 
forget that experience that they

00:36:47.024 --> 00:36:49.024
had.

00:36:50.732 --> 00:36:52.553
It is a difficult transition.  
Some do not return as 

00:36:52.554 --> 00:36:54.554
successfully as others.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.100
And indeed, some of this group 
are a 

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:03.550
matter for our focus today.

00:37:04.958 --> 00:37:07.358
We need to know the experience 
of war from those who are there 

00:37:07.359 --> 00:37:11.265
before we can begin to 
understand it.  To know how 

00:37:11.266 --> 00:37:13.266
profound this experience 

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:17.590
is, how contrary it is, to 
everything 

00:37:19.258 --> 00:37:21.258
they've been taught and learned.

00:37:24.617 --> 00:37:26.617
As a Vietnam veteran, Army 
combat 

00:37:28.303 --> 00:37:30.149
photographer, a friend, Victor 
Ants recently described it, they

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:32.150
risked their lives.

00:37:33.276 --> 00:37:37.267
They faced terror.  They lose 
buddies in battles.  And then 

00:37:37.268 --> 00:37:39.268
they come home, where they 

00:37:41.369 --> 00:37:43.369
had to square what they had to 
do with 

00:37:44.465 --> 00:37:45.687
warriors with now what they're 
expected to do now that they're 

00:37:45.688 --> 00:37:49.598
home.  It isn't easy.
Veterans who are in prison for 

00:37:51.632 --> 00:37:53.632
committing a crime face many of 
the same 

00:37:57.524 --> 00:37:59.524
problems that in which veterans 
face

00:38:03.877 --> 00:38:04.592
nonveterans face in 
transitioning back to civilian 

00:38:04.593 --> 00:38:06.593
life after release.

00:38:07.679 --> 00:38:09.510
Problems with acceptance and 
employment andians enters 

00:38:09.511 --> 00:38:12.367
society while encountering 
suspicion at every turn.

00:38:15.425 --> 00:38:17.425
And finally of avoiding 
recidivism.

00:38:18.471 --> 00:38:20.471
This path is harder to avoid if 

00:38:21.728 --> 00:38:24.572
individuals encounter a society 
that has little confidence in a 

00:38:24.573 --> 00:38:29.267
good outcome.  These problems 
may be compounded for veterans 

00:38:29.268 --> 00:38:31.268
who have been released.

00:38:33.965 --> 00:38:35.965
They confront dual and 
reinforcing stereotypes.

00:38:42.328 --> 00:38:44.328
The current "ban the box" 
initiative to

00:38:46.281 --> 00:38:48.281
encourage respective employers 
and 

00:38:49.294 --> 00:38:51.294
admoni

00:38:54.093 --> 00:38:56.140
into discontinue asking criminal
history, is an interesting 

00:38:56.141 --> 00:38:58.141
effort.

00:39:00.526 --> 00:39:02.556
It's reminiscence of the Vietnam
veterans in the 1970s who didn't

00:39:04.601 --> 00:39:06.839
acknowledge their military 
service on job applications, 

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.840
because they thought this was 
something that would be far 

00:39:10.931 --> 00:39:12.931
better for them if their 
employer didn't 

00:39:14.234 --> 00:39:16.234
have to say, "Were you a 
veteran?

00:39:17.305 --> 00:39:18.725
" And ask some of the most 
foolish questions you could 

00:39:18.726 --> 00:39:20.726
imagine.

00:39:22.205 --> 00:39:22.597
We've come a great distance 
medically since post-traumatic 

00:39:22.598 --> 00:39:24.598
stress syndrome was 

00:39:26.104 --> 00:39:28.104
recorded recognized as a 
clinical disorder.

00:39:29.356 --> 00:39:31.356
But that journey is not over.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.361
And the distance remains even 
greater in accomplishing social 

00:39:37.362 --> 00:39:39.362
acceptance of this mental health
condition.

00:39:41.534 --> 00:39:43.404
The mental -- the medical and 
the legal recognition of 

00:39:43.405 --> 00:39:47.320
post-traumatic stress syndrome 
has been so important.  We 

00:39:47.321 --> 00:39:49.321
discuss it more openly now.

00:39:51.618 --> 00:39:53.618
But you know, I also worry that 
this 

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.380
talking about it more openly, 

00:40:00.464 --> 00:40:02.464
ironically, has buttressed 
another cruel stereotype.

00:40:04.573 --> 00:40:06.573
That of the socially unhinged  
veteran.

00:40:09.082 --> 00:40:11.718
The Vietnam veterans in the 
1970s came straight in to this 

00:40:11.719 --> 00:40:13.719
headwind.

00:40:17.623 --> 00:40:19.623
And they encountered movies such
as 

00:40:21.916 --> 00:40:23.916
Taxi Driver and Apocalypse Now, 
which 

00:40:27.214 --> 00:40:29.214
deranged psychotic veterans 
emerged.

00:40:30.274 --> 00:40:32.933
The 1970s were not kind to 
veterans coming back from an 

00:40:32.934 --> 00:40:34.934
unpopular war.

00:40:39.294 --> 00:40:41.294
From the early in the 70s on the

00:40:43.822 --> 00:40:46.478
television show Kojak,  Teli 
Savalas confronted a group of 

00:40:46.479 --> 00:40:48.479
homicides in Manhattan.

00:40:50.965 --> 00:40:52.965
He told one of his colleagues to
find 

00:40:55.303 --> 00:40:57.137
out if there were any Vietnam 
veterans in the neighborhood of 

00:40:57.138 --> 00:41:00.891
the crime.  Think of this.  Are 
there any Vietnam veterans 

00:41:00.892 --> 00:41:02.725
there?
Post-traumatic stress syndrome 

00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:05.409
is a companion of all wars.

00:41:08.704 --> 00:41:10.704
Read Odysses.

00:41:13.587 --> 00:41:15.842
But this was not even diagnosed 
as a clinical condition until 

00:41:15.843 --> 00:41:20.123
1979.  Before that, they were 
categorized as suffering from 

00:41:20.124 --> 00:41:22.124
the Vietnam syndrome, as 

00:41:23.597 --> 00:41:26.051
if it were an isolated condition
of what so many other veterans 

00:41:26.052 --> 00:41:28.052
thought of as 

00:41:29.475 --> 00:41:31.475
this wind

00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:37.829
whining hippie group coming back
from Vietnam.

00:41:38.074 --> 00:41:39.293
Their parents generation told 
them to grow up and get over  

00:41:39.294 --> 00:41:41.294
it.  They said, "We did.  "

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:46.870
But, of course, not all of them 
did.

00:41:50.972 --> 00:41:52.972
It was called combat fatigue or 
shell shock then.

00:41:54.274 --> 00:41:56.274
The Vietnam veterans spoke of 

00:41:58.357 --> 00:42:00.825
nightmares becoming daymares.  
One said to me if those other 

00:42:00.826 --> 00:42:02.826
people 

00:42:04.481 --> 00:42:07.152
had to spend just one night 
inside my nightmares, they would

00:42:07.153 --> 00:42:09.153
fall to the floor with tears in 
their eyes.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.900
But these veterans endured and 
they have 

00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:17.381
contributed so much to our 
national life.  One thing we've 

00:42:17.382 --> 00:42:19.382
learned is that 

00:42:20.488 --> 00:42:22.738
veterans will speak about their 
experiences more candidly and 

00:42:22.739 --> 00:42:24.771
more personally with other 
veterans.

00:42:28.278 --> 00:42:29.718
Some of the best counseling 
sessions involve a group of 

00:42:29.719 --> 00:42:31.719
veterans sharing 

00:42:32.983 --> 00:42:34.983
their stories and encouraging 
one another.

00:42:38.496 --> 00:42:40.346
If post 9/11 veterans have not 
had to contend with the same 

00:42:40.347 --> 00:42:42.347
nasty degrading 

00:42:43.676 --> 00:42:46.325
stereotypes in popular culture, 
they still have often to 

00:42:46.326 --> 00:42:48.326
encounter wisps of 

00:42:49.394 --> 00:42:51.394
the fear and prejudice that 
remain.

00:42:53.095 --> 00:42:55.773
And here their reinforcing fear 
and prejudice and suspicion that

00:42:55.774 --> 00:42:57.774
confronts 

00:43:02.707 --> 00:43:05.358
the ones who are former convicts
and veterans can be even harder 

00:43:05.359 --> 00:43:08.249
to escape.
If this is their difficult 

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:11.098
assignment, I have confidence in
them.  But our society has a 

00:43:11.099 --> 00:43:13.099
role, as well.

00:43:14.346 --> 00:43:16.346
We still need to thank them for 
their 

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.900
service and recognize this as 
not a 

00:43:22.788 --> 00:43:24.788
condescending throw-away 
gratuity.

00:43:25.689 --> 00:43:29.353
They need a hand, not a hand 
out.  They need a hand.  We need

00:43:29.354 --> 00:43:31.354
to recognize what they've done 
on our behalf, even if they have

00:43:33.264 --> 00:43:36.561
stumbled since.  They have much 
to offer.  Americans today to 

00:43:36.562 --> 00:43:40.256
juggle their views of the 
current generation of veterans. 

00:43:40.257 --> 00:43:42.257
They applaud them when they're 
introduced at events.

00:43:45.961 --> 00:43:47.961
They call them all heroes.

00:43:54.096 --> 00:43:56.332
Yet, they're also a little bit 
uneasy around them sometimes.  

00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:58.589
We all need to know them better.
We need to understand who they 

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:00.590
are, 

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:04.748
what they've endured, what they 
want to do.  These veterans have

00:44:04.749 --> 00:44:06.749
worked effectively 

00:44:08.064 --> 00:44:10.064
with others of different 
backgrounds.

00:44:12.112 --> 00:44:14.565
They have assumed responsibility
and accountability.  They've 

00:44:14.566 --> 00:44:16.616
functioned in complex 
organizations in an advanced 

00:44:17.845 --> 00:44:19.845
technological environment.

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.405
And they've confronted dangerous
situations while respecting 

00:44:23.406 --> 00:44:25.406
people of different cultures.

00:44:27.689 --> 00:44:28.693
They have learned discipline and
restraint and self-confidence 

00:44:28.694 --> 00:44:32.578
and tolerance.  They have 
observed and they have 

00:44:36.053 --> 00:44:38.053
themselves offered sacrifice for
a greater good.

00:44:42.378 --> 00:44:45.057
I'm impressed by the options 
that sheriffs and wardens such 

00:44:45.058 --> 00:44:47.058
as those 

00:44:48.974 --> 00:44:50.974
speaking here today, officers 
such as 

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:55.450
Sheriff Peter Koutoujian and his

00:44:57.533 --> 00:44:59.533
Middlesex county middlecaptain 
Malik 

00:45:05.678 --> 00:45:08.671
Muhammad of Orange County 
Florida, and Ron Perez

00:45:12.858 --> 00:45:15.119
, and judge Michael Jackson.  
Semper phi, judge, and thank you

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.187
for what you've done.
Their counseling and the 

00:45:18.188 --> 00:45:20.616
specialized living units that 
some have developed 

00:45:23.675 --> 00:45:25.675
allow veterans to connect with 
each other.

00:45:27.559 --> 00:45:28.597
Remember, they are more 
comfortable talking to each 

00:45:28.598 --> 00:45:30.598
other.

00:45:31.678 --> 00:45:34.137
It's an essential step towards 
their reconnecting with society,

00:45:34.138 --> 00:45:36.138
with that society that sent them
to war.

00:45:39.516 --> 00:45:41.516
The report, which is released 
today, in 

00:45:42.586 --> 00:45:43.618
this gathering, addressed the 
value of the programs such as 

00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:48.968
these.  These veterans have met 
their obligation.  Now, we have 

00:45:48.969 --> 00:45:51.843
an obligation.  To reach out to 
them.

00:45:55.135 --> 00:45:57.135
They will benefit from our 
support, of course.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:01.442
As we all have already greatly 
benefited from all that they 

00:46:01.443 --> 00:46:03.443
have done.

00:46:05.728 --> 00:46:07.728
And we and our society will be 
the 

00:46:08.985 --> 00:46:11.222
better if we are able to help 
them to succeed.  It is truly a 

00:46:11.223 --> 00:46:13.223
win-win.

00:46:16.934 --> 00:46:18.934
We are all ahead if we can help 
them to succeed.

00:46:23.659 --> 00:46:26.128
Maybe it's too much delayed, but
now we need to say in a delayed 

00:46:26.129 --> 00:46:30.613
reciprocal, we've got your back,
now.  We want to help you.

00:46:35.106 --> 00:46:37.335
I'm going to hand off the stage 
to our moderator, Jonathan 

00:46:37.336 --> 00:46:39.336
Elias.  Mr.

00:46:41.244 --> 00:46:43.244
Elias is an award winning 
journalist 

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:46.510
and the host of WJLA-TV's Salute
to Veterans.

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:51.039
To an instructor at the Army War
College and he's passionate 

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:55.531
about veterans issues.  Before 
that, I believe we have a brief 

00:46:58.383 --> 00:47:00.383
video message from an attorney 
at the 

00:47:01.669 --> 00:47:02.849
Harvard law school veterans law 
and disability benefits office.

00:47:05.935 --> 00:47:08.402
Thank you for participating in 
this program today.

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:13.410
[Applause]

00:47:29.455 --> 00:47:31.455
[Video plays.

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:34.470
]

00:50:29.673 --> 00:50:31.673
&gt;&gt;  Good afternoon.  That's all 
you got, really?

00:50:37.049 --> 00:50:39.049
We need a  7th inning stretch 
around here.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.520
I became involved with the 
military two decades ago now.

00:50:46.202 --> 00:50:48.202
I was early on recognizing 
purple heart recipients.

00:50:53.186 --> 00:50:55.186
I knew a lot of friends of mine 
who 

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.120
were veterans and maybe their 
bodies were bruised but their 

00:50:58.121 --> 00:51:00.121
spirits were intact.

00:51:03.221 --> 00:51:05.881
He  I wanted to celebrate that 
spirit.  We used to have 

00:51:05.882 --> 00:51:13.421
gatherings of strangers to come 
together to say thank you very 

00:51:13.422 --> 00:51:15.422
much for your service and 
welcome home.

00:51:17.488 --> 00:51:19.488
I had someone come up to me, a 
good 

00:51:21.784 --> 00:51:23.784
looking kid, and he said, "Why 
are you doing this?" 

00:51:26.869 --> 00:51:28.301
And he started to cry and I just
sat there and held this kid and 

00:51:28.302 --> 00:51:30.590
we talked for a while.  He asked
me again, why are you doing 

00:51:30.789 --> 00:51:34.690
this?  I said, well, because 
everybody should.  Then it got 

00:51:34.691 --> 00:51:37.146
me introduced to the whole idea 
of what PTSD, this window 

00:51:37.147 --> 00:51:39.147
dressing 

00:51:41.836 --> 00:51:43.665
of this button down good looking
kid was a veneer to something 

00:51:43.666 --> 00:51:45.666
more painful and more deep.

00:51:47.159 --> 00:51:48.776
When I spent time talking he 
explained to me war is its own 

00:51:48.777 --> 00:51:50.777
language.

00:51:53.358 --> 00:51:55.358
Approximatethe language of war 
is one where there is pain.

00:51:58.787 --> 00:51:59.835
When you're having a bad day, 
maybe the boss didn't like 

00:51:59.836 --> 00:52:01.836
something you did.

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.221
When they have a bad day, they 
stop on something that goes boom

00:52:07.222 --> 00:52:10.502
and their lives are forever 
changed because they're losing 

00:52:10.503 --> 00:52:12.503
their legs or arms or ability to
do anything.

00:52:13.802 --> 00:52:15.802
Their language of war is so 
impossible for us to speak.

00:52:18.743 --> 00:52:19.770
If you've not walked or marched 
in a battlefield with brothers 

00:52:19.771 --> 00:52:24.099
and sisters to your side and 
suffered the loss of somebody, 

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.137
it's impossible for you to get 
your head around that language. 

00:52:26.138 --> 00:52:28.375
And then they come home.  And 
that language is still fresh in 

00:52:28.567 --> 00:52:30.617
their mind.  That's the language
they speak.

00:52:35.534 --> 00:52:37.534
Yet, here they are on our 
streets 

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:41.220
trying to function as normal 
citizens.

00:52:45.162 --> 00:52:47.599
It's a very frustrating thing.
One friend of mine said how do 

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.600
we transition somebody from 
learning the 

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:53.936
language of war and then going 
to a civilian language once 

00:52:53.937 --> 00:52:59.028
again?  It's incumbent upon all 
of us that these are people who 

00:52:59.029 --> 00:53:01.029
have given their who's for us.

00:53:04.785 --> 00:53:07.037
They selflessly signed up and 
served for country.  The least 

00:53:07.038 --> 00:53:09.676
we can do is pay them back.
When he said to me, why are you 

00:53:09.677 --> 00:53:11.701
doing this?  I said everybody 
should.

00:53:14.971 --> 00:53:16.814
There's 40,000 plus agencies, 
non-profits out there, doing 

00:53:16.815 --> 00:53:20.702
things to help better the lives 
of veterans.  In addition to 

00:53:20.703 --> 00:53:22.703
that, we have leaders 

00:53:24.784 --> 00:53:26.656
in our community, sitting off to
my left here, had they come back

00:53:26.657 --> 00:53:31.823
and have suffering from PTSD.  
All of them have scars.  Those 

00:53:31.824 --> 00:53:34.899
heal.  The wounds never heal.  
The wounds stay with them 

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:39.187
forever.  Some of them can adapt
and go back to life and try to 

00:53:39.188 --> 00:53:41.188
put it in their past, 

00:53:42.453 --> 00:53:44.703
and others make bad decisions 
along the way and find 

00:53:44.704 --> 00:53:46.704
themselves in the courts, 

00:53:50.619 --> 00:53:52.619
as we discussed last year, and 
maybe en

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:55.780
incarcerated.

00:53:57.237 --> 00:53:59.507
These are people that went off 
and fought for you.  Do you owe 

00:53:59.508 --> 00:54:02.953
them something?  Yes.  It's not 
a hand out.  None of them would 

00:54:02.954 --> 00:54:06.869
take it.  A hand up is what 
they're looking for just to get 

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:08.924
back on their feet.
The panel, last year went a 

00:54:08.925 --> 00:54:10.925
little crazy.  We got a ten 
minute dissertation.

00:54:14.507 --> 00:54:16.507
I just want 60 seconds.  Please 
introduce yourself and tell us 

00:54:18.977 --> 00:54:20.665
what you're doing in 60 seconds 
and then we'll start the 

00:54:20.666 --> 00:54:22.748
conversation.
&gt;&gt; GREG CRAWFORD:  I'm Greg 

00:54:22.749 --> 00:54:26.240
Crawford with the national 
institute of corrections.  I 

00:54:26.241 --> 00:54:28.241
want to thank the Library of 

00:54:31.192 --> 00:54:34.477
Congress and Karen Lloyd for 
bringing us back this year.  I 

00:54:34.478 --> 00:54:36.478
want to thank those who serve 
our 

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.666
country in uniform and those who
continue to serve whether you're

00:54:40.667 --> 00:54:42.667
a law 

00:54:43.755 --> 00:54:45.755
enforcement officer or someone 
working 

00:54:47.016 --> 00:54:49.016
in a veterans court, and also 
the veteran peer mentors.

00:54:50.674 --> 00:54:54.389
I served in the Air Force but it
did shape my life.  It helped 

00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:58.112
create structure and discipline 
which was much needed.  Just ask

00:54:58.113 --> 00:55:00.113
my father and mother at the 
time.

00:55:02.589 --> 00:55:04.589
It also led me into working in 
the criminal justice system.

00:55:06.302 --> 00:55:08.185
I worked three years in mental 
health.  It shaped my philosophy

00:55:08.186 --> 00:55:11.272
to working with people.  You 
can't treat a piece of the 

00:55:11.273 --> 00:55:16.449
person.  You have to treat the 
entire person.  That's why these

00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:18.450
types of things, like 

00:55:19.874 --> 00:55:21.874
local housing

00:55:25.483 --> 00:55:27.126
units for jails, work so 
effectively.  You're treating 

00:55:27.127 --> 00:55:31.998
all the person.  Thank you James
Wright for the wonderful speech 

00:55:31.999 --> 00:55:33.999
and also Peter 

00:55:36.511 --> 00:55:39.208
Koutoujian and also Frank Lara. 
And I want to thank the director

00:55:39.209 --> 00:55:43.129
even though he couldn't be here.
Because without him we couldn't 

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:45.787
be here today and issuing these 
publication.  To thank you.

00:55:48.991 --> 00:55:50.991
I alsoso thank you.

00:55:53.904 --> 00:55:55.904
We started with -- we lost our 
way.

00:55:58.556 --> 00:55:59.417
This year we're releasing a 
publication and I'm honored to 

00:55:59.418 --> 00:56:01.418
pass 

00:56:02.872 --> 00:56:05.131
it off to my colleague Bernard 
Edelman who issued both of these

00:56:05.132 --> 00:56:06.551
publications.
&gt;&gt; BERNARD EDELMAN:  Let's see 

00:56:06.552 --> 00:56:08.552
if I can 

00:56:10.043 --> 00:56:13.732
do this in 59.  I'm from 
Brooklyn.  Graduated from 

00:56:13.733 --> 00:56:20.037
college.  Got drafted.  Spent 
most of 1970 in Vietnam.  That 

00:56:20.038 --> 00:56:22.293
changed my life.  It was not in 
combat.

00:56:27.329 --> 00:56:29.329
I was a correspondence 
specialist.

00:56:32.513 --> 00:56:34.165
I spent a lot of times in a 
civil affairs unit.  Still 

00:56:34.166 --> 00:56:38.241
changed my life.  Came back, got
a career, certain things never 

00:56:38.242 --> 00:56:40.242
left me.

00:56:41.717 --> 00:56:43.748
Participanted in a Vietnam art 
show, brought it to New York 

00:56:43.749 --> 00:56:45.749
City, which is my hometown.

00:56:49.677 --> 00:56:51.511
I was named by mayor Koch to 
serve on the Vietnam memorial 

00:56:51.512 --> 00:56:53.512
commission.

00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:59.290
We did the letters home from 
Vietnam, 

00:57:00.999 --> 00:57:02.999
became an HBO documentary of the
same name.

00:57:05.515 --> 00:57:07.515
Since then, I've became the 
mayor's 

00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:10.590
office of veterans  affairs 
director 

00:57:11.672 --> 00:57:13.672
under Ed, first public official 
to put 

00:57:14.988 --> 00:57:17.040
his money where his mouth was 
when it came to Vietnam 

00:57:17.041 --> 00:57:19.041
veterans.

00:57:21.356 --> 00:57:24.004
I've been down here for 15 years
now with Vietnam Veterans of 

00:57:24.005 --> 00:57:27.081
America, which is one of the 
most active of all the service 

00:57:27.082 --> 00:57:29.082
organizations.

00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:32.910
I'm department

00:57:34.127 --> 00:57:36.370
Deputy director for public 
affairs.   Technically, though, 

00:57:36.371 --> 00:57:41.063
I'm a lobbiest.  Thank you.
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL JACKSON:  My name is 

00:57:41.064 --> 00:57:43.109
Michael Jackson from the 
Cleveland area, and I'm 

00:57:46.177 --> 00:57:49.013
a judge with Cuyahoga County 
common pleas court.  I ran as a 

00:57:49.014 --> 00:57:54.356
veteran and I'm presently the 
only veteran on our bench.  In 

00:57:54.357 --> 00:57:56.433
the Vietnam War after my college
graduation, I joined the Marine 

00:57:56.434 --> 00:57:59.152
Corps and was a first  
lieutenant, commanding 

00:58:02.453 --> 00:58:04.453
a company, and a second 
lieutenant commanding a platoon.

00:58:05.988 --> 00:58:08.052
Came back, went to law school, 
married the love of my life who 

00:58:08.053 --> 00:58:12.169
is here today.  And practiced 
law and decided I wanted to be a

00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:14.603
judge at the end of my career 
and I wanted to start a veterans

00:58:15.015 --> 00:58:19.923
treatment court.  Three years 
ago we had one veteran and now 

00:58:19.924 --> 00:58:21.924
we have over 100 veterans in my 
court.

00:58:23.178 --> 00:58:25.178
We started a jail pod connecting
our 

00:58:26.906 --> 00:58:28.906
veterans court with those in the
county 

00:58:29.957 --> 00:58:31.788
jail and look forward to 
exchanging some of those views 

00:58:31.789 --> 00:58:33.789
this afternoon.

00:58:36.746 --> 00:58:39.590
&gt;&gt; MALIK MUHAMMAD:  I'm Malik 
Muhammad from Orange County 

00:58:39.591 --> 00:58:43.760
Florida.  I am retired military.
I retired in January of this 

00:58:43.761 --> 00:58:48.034
year.  The first six years of my
military career was spent on 

00:58:48.035 --> 00:58:50.035
active duty and the 

00:58:52.337 --> 00:58:54.337
remainder was as a reservist out
of Orlando, Florida.

00:58:57.376 --> 00:59:01.160
I bring you greetings from 
Orange County corrections 

00:59:01.161 --> 00:59:03.161
department.

00:59:05.293 --> 00:59:07.293
&gt;&gt; RON PEREZ:  I'm Ron Perez.  I
too was drafted.

00:59:10.801 --> 00:59:13.482
I'm a Vietnam veteran, drafted 
shortly after high school, 

00:59:13.483 --> 00:59:15.483
served in Vietnam 

00:59:18.788 --> 00:59:20.788
from August 1st of 1967 to 
August of 1968.

00:59:22.861 --> 00:59:25.151
1975 I went into the San 
Francisco county jail and have 

00:59:25.152 --> 00:59:29.250
been there ever since, working 
for the sheriff's department in 

00:59:29.251 --> 00:59:31.251
their prison services division, 
developing and creating 

00:59:31.528 --> 00:59:34.410
programs.  I retired from the 
sheriff's 

00:59:37.548 --> 00:59:38.787
department approximately 2008, 
shortly thereafter they 

00:59:38.788 --> 00:59:41.084
contacted me and said, Ron, 
remember that veterans program 

00:59:41.085 --> 00:59:47.399
you said we should always start?
Well, we're going to do it.  So 

00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:50.048
I came back on a consulting 
basis and the development and 

00:59:50.049 --> 00:59:53.342
implementation of the program.  
We started our program in 2010.

00:59:58.691 --> 01:00:00.540
2013, because we had showed we 
had a significant population, 

01:00:00.541 --> 01:00:02.541
the veterans 

01:00:04.599 --> 01:00:07.242
court started, our program is 
called COVER.  COVER stands for 

01:00:07.243 --> 01:00:09.334
community of veterans engaged 
and restoration.

01:00:14.469 --> 01:00:16.469
That name was the idea or brain 
child 

01:00:21.611 --> 01:00:23.650
of our veterans service officer,
our sheriff at that time, loved 

01:00:23.651 --> 01:00:31.437
having programs like sheriff's 
work alternative.  He loved 

01:00:31.438 --> 01:00:33.438
restored justice.

01:00:34.734 --> 01:00:37.180
When he heard community of 
veterans engaged in  

01:00:37.181 --> 01:00:39.858
restoration, he loved it.  Part 
of the reason it was called 

01:00:41.926 --> 01:00:44.797
COVER, the officer from the 
veterans service office was a 

01:00:44.798 --> 01:00:46.798
retired Air Force military and 
you all know, if you were 

01:00:49.487 --> 01:00:51.723
in the military, you can't leave
your bullets without  bullet.

01:00:55.992 --> 01:00:59.678
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  Good so you 
haveTo have you all here.  

01:00:59.679 --> 01:01:00.294
Anybody here not familiar with 
all the corrections system 

01:01:00.295 --> 01:01:03.783
works?  Good.  We don't have to 
waste a lot of time.

01:01:07.442 --> 01:01:10.338
My wife worked at the New York 
Times dubbed the most violence 

01:01:10.339 --> 01:01:13.815
place for offenders in the free 
world.  I was really happy when 

01:01:13.816 --> 01:01:16.868
she trotted out to work every 
day.  It was an absolutely 

01:01:16.869 --> 01:01:18.869
horrible place.

01:01:20.336 --> 01:01:22.782
Very well run and emac collate. 
You would think it was a mall 

01:01:22.783 --> 01:01:24.783
when you drove by it.

01:01:26.882 --> 01:01:28.343
But there were movements done 
from certain sections of 

01:01:28.344 --> 01:01:30.344
populations.

01:01:31.624 --> 01:01:33.662
They literally had to separate 
the populations for fear of 

01:01:33.663 --> 01:01:36.540
violence.  They were all high 
risk.

01:01:41.602 --> 01:01:43.602
Anybody

01:01:47.587 --> 01:01:49.811
So when they go into prison, 
veterans, you would think it 

01:01:49.812 --> 01:01:52.501
would be a no-brainer to 
segregate that population, 

01:01:52.502 --> 01:01:54.502
perhaps.

01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:59.857
But why would they?  What about 
the veterans population that 

01:01:59.858 --> 01:02:03.990
needs segregated?  That's put it
to the panel.  Why is it a good 

01:02:03.991 --> 01:02:05.991
idea to separate 

01:02:07.523 --> 01:02:09.963
veterans that find themselves 
incarcerated?  Is there 

01:02:09.964 --> 01:02:13.056
something productive that will 
come from that?  Is there a 

01:02:13.057 --> 01:02:15.927
chance you'll put them on the 
path?  What is the reason for 

01:02:15.928 --> 01:02:17.928
that separation?  Anybody, 
please?

01:02:19.795 --> 01:02:22.234
&gt;&gt;  I think the basic reason for
doing that is there's something 

01:02:22.235 --> 01:02:27.165
about being a veteran that's 
different and separate from 

01:02:27.166 --> 01:02:29.601
those who have not served.  To 
place veterans together you're 

01:02:31.636 --> 01:02:33.305
recreating a shared military 
experience.  From my experience 

01:02:33.306 --> 01:02:35.951
it doesn't matter if the person 
was in combat or not, 

01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:41.260
served early or served late, but
that 

01:02:44.575 --> 01:02:46.575
shared military experience other
veterans understand.

01:02:47.625 --> 01:02:49.625
The veterans in our county jail 
say the 

01:02:50.695 --> 01:02:51.104
same thing that all of the 
veterans in the publication that

01:02:51.105 --> 01:02:53.105
you'll have the 

01:02:55.595 --> 01:02:57.850
opportunity to read say in other
jails throughout the country, is

01:02:57.851 --> 01:03:02.356
that it's safer.  It's quieter. 
It's more peaceful.  They don't 

01:03:02.357 --> 01:03:05.016
fight.  If they do, they solve 
it themselves.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.340
And they respect each other in a
way that because they've all 

01:03:11.341 --> 01:03:16.473
served.  They may not like each 
other, but they do respect each 

01:03:16.474 --> 01:03:18.474
other because of that service.

01:03:20.604 --> 01:03:22.604
And they end up helping each 
other in that regard.

01:03:25.508 --> 01:03:28.151
For those who have drug 
addictions or mental health 

01:03:28.152 --> 01:03:31.038
addictions or issues, 
particularly PTSD, being in a 

01:03:31.039 --> 01:03:36.750
quiet safe place even if you 
have to be there in jail is much

01:03:36.751 --> 01:03:38.789
better than the general 
population.

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:43.375
&gt;&gt;  So I went on a few site 
visita for this publication and 

01:03:43.376 --> 01:03:46.647
I want to add to what you said, 
judge.  Another really good 

01:03:46.648 --> 01:03:48.648
thing for this the efficiency of
it.

01:03:52.589 --> 01:03:54.606
One of the folks that mentioned 
in Seattle was the fact that the

01:03:54.607 --> 01:04:00.207
VA could come in, in one spot, 
people could come into one spot 

01:04:00.208 --> 01:04:01.628
and talk to people, rather than 
bounce around to different parts

01:04:01.629 --> 01:04:04.721
of the correctional facility.  
So I think efficiency this 

01:04:04.722 --> 01:04:08.413
having those resources all in 
one spot makes a lot of sense.

01:04:08.818 --> 01:04:13.899
&gt;&gt;  It also helps your outside 
agencies, also, and makes it 

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:15.986
easy for them because they know 
they just have to visit one 

01:04:18.237 --> 01:04:20.237
facility and they know they can 
call and 

01:04:21.371 --> 01:04:24.262
check to make sure when they're 
coming up to do the intake on 

01:04:24.263 --> 01:04:26.942
the veteran that the veteran is 
there and not moved somewhere 

01:04:26.943 --> 01:04:28.385
else.
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  Have you 

01:04:28.386 --> 01:04:30.386
spent a lot 

01:04:31.462 --> 01:04:33.462
of time with the inmates in this
population?

01:04:35.783 --> 01:04:36.393
Do you get the sense there 
should have been some sort of 

01:04:36.394 --> 01:04:38.394
intervention?

01:04:40.266 --> 01:04:41.919
What I found with those who came
back with PTSD, a lot of times 

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.920
they just needed a friend.

01:04:46.076 --> 01:04:48.336
A lot of times they feel 
isolated and lost and nobody in 

01:04:48.337 --> 01:04:51.998
their family understands that 
language they learned overseas 

01:04:51.999 --> 01:04:54.079
so they just shut down.  Is that
what you find.

01:04:56.948 --> 01:04:58.948
&gt;&gt;  We still have a significant 

01:05:03.453 --> 01:05:06.122
population of Vietnam  veterans 
in our jail, and they say, this 

01:05:06.123 --> 01:05:08.159
is what I needed when I came 
home from Vietnam.

01:05:12.227 --> 01:05:14.500
If I had this, I would not have 
spent so much time in the 

01:05:14.501 --> 01:05:17.786
criminal justice system.
&gt;&gt; MALIK MUHAMMAD:  I've heard 

01:05:17.787 --> 01:05:22.160
similar things.  If these 
programs were there when I got 

01:05:22.161 --> 01:05:24.207
out, maybe just maybe I wouldn't
have ended up in the criminal 

01:05:24.208 --> 01:05:27.127
justice system.
One of the things the military 

01:05:27.128 --> 01:05:31.431
taught us is comradedy.  You 
place these guys in one 

01:05:31.432 --> 01:05:34.116
dedicated housing unit, you 
start that treatment process for

01:05:34.117 --> 01:05:35.142
recovery.
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  Let's talk 

01:05:35.143 --> 01:05:39.226
about resources.  Everyone is so
keenly aware that things cost 

01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:41.227
money.

01:05:42.306 --> 01:05:43.553
I know the Middlesex sheriff was
talking about things they've 

01:05:43.554 --> 01:05:48.703
done.  This is just redirecting 
as opposed to trying to acquire 

01:05:48.704 --> 01:05:51.979
more money or a budget to put 
something together.  This isn't 

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:56.252
something that could be cost 
prohibitive?

01:05:59.391 --> 01:06:01.391
&gt;&gt; RON PEREZ:  For us in San 
Francisco 

01:06:04.612 --> 01:06:06.612
we're extremely lucky because we
have 

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:10.977
sheriffs that have focused on 
this and we're able to tap into 

01:06:10.978 --> 01:06:12.978
already developed 

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:16.250
programs and develop it for our 
veterans.

01:06:17.313 --> 01:06:19.752
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  If you can 
do it in San Francisco for 

01:06:19.753 --> 01:06:22.402
veterans, you can do this 
anywhere.

01:06:22.606 --> 01:06:24.618
&gt;&gt; RON PEREZ:  That's correct.
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  So maybe you

01:06:24.619 --> 01:06:26.619
can 

01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:30.370
talk to some folks and redirect 
assets 

01:06:33.853 --> 01:06:35.853
without putting more money on 
the budget

01:06:37.513 --> 01:06:39.513
da

01:06:42.523 --> 01:06:43.942
more budgetary line?
&gt;&gt; MALIK MUHAMMAD:  We did the 

01:06:43.943 --> 01:06:45.943
same 

01:06:47.008 --> 01:06:48.838
thing down in Orange County.  
You can do this without spending

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:52.088
a lot of money.
&gt;&gt;  The first thing you need to 

01:06:52.089 --> 01:06:54.089
do is find out your population.

01:06:58.103 --> 01:06:59.785
Find out how many people you 
have in custody.  Data will 

01:06:59.786 --> 01:07:02.027
drive a lot of decisions.
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  Judge, you 

01:07:02.028 --> 01:07:05.878
find that to be a good tool?
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL JACKSON:  I'm a 

01:07:05.879 --> 01:07:09.369
veteran.  The sheriff is a  
veteran.  The deputy sheriff in 

01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:11.370
charge of this is a veteran.

01:07:13.906 --> 01:07:16.779
We both came to this idea at the
same time.  We started this 

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:18.780
within 60 days after our first 
meeting.

01:07:22.147 --> 01:07:24.147
It's justing organizing the 
jail.

01:07:28.053 --> 01:07:28.664
And finding a spot that's 
suitable in the confinement 

01:07:28.665 --> 01:07:30.665
facility.

01:07:32.348 --> 01:07:34.348
Training your guards to deal 
with veterans  differently.

01:07:37.056 --> 01:07:37.719
Many who were veterans wanted to
participant in this project in 

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:41.395
the county jail, because they 
were veterans.  Some were upset 

01:07:41.396 --> 01:07:43.931
because they were doing that, 
but by and large most of the 

01:07:45.827 --> 01:07:47.827
veterans wanted to be involved 
because 

01:07:49.548 --> 01:07:51.548
they sensed that these veterans 
with 

01:07:53.613 --> 01:07:55.613
some help would be taking the 
first steps toward recovery.

01:07:55.893 --> 01:07:57.893
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  We'll talk 
in a 

01:07:58.971 --> 01:08:01.643
second about the pitfalls you 
might run into.  Maybe somebody 

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:03.644
is watching live out 

01:08:06.099 --> 01:08:10.079
there with a jurisdiction and 
they're thinking about it but 

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.080
haven't done it.
But are they different?

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.581
You have some folks who are life
long criminals and these people 

01:08:15.582 --> 01:08:19.846
aren't going to be fixed or 
cured of anything.  But when 

01:08:19.847 --> 01:08:21.847
veterans come in, do you get 

01:08:23.578 --> 01:08:25.814
the sense they just made a 
mistake or take a bad decision?

01:08:29.483 --> 01:08:31.483
Can they get put back on the 
path quickly?

01:08:34.835 --> 01:08:37.025
&gt;&gt;  Veterans, because of the 
facts that your jails and  

01:08:37.026 --> 01:08:39.664
prisons operate 
semi-militaristic with 

01:08:39.665 --> 01:08:41.665
inspections, with 

01:08:43.585 --> 01:08:45.234
line-ups, et cetera, with work 
detail.

01:08:45.235 --> 01:08:47.235
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  Structure.
&gt;&gt;  Structure.  Exactly.

01:08:50.379 --> 01:08:51.605
So veterans coming into the jail
system can fit very easily into 

01:08:51.606 --> 01:08:56.548
that system.  A lot of times, 
what we've done before we 

01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:58.817
started our veterans programs, 
the best workers in the jails 

01:08:58.818 --> 01:09:01.275
that were identified were often 
veterans.

01:09:04.334 --> 01:09:06.005
And veterans that would come 
back into jail, oh, there's 

01:09:06.006 --> 01:09:08.006
Gunny.

01:09:09.299 --> 01:09:11.353
He's going to run the kitchen.
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  So they feel

01:09:11.354 --> 01:09:14.806
like they're plugged in and have
a purpose.

01:09:15.022 --> 01:09:17.022
&gt;&gt; RON PEREZ:  Yep.  They have 
structure.

01:09:20.398 --> 01:09:22.398
Go off to your work detail, come
back, 

01:09:25.239 --> 01:09:27.239
here is your phone call time, 
your male

01:09:29.007 --> 01:09:31.686
meal time, sleep time.
It's much easier than the 

01:09:31.687 --> 01:09:34.135
outside where they lost that 
structure and lost that 

01:09:35.176 --> 01:09:37.876
comradery.
&gt;&gt;  So reminding them of the 

01:09:37.877 --> 01:09:40.950
confidence they once had, I 
think that's an important point 

01:09:40.951 --> 01:09:45.879
that this type of programming 
does for veterans.  It gets 

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:49.975
their sense of purpose back.  I 
think that's what it does.  It 

01:09:49.976 --> 01:09:51.976
gets their confidence going.

01:09:53.875 --> 01:09:55.895
&gt;&gt;  It kind of reacclimates them
back to that military life 

01:09:55.896 --> 01:09:58.755
because that jails and prisons 
are paramilitary organization.

01:10:03.059 --> 01:10:04.688
It reacclimates them back to 
what they were once comfortable 

01:10:04.689 --> 01:10:07.543
to.
It gives them a sense of pride 

01:10:07.544 --> 01:10:12.421
and leadership again, and also 
you have that belongingness that

01:10:12.422 --> 01:10:14.251
they oftentimes seek.
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  Any time we 

01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:18.760
send somebody into prison is 
hope is that justice will be 

01:10:18.761 --> 01:10:20.176
served and they'll learn their 
lesson and come back into 

01:10:20.177 --> 01:10:22.622
society.  Do you get a sense 
from veterans when 

01:10:25.706 --> 01:10:27.706
they do make bad decisions and 
get 

01:10:28.797 --> 01:10:30.797
themselves incarcerated, that 
they are 

01:10:33.434 --> 01:10:35.434
able to that ac column mate to 
public life by learning 

01:10:36.803 --> 01:10:39.464
something in prison?  Are they 
successful candidates after 

01:10:39.465 --> 01:10:41.525
prison?  I don't know.  I'm 
asking you.

01:10:44.177 --> 01:10:46.846
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL JACKSON:  Well, in 

01:10:46.847 --> 01:10:48.847
many 

01:10:50.952 --> 01:10:53.412
prisons, especially in Ohio and 
I think pretty much nationwide, 

01:10:53.413 --> 01:10:55.413
they've been 

01:10:56.667 --> 01:10:58.733
permitted to set up very similar
operations as we're talking 

01:10:58.734 --> 01:11:02.424
about with veterans in the 
county jail.  If you go to a 

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:04.425
number of prisons in 

01:11:05.712 --> 01:11:07.712
Ohio, you'll see veterans pods 
there.

01:11:09.384 --> 01:11:11.384
Some of them are even working 
toward 

01:11:12.645 --> 01:11:13.287
doing productive businesses 
while in prison.  That's 

01:11:13.288 --> 01:11:16.987
authorized.  And they have their
own discipline group among 

01:11:16.988 --> 01:11:18.988
themselves.

01:11:20.665 --> 01:11:22.900
And they are transitioning to 
the community by having people 

01:11:22.901 --> 01:11:25.776
come in.  In fact, one of the 
veterans service 

01:11:30.789 --> 01:11:33.630
organizations, the AMVETS, even 
have chapters of -- they're like

01:11:33.631 --> 01:11:35.631
American legion, VFW, in 
prisons.

01:11:38.136 --> 01:11:40.136
So they're members of a veterans
organization.

01:11:41.848 --> 01:11:43.488
It's not as if it doesn't go on 
there.  Hopefully when they 

01:11:43.489 --> 01:11:45.489
transition out, 

01:11:46.745 --> 01:11:48.373
they'll have that foundation 
that we can recreate and live 

01:11:48.374 --> 01:11:50.374
productive and law-abiding 
lives.

01:11:53.288 --> 01:11:55.113
The connection in the jails also
is worthy of note when you 

01:11:55.114 --> 01:11:57.971
connect with a veterans 
treatment court.  So I will get 

01:11:57.972 --> 01:12:00.826
those people from the veterans 
pod in the jail, put them in a 

01:12:03.289 --> 01:12:05.571
veterans treatment court 
program, where they have four 

01:12:05.572 --> 01:12:08.480
stages they have to go through. 
When they graduate, they have 

01:12:08.481 --> 01:12:10.481
the 

01:12:12.382 --> 01:12:13.599
ability, we hope, so be 
self-sustaining.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.676
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  What kinds 
of mistakes are some of these 

01:12:15.677 --> 01:12:19.767
veterans making when they come 
back and they decide to make bad

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:23.916
decisions and find themselves 
incarcerated?  We have the court

01:12:23.917 --> 01:12:25.956
system that was set up which 
tries to intervene and get in 

01:12:28.814 --> 01:12:30.814
between some of those veterans 
coming 

01:12:32.099 --> 01:12:33.935
back that made minor infractions
in the world of criminal justice

01:12:33.936 --> 01:12:38.828
system, but some of these are 
very serious charges that they 

01:12:38.829 --> 01:12:41.537
may not see the light of day.
&gt;&gt; RON PEREZ:  Sometimes it's as

01:12:41.538 --> 01:12:43.538
simple 

01:12:45.223 --> 01:12:47.069
as not being in compliance with 
their medication.  We had an 

01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:49.070
individual that came into 

01:12:53.633 --> 01:12:55.633
our system, was a captain, a 
scholar, a West point graduate.

01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:00.193
When he got out of the military,
he got himself a little plot of 

01:13:00.194 --> 01:13:02.194
land in 

01:13:04.696 --> 01:13:05.736
Alaska that butted up against 
the forest, and everything was 

01:13:05.737 --> 01:13:07.737
fine except 

01:13:09.397 --> 01:13:12.273
when he came back to visit 
family in the Bay area.  He got 

01:13:12.274 --> 01:13:14.274
himself into a situation where 
he should have been dealt with 

01:13:15.554 --> 01:13:17.592
psychiatrickically, but instead 
wound up being jailed.  He came 

01:13:17.593 --> 01:13:19.593
to our attention.

01:13:21.289 --> 01:13:23.569
We weren't able to get him into 
COVER because of his psychiatric

01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:28.682
issues, but we were able to get 
him into veterans court, get him

01:13:28.683 --> 01:13:31.148
stabilized, and it was 
determined through veterans 

01:13:31.149 --> 01:13:35.028
court the best thing to do would
be to get him back into this 

01:13:35.029 --> 01:13:37.202
community, back into Alaska 
where he had veterans services 

01:13:37.812 --> 01:13:39.812
already in  place.
We were able to do that.

01:13:42.730 --> 01:13:44.730
We had one of our veterans court

01:13:45.986 --> 01:13:47.986
mentors fly back to Alaska with 
him.

01:13:49.063 --> 01:13:51.063
His veterans court status has 
been 

01:13:52.082 --> 01:13:54.082
strains

01:13:55.444 --> 01:13:57.686
veteran transitioned to Alaska. 
He's still having difficulties, 

01:13:57.687 --> 01:14:02.827
but that was the best place for 
him.  He should have never been 

01:14:02.828 --> 01:14:04.864
in the criminal justice system. 
He should have been in the 

01:14:04.865 --> 01:14:06.865
mental health system.

01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:11.026
But because of having COVER and 
having veterans court, he's not 

01:14:11.027 --> 01:14:14.236
perfect, but he's stable and 
living day-to-day.

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:17.540
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  Sheriff, 
some of your examples?

01:14:17.996 --> 01:14:19.818
&gt;&gt; MALIK MUHAMMAD:  Just like 
the technical violations he 

01:14:19.819 --> 01:14:21.819
mentioned, 

01:14:24.935 --> 01:14:27.985
sometimes I've seen them come 
back for self-medicating.  

01:14:27.986 --> 01:14:29.986
Sometimes when times get toughed
when 

01:14:31.051 --> 01:14:33.085
they're released, they tend to 
self-medicate and find 

01:14:33.086 --> 01:14:35.086
themselves back in custody for 
something as minor as, 

01:14:38.585 --> 01:14:42.108
let's say, failing a drug test.
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL JACKSON:  I think all

01:14:42.109 --> 01:14:44.109
those 

01:14:46.026 --> 01:14:46.638
involved with helping veterans 
while in jail all recognize that

01:14:46.639 --> 01:14:49.331
there are a number of veterans 
who draw some pretty serious 

01:14:49.332 --> 01:14:54.426
charges.  One of the things we 
have to distinguish is holding 

01:14:54.427 --> 01:14:56.884
those -- that individual, 
veteran or not, to be 

01:14:57.766 --> 01:15:00.424
accountable for their conduct.
The part that comes into play 

01:15:00.425 --> 01:15:05.537
that's effective for veterans is
that, to the extent we can, we 

01:15:05.538 --> 01:15:09.428
couple that with a treatment 
situation.  So I just had a case

01:15:09.429 --> 01:15:11.429
a couple weeks 

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:15.100
ago where a veteran had a flash 
back.

01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:20.170
He was a combat veteran, Iraq, 
had a flashback.

01:15:23.405 --> 01:15:25.435
Three police officers were 
injured.  None life threatening 

01:15:25.436 --> 01:15:27.436
to my knowledge.

01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:30.151
The three officers were given 
the opportunity at sentencing to

01:15:30.152 --> 01:15:33.637
say what they wanted to happen 
to this individual.  One said 

01:15:33.638 --> 01:15:37.160
prison.  One said, judge, it's 
up to you.  The other said most 

01:15:37.161 --> 01:15:39.161
definitely probation.

01:15:41.259 --> 01:15:43.259
The person who said probation 
was a combat veteran.

01:15:44.537 --> 01:15:46.537
And he understood what was going
on with 

01:15:47.784 --> 01:15:49.784
that veteran with regard to a 
flashback.

01:15:52.894 --> 01:15:54.359
And so as a treatment court 
judge, I have to make that 

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.360
decision with regard to being 
accountable for that conduct, 

01:16:01.416 --> 01:16:03.046
which was serious, but also make
him available to the services 

01:16:03.047 --> 01:16:05.737
that I think would help him.
In his situation, he's going to 

01:16:05.738 --> 01:16:10.019
be confined for up to nine 
months, maybe a little bit less 

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:13.963
if he does well, but he's going 
to be in the veterans treatment 

01:16:13.964 --> 01:16:16.860
court and in the veterans pod 
and he's going to have access to

01:16:16.861 --> 01:16:18.925
some treatment during this 
process.

01:16:19.737 --> 01:16:22.201
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  One of the 
biggest issues, especially with 

01:16:22.202 --> 01:16:24.202
those veterans 

01:16:25.294 --> 01:16:28.198
comes back in PTSD, is domestic 
violence.  The numbers are just 

01:16:28.199 --> 01:16:30.914
astronomical.  It goes back to 
the language I was discussing 

01:16:30.915 --> 01:16:33.803
earlier about the language of 
war, when you come back, you 

01:16:33.804 --> 01:16:36.651
don't speak the same language.  
The language in a relationship 

01:16:36.652 --> 01:16:41.325
is much different.  There's an 
intimacy of a relationship of 

01:16:41.326 --> 01:16:43.326
understanding another person.  
But those who have seen combat, 

01:16:45.706 --> 01:16:48.152
especially, and been affected by
war in such a meaningful way, 

01:16:48.153 --> 01:16:50.626
that shuts down in them.  
Breaking through those 

01:16:50.627 --> 01:16:52.627
communication 

01:16:53.883 --> 01:16:55.883
lines, this is one of those 
opportunities.

01:16:57.348 --> 01:16:58.389
Unfortunately, it comes in 
prison, which is what we're 

01:16:58.390 --> 01:17:01.636
talking about, in that setting. 
I think it breaks everybody's 

01:17:01.637 --> 01:17:03.637
heart 

01:17:05.101 --> 01:17:06.510
hearing the fact that they have 
to go to prison to find a 

01:17:06.511 --> 01:17:08.511
support group that ultimately 
will help them on the road to 

01:17:10.416 --> 01:17:12.416
recovery.  Is that right?
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL JACKSON:  Absolutely.

01:17:16.641 --> 01:17:20.322
I talked to all 22 people in our
jail before I came out here.  

01:17:20.323 --> 01:17:22.550
All of them said essentially the
same thing that's in our 

01:17:22.551 --> 01:17:27.886
publication, they use this as a 
support group among themselves. 

01:17:27.887 --> 01:17:29.887
They really are helping 
themselves.

01:17:32.610 --> 01:17:34.528
One of them told me, you know, 
judge, a couple people were bad 

01:17:34.529 --> 01:17:37.375
rapping you.  One of them, he 
said, he didn't think 

01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:42.278
the punishment was right, and 
the other vet said, well, you 

01:17:42.279 --> 01:17:47.373
have four positive tests for 
drug use.  What did you expect? 

01:17:47.374 --> 01:17:49.621
So they can have that 
conversation.  And they can talk

01:17:49.622 --> 01:17:51.858
it out.  And whether it's right 
or wrong or 

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:57.015
whether my punishment was too 
hard or too lean, they have an 

01:17:57.016 --> 01:17:59.016
avenue of talking 

01:18:00.942 --> 01:18:03.590
it out among thens and they can 
hear other sides.  That doesn't 

01:18:03.591 --> 01:18:05.036
generally go on in the 
population, as I think many of 

01:18:05.037 --> 01:18:07.877
the sheriffs could attest better
than I.

01:18:08.932 --> 01:18:11.045
&gt;&gt; RON PEREZ:  I just wanted to 
add.  You touched on domestic 

01:18:11.046 --> 01:18:13.046
violence.

01:18:15.109 --> 01:18:16.750
Our program, we have a component
that the sheriff's department 

01:18:16.751 --> 01:18:18.751
had this 

01:18:20.806 --> 01:18:22.806
component quite some time ago, 
"resolve 

01:18:25.146 --> 01:18:27.146
to stop the violence" 
anti-domestic violence program.

01:18:28.622 --> 01:18:30.622
It's been adapted actually by 
the DA 

01:18:31.899 --> 01:18:33.574
and is being provided in San 
Francisco to veterans and on the

01:18:33.575 --> 01:18:38.510
outside it's called at Ease.  We
have a component in our COVER 

01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:40.709
program.

01:18:41.777 --> 01:18:43.777
We call it Stand Down but it 
talks and 

01:18:48.789 --> 01:18:50.430
deals with the man worldly 
belief system and violence and 

01:18:50.431 --> 01:18:53.963
addressing that but it's geared 
towards veterans.  I believe 

01:18:53.964 --> 01:18:55.995
it's probably the first one in 
the country to be started 

01:18:58.451 --> 01:19:00.451
specifically for veterans 
dealing with domestic  violence.

01:19:00.705 --> 01:19:02.381
Again, that's something that the
VA, up until this point, has not

01:19:02.382 --> 01:19:04.382
been looking at.

01:19:08.716 --> 01:19:12.859
&gt;&gt;  It strikes me that we feel 
so good when folks come back 

01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:14.860
from a tour of 

01:19:16.365 --> 01:19:18.365
duty, whether it's Iraq, 
Afghanistan, 

01:19:19.635 --> 01:19:21.693
Vietnam, greeted by their 
family.  It's supposed to be 

01:19:21.694 --> 01:19:25.164
wonderful.  At least it is in 
the opinion or the eyes of 

01:19:25.165 --> 01:19:27.846
people who see that.  There are 
an awful lot of guys who come 

01:19:27.847 --> 01:19:32.969
back.  They ain't got no family.
The family is dysfunctional.  

01:19:32.970 --> 01:19:34.970
They've been  dysfunctional for 
years.

01:19:36.242 --> 01:19:38.242
The family were the brothers and

01:19:39.815 --> 01:19:41.815
sisters they had in a combat 
situation.

01:19:44.128 --> 01:19:45.337
All of a sudden, they find 
themselves without a support 

01:19:45.338 --> 01:19:47.381
group.  They start drinking or 
drugging.

01:19:52.296 --> 01:19:54.296
I know of one guy who was a crew
chief 

01:19:58.028 --> 01:20:00.028
on a Medacac, medical evacuation

01:20:01.043 --> 01:20:03.043
helicopter

01:20:05.836 --> 01:20:06.853
.  He would slosh through blood 
every day when he was in the 

01:20:06.854 --> 01:20:08.854
air.  He came back.

01:20:11.771 --> 01:20:13.771
Got married.  Couldn't talk to 
his wife.

01:20:16.959 --> 01:20:18.959
For ten years, he drank himself 
into oblivion every night.

01:20:20.668 --> 01:20:22.553
He started having flashbacks on 
the way to work when he got a 

01:20:22.554 --> 01:20:26.635
different job.  His life is all 
messed up.  Nobody told him he 

01:20:26.636 --> 01:20:29.522
had anything wrong with him.  He
knew something was the matter, 

01:20:29.523 --> 01:20:33.013
but he didn't know what it was. 
It took him a long time before 

01:20:33.014 --> 01:20:37.908
there was an intervention and he
started getting help that he 

01:20:37.909 --> 01:20:40.565
needed.  A lot of that is 
through the vet 

01:20:43.641 --> 01:20:45.068
centers, which is one of the 
most successful operations of 

01:20:45.069 --> 01:20:47.069
the VA.

01:20:48.576 --> 01:20:51.040
We often had to fight with the 
VA to keep them.

01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:54.260
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  So talking 
about, I 

01:20:55.345 --> 01:20:57.155
wish there was some way to 
improve from active duty to the 

01:20:57.156 --> 01:21:01.038
VA services.  There was a gap.  
I hate sometimes as a first 

01:21:02.859 --> 01:21:04.915
opportunity to intervene in 
someone's life is involvement in

01:21:04.916 --> 01:21:10.055
the justice system.  One of the 
things, this publication focuses

01:21:10.056 --> 01:21:12.056
on housing for local jails.

01:21:14.481 --> 01:21:16.481
If you think about the continuum
of this, I think what's really 

01:21:20.082 --> 01:21:21.955
important, even though this 
publication focuses on housing  

01:21:21.956 --> 01:21:23.956
units, it also 

01:21:25.223 --> 01:21:26.873
promoting collaboration among 
entities within the criminal 

01:21:26.874 --> 01:21:28.948
justice system.
I think it's important to think 

01:21:28.949 --> 01:21:33.852
about as people are considering 
implementing these programs is 

01:21:33.853 --> 01:21:35.853
partners with other parts of the
criminal justice system.

01:21:38.953 --> 01:21:41.619
You cannot only share resources 
but also improve outcomes.  If 

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:43.235
law enforcement is talking to 
the vet court, and that's 

01:21:43.236 --> 01:21:45.236
something I've 

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.951
seen on the newest project the 
working on around law 

01:21:48.952 --> 01:21:53.694
enforcement officers responding 
to veterans in crisis.  We're 

01:21:53.695 --> 01:21:55.348
seeing a detective assigned to a
vet court.  There's this link 

01:21:55.349 --> 01:22:00.033
between the housing unit, the 
vet court, and the community.  I

01:22:00.034 --> 01:22:02.709
think judge Jackson has done a 
good job of communicating 

01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:05.583
between the local jail and the 
vet court and he's instrumental 

01:22:05.584 --> 01:22:07.433
to set that up.  I think that's 
something important to think 

01:22:07.434 --> 01:22:09.434
about.

01:22:11.161 --> 01:22:12.585
Not just focus on your own piece
but branching out and 

01:22:12.586 --> 01:22:14.586
communicating within your 
system.

01:22:15.031 --> 01:22:17.031
&gt;&gt;  I think most who will hear 
this will 

01:22:19.923 --> 01:22:22.773
say it's a great idea and a 
no-brainer.  But why wouldn't 

01:22:22.774 --> 01:22:24.774
every correctional 

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.728
house, whether a small 
jurisdiction or a big unit, why 

01:22:29.729 --> 01:22:31.984
not institute this kind of 
program and not do it right 

01:22:31.985 --> 01:22:34.437
away?
&gt;&gt; MALIK MUHAMMAD:  I can't 

01:22:34.438 --> 01:22:38.457
think of a reason why they 
wouldn't.  But I can answer as a

01:22:38.458 --> 01:22:40.458
start-up.

01:22:42.784 --> 01:22:44.784
The hardest part is the initial 
buy-in.

01:22:48.583 --> 01:22:50.420
Once you get those accomplished 
or over those hurdles, it's 

01:22:50.421 --> 01:22:52.421
easier.

01:22:54.797 --> 01:22:56.018
But I can't think of a reason 
why we wouldn't look at helping 

01:22:56.019 --> 01:23:00.324
veterans.  I say that not just 
because I'm a veteran but at 

01:23:00.325 --> 01:23:03.034
some point those men and women 
in the units, they wore a 

01:23:03.035 --> 01:23:05.068
uniform and they decided at some
point they were 

01:23:08.176 --> 01:23:10.214
going to protect us and I think 
for that we owe them.

01:23:10.624 --> 01:23:14.127
&gt;&gt;  Great point.  If you're 
running a vet court or a housing

01:23:14.128 --> 01:23:17.375
unit, it's really important that
you track data.  That you 

01:23:17.376 --> 01:23:19.376
justify why this programming is 
so important.

01:23:22.133 --> 01:23:24.767
We all know anecdotally these 
programs work and they're 

01:23:24.768 --> 01:23:26.768
effectively and they 

01:23:28.242 --> 01:23:30.242
reduce recidivism.

01:23:32.777 --> 01:23:34.798
rebut if you're listening out 
there, keep track of that data 

01:23:34.799 --> 01:23:36.461
so we can keep building?
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  How well 

01:23:36.462 --> 01:23:38.462
would 

01:23:39.555 --> 01:23:41.801
veterans do, let's say this 
program didn't exist, nobody was

01:23:41.802 --> 01:23:43.802
instituting it, 

01:23:45.314 --> 01:23:47.801
instituting stuck a veteran with
a minor infraction in a general 

01:23:47.802 --> 01:23:49.944
population unit, what happens to
them?

01:23:54.239 --> 01:23:57.543
&gt;&gt;  From what I've read and 
discussed in interviews, they 

01:23:57.544 --> 01:24:00.429
get in general population and 
they don't do well.  There's no 

01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:02.430
support system there.  They 
don't want to fight with guys, 

01:24:04.086 --> 01:24:05.966
but other guys want to fight 
with them.  You need to have 

01:24:05.967 --> 01:24:07.967
something where you 

01:24:09.052 --> 01:24:12.715
can depend on upon.  So you can 
watch his six and he can watch 

01:24:12.716 --> 01:24:14.716
your six.

01:24:15.768 --> 01:24:17.768
That doesn't happen in general 
population.

01:24:17.801 --> 01:24:18.825
&gt;&gt; RON PEREZ:  If they come into
general population and they 

01:24:18.826 --> 01:24:20.861
don't receive any services, 
they're going to leave without 

01:24:22.536 --> 01:24:23.963
any services and without any 
direction and they're probably 

01:24:23.964 --> 01:24:27.023
going to be back very, very 
shortly.  Where at least with a 

01:24:27.024 --> 01:24:31.318
program such as this, you're at 
least making them aware what 

01:24:31.319 --> 01:24:33.785
services are available.  You're 
making them aware of what 

01:24:35.427 --> 01:24:37.427
benefits they're eligible for, 
because a 

01:24:39.284 --> 01:24:41.544
lot of times you'll find that 
the veteran doesn't realize he's

01:24:41.545 --> 01:24:45.649
eligible for any benefits, 
especially if they have less 

01:24:45.650 --> 01:24:47.885
than an Honorable discharge.
They think there's nothing 

01:24:47.886 --> 01:24:50.160
available to them, when that's 
not true.

01:24:50.987 --> 01:24:52.987
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  Let's talk 
about the pitfalls.

01:24:54.644 --> 01:24:56.882
There's some jurisdictions out 
there saying I'd love to do it, 

01:24:56.883 --> 01:24:58.883
but this is 

01:24:59.952 --> 01:25:01.795
going to be a hurdle.  Talk 
about some issues that are in 

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:05.930
the way and that you overcame 
and how you did that.

01:25:07.757 --> 01:25:09.388
&gt;&gt; RON PEREZ:  The biggest thing
for us was probably getting 

01:25:09.389 --> 01:25:11.389
classifications on board.

01:25:14.049 --> 01:25:16.049
Because obviously

01:25:17.597 --> 01:25:19.842
Classifications is a big key 
part of it because they 

01:25:19.843 --> 01:25:23.310
determine whether the individual
has any gang history, what his 

01:25:23.311 --> 01:25:25.311
sophistication is.

01:25:26.388 --> 01:25:28.388
A lot of times that's how an 
individual is housed.

01:25:29.505 --> 01:25:31.972
If a veteran has some things in 
his background, that could 

01:25:31.973 --> 01:25:35.449
exclude him from programming.
So if you have classifications 

01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:37.703
on board, they know it's a 
veteran, you can look 

01:25:41.777 --> 01:25:43.777
at that veteran on a 
case-by-case basis.

01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:47.162
Why did you have these gang 
ties?  Can you put those gang 

01:25:47.163 --> 01:25:49.163
ties off to the side?

01:25:50.661 --> 01:25:53.315
Are you willing to participate 
in treatment?  And for us in 

01:25:53.316 --> 01:25:55.989
California, now, they have 
what's called milestones 

01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:57.990
credits.

01:26:00.924 --> 01:26:02.540
Whether you're in county jail or
prison, for your participation, 

01:26:02.541 --> 01:26:07.238
in any treatment or any type of 
programming, that's going to 

01:26:07.239 --> 01:26:12.207
give you time off your sentence.
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  Okay.  Let's

01:26:12.208 --> 01:26:14.208
quickly get some thoughts.  
Sheriff?

01:26:14.678 --> 01:26:16.678
&gt;&gt; MALIK MUHAMMAD:  I was saying
just 

01:26:17.984 --> 01:26:20.649
getting some buy-in from the 
staff.  Depending on the number 

01:26:20.650 --> 01:26:23.959
of veterans you have from your 
organization, you get some push 

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:29.551
back.  Some veterans actually 
thought by establishing a 

01:26:29.552 --> 01:26:31.552
housing unit, that would 
actually diminish their service.

01:26:34.245 --> 01:26:37.121
Once they do training for  them,
they quickly realize there's 

01:26:37.122 --> 01:26:41.057
benefits in there by having the 
program.

01:26:41.277 --> 01:26:42.074
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  Judge?
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL JACKSON:  I think 

01:26:42.075 --> 01:26:46.621
training the staff and making 
sure they understand it is the 

01:26:46.622 --> 01:26:48.622
main thing.

01:26:49.915 --> 01:26:50.922
And also convincing people 
inside the jail and outside the 

01:26:50.923 --> 01:26:54.650
facility that these veterans are
not getting a break.  They're 

01:26:54.651 --> 01:26:56.651
being put together because, 

01:26:58.786 --> 01:27:00.786
one, there's less problems.

01:27:03.905 --> 01:27:04.717
Less time they're going to spend
in confinement and reduced 

01:27:04.718 --> 01:27:06.718
privileges.

01:27:08.437 --> 01:27:10.098
And you're going to have 
necessary fewer guards involved 

01:27:10.099 --> 01:27:12.099
guarding these vets.

01:27:13.761 --> 01:27:15.837
So there is an advantage that 
can be assessed, that will be of

01:27:15.838 --> 01:27:17.838
benefit to the 

01:27:20.718 --> 01:27:22.766
veterans, and to the jail 
facility.

01:27:23.407 --> 01:27:27.149
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  Bernard?
&gt;&gt; BERNARD EDELMAN:  I think for

01:27:27.150 --> 01:27:30.805
anybody who reads this 
publication, a lot of those 

01:27:30.806 --> 01:27:35.132
answers will be found here.  
What do you have to overcome?  

01:27:35.133 --> 01:27:37.133
What do you have to think about 
when 

01:27:39.819 --> 01:27:41.819
you want to set up specialized 
housing?

01:27:44.193 --> 01:27:44.992
Call it whatever you want, but 
what do you have to really 

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:46.993
consider?

01:27:48.578 --> 01:27:51.267
If you have  objections, how do 
you overcome those objections?  

01:27:51.268 --> 01:27:53.716
Realistically, most of the 
objections can be overcome by 

01:27:53.717 --> 01:27:55.717
just speaking 

01:27:56.802 --> 01:27:59.859
rationally and dealing with any 
problems as they come up.

01:28:00.061 --> 01:28:02.120
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  Greg?
&gt;&gt; GREG CRAWFORD:  I want to 

01:28:02.121 --> 01:28:05.811
talk about the publication, as 
well.  We want folks to read the

01:28:05.812 --> 01:28:09.286
publication.  There are positive
examples of things happening 

01:28:09.287 --> 01:28:12.776
across the country.  These are 
things for you to consider.  We 

01:28:12.777 --> 01:28:14.777
structured this around design, 

01:28:16.288 --> 01:28:17.933
development, implement, and 
sustain.  There's examples from 

01:28:17.934 --> 01:28:19.934
each of these 

01:28:23.251 --> 01:28:26.100
folks, the king county in 
Washington, in the Humvee 

01:28:26.101 --> 01:28:28.949
county, and in Middlesex county.
Each of the folks if you reached

01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:32.804
out to them would be happy to 
talk about it, but a lot of this

01:28:32.805 --> 01:28:34.805
stuff is in here.

01:28:37.928 --> 01:28:40.386
Contact me and we can have a 
conversation.  Any of these 

01:28:40.387 --> 01:28:42.428
folks would be happy to help 
you.  Thank you for joining us.

01:28:43.248 --> 01:28:45.248
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ELIAS:  Anything 
else before 

01:28:48.001 --> 01:28:49.217
we say good afternoon to you?  
Any questions at all?  No 

01:28:49.218 --> 01:28:51.218
questions?

01:28:54.092 --> 01:28:55.722
You did a great job of 
explaining it all.  Thank you 

01:28:55.723 --> 01:28:57.587
guys for being  here, and thank 
you guys for being here, as 

01:28:57.588 --> 01:28:59.711
well.

01:29:02.733 --> 01:29:04.733
