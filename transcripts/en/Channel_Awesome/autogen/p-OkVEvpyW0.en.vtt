the smart stuff but I think there's
still a way to balance it out where it's

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:09.470
still a way to balance it out where it's
 

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.200
still a way to balance it out where it's
like there's still this charm and this

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:11.210
like there's still this charm and this
 

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.390
like there's still this charm and this
understanding to what they're doing like

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:13.400
understanding to what they're doing like
 

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.890
understanding to what they're doing like
there's a lot of times where a teenager

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:14.900
there's a lot of times where a teenager
 

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.860
there's a lot of times where a teenager
will do something and you or there's

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:17.870
will do something and you or there's
 

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.600
will do something and you or there's
other movies or shows that show a

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:19.610
other movies or shows that show a
 

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.220
other movies or shows that show a
teenager doing something foolish but

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:21.230
teenager doing something foolish but
 

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.650
teenager doing something foolish but
it'll show why and sort of explain why

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:23.660
it'll show why and sort of explain why
 

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.930
it'll show why and sort of explain why
and this it's like they're technically

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:25.940
and this it's like they're technically
 

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.690
and this it's like they're technically
saying why it's showing why but like you

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:28.700
saying why it's showing why but like you
 

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.890
saying why it's showing why but like you
say it doesn't feel very natural very

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:29.900
say it doesn't feel very natural very
 

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.080
say it doesn't feel very natural very
flowing so I think there is a way to

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:32.090
flowing so I think there is a way to
 

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.870
flowing so I think there is a way to
show thin becoming a teenager at least

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880
show thin becoming a teenager at least
 

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.190
show thin becoming a teenager at least
with our relationships and it only seems

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:36.200
with our relationships and it only seems
 

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.930
with our relationships and it only seems
to be with the relationship stuff yeah I

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:37.940

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.220
to be with the relationship stuff yeah I
get when your team is mostly what you

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:39.230
get when your team is mostly what you
 

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.770
get when your team is mostly what you
think of anyway um but I think there is

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:41.780
think of anyway um but I think there is
 

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.540
think of anyway um but I think there is
a way to show it where it is sort of

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:43.550
a way to show it where it is sort of
 

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.180
a way to show it where it is sort of
more balanced out and not just I'm a

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:46.190
more balanced out and not just I'm a
 

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:47.800
more balanced out and not just I'm a
dufus who's never gonna listen now and

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:47.810
dufus who's never gonna listen now and
 

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:48.970
dufus who's never gonna listen now and
I'm gonna think I'm right even though

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:48.980
I'm gonna think I'm right even though
 

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.650
I'm gonna think I'm right even though
I'm obviously not it's like there's even

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:50.660
I'm obviously not it's like there's even
 

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.870
I'm obviously not it's like there's even
though a lot of times we think that all

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880
though a lot of times we think that all
 

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.640
though a lot of times we think that all
that goes through team's heads and stuff

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:54.650
that goes through team's heads and stuff
 

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:55.690
that goes through team's heads and stuff
like that there is sort of this

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:55.700
like that there is sort of this
 

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.760
like that there is sort of this
progression there is sort of this this

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:57.770
progression there is sort of this this
 

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.740
progression there is sort of this this
might end this understanding and there's

00:15:59.740 --> 00:15:59.750
might end this understanding and there's
 

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.690
might end this understanding and there's
there's method to the madness it's like

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:01.700
there's method to the madness it's like
 

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.180
