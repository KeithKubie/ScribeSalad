TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.002
And this week I'm at
AnDevCon in Boston.

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:07.960
But that's not going to
stop me from giving you

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.130
your update about the coolest
developer news from Google

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.720

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.250
Say goodbye to CanvasHacks

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.290
Yes, I said "ghif."

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.370
Let's just move on.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.990
Muted AutoPlay for video
is supported by Chrome

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.430
for Android as of Version 53.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.210
Playback starts
for a video element

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.140
once it comes into view if both
AutoPlay and Muted are set.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.270
And it can be initiated
programmatically.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.280

linked in the description

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.850

accurately, set the
minimum and maximum zoom

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.510
levels on your map, and
restrict the user's panning

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.990
to particular lat-long
bounds of the camera target.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.640

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.610
Android add-ons
for Docs and Sheets

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.610
are a new way to get more
work done from anywhere,

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.900
such as writing a contract
for esignature with your phone

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.870

tablet for some quick analysis.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.280

device but continue

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.530

section of AdWords.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.940

insight into device usage

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.229

conversion path.

Want to know how to avoid
lock-in with your cloud

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.160

open-source software that

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.340

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.330
specifics.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.080
Google Cloud Shell is a
command-line interface

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.340
that allows you to manage
your Google Cloud Platform

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.860
infrastructure from any computer
with an internet connection.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.150
We're happy to announce
that Cloud Shell is now

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.080
generally available
and still free to use.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.000
Also now generally available
are customer-supplied encryption

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.230
keys for Compute
Engine, allowing

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.900
you to take advantage
of the cloud

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.610
while protecting your Google
Compute Engine disks with keys

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.960
that you control.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.210
