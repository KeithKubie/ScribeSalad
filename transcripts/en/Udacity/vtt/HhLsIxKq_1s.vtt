00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.920
&gt;&gt; So, here's the quiz. You see on

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.270
the screen this sort of unexplained two little squiggles

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.088
with a bunch of numbers in front, on top of them or under them or near them?

00:00:07.088 --> 00:00:10.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah I, I assume that's a river and on one bank it's the

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.370
land of the plus ones and the other bank has been infilitrated by plus twos.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.380
&gt;&gt; That's not what I intended at all but I actually like that enough that I'm

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.100
going to pretend, that that's what I intended. So

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.910
these work out to be sequences of states.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.850
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see now.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.140
&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.140
and rewards that you receive. No, no, no, it's

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.440
a riverbank and on one side of the bank, as

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.025
you walk along it, you get a bunch of plus

00:00:31.025 --> 00:00:32.759
ones. On the other side you get a bunch of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.920
plus ones and some plus twos. And this just

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.940
goes on forever, okay? And, I'm not going to tell you

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.850
what all the rewards are after that except that they,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.950
they look similar to the rewards that you see here.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:42.130
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.050
&gt;&gt; Plus ones and plus twos, okay? And let's

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.020
say the top, the top one, in fact, nothing

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.870
but plus ones. And the bottom ones are some

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.260
plus ones with maybe some plus twos sprinkled in and

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.190
out, but those are really the only options. Okay?

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.340
&gt;&gt; Here's my question to you. So, would you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.940
rather be on the top side of the river

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.930
bank, or the bottom side of the river bank?

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.520
Okay? You think you know the answer already, don't you.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.460
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Well then, let's, let's give our listeners

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.720
a, a chance to come up with the right answer.
