00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Thank you very much.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.030
I know your program says Kevin
Sullivan who should have been here

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.270
to introduce Ben who is
a good friend of Ben's,

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.450
but Kevin is a reporter for
the Washington Post; and so,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.900
he was called off to
the hurricane in Texas

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:30.190
in quite perilous conditions is
covering that devastating flood

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.790
for the paper and for our benefit.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.190
So, my name is Marie Arana,
and I am the literary director

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.490
of this festival.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.790
It's a wonderful festival.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.000
I've been doing this for 17 years.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.300
How about you?

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.510
I mean are you having a good time?

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.240
How many of you are
here for the first time?

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.540
Oh, welcome.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.590
Welcome. And may you come back.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.440
How many of you are here
for the last five years?

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.880
Wonderful.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.340
And for the last 17?

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.640
A few hands.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.940
Wonderful.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.990
Well, thank you very much
for supporting the festival,

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.060
and there is a better
way to support it

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.950
and that is through your donations.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.270 position:56%
This is a free and public event and
we can only do it if you support it.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.760
So I hope you will
consider doing that.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.360
Ben will have a Q and A after
his talk, and it's such a thrill

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.060
to be standing here
introducing Ben Macintyre.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.040
Congratulations for having the good
judgment to come to this session

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.460
because you are in
for a very big treat.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.210
He's a marvelous storyteller
whose book after book

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.300
after book have engaged many
readers beyond his native England.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.480
I am certainly an ardent fan.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.180
It's really a great
pleasure to welcome him here

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:17.550
and to have him cross the Atlantic
to come and be with us today.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.590
So, now to the books.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.670
The title of Ben Macintyre's
most recent book

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.160 position:56%
"Rogue Heroes" tells us a great
deal about the people and the events

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.370
and themes that interest
him the most.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.700
He recognizes and honors genuine
heroism on the infrequent occasions

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.220 position:56%
when it occurs, but he also delights

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.970
in rogues especially
rogues who becomes spies.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.890
He has a soft spot for the
awe, the unconventional,

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.880
the shameless, and yes, larcenists.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.440
All the better when the
scandal turns out to be a hero.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.950
Well, a hero of sorts.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.100
So it is that Adam Worth,
the hero of the Napoleon

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.870
of Crime not merely engineers epic
thefts on an international scale,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.460
he steals Gainesboro's
great portrait

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.920
of Georgiana the alluring duchess
of Devonshire and hides it away

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.040
for a full two decades maintaining
her as his private pinup girl.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.040
And so it is that Kim Philby,
the notorious double agent,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.100
emerges in Macintyre's superb
A Spy Among Friends as amoral

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.830
but irresistibly charming.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.980
Loved by his closest friends even
as he betrays them and his country.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.340 position:56%
And so it is that Agent Zigzag, the
petty criminal Eddie Chapman becomes

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.470
in World War 2, a double
agent whose service

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.300
to England plays a crucial part in
the struggle against Nazi Germany,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.950
yet who remains a rogue
and a scoundrel right

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.530
up to the rather glorious end.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.490
And finally, so it is,
that in Rogue Heroes,

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.390 position:56%
a small band of British officers
and men refuses to play by the rules

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.460
of warfare forming the special air
service parachuting behind enemy

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.470
lines, unheard of at the
time, and doing damage far

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.040
out of proportion to their numbers.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.600
All of these stories are true like
the stories in his other books

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.690
yet all are told by Macintyre
with flair and suspense.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.820
That is, his friend David Cordwell,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.300
the great novelist John
LeClaire surely admits

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.330
and perhaps even envies.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.050
It is your turn now to fall
under Ben Macintyre's spell.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.850
Ben.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:06.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.520
&gt;&gt; Ben Macintyre: Hello everybody.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.170
Thank you very much for that.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.860
Very lovely introduction.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.250
I didn't always quite write
about people who are either mad

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.360
or dangerous or crooked or in
some way kind of off center,

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.120 position:56%
but it does seem to be a kind of --
it's a habit I can't break actually.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.420
Rogue Heroes.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.010
Special forces like your own
Delta Force and Navy Seals

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.820
and the SAS have a particular
hold on our public imagination.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:43.140
Of the military, they attract
more imagination, more admiration,

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.290
more speculation, and more
downright fantasy than any part

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.410
of the military establishment.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.870
This is largely because
they are mysterious.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.030 position:56%
They cultivate all of these
groups, cultivate an air of secrecy,

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.890
and that is sort of part of
the way they sell themselves.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.250
So when I was asked three
years ago whether I was willing

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.910
to write the authorized
book about the SAS,

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.250
it took me about eight
seconds to say yes

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.960
because what it meant was
access to their secret archive,

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.140
which I can't even tell
you where it is in fact.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.930 position:56%
But and to describe it as an archive
is rather dignified what is actually

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.870
really just a set of enormous
cardboard boxes stuffed with paper.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.780
And not just paper.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.190
The archives contain letters,
diaries, memos, postcards,

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:45.350 position:56%
but also parachutes, guns, uniforms,
because the SAS is so secret

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.090
that towards the end of
the war when they were sort

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.390
of gathering everything together,

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.730
they simply just hid
it away in these boxes.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.480 position:56%
And as an archive, it's irresistible

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:59.480
because the SAS itself doesn't
really know what it's in.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.950
They did in fact digitize
the entire archive for me.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.620
It was about a million and a
half pages, 1.5 million pages.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:13.090 position:56%
And some poor soldier who had signed
up to strangle people in Iraq had

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.220
to spend about a year
digitizing this

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.630
and he ended up absolutely
hating me.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:23.440
I approached the task
with some trepidation

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.680
because I wondered whether the SAS
would try to control what I wrote.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.380
Whether they would try to
take the less creditable parts

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.790
of the story out.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.660
I was assured that they
wanted a warts and all book,

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.960
and that's what they got.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.550
There are more warts in
this story than I expected,

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.480
and I think a great deal
more than they expected.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.120
But to their credit, they
never tried to take them out.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.730
And of course, the SAS is a
vital part of all of our history

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:56.130
because all special
forces units which are now

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.850
of course a completely accepted
element of all modern warfare.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.130
The idea that you have
small highly-trained units

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.690
that will operate covertly
behind the lines both

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.910
to gather intelligence and to
hit high value strategic targets.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.460
That is now an absolutely
accepted part of military thinking.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.980
It wasn't always that
way and it began

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.250
with a very unlikely
group of people.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:26.380
I had come to the SAS -- I
mean I think we all have a sort

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.240
of image of special forces.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.690
Of highly trained, very
efficient, very fit people carrying

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:36.820
out the sort of jobs that most
of us would never want to do.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.650
The reality is both much more
-- certainly historically,

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:44.140 position:56%
the reality is much more complex
and much more interesting than that.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:49.640
The original SAS was highly
eccentric; deeply diverse.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.150
It was peopled by oddballs.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.340
Soldiers who wouldn't fit
into a conventional army.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:01.510
The original SAS was in many ways
a kind of ragtag private army.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:05.030
Some of the early SAS
were clever and tough,

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:09.930
but others were extremely sensitive
of no more than average strength

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:15.410
and fitness and yet courageous
in other very unexpected ways.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.140
Many were brutally
hardened by the experience

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:23.780
of behind the lines warfare and
became more so as the war advanced.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.970
Some never recovered from the
experience of this kind of warfare,

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.940
and some were borderline psychotic.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:37.570
This didn't turn out to be as
I had expected it to be a kind

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.340
of traditional regimental history.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:44.080
Instead it sort of turned into a
kind of study of human behavior.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:50.790 position:56%
How ordinary men behave in
extraordinary conditions of warfare.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.800
And I discovered many
things about the SAS

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.750
which I had never known
before including the fact

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.530
that it was very nearly
disbanded at birth

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.760
and would really only
have survived --

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.280
would not have survived without
the personal intervention

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.580
of Winston Churchill himself.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.190
Now the SAS was dreamed

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.960
up by a young British
officer called David Sterling.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.900 position:56%
Now Sterling came up with the idea
of the SAS, the Special Air Service,

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.710
while he was convalescing
from a failed parachute jump

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.930 position:56%
in the North African desert in 1941.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.340
If I just quickly tell you
how that accident happened,

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.830
it'll give you a little bit of the
flavor of what Sterling was like.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.030
He was bored to death
in North Africa.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.200
He had signed up for the
Commando's but wasn't seeing nearly

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.370
as much action as he wanted; and
so, he stole a set of parachutes

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.780
from a dock in Suez,
borrowed a plane

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.490
that was completely inappropriate
for what he wanted to do,

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.170
and then he and a couple of
friends simply tied the rip cords

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.200
of the parachutes to the
chair legs inside the plane,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.050
opened the door, and jumped out.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.830 position:56%
The problem was, as I said, that the
plane was the wrong sort of plane.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:01.140 position:56%
And Sterling's own parachute snagged
on the tailfin and he plummeted

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.080
to Earth at roughly four
times the recommended speed

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.730
and did his [inaudible].

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.010
But while lying in
hospital in Cairo,

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.750
he came up with a most simple
but very singular idea.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.640
He worked out that because
at that point of the war --

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.340
I should probably give you a little
strategic idea of where we were.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:25.100
Obviously, America was not yet
in the war, but the 8th Army,

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.230
the British 8th Army was
sort of encamped at Cairo

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.400
in the eastern part
of the western desert.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.600
And the Italian and German
armies were encamped in the west,

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.050
and it was kind of a
moment of stasis really.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.350
Nobody was moving.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.670
And the Germans and the Italians
controlled all the airfields along

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.260
the northern strip; the single road

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.220
that runs along the
coast of North Africa.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.730
So Sterling worked out that if he
could parachute into the desert,

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:56.400
and as it were this vastly
desert, and as it were creep

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.080
up behind the enemy, they
could attack the airfields,

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.200 position:56%
blow up as many planes as they
possibly could in the shortest space

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.780
of time, and then effectively
run away back into the desert.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:11.340
It sounds like a simple
idea, and indeed it was.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:15.410
But in many ways, it was completely
revolutionary because many

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.400
of the middle ranking officers

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.740
at that point had a very static
idea of how war was fought.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.110
This came from the first world war.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.400
The idea was that two large
armies will meet in a large space

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.610
and fight it out until
one of them wins.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.290
What Sterling was recommending
was completely different

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.310
and very revolutionary.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.840
Amazingly, he got permission
to start recruiting,

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.620
and he set about doing this
in a very particular way.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.000
He was looking for people
who were unconventional.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.450
He was looking for people
who didn't really stick

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.600
by the rules and he got them.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.760
One of his earliest recruits
was a man called Patty Mane.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.570
He was a northern Irishman
with an explosive temper

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.680
and a serious drink problem
and a capacity for raw

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.600
and frequently unconstrained
violence.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.120
He probably destroyed more planes

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.850
than anybody else during
the Second World War,

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.330
any fighter pilot on either side.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.320
But he blew them up all
entirely on the ground.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.700
Another key recruit was
a man called Jock Lewes,

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.510
who was an Oxford educated
intellectual really with sort

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:22.110
of matinee looks, but he
was also a very clever man,

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.680
and he invented a particular
kind of bomb

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.580
which is still called a
Lewes bomb, which was a kind

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.300
of rustic handheld time bomb.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.760
I particularly love this
painting by Rex Whistler

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.790
because it shows Lewes training
at Sandown Racecourse in Britain,

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.620
which is one of the big
race courses in Britain.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.390
You can actually see the horses
sort of coming up behind him,

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.640
and he's holding a [inaudible] gun
and it looks exactly as if he's

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:50.560
about to start mowing down the
runners and riders in the 350.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.790
Another key recruit was
a man called Reg Seekings

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:59.940
who was a foul-mouthed one-eyed
boxer from Cambridge who had a sort

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.660
of gift for killing really.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:05.300
He was able to do so
without remorse.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.670
He described himself as
a rough tough so and so.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:14.770
Most people thought he was a
complete maniac but he was the sort

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.720
of person that you actually wanted
on your side in a war like this.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.840
His closest friend was a
man called Johnny Cooper.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.970
Cooper was actually 17.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.970
He was too young to join the SAS.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.900
He lied about his age to get in.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.180
And this is the typical
photograph of Cooper.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.090
There are lots of photographs
in the SAS archive and lots

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.490
of photographs in the book.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.540
One of the things the
SAS was very good

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.170
at was taking photographs
of themselves.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.370
It's almost as if they
knew that they were going

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:44.390
to become extremely famous
after the war; and so,

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.140 position:56%
they might as well capitalize on it.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.830
But every photo -- I mean,
Cooper was an extraordinary man.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.650
He fought through every single
one of the worst campaigns

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.830
that took place that the SAS
fought during the Second World War,

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:59.990
and he has a broad grin on his
face in every single photograph.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.730
And Sterling himself,
you see him here again,

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.010
is a most unlikely candidate

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:09.420
to lead what would become a
famously fit fighting force.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.230
He was tall, stooped,
he had a bad back.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.660
He had conjunctivitis.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.960
He had desert sores.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.490
He was very unfit.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.790
He drank too much.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.520
He smoked all the time.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.210
And yet, he had one very
particular talent which was

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.310
that he had a real gift
for identifying the sort

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:29.610
of characters that he wanted.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.200
And in a way, it was a little like
a sort of dirty dozen operation.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.300
Sterling went around
picking out people

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.780
that he thought would fit the bill.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.640
He said, "I didn't
want psychopaths."

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.340
He got a few psychopaths,

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:44.270
but he wanted people
who were unconventional.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.580
Who were able to think
laterally but who could also be

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.150 position:56%
when necessary, completely ruthless.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:54.390
He began training them
at Kibrit in Egypt.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.840
They were trained in unarmed combat

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.690
in long-term desert
survival techniques.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.580
And in particular, in parachuting.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:07.070 position:56%
Now Sterling believed that a very
good way to train for parachuting is

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:13.250
to jump out of the back of a
speeding truck at 40 miles an hour.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.480
This is actually not a good
way to train for parachuting

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.070
because you're going
horizontally and not vertically.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.850
But it is a very, very
good way to break your legs

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:27.680
which quite a number of
trainees in fact did.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:34.300
This was very tough training, and
indeed two died while training

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.000
for the first operation which
was called Operation Squatter,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.430
and it took place in November 1941.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.650
It involved 55 parachuters.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.760
And the idea, as I say,
was pretty, pretty simple.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.480
They would parachute into the
desert, they would then sneak

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.560
up behind the sort of aligned
airfield, grab as many planes

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.070
as they could and then escape.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:59.130
It was an unmitigated catastrophe.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:03.790
These parachuters jumped into the
teeth of what was the worst gale --

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.690
worst storm in the
area for 30 years.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:10.980
Most of them landed
miles off target.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.850 position:56%
Many became completely disorientated
and lost in the desert at night.

00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:19.470
Some were actually scraped
to death on the desert floor

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.620
because in the high winds they
couldn't unclip their parachutes,

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:26.920
and a couple were so badly wounded
by the fall that they simply had

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.150
to be abandoned and died
of thirst in the desert.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:40.000 position:56%
Of the 55 parachuters that went in
on Operation Squatter, 23 came back.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.950
They straggled back to a
rendezvous in the desert

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.010
with the long-ranged
desert group, the LRDG.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:52.340 position:56%
These were the desert reconnaissance
intelligence unit whose task it was

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:56.900
to drive across the 500
mile Libyan desert and spy

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:01.610
on the troops moving
along the coastal road.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:03.440
They were brilliant
desert navigators.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.710
They'd worked out incredible
techniques for getting

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:10.800
across the desert, and they were
the ones who took the survivors

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.050
of the first SAS operation
back out again.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:17.460
Now instead of this leading
to the immediate disbanding

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.140
of this operation, and Sterling
actually interestingly never really

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.600
reported on quite what
a disaster it had been.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.990
I read his report on
Operation Squatter,

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.800
and it's a miracle of economy.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.860
He just says it didn't
go terribly well.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.810
We're getting on with the next one.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.670
But as a result of it, he hit
on a very simple idea which was

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:43.290
that if the LRDG, if
these truck-born

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:47.000
and jeep-born troops could get
into the desert and take them out,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.240
then they can bring them
in in the first place,

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.120
and then that would obviously
obviate the need to jump

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.100
out of planes with parachutes
in the middle of the night.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.070
And quite why this
glaringly obvious solution

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.860
to a quite simple problem had not
occurred to anyone before is one

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.620
of the great mysteries
of the SAS story.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:09.590
But it was a real turning
point for the SAS

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:14.010
because it made them highly
mobile, and they began an alliance.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.690
The SAS and the LRDG to
carry out a whole series

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.690
of lighting raids on airfields.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:25.240
They blew up hundreds of them and
then escaped back into the desert.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.700
And one of the things that I
learned in writing this book is

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:32.640
that it requires a particular cast
of mind and sometimes that cast

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.920
of mind has to be particularly
brutal.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.240
I mentioned at the beginning Patty
Mayne, the Irish Rugby player.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.680
There was one handwritten
document I found in the archive

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.240
that is actually very chilling, and
it's a description by Patty Mayne

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.050
of an assault that was made
on an airfield called Tamit.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.070
And it goes roughly like this.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:53.480
They got onto the air field.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.540
They noticed they planted their
bombs and they were sneaking off

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.010
without having been
picked up by the sentries.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:01.990
When they spot in the corner of the
airfield a hut with a light coming

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:03.920
from under the door,
and they realized a sort

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.070
of party was taking place inside.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:10.570
Italian and German officers
were having a ball inside.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.070
And this is -- I'll just read

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:15.440
to you very briefly Mayne's
description of what happened next.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.500
I kicked open the door and
stood there with my Colt 45.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.480
The others at my side with a
tommy gun and another automatic.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.220
The Germans just stared at us.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.800
We were a peculiar
and frightening sight.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.620
Bearded and with unkempt hair.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.420
For what seemed like an age,
we just stood there and looked

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.170
at each other in complete silence.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.220
Then I said, "Good evening," and
at that, a young German arose

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.010
and moved slowly backwards.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.470
I shot him.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.950
I turned and fired at
another some six feet away.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.540
The room by now was in pandemonium.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.580
Then they barricaded the doors.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.370
They rolled in hand grenades
and barricaded the doors.

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:58.340
At least 30 people
were killed that night

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.470
in what even Sterling was shocked

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:05.120
by what he called a callous
execution in cold blood.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:10.110
Patty Mayne was really, in some
ways, a kind of trained killer.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:14.090
But alongside people like Mayne
were others; no less brave,

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.330
but of a very different
kind of martial bent.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.560
One of my favorites in this story
is a man called Fraser McLuskey,

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.160
who called himself
the parachute padre,

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.000
and he was the first
chaplain of the SAS.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.090
So he took part in all

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.450
of the toughest assignments
that they were on.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:33.440
He never carried a gun, and
he exuded an astonishing sort

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.330
of moral force that had a
great impact on the regiment.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:43.010
Life expectancy in the early
SAS was extremely short

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.210
because having planted these
bombs, they then had to escape,

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:50.700
and as sun would come
up, any surviving planes

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.120
from the airfields would
then go hunting for the SAS.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.630
And this appalling game of cat

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.560
and mouse would take
place in the desert.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.280
This is the last known photograph
of Jock Lewes who was attacked

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.940
with his convoy on
Christmas Eve 1941.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:09.850
He was hit by a [inaudible] shell
which blew his leg off and he bled

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.080
to death very, very swiftly.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.490
And he is buried somewhere
in the western desert.

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:16.530
No one has ever found his remains.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.210
The men of L detachment.

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.940
They call themselves
L detachment SAS.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.260
Sterling used to joke that
the L stood for learner.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:30.560
L detachment were very
mindful of their own drama.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.910
They looked, dressed, and to a
considerable extent, acted the part

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.790
of swashbuckling desert warriors.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.740
And they took their cue really
from the first World War,

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:46.640
from Lawrence of Arabia and his
kind of very romantic take on war.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.420
Everyone wore beards like this.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:54.520
The cover of Rogue Heroes, I always
thought it shows six soldiers just

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.900
about to go into battle, and I've
always thought it looks exactly

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.420
like a rock band preparing
to go on stage.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.560
They knew exactly the
impact they were having

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.130
because theirs was not
just a military effect.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:09.570
It was a moral effect.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.810
They were under strict orders
never to boast about their exploits

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:17.420
but then they never really needed
to because others boasted for them.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:23.300 position:56%
And the exploits of the SAS quickly
became the stuff of myth and legend.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.730
They inflicted huge
damage on axis air power.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:31.910
They sacked German and Italian
morale and they tied up thousands

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.410
of enemy soldiers defending
the air fields

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.990
who would otherwise have been
deployed on the frontline.

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:41.980
In his diary, Rommel wrote
that the SAS had inflicted

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.770
considerable havoc.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:47.550
He said Sterling's men
had caused more damage

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.940
to us than any other unit.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.100
Now there were few people
who understood the importance

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.300
of military drama better
than Winston Churchill,

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.940
and you see him here
with his son Randolph,

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.310
a figure who's been almost
completely lost to history

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:06.490
but who plays a very important
part in the SAS story.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:08.920
Now Randolph was a
most unlikely soldier.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.000
He was extremely overweight, and
in fact, Sterling always joked

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.980
that it was very hard to sort
of push him through the hole

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.910
in the aircraft to get
him to actually parachute.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.720
But Sterling, Randolph
Churchill was a journalist,

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.890
and like many journalists, he
had a pretty vivid imagination.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:29.820
And Sterling worked out that if
he could get Randolph involved

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.000
in the SAS project, there
was a high probability

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.100
that Randolph would
tell his father and that

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.070
that would ensure the future of the
SAS because he was in real trouble.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:42.020
And so, he invited
Randolph to take part in one

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.870
of the least successful operations.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:48.420
Not just of the North African
campaign, but of the entire war,

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.630
and it was called Operation Bigamy.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.730
And the plan was very simple.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:56.790
Sterling decided that he would
convert a staff car to look

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.840
like a German vehicle,
and you see it here.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.940
They called it the blitz buggy.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.240
And the idea was very simple.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.870
They would drive into occupied
Benghazi which was seething

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.070
with Italian and German troops.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.840 position:56%
They would then go down to the dock.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.440
They would then inflate
some inflatable clacks

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.490
and padlock the shipping
that was moored in the dock.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:19.650
Then they would blow
it up with [inaudible]

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:21.380
and sink all the ships there.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.780
So they would blow up
the mouth of Benghazi

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:28.190
and prevent any other shipping
and supplies from coming in.

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:29.490
It was a very simple idea.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.470
And here you see them about
to set off in the blitz buggy.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:35.040
Now a key figure who
had to be brought along

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.070
for this was a man
called Fitzroy Maclean.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:42.260 position:56%
Now Fitzroy was brought along
because Fitzroy could speak Italian,

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.860
and the guard posts around
Benghazi were manned by Italians.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.690
Well, Fitzroy Maclean could speak
Italian but it was only a sort

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:51.700
of Italian because he had
learned his Italian studying

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.350
Renaissance art.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.010
And so, the Italian
he spoke was a kind

00:25:56.010 --> 00:26:00.280
of weird 15th century
[inaudible] Italian.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.520
And so, as they approached
the first Italian checkpoint,

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.770
Fitzroy addressed this
astonished Italian

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.320
in what must have sounded
like sort of Dante.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.470
[Inaudible] will open
yonder barrier so I

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:16.100
and my companions may
enter therewith,

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.900
and I think the Italian
was so astonished by this

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.590
that he just threw up the
barrier and they drove in.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.980 position:56%
And they drove down to the dock, and
they got to the dock and discovered

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.630
that both the inflatable
kayaks had been punctured

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.250
so neither could be used.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.900
So they called off the
operation, and there were four

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.590
of them on this operation.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:37.200
And as they were sort of
marching out of the harbor,

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.770
they realized that instead
of four, they had become six

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:44.130
because two Italian soldiers
obviously thinking that some kind

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.560
of weird military parade was
taking place in the middle

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.840
of the night had joined
the back of the line.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:53.000
And so, I think this was the
only time in the war when Allied

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.380
and Axis soldiers marched
together in perfect harmony.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.310
As they left, Fitzroy Maclean
he was obviously completely high

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:04.380
on adrenaline by this point,
called out the Italian guard

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.540
and dressed them down again
in this bizarre Italian.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.190
Saying what you've done here
is incredibly dangerous.

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:14.640 position:56%
There could be British saboteurs all
over the place and you're all fired.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.650
As I say, the operation
was a total failure.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:22.380
It had no impact whatever on
the war except that as planned,

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:27.200 position:56%
Randolph did indeed write it up in a
series of wonderfully vivid letters

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.660
that he sent to his father.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.400
And that ensured the
future of the SAS.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.450
Churchill was very taken
by this kind of warfare.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:35.290
He loved swashbucklers.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:38.850
And very soon after this, he
was at a dinner party in Cairo

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.540
on his way to see Sterling.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.150
When he met Sterling, and Sterling
chanted him with the stories

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.070
of what they were up to
and the very next day,

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:50.480
this is again from the archive,
Churchill's secretary sent a note

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.750
to Sterling saying, "Tell
me what the SAS is about."

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.270
Sterling replied with
a kind of blueprint

00:27:56.270 --> 00:28:00.890
for what special forces could be,
and it was really a paragraph.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:04.160
It said vastly expand
the size of the SAS

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.880
and put me David Sterling
in charge of it.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.170
But what you see in this document
is really is a kind of blueprint

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:14.690
for what all special forces
thereafter really became.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:18.140
It's rather a brilliant,
brilliant idea, and it worked.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.880
It ensured that the
SAS future was safe.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:26.310
I just very quickly want
to tell you, I mean the SAS

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.080
by this point had developed
techniques of desert survival.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.440
That meant they could hang
out in the desert for long,

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:37.040
long periods dug into these sort
of fortified desert encampments.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.300
But as I say, life
expectancy was very short.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.830
I just want to tell
you one quick story

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.180
about a man called Jack Sillito

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.450
who represents a particular
kind of bravery I think.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.730
Sillito was with his unit
trying to mind the [inaudible]

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:55.440
in October 1941, '42 now, when
he was separated from his unit

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.020 position:56%
and realized that he was
completely on his own in the desert.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.590
And so, he could either surrender
to the Germans or he could try

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:04.830
to walk back 130 miles
across the desert to try

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.870
and rejoin the unit in the desert.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.570
He chose the latter course.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:09.870
He had no water.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.730
He had a little receptacle though.

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:15.120
On the second day he began
to drink his own urine

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.850
which became steadily
more concentrated

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:19.460
as he trudged through the desert.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:23.100
On the third day, his feet
blistered and cracked.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.980
On the fourth day,
his tongue swelled up.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:30.510
On the fifth day he began to
hallucinate, and on the sixth day,

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:34.420
he saw in the distance a little
convoy of jeeps; they were SAS,

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:38.020
and he took off his shirt and set
fire to it in an effort to try

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.320
and attract their attention.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:43.880
They drove away across the horizon
and disappeared, and he trudged on.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:48.400
He covered 130 miles and finally
got to the desert encampment,

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.590
and there are a series of
extraordinary photographs

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.550
of Sillito the next day
with his feet bandaged.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:57.940
Sterling believed that
a week after this,

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.920
Sillito had completely
recovered from the experience

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.440 position:56%
which I think was not true actually.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.450
I think Sillito never
fully recovered from it.

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:08.730
The second battle of L Alamein.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.560
You see General Montgomery
here who was the commander

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.560
of the 8th Army was a
turning point for the army.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.640
Montgomery had initially
been very skeptical

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.940
about Sterling's operations.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.560
He didn't like what
Sterling was up to.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.840
He said the boy Sterling is mad.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:28.060
Quite, quite mad but in war there
is always a place for mad people.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:32.580
They began to lose a lot of men
the SAS towards the end of the war,

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:33.880
and the reason for this, again,

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.560
I found in the archives
was actually due to a spy.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.230
The SAS was infiltrated by
a man called Theodore Skerch

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.360
who was an Italian.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.830
He'd been recruited by
Italian military intelligence.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.650
He was a very committed fascist.

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:50.020
And one of the reasons why
the SAS lost so many men was

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.270
because in fact a lot of
their positions were betrayed

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:56.950
by Theodore Skerch who was captured
at the end of the war and tried,

00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:00.760
and was actually the only British
soldier to be tried and executed

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.840
for treason in the
course of the war.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.590
With the end of the
war in the desert,

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:09.490
the focus redeployed to Europe.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:15.340
The SAS was deeply involved in
retaking Italy and in the fight

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.740
for occupied France,
but they were no longer

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.260 position:56%
under the command of David Sterling.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.890
Sterling was captured in the very
last operation, last SAS operation

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:27.910
of the desert war and spent the
rest of the war trying and failing

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.450
to escape from various
prisoners of war camp.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:34.190
The unit now came under
the command of Patty Mayne,

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:38.130 position:56%
and the war entered a very different
kind of phase because Hitler

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:41.450
by this point passed something
called the Commando Order.

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:44.880
Now the Commando Order
was a direct response

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.450
to what the SAS had been doing

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:48.560
and what it did was
it effectively called

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.750
for all captured SAS personnel

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:56.130
to be executed immediately
and without trial.

00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:00.890
Dozens, scores of SAS soldiers
were simply murdered by the SS.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:06.630
And in the final phase of the
war, the SAS was vastly expanded.

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:13.420
It played a vital role in D Day,
parachuting behind the lines,

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.520
and really trying to prevent
the [inaudible] divisions

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:24.150
from the south moving north to
reinforce the Normandy bridge head.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:26.490
SAS troops were among the first

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:29.510
to enter Bergen-Belsen
Concentration Camp.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:32.720
A scene of unbelievable
horror greeted them there.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.310
And there was an extraordinary
moment.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:38.000
You may remember I mentioned
Reg Seekings the one-eyed boxer

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.300
at the beginning.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.880 position:56%
Well, Reg Seekings decided to take
the law into his own hands and began

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.090
to beat up an SS officer.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.410
He was stopped by his
commanding officer who said, "No,

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:49.140
we must arrest these people.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.950
They must all be put on trial,"
and it's a very interesting moment

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:56.250
because the SAS could simply
have executed every single one

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:59.620
of those SS soldiers,
but instead they decided

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:00.920
that they should be put on trial.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.690
And it's a little spark of humanity

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:07.390
in what was otherwise an
unbelievably brutal war.

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:11.690
So that photograph you just
saw there was the [inaudible]

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:15.010
under arrest who was
then tried and executed.

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.630
The SAS idea expanded
hugely after the war.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:22.410
It spread to France, to Belgium,
to Australia, to New Zealand,

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:24.370
and most importantly
to this country.

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:29.280
US Delta Forces was directly
modeled on the SAS idea,

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.310
and the ideas that
Sterling came up with back

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:35.660
in 1941 are still really
the principles

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.490
on which special forces
operate today,

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.590
and they are as important
today as they've ever been.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.160
Arguably more important
than they've ever been.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:48.010
Interestingly, the other day
the US defense secretary said

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:52.610
of special forces operating in
Syria, we want Isis never to know

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:54.750
who is coming through
the window next,

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:58.520
and that's a very similar
description to the way

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.170
that Sterling approached this war.

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:07.110
To finish, many things came
to me while writing this,

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:09.820
but one of the things,
perhaps above all, the war --

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.810
we have an idea of
the Second World War

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.400
that is written often
in black and white.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.500
That there are heroes and villains.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.190
There are good people
and bad people.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:21.310
There was a right side to be
on and a wrong side to be on.

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:24.050
I've become increasingly
convinced writing about this area

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:27.780
that actually all is really
painted in shades of gray.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:32.860
Good people do bad things by
mistake or not by mistake.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.310
I mean Patty Mayne was not a
bad man but he was a killer.

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:39.480
And there are heroes
on the other side too.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:43.250
I wrestled with hero because
I wasn't sure that I --

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.780
I mean some of these men
were incredibly heroic

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.680
but war itself is not heroic.

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:52.510
War itself is incredibly
nasty, and nobody really comes

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:55.300
out of this story glorified.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:35:00.030
But yet it raises the question
that I hope all good history raises

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:01.470
which is, what would you do?

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:04.110
And there's one final story that
I will tell you about which is

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.270
about a man called
Sutton who parachuted

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.440
into occupied France right
at the end of the war.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.740
He was just a young man.

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:13.570
He was a signaler, and he landed
with three other companions.

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:15.290
The other three were all executed.

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:16.610
They were all captured immediately

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.730
and the other three
were killed immediately.

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:21.790
But he survived, and he
told this incredible story

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:23.550
after the war of personal survival.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.460
How he had been captured,
he'd escaped,

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.980
he'd fought off troops
with a [inaudible] gun.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.530
You know, it was an amazing story.

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.910
The problem with this story is
that I don't think it was true.

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:38.450 position:56%
The truth is that actually Sutton --
and this became clear at the trials

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:40.590
after the war of the
people who had captured him.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:43.820
It is pretty clear
that Sutton cooperated.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:47.350
That he agreed to work
with the Germans to --

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:49.590
it's not quite clear
how much he did,

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.950
but he may even have
given the locations

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:53.680
of parachute landing drops.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.730
Now when I read this account, I was
horrified, and I thought, "Well,

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:58.820
I should really condemn this man."

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:03.030
But actually I couldn't bring
myself to do that because I'm not

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.220
at all sure that I wouldn't
have done the same thing

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.520
in that circumstance.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.180
If given the choice between
being shot on sight and buried

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:13.810
in a shallow grave, I would not
also have tried to save my skin

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:18.820 position:56%
by feeding perhaps disinformation
but certainly try to hold onto time.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.480
So I don't know that I wouldn't
have done the same thing,

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:24.280
but I do know that I would probably
not have volunteered to parachute

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.070
into occupied France
in the first place.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:29.500 position:56%
So I guess my question, and I'll end

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:33.040
with this thought is,
what would you do?

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.840
Thank you very much indeed.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:41.040
[ Applause ]

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.340
Thank you.

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.110
[ Applause ]

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:46.360
Now we certainly have some
time for some questions.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.660
What time did we wind up?

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.680 position:56%
We haven't got very long I'm afraid.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.150
But please do ask any
questions about this

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:54.480
or any other subject
that I can help with.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.780
Yes, sir?

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.080
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.380
I love all of your work.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:59.680
&gt;&gt; Ben Macintyre: Thank you.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:00.980
&gt;&gt; Two questions.

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.700
One about Rogue Heroes.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.730 position:56%
Just that you brought that so alive.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.540
Did they actually, and I'll
state those questions quickly,

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:12.130
did they actually think that
they were going to be as accepted

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:15.990
by the archaically minded
British military as they were?

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:18.680 position:56%
And you did a great job of that too.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:23.440
And on Operation Mincemeat, did
you have access to the same kind

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:26.640
of archival materials for the book
was essentially [inaudible] war

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.640
secret undertaking?

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.940
&gt;&gt; Ben Macintyre: Thank you.

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:32.660
The answer to the first question
is no, they did not expect

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:36.160
to be accepted and Sterling
was in constant battle

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:41.730
with the higher brass who he
referred to sort of the mid-levels

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:46.250 position:56%
of British military bureaucracy as
layer upon layer of fossilized shit.

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:50.970
It was a phrase he used repeatedly
and sometimes in writing.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:54.000
So they knew exactly what
he was talking about.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.840 position:56%
So no, they didn't expect to survive

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.040
and it was rather amazing
that they did.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.400
And they did so really by a
certain amount of subterfuge too.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.380
I mean Sterling essentially
got away with it,

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:07.000 position:56%
and he wasn't the only private man
running a sort of semi-private army.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.930
On Operation Mincemeat which
is the deception operation

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:13.450
that preceded the Sicilian
invasion which was a bizarre

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:16.720
and rather wonderful story
of using a dead body to try

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.140
to ferry effectively lies
to the German high command.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:25.230
Yes, I was incredibly lucky with
that one because M15 happened

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:28.310
to release their archives.

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:29.610
It was an M15 operation.

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:30.910
M15 is the equivalent of the FBI.

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:35.140
I mean they are the internal
security organization

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:37.140
but they were running
the operation for reasons

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.440
that are quite complicated.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.010
M16 never releases its files.

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:43.470
M16 God bless them does
otherwise I'd be out of a job.

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:45.450
So they do me proud.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:46.750
Thank you.

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.050
Yes, sir?

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:51.360
&gt;&gt; You said that Sterling spent the
rest of the war trying to escape.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.070
What happened to him after the war?

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.810
&gt;&gt; Ben Macintyre: Well,
his after war story --

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:57.110
like a lot of these soldiers,

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:59.030
he's actually rather a
sad one in lots of ways.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:03.740
I mean, many of these men
were people who thrived in war

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:08.160
but really suffered in peace, and
Sterling never really found a point

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.460
to his life after the war.

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.530
It had been so exciting.

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:12.830
He had been so young.

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:18.280
He'd achieved so much that really
the SAS was disbanded after the war

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:21.470
and then reformed again a
year later, but by that point,

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:23.160
Sterling was long out of the army.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.970
And many of them lived very
sad after lives actually.

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:29.420
They never quite adjusted
to peace time conditions.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.720
And Patty Mayne was another one.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.390
I mean, he died incredibly young.

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:36.570
He took to the drink and actually
drove his car into a lamppost.

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:39.210
I've never been sure whether he
did that intentionally or not.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:43.290
So Sterling's afterlife, which
is often true in fact of people

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:46.190
who have seen vivid
action of this sort,

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:48.080
was never quite the same again.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.380
Yes, ma'am?

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:54.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sir, you mentioned the cardboard
boxes full of the archival materials

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:58.080
that you worked with, and you
probably worked with tons and tons

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.780
of other material afterwards.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.650
How much background research do
you feel yourself having to do,

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:07.040
and when did you finally say
okay enough, I've got to work?

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.340
&gt;&gt; Ben Macintyre: That's
a lovely question.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.640
The answer is I never
quite get to the moment

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.940
where I think I've done enough.

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:15.140
But the deadline, I can sort of
hear it crunching up behind me,

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:16.640
and I realized I'd better stop.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.790
I got huge help from the SAS.

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:21.040
They were wonderfully
cooperative about all of this.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.740
I thought they would be tricky.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.990
I through there might be
elements of this story

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:26.290
that they would want to take out.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:29.790
The only thing they wanted to
take out was a graphic description

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:32.210
of the death of one soldier and
they wanted to take that out

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:33.640
because it was going
to upset the family,

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.950
and I completely understood that.

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:36.970
I got a lot of help from them.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:39.220
In fact, this book could
not have been written

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.440
without the active
participation of the SAS.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.130
They really -- they made it happen.

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.930
Whether they will allow me to
do a sequel I strongly doubt

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:52.690
because after 1945, we end
up in even murkier territory.

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:55.320
I probably only got time
for one more questions.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.620
Sir?

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:59.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mr. Macintyre, how important do
you believe the special relationship

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:04.370 position:56%
between the United States and Great
Britain is for world security today?

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:05.670
&gt;&gt; Ben Macintyre: Wow.

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:08.050
That's a question I'll give you
a lot more than two minutes on.

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:10.490
It's still absolutely vital.

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:14.620
It is still the strongest and most
important of the relationships.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:20.630
Particularly in an era of when
signals intelligence which was

00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:23.780 position:56%
so important during the Second World
War and is now obviously digital

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:27.710 position:56%
and to do with mobiles and so on, is
actually vital, and the relationship

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:30.470
between GCHQ which is
our equivalent in Britain

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:33.370
of the signals intelligence
[inaudible] absolutely vital.

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:39.130 position:56%
So I would argue it's probably never
been more special or more important.

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:42.030
And that is true of
intelligence generally.

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:46.740
I mean, we imagine, don't we,
somehow that war has moved on,

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.530
but actually human intelligence

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:51.830
and signals intelligence are
absolutely the core of all

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:54.640
of our freedoms and have
been for a very long time.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.510
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you very much indeed.

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:01.660
[ Applause ]

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:05.550

of the Library of Congress.
