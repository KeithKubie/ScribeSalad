00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:04.060
So, this is probably what you think of when you
picture an atom, right?

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.769
The thing is, the central part of this model
is just plain inaccurate.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.830
Scientists recently found the nucleus of some
atoms don’t look like this at all, and it’s

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.080
causing a ruckus because well, this newfound
shape straight up shouldn’t exist.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.250
When you learned about atoms in school, you
probably learned about a couple of different

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.900
models-- and one thing was likely always the
same- the nucleus was spherical.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.610
But it turns out that might’ve been too
simple.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.150
Atomic nuclei are made up of protons and neutrons
that are held together by the Strong Nuclear

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.829
Force (one of the universe’s fundamental
forces), and based on this, one might assume

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.830
they’d be more or less spherical.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.310
In reality, though, most nuclei are deformed
to some extent, they can be elongated into

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.360
football shapes or squished into discs-- but
as long as they’re symmetrical everything

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.510
in physics land is fine and dandy.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.450
Here’s the problem though, we just found
a nucleus that ISN’T symmetrical, and it’s

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.450
a huge deal.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.100
And that’s because symmetry is a very important
cornerstone to many of the theories we use

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.070
to understand the universe.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.460
In particle physics, there’s a theory called
CP-Symmetry, which is the combination of charge

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.530
symmetry and parity.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.450
Charge symmetry is the idea that if you flip
the charge of an atom, the physics of the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.920
atom shouldn’t change.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.530
This is the basis to our understanding of
antimatter- if you flip the charge in a regular

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.619
atom, you get an anti-atom.

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.140
The physics should work the same.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.780
Similarly, Parity is the idea that if you
invert the spatial coordinates of a system,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.030
the physics shouldn’t change.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.560
Our hands, for example, show parity- if you
move one hand like this, you can mirror it

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.740
with your other hand- and it works the same
way.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.140
Theoretically, atoms should behave this way,
too.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.240
So, back to the new hotness.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.350
Some Scotland-based scientists confirmed a
pear-shaped nucleus exists.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.650
A PEAR, YOU GUYS!

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.600
The most exciting shape of all the fruits!!!

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.159
Scientists had previously found asymmetrical
nuclei in the isotopes Radium-224 and 226,

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.430
But this time they confirmed it in Barium-144,
which is a comparatively lighter atom.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.500
And how’d they do it you ask?

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.009
They just looked for octupole transitions
in the gamma ray emissions of excited ba-144

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.170
nuclei, casual.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.249
And the surprisingly pear-shaped nuclei they
found had uneven distributions of mass, and

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:17.249
charge.

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:21.170
Which according to currently accepted models
of physics, like CP-symmetry, just shouldn’t

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.170
exist.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.170
But THEY DO.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.529
And the scientists think that could have some
very big implications.

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:31.409
Our current models predict the symmetry of
antimatter and matter, and of the flow of

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:37.109
time, but the scientists think that these
nuclei being asymmetrical could explain why

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.859
these other things don’t function symmetrically
either.

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.169
If some atomic nuclei aren’t symmetrical…
they’re claiming it could explain why we

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:51.310
can’t seem to find antimatter in our universe,
and why time always flows from past to future

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.029
-- and therefore, why time travel is likely
impossible :(

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.120
These are some pretty hefty claims, though,
and as always more research is needed before

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.670
we can prove anything.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.090
But it is pretty amazing that such a tiny
discovery could have such huge implications,

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.219
innit?

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.989

If tiny science gets you as excited as a barium-144
nucleus, you should watch Julian’s video

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.219
about just how small life can get, here.

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:49.389
And fun fact, about 99.9% percent of an atom
is empty space - without it, all of humanity

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.290
would be the size of a sugar cube.
