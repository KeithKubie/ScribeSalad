00:00:00.497 --> 00:00:03.080
BRIAN KRAUS: You are listening
to "These Vibes Are Too Cosmic"

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.421
here on WPRB Princeton,
community-supported independent

00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:06.920
radio.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.580
Thanks a lot for joining us.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.320
My name is Brian.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.786
Stevie is here
with me on the mic.

00:00:10.786 --> 00:00:11.910
STEVIE BERGMAN: Hey, there.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.761
BRIAN KRAUS: And we have
a lot to get to today.

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:16.219
STEVIE BERGMAN:
I'm Stevie Bergman,

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.149
and I'm a graduate
student here in physics.

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:20.690
BRIAN KRAUS: I'm Brian Kraus,
and I'm a graduate student here

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.010
in plasma physics.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.468
STEVIE BERGMAN: And we're the
hosts of "These Vibes Are Too

00:00:24.468 --> 00:00:26.800
Cosmic" on WPRB
Princeton, 103.3 FM.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.640
BRIAN KRAUS: So all right.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.650
That's all the science news
we have time for today. I'm -- 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.010
STEVIE BERGMAN: Outreach has
been a big part of my life

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.420
for many years.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.900
I started a radio show
here, was given a slot.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.630
And around that time, also,
Brian just kind of casually

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.967
mentioned, you know, I would
love to start on the radio

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:46.550
show, as well.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.530
And I want to do a science
outreach program, as well.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.970
And I was just like --

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.980
I think I called you
at 10 p.m. or 11 p.m.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.480
and was just like,
oh my God, dude.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.360
This is amazing.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.164
And yeah, that's kind
of how it got started.

00:00:59.164 --> 00:01:01.455
BRIAN KRAUS: Our goals for
"These Vibes Are Too Cosmic,"

00:01:01.455 --> 00:01:04.400
to get to what
our show is about,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.200
it's about spreading
science around.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.060
It's about making science
kind of personable to people.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.060
First of all, there's a
lot of great discoveries

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.230
that just will blow your mind
if you bother to understand what

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.460
they are and what they mean.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.793
And to share these with people --

00:01:17.793 --> 00:01:20.275
I think a lot of them, people
would never hear about.

00:01:20.275 --> 00:01:22.022
This is "These Vibes
Are Too Cosmic.

00:01:22.022 --> 00:01:22.880
We'll be right back.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.010
Most shows on WPRB are
very music-focused.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.450
And we had one of the first
ideas for a talk show.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.230
So our show is about trying to
get the science research that

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.650
happens within Princeton --
often behind closed doors,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.810
on someone's computer
or in someone's lab --

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.160
and spread it out to the public.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.701
STEVIE BERGMAN: The
way I think of it

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.390
is that we provide a
platform for scientists

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.510
and experts, authors.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.610
Sometimes we bring in artists.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.350
It almost always
has a science bend.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.600
But I think what people
underestimate is how many

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.107
things have a science bend.

00:01:58.107 --> 00:01:59.940
BRIAN KRAUS: And here
to talk to me about it

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.930
is Isabela Morales, a
graduate student here

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.430
in the Department of History.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.910
STEVIE BERGMAN: What we do as
interviewers is we try and help

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.860
the expert explain their
work and their idea

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.830
for just the general
audience that's listening,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.800
whether they're just
tuning in for a few minutes

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.176
as they're driving or whether
they're a regular listener.

00:02:21.176 --> 00:02:23.008
BRIAN KRAUS: It's
something we're, actually,

00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:25.167
I think, as scientists,
it's a skill that we get

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:26.750
without really
realizing it's a skill,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.416
but just to understand
someone's science

00:02:28.416 --> 00:02:31.220
and be able to process it
quickly and summarize it.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.266
And that's so useful for
a live radio interview.

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:35.140
For those listeners far
outside of Princeton,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.516
Nassau Hall is the center of
Princeton campus, basically.

00:02:37.516 --> 00:02:38.431
ISABELA MORALES: Right.

00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:40.100
It is the oldest
building on campus.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.440
STEVIE BERGMAN: Our best 
interviews are ones where

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.590
we connect with our
guest, and our guest

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.360
connects with the audience.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.030
And they are laughing,
and they are getting

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.530
excited about what they do.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.320
Because this is what they
spend their every day on.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.270
And they're so
passionate about it.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.610
And if we can bring that out
and show that to our audience,

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.320
that is wonderful.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.620
Science is everywhere, all
around us, all the time.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.130
And so if we can help
people look around the world

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.540
and think about the way
the universe is working --

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.750
from the atoms in the
table, from the way

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.840
their car is working, from
trees, all of this stuff --

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.400
then I think we've done our job.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.050
