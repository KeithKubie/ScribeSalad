00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.170
In this video we're going to
cover what is arguably, the

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.040
single most important concept
in all the statistics.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.570
Well if you go into almost any
scientific field you might even

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.760
argue that it's the single
most important concept.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.000
I've actually told people that
it's kind of sad they don't

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.560
cover this in the
core curriculum.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.900
Everyone should know about is
because it touches on every

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.590
single aspect of our lives and
that's the normal distribution

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.000
or the Gaussian distribution
or the bell curve.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.270
And just to kind of give you a
preview of what it is, my

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.970
preview will actually make it
seem pretty strange but as we

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.880
go through this video hopefully
you'll get a little bit more

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.040
intuition of what
it's all about.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.740
The Gaussian distribution or
the normal distribution,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.250
they're two words
for the same thing.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.930
It was actually Gauss
who came up with it.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.200
I think he was studying
astronomical phenomenon

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.190
when he did.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.740
But it's a probability density
function just like we studies

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.990
the Poisson distribution.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.080
It's just like that.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.370
And just to give you the
preview it looks like this.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.760
The probability of getting
any x, and it's a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.150
class of probability
distribution functions.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.520
Just like the binomial
distribution is and the Poisson

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.740
distribution, it's based on
a bunch of parameters.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.930
This is how you would
traditionally see it written in

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.340
a lot of textbooks and if we
have time, I'd like to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.580
rearrange the algebra just to
get a little bit more intuition

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.540
of how it all works out.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.140
Or maybe we could get
some insights on where

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.140
it all came from.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.070
I'm not going to prove it in
this video, that's a little

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.860
bit beyond our scope.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.130
Although, I do want to do it
and there's actually some

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.570
really neat mathematics
that might show up.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.610
If you're a math lead there's
something called Sterling's

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.650
formula what you might want
to do a Wikipedia search on,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.770
which is really fascinating.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.940
It approximates factorials
with essentially a

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.890
continuous function.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.100
But I won't go into
that right now.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.890
The normal distribution is 1
over -- this is how it's

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.890
normally written -- the
standard deviation times the

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:08.230
square root of 2 pi times
e to the minus 1/2.

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.860
Well, I like to write it this
way, it easier to remember,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.470
times whatever value you're
trying to get minus the mean of

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.210
our distribution divided by the
standard deviation of our

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.950
distribution squared.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.840
And so if you think about it,
actually this is a good thing

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.280
to just notice right now.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.970
This is how far I'm from the
mean and we're dividing that

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.220
by the standard deviation of
whatever our distribution is.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.480
This is a preview of actually a
normal distribution that I've

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.500
plotted, the purple line here
is a normal distribution.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.830
Initially the whole exercise --
I know I jump around a little

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.440
bit -- is to show you that the
normal distribution is a good

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.110
approximation for the binomial
distribution and vice versa.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.420
If you take enough trials in
your binomal distribution and

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.970
we'll touch on that a second.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.680
The intuition of this term
right here I think is

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.530
interesting because we're
saying, how far are we away

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.310
from the mean, we're dividing
by the standard deviation.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.700
So this whole term right here
is how many standard deviations

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.560
we are away from the mean.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.130
This is actually called
the standard z score.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.570
One thing I found in statistics
is there's a lot of words a lot

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.970
of definitions and they all
sound very fancy, the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.780
standard z score.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.340
But the underlying concept
is pretty straightforward.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.545
Let's say I had a probability
distribution and I get some x

00:03:29.545 --> 00:03:32.380
value that's out here and it's
3 and a half the standard

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.200
deviations is away from the
mean, then it's standard

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.490
z score is 3 and a half.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.220
Anyway let's focus on the
purpose of this video.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.890
So that's what the normal
distribution, I guess

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.930
the probability density
function for the normal

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.350
distribution looks like.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.370
But how did it get there?

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.100
By the end of this video you
should at least feel

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.770
comfortable that this is a good
approximation for the binomial

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.020
distribution if you're
taking enough trials.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.760
And that's what's fascinating
about the normal distribution

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.940
is that if you have the sum --
and I'll do a whole other video

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.990
on the central limit theorem --
but if you have the sum of many

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.110
independent trials approaching
infinity, that the distribution

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.370
of those, even though the
distribution of each of those

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.500
trials might have been
non-normal but the distribution

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.860
of the sum of all those trials
approaches the normal

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.490
distribution.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.890
I'll talk more
about that later.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.260
But that's why it's such a good
distribution to kind of assume

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.750
for a lot of underlying
phenomenon.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.490
If you're kind of modeling
weather patterns or drug

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.790
interactions and you we'll talk
about where it might work well

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.480
and where it might
not work so well.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.270
Like sometimes people might
assume things like a normal

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.190
distribution in finance and
we've see the financial crisis

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.120
that's led to a lot of
things blowing up but.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.860
Anyway, let's go back to this.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.080
This is a spreadsheet
right here.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.640
I just made a black background
and you can downloaded it at

00:04:51.640 --> 00:05:01.810
khanacademy.org/downloads
Actually, if you just do that

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.380
you'll see all of
the downloads.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.050
I haven't put it there yet, I'm
going to do it right after I

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.230
record the videos
downloads/normal

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.470
distribution.xls.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.640
If you just go up to
khanacademy.org/download/

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.100
you'll see all the things
there and you'll see

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.880
this spreadsheet.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.950
I encourage you to play with it
and maybe do other spreadsheets

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.660
were you experiment with it.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.610
So this spreadsheet what we do
is we're doing a game or let's

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.540
say I'm sitting I'm on a street
and I flip a coin, I flip

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.240
a completely fair coin.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:44.560
If I get heads, this is heads,
I take a step backwards or

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.970
let's say a step to the left.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.990
And if I get a tails I
take a step to the right.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.940
So in general I always have a
-- this is a completely fair

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.280
coin -- I have a 50 percent
chance of taking a step to the

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.520
left and I have a 50 percent
chance of taking a

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.630
step to the right.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.000
So your intuition there is if
I told you I took a you a

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.630
thousand flips of the coin
you're going to keep

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.540
going left and right.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.360
If by chance you get a bunch
of heads, you might end up

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.100
really kind of moving
over to the left.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.280
If you get a bunch of tails you
might move over to the right.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.740
And we learned already the odds
of getting a bunch of tales or

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.670
many more tails than heads is a
lot lower than things kind of

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.690
being equal or close to equal.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:36.590
Right here what I've done --
let me scroll down a little

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:48.980
bit, I don't want to lose the
whole thing -- is I have this

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.950
little assumption here and I
encourage you to fill that out

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.320
and change it as you like.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.290
This is the number
of steps I take.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.980
This is the mean number of left
steps and all I did is I got

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.260
the probability and we
figured out the mean of the

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.510
binomial distribution.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.510
The mean of the binomial
distribution is essentially the

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.400
probability of taking a left
step times the total

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.140
number of trials.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.830
So that's equal to 5, that's
where that number comes from.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.150
And then the variance -- and
I'm not sure if I went over

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.160
this and I need prove this to
you if I have and I'll make a

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.500
whole other video on the
variance of the binomial

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.300
distribution -- is essentially
equal to the number of trials,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.630
10 times the probability of
taking the left step or kind of

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.150
a successful trial -- I'm
defining left as a successful

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.640
trial, that could be right as
well -- times the probability

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.490
of 1 minus the successful trial
or non successful trial.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.370
In this case they're equally
probable and that's where

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.550
I got the 2.5 from.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:49.510
And that's all on
the spreadsheet.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.380
If you actually click on
the cell and look at the

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.400
actual formula I did that.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.880
Although sometimes when you
see it in Excel it's a

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.640
little bit confusing.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.360
And this is just the square
root of that number.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.120
The standard deviation
is just the square

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.540
root of the variance.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.460
That's just the
square root of 2.5.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.630
And so if you look here
this says, OK what is

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.510
the probability that
I take 0 steps?

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.170
So I take a total of 10 steps
-- just to understand this

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.970
spreadsheet -- what is the
probability that I

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.360
take 0 left steps?

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.020
And just to make clear, if I
take 0 left steps that means I

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.110
must have taken 10 right steps.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.440
And I calculate this
probability -- I should have

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.650
drawn maybe a line here -- I
calculate this using the

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.920
binomial distribution.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.860
And how do I do that?

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:44.810
Let me actually switch
colors just to make

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.500
things interesting.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.170
Do they have a purple here?

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.230
I'll do a blue.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.700
So blue for binomial.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.600
So what I have here is
how many total steps?

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.420
There's a total of 10 steps.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.410
So 10 factorial, that's kind of
the number of trials I have.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.820
Of that I'm choosing
0 to go left.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:14.390
So 0 factorial divided by
10 minus 0 factorial.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:15.580
This is 10 choose 0.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.790
I'm choosing 0 left steps of
the total 10 steps I'm taking

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.900
times the probability of 0 left
steps so, it's the probability

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.110
of a left step, I'm only taking
0 of them times the probability

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.550
of a right step, and I'm
taking 10 of those.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:35.050
So that's where this number
came from, this .001.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.700
That's what the binomial
distribution tells us.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:44.530
And then this one similarly, is
10 factorial over 1 factorial

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.070
over 10 minus 1 factorial.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:47.820
That's how I get that one.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.650
And once again, if you click
on the actual cell you'll

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:51.960
see that explained.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.020
We've done this multiple times.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.490
This is just a
bionomial calculation.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:59.080
Then right here, after
this line right here, you

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.520
can almost ignore it.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.930
I did that so that I can do a
bunch of different scenarios.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:09.490
For example, if I were to go to
my spreadsheet, and instead of

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:17.580
doing 10 I wanted to do 20
steps then everything changes.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:23.410
And that's why down here after
you get to a certain point the

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:26.130
whole thing just
kind of repeats.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.000
I'll let you think
about why I do that.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.200
Maybe I should have made
a cleaner spreadsheet.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.490
But it doesn't affect the
scatter plot chart that I did.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:38.170
And so this plot in blue, and
you can't see it because the

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.590
purple is almost right over.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:43.560
Actually let me make it
smaller so that you can see.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:48.080
Let's say I only took 6 steps.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.200
Well it's still hard to see the
difference between the two.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.590
Once again the whole point
of this is to see that the

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.570
normal distribution is
a good approximation.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.730
But they're so close that
you can't even see the

00:10:58.730 --> 00:10:59.430
difference on mine.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.705
If you only took four steps,
OK, I think you can see here.

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.460
Let me get my screen draw on.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.830
The blue curve is
right around there.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.910
This is the binomial.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.910
There's only a few points
here, you the points

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.560
only go up to here.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.890
This is if I take 0 steps left,
1 step left, 2 steps left,

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.330
3 steps left, 4 steps left.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.750
And then I plot it and then I
say what's the probability

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.840
using the binomial
distribution?

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.710
And this is my final
position right?

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.460
If I take 0 steps to the left
then I take 4 steps to the

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.090
right so my final position
is at 4, so that's the

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.950
scenario right here.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.220
Let me switch my color back to
yellow, it's easier to see.

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:49.730
If I take 4 steps to the left,
I take 0 steps to the right and

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.780
so my final position is
going to be at minus 4.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.030
It's going to be here.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:58.980
If I take an equal amount of
both, that's this scenario,

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.500
then I'm neutral.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.840
I'm just stuck in the
middle right here.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.360
I take 2 steps to the right and
then I take 2 steps to the left

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.630
or vice versa, I take 2 steps
to the left and then I take

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.760
2 steps right and I
end up right there.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.720
Hopefully that makes
a little sense.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.790
My phone is ringing.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:17.060
I'll ignore that because
the normal distribution

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:17.990
is so important.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:21.050
Actually, my 9 week old son is
watching so this is the first

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.200
time I have a live audience.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.300
He might pick up something
about the normal distribution.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.650
So the blue line right here --
I'll trace it maybe in yellow

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:35.470
so you can see it -- is the
plot of the binomial

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:36.500
distribution.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.620
I connected the lines but you
see the binomial distribution

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.520
look something more like this.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.310
This is the probability
of getting to minus 4.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.770
This is the probability
of going to minus 2.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:55.390
This right here is
the probability of

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.240
ending up nowhere.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:06.030
Then this is the probability of
ending up 2 to the right and

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.510
this is the probability of
ending up 4 to the right.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.670
This is the binomial
distribution, I just plotted

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.860
these points right here.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.490
This is 0.375.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.520
This is 0.375.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.000
That's the height of that.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.320
Now what I wanted to show
you is that the normal

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.530
distribution approximates
the binomial distribution.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:29.550
So this right here, I wanted
to say what does the normal

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:34.880
distribution tell me is the
probability of ending up

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.180
with exactly 0 left steps?

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:42.260
This is a little bit tricky.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.970
The binomial distribution
is a discreet probability

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:45.500
distribution.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.100
You can just look at this chart
or look here and you say, what

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:56.280
is the probability of having
exactly 1 left step and 3 right

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.160
steps which puts me right here?

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.530
Well you just look at this
chart and you say oh, that

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.300
puts me right there.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.100
I just read that probability,
it's actually .25.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.400
And I say oh, I have a 25
percent chance of ending

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:12.010
up 2 steps to the right.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.090
There's a 25 percent chance.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:17.400
The normal distribution
function is a continuous

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.180
probability distribution so
it's a continuous curve.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.130
It looks like that, it's a
bell curve and it goes off

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.400
to infinity and starts
approaching 0 on both sides.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.090
It looks something like that.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.040
This is a continuous
probability distribution.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.800
You can't just take a point
here and say, what's the

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.250
probability that I end
up 2 feet to the right?

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.080
Because if you just say that
there's the actual the

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.580
probability of being exactly --
and you should watch with my

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.170
video on probability density
functions -- but the

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:45.270
probability of being exactly 2
feet to the right, exactly, I

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.500
mean I'm talking to the
atoms, is close to 0.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.430
You actually have to specify
a range around this.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:56.900
What I assume in this
within a half a foot

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.330
in either direction.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:58.690
Right?

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.380
If we're talking about feet.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.840
To figure that out what I did
here is I took the value of

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.280
the probability density
function there.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.600
And I'll show you how
I evaluated that.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.450
And then I multiply that by 1.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.580
So it gives me this area.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.620
And I use that as an
approximation for this area.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.580
If you really want to be
particular about it what you

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.000
would do is you would take the
integral of this curve between

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.750
this point and this point
as a better approximation.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:27.970
We'll do that in the future.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.080
But right now I just want to
give you the intuition that the

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.470
binomial distribution really
does converge to the

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.380
normal distribution.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.290
So how did I get this
number right here?

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:44.880
Well I said, what is the
probability that I think 1 left

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:53.260
step -- I kind of used less
steps as success -- of one?

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:59.080
And that equaled 1 over
the standard deviation.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.450
When I only took 4 steps the
standard deviation was 1.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.780
So 1 over 1.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:04.950
Actually let me change this.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:09.946
Let me change it to
a higher number.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.645
We'll go back to the
example where I'm at 10.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.552
So if this is at 10.

00:16:20.552 --> 00:16:22.560
Let me go back to
my drawing tool.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.980
Let me do this calculation.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.660
Actually, even better let
me do this calculation.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.160
So what's the probability
that I have 2 left steps?

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.845
If I have 2 left steps I took a
total of 10 steps so I'm going

00:16:39.845 --> 00:16:42.800
to have 8 right steps and
that puts me 6 to the right.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.090
So that's this
point right here.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:47.170
So what's that probability?

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.070
How do I figure this out
using the probability

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.270
density function?

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:51.150
How do I figure this height?

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:56.150
Well I say the probability of
taking 2 left steps -- that's

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.130
how I calculate it, if you
actually click on the cell

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:04.150
you'll see that -- is equal to
1 over the standard deviation,

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:11.360
1.581 -- and I just directly
reference the cell there --

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.694
times the square root of 2 pi.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.885
I'm always in awe of the whole
notion of e to the i pi is

00:17:18.885 --> 00:17:19.940
equal to negative 1
and all of that.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.090
But there's another
amazing thing.

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:25.530
That all of a sudden as we take
many trials we have this

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.740
formula that has e and pi in it
and square roots but once again

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.310
these two numbers just
keep showing up.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:33.290
It tells you something about
the order of the universe

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.120
with a capital o.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:42.610
But let's see, times e to
the minus 1/2 times x.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.310
Well x is what we're trying
to calculate, two successes.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:54.780
To to have exactly 2 left,
so it's 2 minus the mean.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:18:01.000
So the mean is five, 2 minus
five divided by the standard

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:10.160
deviation, divided by 1.581,
all of that squared.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.170
That's where this
calculation came from.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.590
So I told you in the last one
this right here just tells

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:22.640
me this value up here.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.310
If I want to know this
exact probability,

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.960
it's the area of this.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.010
And if I just take one
line the are is 0.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:36.010
Remember, in this case you can
only be 2 feet away because

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.770
we're taking very exact steps.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.890
But what the normal
distribution is it's the

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:44.280
continuous probability density
function so it can tell us

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.720
what's the probability of
being 2.183 feet away?

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.900
Which obviously can only happen
if we're taking infinitely

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.330
small steps every time.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:54.420
But that's what it's use is.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.100
It happens when you start
taking an infinite

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:56.940
number of steps.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.310
But it can approximate
the discreet.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.470
And the way I approximate it is
I say oh, what's probability of

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.150
being within a foot of that.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.400
And so I multiply
this height, which I

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.920
calculate here, times 1.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.380
So let's say this has a base of
1, to calculate this area which

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.110
I use as an approximation.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:19.220
So you just multiply that times
1 and that's what you get here.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.240
And I just want to show you.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:26.050
Even with just 10 trials, the
curves, the normal distribution

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.550
here is in purple and the
binomial distribution

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.140
is in blue.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.070
So they're almost right
on top of each other.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:39.860
As you can take many more steps
they almost converge right on

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.320
top of each other and I
encourage you to play

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.700
with the spreadsheets.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.170
Actually, let me show
you that they converge.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.540
There's a convergence worksheet
on this spreadsheet as well if

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.180
you click on the bottom
tab on convergence.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.450
This is the same thing but I
just want to show you what

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.940
happens at any given point.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.550
Let me explain this
spreadsheet to you.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.040
So this is what's
the probability of

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.570
moving left, right?

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.060
So this is just saying, I'm
just fixing a point what's

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.330
the probability -- and you
can change this -- of my

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.120
final position being 10.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:18.720
And this essentially tells you
that if I take 10 moves, for my

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.330
final position to be 10 to the
right, I have to take 10 right

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:22.820
moves and 0 left moves.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:26.230
That's a typo right there, it
should be moves not movest.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:31.770
If I take 20 moves to end up 10
moves to the right then I have

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:34.580
to make 15 right moves
and 5 left moves.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.780
Likewise if I take a total of
80 moves, if I think 80 flips

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.580
of my coin to make me go left
or right, in order end up 10 to

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:46.430
the right, I to take 45 right
moves and 35 left moves in any

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.920
order and it will end up
with 10 to the right.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.920
So what I want to figure out
is, as I start taking a bunch

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:58.650
of total moves -- here I max it
out at 170 -- if I start

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.350
flipping this coin an infinite
number of times, I want to

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.340
figure out what's the
probability that my final

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.080
position is 10 to the right.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.880
And I want to show you that as
you take more and more moves

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.730
the normal distribution becomes
a better and better

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.260
approximation for the
binomial distribution.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.510
So right here, this calculates
the binomial probability, just

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.040
the way we did before and you
can look at the cell

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:21.770
to figure it out.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.170
I used left moves as a success.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.920
So this is 10 choose 0 and
we know what that is.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.840
It's 10 factorial over 0
factorial over 10 minus 0

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:43.210
factorial times 0.5 to the
0 times 0.5 to the 10th.

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.980
That's where that
number comes from.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:52.540
If I go to this one right
here is calculated.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:53.720
Actually let me write
it out because I think

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.290
it's interesting.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:54.867
I have a total of 60 total
moves, so it's 60 factorial

00:21:54.867 --> 00:22:02.990
over, I have to have 25 left
moves so 25 factorial.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:09.510
So that's I'm 60 minus 25
factorial times the probability

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.510
of a left move and have 25 of them, times the

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:17.860
probability of a right move
and I have 35 of those.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.490
So that's just what the
binomial probability

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.390
distribution will tell us.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.220
And then it figures out the
mean and the variance for each

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.340
of those circumstances and you
could look at the formula.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.050
But the mean is just the
probability of having

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:32.880
a left move times the
total number of moves.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.250
The variance is probability of
left times probability of right

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.160
times total number of moves.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.670
And then the normal
probability, once again, I just

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.810
use the normal probability.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.310
So I approximate
it the same way.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.620
And Excel has a normal
distribution function but I

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.750
actually typed in the formula
because I wanted you kind of

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.890
see what was under the covers
for that function that

00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:58.910
Excel actually has.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:04.770
So I actually say what's the
probability of 25 left moves?

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:06.830
No, 45 left moves.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:14.690
So I say the probability of
45 left moves is equal to 1

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.340
over the standard deviation.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.430
So in this situation the
standard deviation is

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:21.720
the square root of 25.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:32.910
So it's five times 2 pi times e
to the minus 1/2 times 45 minus

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:37.790
the mean, minus 50 over the
standard deviation, which we

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.010
figured out was 5, squared.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:45.060
So that tells me the value of
what the normal distribution

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:48.100
tells me for this situation
with this standard deviation

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.020
and this mean and then I
multiply that by 1 -- you don't

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.280
see that in the formula, I
don't actually write times 1 --

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.020
to figure out the area
under the curve.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.380
Because remember it's a
continuous distribution

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.480
function.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.840
This right here just gives me
the value but to figure out the

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.590
probability of being within a
foot of it I have

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.210
to multiply by 1.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:06.340
I'm approximating really.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.320
I really should take the
integral from there to there

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.900
but this little rectangle is
a pretty good approximation.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.860
In this chart I show you that
as the total number of moves

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:20.560
gets larger and larger the
difference between what the

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.330
normal probability distribution
tells us and the binomial

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.060
probability of distribution
tells us, gets smaller and

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.930
smaller in terms of the
probability of you ending up

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.100
to 10 moves to the right.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.040
And you can change
this number here.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.230
Let me change it
just to show you.

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:38.370
You could say what's the
probability of being

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:43.670
15 moves to the right?

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.280
I think that something is
happening with the floating

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.180
point error because when you
get to large factorials I

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.770
think something weird
happens out here.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.600
You may just have to
get even further out.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.820
For 10 you can see clearly that
it converges and I'll trying to

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.043
figure out why I was getting
those weird saw tooth patterns.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:35.110
Maybe while I do screen capture
something weird is happening.

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.570
The whole point of this was to
show you that if you want to

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.770
figure out the probability of
being 10 moves to the right, as

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:44.840
you take more and more flips
of your coin the normal

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:49.840
distribution becomes a much
better approximation for the

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.730
actual binomial distribution.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.220
And as you approach infinity
they actually converge

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.120
to each other.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.560
Anyway, that's all
for this video.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.290
I'll actually do several
more videos on the normal

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:02.027
distributions because it is
such an important concept.

00:26:02.027 --> 00:26:02.380
See you soon.
