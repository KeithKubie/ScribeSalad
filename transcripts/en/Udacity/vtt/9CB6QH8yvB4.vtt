00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.730
&gt;&gt; That's clearly the door handle, but there's no perceived affordance.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.350
So it's a signifier that this is a handle, but it's only

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.520
half a signifier. It tells where the handle is, but not

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.310
what to do, so, I don't know, how do you open it?

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.970
&gt;&gt; Hi, Don. How are you? What are you doing with my car?

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.550
&gt;&gt; Trying to understand

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.810
how to open it. The hell, what did you do?

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.390
&gt;&gt; Well I have the key, so it

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.650
knows that I'm coming, so it automatically opens.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.454
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's clever. This is a really good example of hiding

00:00:39.454 --> 00:00:44.770
a perceived affordance. Hiding, the signifier, because you don't need to have it

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.240
there. The owner of the car knows how to use it, and when

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.820
the owner of the car comes near with a key, it automatically opens,

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.110
you can grab the handle.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.360
That's very clever design.
