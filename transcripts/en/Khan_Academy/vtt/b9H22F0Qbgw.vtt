00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.900
Consider the following
coordinate pairs.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.608
And they give us a
bunch right over here.

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:07.380
Which of those pairs
is not graphed below?

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.870
So let's see, 3
comma negative 2.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.560
So 3 comma negative 2,
well, actually, that

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.630
looks like that first
one is not graphed.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.719
So 3 comma negative
2 isn't graphed.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.510
And you can verify that
all of these others

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.426
do seem to be graphed.

00:00:21.426 --> 00:00:23.515
4 comma negative
8 is right there.

00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:26.830
Negative 8 comma 3
is right over here.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.680
4 comma 6 is right there.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.410
And negative 1 comma
0 is right there.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.160
So let's do a couple
more of these.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.721
So is negative 5
comma 0 graphed?

00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:39.220
Yep.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.175
It's right over there.

00:00:40.175 --> 00:00:43.930
Negative 4 comma positive
5 should be there.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.210
So that's not graphed.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.620
So let me just select that one.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.090
Let's do one more of these.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.090
Negative 8 comma 4, so negative
8 comma 4, we got lucky.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.586
The first one is not
graphed-- negative 8 comma 4.

00:00:59.586 --> 00:01:01.473
And we're done.
