00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:05.350
Whether you say tomato or tomato, it’s clear
that your accent is a defining feature of

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.580
who you are.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.730
Everyone has an accent (heck, even goats have
regional ways of saying BAAH), but what’s

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.030
the science behind language acquisition and
does your accent say something about you?

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.210
In an American survey, 47% of adults found
British accents to be sophisticated, while

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.250
51% thought New York accents were rude; Southern
accents were considered nice but possibly

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.119
uneducated, while New England accents were
considered intelligent.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.640
But it turns out that humans have a bias towards
others who sound like them or have the same

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.640
accent.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.989
Of course, it’s important to distinguish
between a native language accent and an additional

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.420
language accent.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.730
English native language accents depend on
factors such as geographic location and socioeconomic

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.730
status.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.530
For example a cockney accent of the working
class London is markedly different than the

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.410
Queen’s Received Pronunciation.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.600
However, when it comes to non-native language
accents, things are more complicated.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.829
If you decide to move to Spain and learn Spanish
as an English speaker, you will always speak

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:08.700
with an English accent - even if you remain
their for decades.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.659
After the age of 12, the length of residence
has almost no effect on your accent.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.149
Studies pinpoint the ideal age as 6 years
old, with diminishing ability from that point

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.149
forward.

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.200
Interestingly, some stroke patients wake with
an accent completely different to their original

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.200
voice.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.060
This condition is known as the ‘Foreign
Accent Syndrome’ and results from damage

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.270
to the insula region of the brain which is
responsible for language processing.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.520
One integral aspect of language is the phoneme.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.229
Phonemes are the different sound units we
use to make up words - some of which are unique

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.670
to different languages.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.749
For example, the phonemes with TH (th and
th) as in words like ‘the’ and ‘thing’

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:49.969
do not exist in German, making it difficult
for German speakers to pronounce these words

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:50.969
properly.

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.280
Conversely, there are many phonemes in other
languages that as English speakers we cannot

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.380
pronounce or even hear properly.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.380
In a groundbreaking study, 32 American and
32 Japanese six month old babies listened

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.959
to a recorder play “la la la” repeatedly.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.569
When the recording switched to “la la ra”
a toy to the side would light up and play

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.569
a musical tune.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.150
The babies were primed to understand that
recognizing the difference between “la”

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.020
and “ra” lead to an audio-visual reward
and both the American and Japanese 6 month

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.950
old babies were able to tell the difference
and anticipate the toy reward when necessary.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.790
But “La” and “ra” are phonemes that
do not exist in the Japanese language.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.209
When this study was replicated with 10-12
month old babies, the Japanese babies could

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.540
not tell the difference between these uniquely
English phonemes, showing that a critical

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.560
period for recognizing phonemes and brain
development is at merely six months old.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.400
If you try and learn a language, regardless
of your age, synaptic connections are made,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.000
which ultimately create a denser grey matter
and stronger white matter networks.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.730
In fact, those who have grown up in bilingual
households are consistently more sensitive

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.800
to subtle language differences compared to
their monolingual counterparts.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.659
Brain scans have shown that bilingual babies
have stronger brain responses in their orbital

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.480
and prefrontal cortices, which are areas linked
to focus and problem-solving abilities.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.620
But have you ever wondered why so many people
hate the sound of their own voice?

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.019
We break down the science and challenge some
people to come to terms with their own voice

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.890
in our AsapTHOUGHT video.
