00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.206
My name is Dr Jenifer Zeligs. And I am the director of Training and Research

00:00:04.206 --> 00:00:09.196
for a Special Program here at Cal State University. Which functions like a

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:14.105
teaching aquarium for students from all over the world. To come and learn about

00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:17.887
how to use animal behavior modification to take the best possible care of

00:00:17.887 --> 00:00:22.831
animals. And work with them in zoo and aquarium environments, as well as in

00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:24.885
research facilities.

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:27.288
&gt;&gt; So, and you're writing a book, as you're an expert in the field. What was that

00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:27.555
book?

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:31.776
&gt;&gt; it's called Animal Training 101, the complete and practical guide to the art

00:00:31.776 --> 00:00:36.340
and science of behavior modification. And I hope it'll be a good guide for

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.009
people who are interested in animal training and behavior in general.

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.806
&gt;&gt; Wonderful. So, do you use the ABCs of operant conditioning in your work?

00:00:43.806 --> 00:00:47.706
&gt;&gt; Yes, so the ABCs of operant conditioning is one of the classic ways that people

00:00:47.706 --> 00:00:53.695
explain the idea of how behavior is developed. And A stands for antecedent, B

00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:58.420
behavior, and C consequences. This is the method by which behavior is created,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.146
whether I'm doing it intentionally, or whether it's happening on its own in the

00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:09.580
natural world. The antecedent to trained behavior is a cue. The antecedent in

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.164
the process of training is usually a type of, of conditioning technique that

00:01:13.164 --> 00:01:17.979
you'd use, for example you'll see us using targets. This is a thing that we can

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.085
use to cause and create the behavior that we then want to see, which is the B.

00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:25.685
And then the C, the consequence, is the reward, the reinforcement, that

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:31.811
influences the animal to want to do that behavior again in the future. Another

00:01:31.811 --> 00:01:34.520
type of consequence can be a punisher, so there's two types of, well there's

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.752
actually 3 types of consequences. Reinforcer, which increases the frequency of

00:01:38.752 --> 00:01:42.967
the behavior. Neutral, which does nothing to the frequency of behavior. And

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:45.790
punisher, which decreases the frequency of behavior.
