00:00:01.385 --> 00:00:02.900
- [Instructor] In previous videos, we took

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.631
this bivariate data and we
calculated the correlation

00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:09.436
coefficient, and just
as a bit of a review,

00:00:09.436 --> 00:00:11.874
we have the formula here, and it looks

00:00:11.874 --> 00:00:14.475
a bit intimidating, but
in that video we saw

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:18.642
all it is is an average of
the product of the z scores

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.119
for each of those pairs.

00:00:23.077 --> 00:00:25.509
And as we said, if r is equal to one,

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.016
you have a perfect positive correlation.

00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:30.493
If r is equal to negative
one, you have a perfect

00:00:30.493 --> 00:00:33.528
negative correlation, and
if r is equal to zero,

00:00:33.528 --> 00:00:36.614
you don't have a correlation, but for this

00:00:36.614 --> 00:00:40.781
particular bivariate dataset,
we got an r of 0.946,

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:46.665
which means we have a fairly
strong positive correlation.

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:49.351
What we're going to do
on this video is build

00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:52.735
on this notion and actually
come up with the equation

00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:56.402
for the least squares
line that tries to fit

00:00:57.325 --> 00:00:58.408
these points.

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:02.717
So before I do that, let's just visualize

00:01:02.717 --> 00:01:05.199
some of the statistics that we have here

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.293
for these data points.

00:01:06.293 --> 00:01:08.300
We clearly have the four
data points plotted,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.798
but let's plot the statistics for x.

00:01:10.798 --> 00:01:13.654
So the sample mean and the
sample standard deviation

00:01:13.654 --> 00:01:16.821
for x are here in red, and actually

00:01:18.298 --> 00:01:20.396
let me box these off
in red so that you know

00:01:20.396 --> 00:01:23.250
that's what is going on
here, so the sample mean

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.649
for x, it's easy to calculate
one plus two plus two

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.291
plus three divided by four,
is eight divided by four,

00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:32.867
which is two, so we have x
equals two right over here.

00:01:32.867 --> 00:01:34.991
And then this is one
sample standard deviation

00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:37.779
above the mean, this is one
sample standard deviation

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:41.184
below the mean, and then
we could do the same thing

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:42.851
for the y variables.

00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:47.980
So the mean is three,
and this is one sample

00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:53.311
standard deviation for y above the mean

00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:57.939
and this is one standard
deviation for y below the mean.

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.250
And visualizing these means, especially

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.934
their intersection and also
their standard deviations,

00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:06.520
will help us build an
intuition for the equation

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.687
of the least squares line.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.973
So generally speaking,
the equation for any line

00:02:11.973 --> 00:02:15.223
is going to be y is equal to mx plus b,

00:02:17.047 --> 00:02:19.906
where this is the slope and
this is the y intercept.

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:23.535
For the regression line, we'll
put a little hat over it.

00:02:23.535 --> 00:02:25.869
So this, you would literally say y hat,

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:27.960
this tells you that this
is a regression line

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.462
that we're trying to fit to these points.

00:02:30.462 --> 00:02:34.203
First, what is going to be the slope.

00:02:34.203 --> 00:02:38.120
Well the slope is going
to be r times the ratio

00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:42.126
between the sample standard
deviation in the y direction

00:02:42.126 --> 00:02:46.407
over the sample standard
deviation in the x direction.

00:02:46.407 --> 00:02:48.025
This might not seem intuitive at first,

00:02:48.025 --> 00:02:49.677
but we'll talk about it in a few seconds

00:02:49.677 --> 00:02:51.334
and hopefully it'll make a lot more sense,

00:02:51.334 --> 00:02:53.424
but the next thing we
need to know is alright,

00:02:53.424 --> 00:02:55.474
if we can calculate our
slope, how do we calculate

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:57.335
our y intercept?

00:02:57.335 --> 00:02:59.789
Well like you first
learned in Algebra one,

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:02.384
you can calculate the y
intercept if you already know

00:03:02.384 --> 00:03:05.314
the slope by saying well
what point is definitely

00:03:05.314 --> 00:03:07.371
going to be on my line?

00:03:07.371 --> 00:03:10.157
And for a least squares regression line,

00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:11.875
you're definitely going to have the point

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:16.078
sample mean of x comma sample mean of y.

00:03:16.078 --> 00:03:20.290
So you're definitely going
to go through that point.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.510
So before I even calculate
for this particular example

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.378
where in previous videos
we calculated the r

00:03:26.378 --> 00:03:30.173
to be 0.946 or roughly equal to that,

00:03:30.173 --> 00:03:32.959
let's just think about what's going on.

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.620
So our least squares line
is definitely going to go

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.203
through that point.

00:03:38.574 --> 00:03:42.741
Now if r were one, if we had a
perfect positive correlation,

00:03:43.597 --> 00:03:46.967
then our slope would be
the standard deviation

00:03:46.967 --> 00:03:50.346
of y over the standard deviation of x.

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:52.450
So if you were to start at
this point and if you were

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.714
to run your standard
deviation of x and rise

00:03:56.714 --> 00:03:59.283
your standard deviation of y,

00:03:59.283 --> 00:04:00.995
well with a perfect positive correlation,

00:04:00.995 --> 00:04:03.578
your line would look like this.

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.458
And that makes a lot of sense.

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:10.089
Because you're looking at your spread of y

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:13.935
over your spread of x,
if r were equal to one,

00:04:13.935 --> 00:04:17.128
this would be your slope,
standard deviation of y

00:04:17.128 --> 00:04:19.478
over standard deviation of x.

00:04:19.478 --> 00:04:21.095
That has parallels to when you first learn

00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:22.202
about slope.

00:04:22.202 --> 00:04:25.042
Change in y over change
in x, you're seeing

00:04:25.042 --> 00:04:28.060
you could say the average spread in y

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.268
over the average spread in x.

00:04:30.268 --> 00:04:32.705
And this would be the case when r is one,

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.114
so let me write that down.

00:04:34.114 --> 00:04:37.633
This would be the case
if r is equal to one.

00:04:37.633 --> 00:04:40.654
What if r were equal to negative one?

00:04:40.654 --> 00:04:43.482
It would look like this.

00:04:43.482 --> 00:04:44.981
That would be our line if we had

00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:48.133
a perfect negative correlation.

00:04:48.133 --> 00:04:50.104
Now what if r were zero?

00:04:50.104 --> 00:04:53.348
Then your slope would be
zero and then your line

00:04:53.348 --> 00:04:58.327
would just be this line, y
is equal to the mean of y,

00:04:58.327 --> 00:05:02.229
so you would just go through
that right over there.

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.417
But now let's think about this scenario.

00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:08.084
In this scenario, our
r is 0.946, so we have

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.245
a fairly strong correlation,
this is pretty close to one,

00:05:14.245 --> 00:05:18.147
and so if you were to
take 0.946 and multiply it

00:05:18.147 --> 00:05:21.559
by this ratio, if you
were to move forward in x

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:25.392
by the standard deviation
in x, for this case,

00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:28.897
how much would you move up in y?

00:05:28.897 --> 00:05:33.064
Well you would move up r times
the standard deviation of y.

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.051
And as we said if r is one,
you would get all the way

00:05:36.051 --> 00:05:38.974
up to this perfect
correlation line, but here

00:05:38.974 --> 00:05:41.848
it's a 0.946, so you would get up

00:05:41.848 --> 00:05:45.379
about 95% of the way to that.

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:46.962
And so our line without even looking

00:05:46.962 --> 00:05:51.129
at the equation is going to
look something like this,

00:05:52.859 --> 00:05:56.400
which we can see is a pretty
good fit for those points.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.590
I'm not proving it here in this video.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.989
But now that we have an
intuition for these things,

00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:02.380
hopefully you'll appreciate
this isn't just coming

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.486
out of nowhere into some strange formula,

00:06:04.486 --> 00:06:07.335
it actually makes intuitive
sense, let's calculate it

00:06:07.335 --> 00:06:10.760
for this particular set of data.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.927
M is going to be equal to
r, 0.946, times the sample

00:06:16.945 --> 00:06:20.862
standard deviation of y,
2.160, over the sample

00:06:23.027 --> 00:06:25.610
standard deviation of x, 0.816.

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:29.729
We can get our calculator
out to calculate that,

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:32.146
so we have 0.946 times 2.160,

00:06:40.443 --> 00:06:43.526
divided by 0.816, it gets us to 2.50,

00:06:49.498 --> 00:06:51.314
let's just round to the nearest hundredth

00:06:51.314 --> 00:06:54.780
for simplicity here, so
this is approximately equal

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.613
to 2.50.

00:06:59.972 --> 00:07:02.005
And so how do we figure
out the y intercept?

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:04.459
Well remember, we go through this point,

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:08.459
so we're going to have
2.50 times our x mean,

00:07:10.182 --> 00:07:13.099
so our x mean is two, times two,

00:07:14.087 --> 00:07:15.758
remember this right
over here is our x mean,

00:07:15.758 --> 00:07:18.675
plus b, plus b is going to be equal

00:07:20.859 --> 00:07:25.233
to our y mean, our y mean we
see right over here is three,

00:07:25.233 --> 00:07:26.976
and so what do we get?

00:07:26.976 --> 00:07:30.059
We get three is equal to five plus b.

00:07:35.693 --> 00:07:38.305
And so what is b, well
if you subtract five

00:07:38.305 --> 00:07:42.302
from both sides, you get b
is equal to negative two.

00:07:42.302 --> 00:07:44.439
And so there you have it.

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:47.085
The equation for our
regression line, we deserve

00:07:47.085 --> 00:07:49.689
a little bit of a drum
roll here, we would say

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:53.363
y hat, the hat tells us
that this is the equation

00:07:53.363 --> 00:07:57.280
for a regression line,
is equal to 2.50 times x

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:05.932
minus two, minus two, and we are done.
