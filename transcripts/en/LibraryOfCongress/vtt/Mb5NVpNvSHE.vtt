00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.400
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.960
My name is Betsy Peterson.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.230
I'm the Director of the American
Folklife Center here at the Library

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.130
of Congress, and on
behalf of the staff,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.200
I want to welcome you all today.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.460
It's a gorgeous day here,
and I'm really pleased

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.160
that you all are here
to share it with us.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.920
This is a special program, part
of our Homegrown Concert Series,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.470
part of our Lecture Series, and
it's an opportunity for us to have,

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.400
for us to engage in a
conversation with individuals

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.730
who have been awarded the
National Heritage Fellowship,

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.390
which is the highest honor
given to traditional artists

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.270
in the United States by the
National Endowment for the Arts,

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.250
and we're thrilled to have
actually not just two;

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.540
we have three here today with
us, and that's very exciting.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.600
All the way from California,
we Roy and PJ Hirabayashi,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.240
the leaders of San Jose Taiko,
and we have Daniel Sheehy,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.010
the Ethno Music College's Director
Emeritus of Smithsonian Folkways,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.700
and actually, a National
Endowment Heritage Fellow

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.190
for Cultural Advocacy.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.240
So, he's going to be doing some of
this cultural advocacy work today,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.100
interviewing our artists here.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.060
Just as a little bit of background
the Homegrown Series is an

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.470
opportunity for the American
Folklife Center to work

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.030
with cultural specialists
folklorists at the Music colleges,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.430
artists around the country
to identify the very best

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.570
of traditional arts, music,
dance, narrative, arts,

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.420
and work with individuals
to bring artists here

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.560
to share their traditions with
all of you and to consent,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.160
agree to be recorded
for our archives.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.180
And this session today
is no different.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.510 position:56%
It will be recorded, and this
conversation will be in our archives

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.090
so that future generations
can access it,

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.140
and people around the world will
be able to view and listen to it.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.680 position:56%
So, with that little caveat, let me
ask you to turn off your cell phone,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.060
if you have such a
thing and have it on,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.200
or else you will memorialized
in our archive as well.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.930
I also want to thank,
actually, while I'm on the topic

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.660
of acknowledgements and
talking about partners

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.680 position:56%
and individuals we work with, I
also want to thank Mark Rooney today

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.580
of Washington, DC,
who was very gracious,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.470
for learning his drums today

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.250
because I believe the
San Jose Taiko Drums are

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.570
over on the mall right now
and need to stay there.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:25.180
So, but at any rate, so our
program today, acknowledged as one

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.480
of the Premiere Music
Ensembles in the United States,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.850
San Jose Taiko was founded in 1973
by young Asian Americans searching

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.770
to convey their experiences as
third generation Japanese Americans

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.850
and inspired by traditional
Japanese drumming.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.660
Company performers express
the beauty and harmony

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.400
of the human spirit through
the voice of the Taiko drum,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.510
and as they strive to create new
dimensions in music, movement,

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.460 position:56%
and tradition, San Jose Taiko's
performances feature visual elements

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.570
in choreography requiring
physical strength,

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.310
endurance, focus, and energy.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.200
And the members of the group
participate in composing,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.280
choreographing, designing,
and fabricating costumes

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.370
and hand crafting the drums.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.240
This collective effort
produces a performance

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.260
that highlights group
unity and purpose.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.650
In 1987, San Jose Taiko became one

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.490
of the first American
Taiko ensembles

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.990
to be invited to perform in Japan.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.550
They have performed in
a wide range of venues,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.720
from small community
centers throughout California

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.460
and schools, to Carnegie Hall.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.170
In addition to offering
extensive educational

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.530
and community outreach programs,
San Jose Taiko is currently working

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.180
on establishing a Taiko
Conservatory, the first of its kind

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.320
in the United States,
which is exciting.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.350
I hope we'll hear more about that.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.350
Roy and PJ are credited for
developing a holistic art form

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.390
that embraces artistic excellence,

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.700
while also encouraging
San Jose Taiko members

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.130
to become leaders and
community builders.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.390
So, please, let's welcome
Roy and PJ Hirabayashi,

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.510
National Heritage Fellows,
and Dan Sheehy.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:29.630
[ Audience Applause ]

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.770
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Thank you, Betsy.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.440
You said everything
I was going to say,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.580
so I don't have anything
left to say.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.880 position:56%
Thank you all for coming here today.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.660
We can't have this
presentation without you all here,

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.510
so you're very much a part of this.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.970
And I have to say, just
to start off myself,

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.980
that I'm so incredibly humbled to
be here on this little platform

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.140
with two of the most articulate
activist traditional artists

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.840
that this country, or maybe
beyond, has ever produced.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.600
And so, it's I just feel
so moved and humbled

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.130
to be here with you also.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.630
Thank you for taking the time to
come up to the Library of Congress.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.930
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Thank you.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.230
[Inaudible]

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.530
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi:
He's totally honored.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.830
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Okay.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.060
So, why don't we start
with a why question.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.730
Why Taiko?

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.870
And you know, this goes
back to, as Betsy mentioned

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.730
in her opening remarks there,
there were things happening

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.880
in the late 1960's and
early 1970's in California,

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.890
particularly the Bay Area
perhaps, in particular.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.700
Can you set the scene and
give us a sense of why?

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.000
Why are we here today?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.300
Why we have these drums?

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.600
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Sure.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.440
Well, yes, in the late
1960's, I think probably some

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.360
of you can remember at
that time was really a lot

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.240
of happenings happening
in our country.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.450
The Social Justice
Movement was really,

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.730
the Civil Rights Movement
was really active;

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.950
the Anti-War Movement was going
on, and so at that time it was also

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.670
for a lot of people of color,
it was a search of identity,

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.640
asking the question of
what is my heritage,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.960
what is my ethnic background,
where do my family,

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.050
where does my family come from,
and how do we fit here in America.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.510
I'm Sansei, third generation; so,
my grandparents emigrated here

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.700
from Japan, from Hiroshima
[phonetic] area.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.330
My parents were born here
in the United States,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.400
but they were actually sent back to
Japan to be raised from elementary

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.610
to high school, and then came back

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.320
to the US just before
World War II broke out.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.510
So, they were primary Japanese
speaking when they returned

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.900
to the US, so they're
considered what's called,

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.180 position:56%
they're Nisei second generation, but
they're considered Kepay [phonetic],

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.190
raised in Japan but
American citizens.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.210
Sansei, I was born right after
World War II in the early 1950's,

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.730
and so at that time for us,
for me, it was really kind

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.030
of the search of who I was.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.470
I was a Japanese American,
and within that context

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.150
of what was going on
again in the late 1960s.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.240
That was the beginning of
Ethnic Studies on campuses.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.960 position:56%
Again, the Anti-War Movement was
going on, the war in Southeast Asia;

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.700
so, for a lot of us, it was just
trying to search how that identity

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.000
or search for what we were

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.910
as Japanese Americans was
really kind of what's going on.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.270
And so, I've always loved music,
playing music in different ways,

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.190
and so when I discovered the
Taiko, the Japanese drum,

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:30.520
I quickly discovered or found that
this was a voice that was missing

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.120
in my life because growing up
there was no musical voice for me

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.610
that really connected to my
heritage as a Japanese American..

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.910
PJ can answer that.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.890
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Can I just ask
when was that very first moment

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.520
that you heard or saw a Taiko drum?

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.750
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Well, actually,
growing up, I heard Taiko playing

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.770
in our festivals in our,
in the Japanese community,

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:57.400
but for me to really connect to it,
it was in actually the early 1970's

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.430
when I first heard a San
Francisco Taiko group,

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.730
and there's another group

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.530
in Los Angeles called the
Keyano [phonetic] Taiko.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:07.060
We started San Jose Taiko
in 1973, so it was around

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:13.080
and that really it's connecting
to the ideas around 1972, 1973 on.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.380
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Great.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.680
Thanks. PJ?

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.120
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: Ditto.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:24.770
[Laugh] Just to kind of cap on our
similarities, my grandparents are

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:32.150 position:56%
from Japan, and my parents were born
in California, and I grew up in,

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.030
well, I was born in 1950, so right

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.720
after World War II, I
went to public school.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:47.210
That was 1955-ish, and I was
the only Asian face at school,

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.900
and I was quickly reminded
that I was already different.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.730
And there was something about going
to school and already being cast

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.490
out as being different and not
included and the separation

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.350 position:56%
of like why am I not being included.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:06.550
So, there was already this very
seething feeling of inferiority,

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:11.590
less than, no self-esteem, and
that's how I actually felt,

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:17.090
you know, not being included
for a long period of time.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:21.800
And so, just kind of quickly
forward, to have heard Taiko

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:27.490
in the early 1970's, all of
a sudden became like "Wow!"

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:33.120 position:56%
I saw this energy, you know, and
they were, there were men and women.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.530
They were all dressed
up in happi coat,

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:36.830
and in San Francisco [inaudible].

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:44.010
By the way, Sage Tanaka is
also a Heritage Fellow too.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:52.560 position:56%
And to be able to see this unabashed
energy coming from the stage,

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.630
this expression, and immediately
it's like I want to do that;

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.640
almost like, I can do that.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.710
How can I do that?

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:07.770
And so it was like that exploration
of, okay, I want to find Taiko,

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.120
how I could become like this.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.930
I always use the word "ballistic,"
you know, being a woman too,

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:21.730
it's like you're always, and Asian
woman too, so ballistic was like,

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:26.380
okay, let go, you know, this
is self-expression at its best,

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.690
and I don't have to talk.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.820
This is the way I'm going
to communicate with you.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.870 position:56%
This is how loud I'm going to become
that I could not show you as I

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.270
as growing up as a little girl.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.200
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Were women very
much a part of the Taiko scene

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.840
that you were exposed to back then?

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.520
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: In the very
beginning, it was very prominent.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.140
I mean, I would say that,
well, for San Jose Taiko,

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:53.780
as we started in 1973, we
were like about 85% women.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.080
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Women.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.380
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: Yeah.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.680
I think we were all
searching for something,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.560
whether we were conscious
of it or no.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.500
You know, it's like that
freedom of expression,

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.880 position:56%
and people coming together and doing
something and exploring together;

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.760
not, you know, there is
kind of root culture,

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.650
but how does it affect us
living here in America,

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.050
how does it translate,
how is it different?

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:17.350
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Right.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.380
Could you, this might be, is
this the time to give us a sense

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.890
of that wild moment, what you
heard that sort of grabbed you

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.190 position:56%
and pulled you into this, right now?

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.780
This is part of our
plan, just so you know.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.700
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Well,
this is a great opportunity

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.520
for us just to demonstrate a piece.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.500
This piece is called Celebration.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.100
It's a duet piece that
PJ and I wrote.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.710
I can't even remember
when it was we wrote this,

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.090
but it's a number of years back.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.110
But it'll feature so many
small drums that we have here.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.690
The Taiko comes in many
different sizes; unfortunately,

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.670
we could not bring some of
the large ones here today,

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.270
but we have a nice sample
from Mark Rooney to show you.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.070
Again, Celebration.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.330
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: We were
pleased that [inaudible]

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:17.430
and I to have a little class
before you all came here today,

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.020
so I think we'll refrain, right.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.900
We'll just leave it to PJ.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:29.460
So, we've moving from the why
a little bit into the what.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.730
So, you heard a little bit of
the what, and you're looking

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.030
at some of the what here.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.710
Can you tell us what,
well, maybe what is Taiko?

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:41.700
Maybe we just start there
and kind of go, move out.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.000
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi:
Well, first of all,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.900
Taiko is the Japanese word
for the Japanese drum.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.350
So, it refers to all the different
size drums you actually will see

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.370
in Japan or here in
the United States now,

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.900
and actually you could see just
from our small collection here

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.920
that we're using there's a variety

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.100
of different styles
that the drum comes in.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.770
And as I mentioned before,
they actually be much larger.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.850
In Japan, or even here in the US,
you'll see drums sort of up to four

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.660
or five feet in diameter,
weighing 3, 4,

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.150 position:56%
500 pounds to this much smaller drum

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.230
that can actually be
held in one hand.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.440
And so, what we have in collection

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.200
in general is the barrel
style Taiko,

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.890
which they call the Narvado
[phonetic] drum, See,

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.320
it's tacked on with tacks in
order to put the cowhide on there,

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.970 position:56%
and the smaller drums, the real
small drum, we call the Shime Taiko.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.750
It's double-headed with rope,
and you could adjust the tension

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.170
and the pitch with the rope,

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.990
and then the little bit longer
barrel drum in the middle,

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.610
we call kettle drum, which
is also barrel style,

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:38.150
made out of flat woods.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:42.850
And those drums also are tied by
rope with the different heads.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:45.650
And those, those kettles, also
come in many different sizes,

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.420
much smaller ones that you
carry around to larger ones

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.050
that would sit on a stand.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.830
But in Japan, again, or here in
the United States, we use a variety

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.120
of different drums in order to
create the different pitches,

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.830
styles, uses within
movement or dance also,

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:03.980
and in order to really create the
music that we want to be doing.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: So, maybe what
we can explain is what you're seeing

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.390
today as kind of contemporary.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:14.540
So, what we've been able to infuse
in our style is some understanding

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.740
and respect for the roots of
where Taiko come from, from Japan.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.890
And in Japan, Taiko
was really never used

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.220
for art sake; it was for life sake.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:32.090
It's to accompany the prayers and
chanting for good harvest and rain,

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:40.510
and also to chase away
the insects from crops,

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:47.510
and in time of bountiful
harvest there was celebration;

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:50.050
so, for a good harvest.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:54.210
Even warriors would use the sound
of Taiko to frighten their enemy.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:59.670 position:56%
The villagers would use Taiko to
have people congregate in the center

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:05.230
of the village when there
was a time to come together.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:10.200
But Kumi-daiko, K-u-m-i, in
Japanese it means "ensemble."

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.590
Ensemble playing really
did not become popular

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:18.520
until after World War II,
and I think this is all

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:23.210
from the same reason like why we
play joyfully for a celebration.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:28.250
This is after World War II, and in
Japan there were some Taiko players

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:32.650
that they felt that, wow, we need
to kind of reinvigorate to become,

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:38.740
you know, enliven, uplift ourselves
for after a harsh World War,

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:44.290
and that's how Kumi-daiko started
to become popular in Japan.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:48.400
So, it's, we're not talking
about ancient Kumi-daiko playing.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.340
So, that's what really
infused our interest.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.900
Like how do we use this as a
tool of bringing people together,

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.090
building community,
and like expression?

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:01.670
There was no way.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.110
Remember, when we started a group

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:08.270
in the 1970's we didn't have any
cell phones or computers, so LPs,

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:14.240
you know, we would buy these
LPs from Japan and play it;

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.010
and yet there was something
about it that we felt that, wow,

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:21.760
let's recognize these rich
traditions from Japan,

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.000
but let's just don't copy.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.620
You know, we just don't want to
copy or appropriate those songs.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:32.490
Let's create music that comes
from us, you know, and let's also,

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:37.340
we didn't, we couldn't afford
drums -- quickly going back,

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:42.200
we didn't afford drums from Japan
because one small drum would cost

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:47.760
like $3000 to $5000 just
for a group to have.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.520
So, one of our predecessor groups,

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.080
Sansei Taiko down in Los
Angeles, was very innovative.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:02.350
They took a wine barrel that they
bought in Los Angeles and wanted

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:07.900 position:56%
to make Taiko become accessible like
more through the Buddhist Temple

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:12.270
and activities to draw in young
people because there was kind

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:16.640
of like young people were losing
interest in Buddhist religion.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.950
So, Sansei Taiko,

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.250
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Kinnaro.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.300
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi:
Kinnaro Taiko, excuse me,

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:30.930
devised these wine barrel Taiko,
which actually is the predecessor

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:35.750
of American Taiko, and
that's what you see here.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.340
It's actually a combination.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.090
I think there's two drums, the
small pitch drums that are roped

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:44.850
from Japan, and the other three
drums are actually made here

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:46.390
in the States.

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.220
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: So, if you
had your full group here,

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:53.750
here we have one, two, three,
four, five drums, two players,

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.060
how many drums and how many
people would we have here

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.460
for a typical San Jose Taiko?

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.790
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: For San
Jose Taiko, I think we have

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.230
about 22 performing members.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:07.460
There's occasions at home where
we'll play with all members

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:11.320
and actually fill up an
entire room out on the stage,

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.480
and so, and a variety of drums.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.290
So, when we tour, actually,

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:20.310
we're touring with a good almost 20
different drums of different sizes

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.990
in order to do one
performance concert.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:27.950
There's a base, I guess, style
or ensemble drum, which is about,

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.700
I guess, about 10 pieces
minimum that we would use,

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.900
but they're much larger
than what we have here.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.200
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Mm-hmm.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.780
Okay. Yeah, I was wondering
about that

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.090
because I thought I could hear
the [inaudible] Stradivarius

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:39.390
Strings resonating.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:40.690
[Laughing] Okay.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.910
I just wondered if we
have like 10 more drums,

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.350
what would happen to
the glass over there.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:53.730
So, help us out here, so when
we're listening to you all perform,

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:57.560
or San Jose Taiko perform, what
should we pay attention to?

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.200 position:56%
I mean, obviously, there's movement.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.080
There's a visual aspect there.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.920
There's sound, there's
quite a bit going on.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.390 position:56%
Give us something to grab onto here.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:13.990
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: Well, I
would say, as a viewer audience,

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:18.250
just listen with open
mind and open heart.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:25.080
Don't categorize us as saying,
that's not authentic from Japan.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:32.900 position:56%
And I think also what we really want
to have people experience is kind

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:38.920
of finding your own story, how
in our explanation of the songs

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:44.030
that are created by individuals
within San Jose Taiko Company,

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:48.300
there's a backstory to every song.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:52.760
So, you make it your, we won't
tell you exactly what to think.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.160
So, we want you to
kind of like imagine.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:01.340
But I really love at the end
of a performance at a concert

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.270
in a theatre, and we go to the
lobby and thank the audience

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.540
for coming out, we will
often hear people say,

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.030
"Oh, wow, you made me cry."

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.600
Or, "Wow! I'm just
feeling so great."

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:18.150
And you go, "Thank
you, and I'm sorry."

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:22.600 position:56%
No, but there's something about
that experience that you touch them.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.130
You know, if there was that tear
that came up, there was something

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:28.910
that they were able to experience.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:30.660
So, it's kind of like, yeah,

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.420
we leave it out for the
expression to speak for itself.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:34.720
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: We're
like that people got to decide

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.010
for themselves what they want to
take from it without a certain,

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.520
being guided in a certain
direction, right.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.590
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: I do say
that like in the philosophy

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.100
of San Jose Taiko that
there is purpose

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.590
and intention behind
everything that we do,

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:52.380
and even though we don't tell you,
it's a little way through our,

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.500
you know, selves that we're
communicating, you know, this,

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:01.470
the principles of playing
together as an ensemble of oneness,

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:07.370
of open heart, open mind.

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:11.060
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Bessie Peterson
mentioned that the opening remarks

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.090
that I was trained as
an Ethnomusicologist,

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:17.510
and one of the things that I
gathered from all that training was

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:20.690
that music has absolutely
no meaning whatsoever.

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:25.020
I mean, it has absolutely
no meaning whatsoever except

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.670 position:56%
for the meaning that people give it.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:31.420
And I'm curious, what,
could you talk a little bit

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.900
about the two sides
of that conversation?

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.690 position:56%
Like what meaning, examples of
meaning that you've given the music,

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:42.020 position:56%
either musically or in terms of that
story behind it, as you were saying.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:47.410 position:56%
And then, what meaning have you seen
people take from it or add to it,

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:49.710
you know, like people
sitting here right here today?

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.700
Can you give us a sense
of those two sides

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.570
of that conversation a little
bit from your experience?

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:55.870
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Sure.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.170
I'll start with that.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.660
Well, when we started San Jose
Taiko, we're the third group

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:03.950
to begin here in North America,
and probably at that time outside

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:07.160
of Japan, as far as this
particular ensemble form.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:12.740 position:56%
So, we were, as PJ mentioned, trying
to draw from experience or sounds

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.400
that we felt were coming from Japan

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.740
but more importantly
what was we felt,

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.440 position:56%
we grew up as as Japanese Americans,

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.520
and so the music we
were writing early

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.530
on really incorporated
a lot of that influence.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:28.610
And so when you hear our music,
you may kind of sense of a jazz

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:32.810
or an Afro-Cuban thing going on,
or polyrhythmic stuff happening,

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:36.470
and so you might get that kind
of sense of a rhythm going

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.850
on that you'll be hearing
when we're playing.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.580
And so, I'm hoping as a
musician, or as a Taiko player,

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:48.020 position:56%
that people when they are listening
to us as musicians are playing music

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.140
that really kind of
touches different aspects

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:57.250
of what you may really enjoy as a
listener or just enjoy of music.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:01.600 position:56%
So, you might sense as the soloist
doing different things and that kind

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.620
of things happening and
also different textures

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:08.010
of what the different drums
may be doing at the same time.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.340
And so, it's really trying
to combine a lot of that,

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.390
and then on top of
that is the movement.

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:16.780
So, for those who enjoy dance
and movement, there's that piece

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.220
of what Taiko is all about too.

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:22.360
So, we're trying to combine
what we many times refer

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.000
to as dancing with the drums.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.080
So, the audience could really
kind of enjoy that kind

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.510
of variety of what's happening.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:33.550 position:56%
So, we're hoping that as an audience
member you're not just focusing

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:35.690
on one person, but you're
looking at everybody

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:38.630
and really have a hard time
watching [inaudible] ensemble

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:41.100
because each person is
doing something different.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.720
And rather than watching, say,
an orchestra or a string ensemble

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.560
where it's a little
bit more stationery.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.320
And so, with that, it's really
just trying to create that,

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.390
the vibrancy of playing the
drum, having the opportunity

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:58.670
to just enjoy what we're playing,
and hopefully passing that on

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:02.020
to you too so you can enjoy that
experience too at the same time.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.990
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: It's
so multi-disciplinary,

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:07.270
as Roy is saying, there's the
physical aspect, musical aspect.

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:12.200
There's kind of like the
theatrical aspect as well.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:19.800
So, as an audience, I imagine
somebody in a different discipline,

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.330
ethnic, you know, art, like wow,

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:27.590
I wonder what that sounds
like if we got together.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:32.530
Like I'm feeling that there's
also this inciting excitement

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.090
of exploration.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:38.590
Even as an artist, you
don't have to be musical.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:41.270
Maybe it's like I want to
just experience what it's

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:43.620
like to hit that drum, you know.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:47.420
And yeah, that's the invitation.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.580
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: What about
stepping back, let's say, you know,

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:55.170
a football field, or
whatever, conceptually?

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:58.360
Festivals, I've gone
to, for example,

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.360
looking for a representation
of who is in a community,

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.120
or who's in a broader
community, or whatever.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:11.410
And it seems like over the years
that Taiko has been selected as one

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:16.530
of those potent expressions
that it's more than music

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:18.110
in a general kind of way.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:21.720 position:56%
Do you have a take on that yourself,
or what would you see there?

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.160
You know what I'm trying
to, attempting to say here?

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.460
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Yes.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.990
And we're excited about the fact
that, you know, we're, I mean,

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.850
again, we are trying to be
serious about our musical form

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:36.220
and what we compose, but as
a form in a musical entity

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.860
that we're really trying
to build a community,

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.430
so we realize that the drum
is a calling instrument

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.030
for the community itself.

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.100
And so, like you're
mentioning, I mean,

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:50.450
we play for City Hall officials,
football games and festivals

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:54.600
and school assemblies and, I mean,
weddings and even, unfortunately,

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.250
funerals, we've been
asked to play at.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:59.780
But it's, basically, it's us being
asked to use the drum through,

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:03.370
as a voice to call people together
and to share that experience.

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:07.140
And so, that's one really important
thing that we feel about what Taiko

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.970
for us and what sounds
like Taiko's been trying

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:13.680
to do is use the instrument
in our music as a way

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.490
to help gather people together
and bring people together

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:20.560
to enjoy what's happening
as a community itself.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.990
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: I
have to add with that

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:25.060
that the first three Taiko
groups, of which we are the third,

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:29.550
actually [inaudible] were
started from Japan towns.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:32.600
Three Japantowns who made
it in the United States

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.530
that are physical entities still
and recognized as Japantowns,

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:40.290
Los Angeles and San
Francisco and San Jose.

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:45.100
So, in that way, we see
like how important it became

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:49.720
as a pioneer voice for these
communities that, you know,

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:54.250
it's like, oh, I'd like to learn
more, you know, and it's like also,

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:56.920
hey, there's this celebration,
you know,

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.300
this is happening in Japantown.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.600
Come on out.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.070
And so there's also
this awareness building

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:06.720
of what the community
is and the larger city.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.550
And then, also, we always
used to be asked, well,

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:14.380
do you have to be Japanese
to play the Taiko?

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.130
And I think, you know, that,

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:19.390
at the very beginning it
was like, no, you don't.

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:23.410
But please understand that we
are kind of exploring ourselves,

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:28.570
and it is a voice for the
Japanese American experience.

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:30.530
So, if you can be patient

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:33.940
and understand that's what
we're exploring, then yeah,

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:39.080
come join San Jose Taiko and to
be respectful of the tradition

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.520
and the history of like what
this community has gone through.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:48.310
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: San Jose
Taiko is number three.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:53.660
What are the differences say
between, say, what Sage Tanaka did

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:59.370
and the San Francisco Bay Area
in Keynata and Los Angeles

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:00.840
and what you are all doing?

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:05.440
And even looking today, hoping to
get a little sense of you today

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.600
and how things have evolved over
the years, but how are things?

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.980
Is everybody the same,
with the same philosophy,

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.280
or are there differences between?

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:17.030
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: No, there are
differences in basic philosophy.

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:18.960
Sage Tanaka, [inaudible]
Taiko [inaudible] Joe,

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.570
really, he was trained in Japan.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.510
He's an immigrant from Japan.

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:29.250
So, he really had brought
the Japanese traditional,

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:33.790 position:56%
folk traditional of styles, festival
drumming to America, basically.

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:37.230
And so, his style and
form really kind of lies

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.650
in that direction of playing.

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.600
Keynata Taiko was based out
of the Senshin Buddhist Temple

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.610
with the Buddhist Church
in Los Angeles, Central LA,

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:49.030 position:56%
and so Revo Muskodani [phonetic] and
those folks really kind of focused

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.820
on using the Taiko within
the Temple in a religion

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.900
and their activities around that.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.780
Still a bit more contemporary
in a sense,

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:59.440
but philosophically it's
really around the ideas

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.470
of the religion and the Temple.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:03.820
And so, when we started San
Jose Taiko, as we mentioned,

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.130
we came from a little bit
more of a Japanese American

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:10.410
and Asia American perspective,
and realizing that we didn't have

00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:13.460
that kind of training
that we were just trying

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.710
to create our music
based upon what we felt.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:20.110
So, it was really using a
lot of other different ideas

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:21.510
in order to create the music.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:25.900 position:56%
And so, we feel that San Jose Taiko,
we took more of a contemporary vein

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.140
of looking at how to
create our music and style.

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.970
And so, when you look at music,

00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:33.540
the Taiko scene now you
could probably trace it back

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:35.480
to San Francisco Taiko,
more traditional,

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.900
to a little bit the Buddhist
path that the Kenata Taiko took

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.670
and then more the contemporary,
which style that we've taken.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:47.630
In Japan, I feel that, and I'm
not saying this to brag or boast,

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:51.070 position:56%
but I feel that what we've done here
in the United States has really kind

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:53.090
of influenced now what's
going on in Japan.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:56.230
And although the Japanese Taiko
folks feel they're more traditional

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:59.780
in that sense, again, as PJ
mentioned, this art form for us,

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:03.760
this particular style only
started about the early 1950's.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.980
And so, Taiko in the
United States era,

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:11.000 position:56%
particularly has been running
parallel to what's going on in Japan

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.890 position:56%
for about at least a good two-thirds
of that life span of this art form.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:18.900
And so, with that, I think we've
greatly influenced now what's

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:23.060
happening in Japan as far as the
Taiko scene, the Kumi-daiko scene

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:26.050
where things that we were
being criticized for early on,

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:28.460
as far as using other
instrumentation, we would bring

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.160
in a cow bell and other
rhythm patterns,

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.050
and non-Japanese instruments.

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:37.150
Now, it's used all over,
especially in Japan.

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:40.010
And just the rhythmic
sense that we're doing,

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:43.380
that we were doing early on is also
being copied elsewhere all over.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:46.640
And so, it's interesting
that I think Taiko

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.790
in America has influenced who
has gone now internationally

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:54.590
because now you see Taiko very
popular in Europe and Australia

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:58.100
and Asia and other countries,
and also South America.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:01.290
So, it's really gone way beyond
what we experienced early on.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:02.590
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: So, [inaudible].

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:03.890
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: Yeah.

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:07.690
Actually, I wanted to say besides
what you hear and see, you know,

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:13.280
I think the three seminal groups
that started, we were very distinct

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.480
in our organization, and coming

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.450
from like community organizing
backgrounds or activism,

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:26.940
we wanted to be very clear that
we wanted some cooperation,

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:31.030
a cooperative collective
style of interaction

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:34.620
in how we operated as a group.

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:40.930
So, unlike a traditional Japanese
adieu [phonetic] or school,

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:42.890
where it's always popped down,

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:46.930
there is really no
lateral approach to that.

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:48.230
So, that's what we were doing.

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:51.920
We're just kind of making it
a lateral, even way of people,

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:57.390
inputting ideas, being creative,
how do we share responsibility.

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:01.180
So, I have to say that that kind
of still remains very distinct.

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.970
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Yeah,
yeah, that's big, essentially.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:06.270
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Okay.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:10.690
In terms of quantity,
okay, we got up to three.

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:14.070
Where are we now in
the United States,

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.230
and then beyond the United
States in terms of groups

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:18.230
or however you want to express it?

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:21.000
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Within,
for the longest time,

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.010
I was hearing about maybe
300 groups in North America,

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.800
but someone corrected me recently
saying that it's probably closer

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.880
to 450 in North America alone.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.480
In South America now,
Taiko has been so popular,

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:35.290
it becomes real popular
too the last 15, 20 years.

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:39.550
So, there might be almost
equal numbers to that extent.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.830
And as I mentioned, in Europe now,
it's really, it's just amazing,

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:46.160
and when countries were, even
not [phonetic] the Taiko,

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:50.140
this as an ensemble, it's
springing up all over Europe.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:54.870
And so, it's really grown quite
a bit outside of Japan basically.

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.230
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Does
that include, you know,

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:59.430
they're a sizeable Japanese
communities in Brazil and Peru,

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.390
for example, are those --

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:02.820
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Yes, important.

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.440
They really started a lot, right.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.740
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: So, so far.

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:10.030 position:56%
Yeah. And PJ, you mentioned a while
ago that a lot of people who are not

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:14.020
of Japanese descent are
interested in performing

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.250
and are performing Taiko music.

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.500
Can you tell us about
that a little bit?

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.610
Is that big, a little bit?

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:24.290
Is it, or it must be
special stories.

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:25.590
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: I think there's

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:29.680
that flat line universal
concept, and that's heart.

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:34.610
So, you know, it doesn't
matter where or what you are;

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:37.930
it's just kind of an open door.

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:43.300
Well, that's what we try to do,
how to make Taiko accessible,

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:47.170
and it's very interesting.

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:50.370
I mean, there's no way of
knowing how Taiko is growing

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:54.080
or in what communities
it's developing.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.040
Yes, there's a lot
more non-Asian faces

00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:01.250
that are creating Taiko groups,
and then it's very interesting

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:03.240
to see a lot of non-Asian faces

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:08.600
that are really promoting
Taiko from Japan.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.140
And it's interesting
to see the diversity

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:16.540
of like people being inspired
and influenced by the source

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.830
of where Taiko is coming from.

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:20.130
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Mm-hmm.

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:21.430
How American is Taiko?

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:24.880
I mean, that's kind of a,
ever fully dumb question.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: Well, let me ask,
how many of you know what sushi is.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.380
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: There you go.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:30.680
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: Okay, right.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.080
Okay. So, that's what
Tomakasin [phonetic] say

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.380
from San Francisco
Taiko [inaudible].

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.480
You know, Taiko will
have hit the scene

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:42.300
if Taiko becomes as
ubiquitous as sushi.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.960
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Well, it's
pretty ubiquitous, as I said.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.260
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: I think it is.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.600
Oh, and you don't, yeah, to
hear in commercials, you know,

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.340
very subliminally, on TV, you know;

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:57.940
it's like it's already
in compositions.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.240
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Look,
we have a couple

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.590
of more pieces before
we all adjourn here,

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:05.040 position:56%
but is it okay to ask the questions.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:10.900
People, who's in, somebody in
charge, can we do that, given this?

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.400
Yes. Oh, there's a microphone
for people to ask questions.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.700
That's terrific.

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:19.040
So, let's let Viah [phonetic]
be our intermediary here.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.780
How's that?

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:23.080
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.430
You're talking about trying to
find the uniqueness of Japanese

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:31.000
for the experience to the Taiko
drum and, as you mentioned,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.340
there are many Japanese in
Brazil, and there's Samba there,

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.830
and if anybody that came
from another country

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:40.100
and start playing the drums, they
would play in their unique culture.

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.570
What makes Taiko unique
for Japanese?

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:45.920
And I guess, specifically, the
rudiments, the time signature,

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.880
the collaboration in unison.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.860
You have to feel each other out
while you're playing together.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:56.930
Maybe you can describe in regards
to the Taiko style for Japanese

00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:00.310
in that experience
for being Japanese.

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:02.630
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Well,
it's definitely changed

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:08.160
over the years since, I guess, the
Kumi-daiko styles kind of started.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.800 position:56%
So, traditionally, especially when
you talk about the festival drumming

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.810
that goes on in Japan,
rhythmically, it's pretty simple

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:16.160
and pretty repetitive

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.910
because basically they're
accompanying a dance

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.610
or that kind of form.

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:25.380
And so it was [inaudible]
Gucci in Japan

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.190
that started the ensemble
format, and he was the first

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:32.080
to take a composition and write it
using just Taiko for itself to kind

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.160
of use those voices or
the other instruments

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.500
or having dance or
other movement to it.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:40.070
And so, with that context, he
started to really look at how

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:43.490
to compose or create
pieces within a way

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:46.160
of where you're just hearing
drums with different voices

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.980
of different sites,
tones, and whatever.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.610
And so, rhythmically, I guess,
tradition, I guess, Taiko,

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:58.120
when dancing or accompanying other
things is pretty much standard

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.470
for [inaudible] whatever.

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:03.420
But now, I guess, in contemporary
form, many groups are writing

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.160
or composers are writing and
other time signatures are just

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.460
moving around.

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.770
And so, for us in San Jose
Taiko, we've been doing

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:13.510 position:56%
that for quite a while because we
were highly influenced by the Samba,

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:16.860
the Afro Cuban rhythms and
things in a polyrhythmic sense,

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:22.150
so we have pieces that are 7/4,
5/4, and other time signatures,

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:25.180
and we try to actually
move in and out of that.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:28.840
So, it's not a sense at all, so
you're feeling you're just locked

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.900
into that one but just being able
to play in a different signature

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:34.160
so that it feels more, you know,

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.500
it feels pretty natural,
in other words.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:40.620
So, but for a Taiko, traditional
Taiko player, it's very unnatural,

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:44.920
and so we then, again, early on
criticized because we were told

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.420
that our music was too complicated
for the Japanese Taiko audience

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:52.720
in general because we were just
too layered on our rhythm patterns

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:56.160
and taking it out of time
signature of the straight 4/4.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.600
But whereas now, again,
you're hearing that all over,

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.450
and it's just very calming.

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:03.580
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: Perhaps
another thing that's,

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:08.240
it's musical; it is your energy.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:13.040
It's key or chee where in Japan,

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:17.370
you would see that
that's the main foundation

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:18.850
of like why people come together,

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:22.580
and I think that's what
all Taiko groups strive

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:26.450
to practice and also keep rooted.

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:32.750
So, it's not taking the Taiko drum
and making it just the instrument

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:34.310
to have a different sound.

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:41.670
It's like how do you really insert
that respect and that energy.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:42.970
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Thank you.

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:46.020
Yes. One right here then.

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.130
&gt;&gt; You may have answered this
question before I arrived,

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:50.220
and so I apologize.

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:54.710
When I think of Taiko drums, I
think of those great huge drums

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:57.350
where you have to almost lie
down in order to play them,

00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:59.500
and when I was upset, I was
thinking, gee, I'd like to do

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.710
that to get rid of
some of my tensions.

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:05.880
Is that part of the
Japanese traditional Taiko,

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:10.240
and now you've evolved in that?

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:14.470
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: Today's
set is very special, again.

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:21.370
[Laughing] [Inaudible] Taiko Group,
we couldn't get this past security,

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:23.700
so it had to be small drums.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.830
So, I'm sorry, no,
no big drums today.

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:27.130
&gt;&gt; But you did it?

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:28.660
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi:
Yeah, oh yes, yes.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:31.620
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Do
you have any videos

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.800
on YouTube that people could find?

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.100
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Well, yes.

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:37.320
If you look to San Jose Taiko,
YouTube, you'll see a lot

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.350
of different videos of the
different kinds of performances.

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.300
A lot of are festival
settings, but you'll see a lot

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.910
of different drums
and concert video too.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:46.210
Yes.

00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:47.510
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yeah.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:48.810
Yes.

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:54.170
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to ask a question
about the choreography movement.

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:58.360
You obviously, when you do the
celebration there are movements

00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.660
that you're doing.

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.870
How does that relate to the rhythm?

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:05.990
How do you compose
or conceive those?

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:07.290
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi:

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.240
I think choreography became a
very instantaneous connection

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.730
for the expression
of San Jose Taiko.

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:21.590
Well, for myself, I also grew up
as a dancer, tap, ballet, you know,

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:25.780
but there's something, either the
cellular, the muscle memory inside,

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.270
you know, it's like that wants

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:30.380
to groove almost before
you become a musician.

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:35.700
And so that's how San Jose Taiko
was trying to integrate movement,

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:40.390
a lot more so than what we
saw from Japan happening.

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:46.910
And since then, it's like I think
people are influencing each other,

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.910
and where can you take movement?

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:50.640
How do you express?

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.180
Yeah

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.480
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Yeah.

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:54.780
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheeby: Pulse
is the lighting,

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.050
the whole state there's
all sorts of -- Yes.

00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:02.020
Sorry. I committed to,
back here next, yes.

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.320
Sorry, and thank you.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.620
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:05.920
Thank you.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.220
Thank you so much for being here.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:08.520
This is a good opportunity.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:09.820
PJ, a little while earlier,

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.400
you mentioned that there were
three extinct Japantowns in LA

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.600
and San Jose and San Francisco.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.190
Would you say that the
development of Taiko had an effect

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:20.490
on the preservation of those?

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:24.190
So, can you talk a
little bit about that?

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:25.490
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: Yes.

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:26.790
Absolutely.

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:30.300
Well, because I think we're just
so connected to San Jose Japantown,

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.900
and our community is so
supportive of us, they go,

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:35.770
"You're the heartbeat
of San Jose Japantown."

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:41.200
And it's like, wow, I really
feel that the presence of arts

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.850
in general, you know,
and to be a part

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:47.790
of like all these celebrations
during the year in Japantown kind

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:52.810
of really elevated our prominence
and exposure, our visibility,

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:57.920
you know, that little
kids want to play Taiko.

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.300
So, it's like this new generation.

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:03.960
It's like the seeding,
right, and it's continuing.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:08.370
I mean, our little kids now are now
married and have their own kids,

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:10.990
and we're going, oh, no kidding.

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:15.810
So, there's such pride and
surprise, I would say, you know,

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:17.710
to see that there's
kind of like, wow,

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:23.370
I never had that while growing
up, as the silent no-esteem kid,

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:25.870
you know, in kindergarten.

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:28.950
Now, it's like these kids
are just like flourishing

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:31.490
with wonderful self-esteem.

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:33.860
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Is
this a springboard

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:37.520
into the Conservatory idea
because this is something special?

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.160
There are all kinds
of ways to innovate.

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.670
This is another way to innovate.

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:42.970
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Right.

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:45.510
Well, it sounds like Taiko
has been working on this idea.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:48.340
Well, we've been doing
a Conservatory concept

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.640
for quite a while now.

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:50.940
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: Program wise.

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:52.240
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi:
Program wise, right.

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:56.140
And so, we just feel we're trying
to put it under one category roof

00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:00.250
of terminology in a sense, but
really it's our outreach program,

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:05.830
our master classes that we offer
for college to other adults.

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:09.040
So, it's a variety of classes,
and our training program we have

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.900
for our performing members.

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:13.650
We feel we have probably one of
the most vigorous training programs

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:15.600
for a member to join San Jose Taiko

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.970
that exists here in
the US right now.

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:20.970
And so, all of these things
are part of what we consider

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:24.970
as an important part of teaching
Taiko and also spreading it

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:28.510
to our performances, whether it's
our concert programming o outreach

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:31.990
program into the schools,
our festival programming,

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:36.060
and our touring that we
do as an ensemble; and so,

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:38.680
it's something that's
been going on for a while.

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:41.660
We're now on the verge of,
actually, an important piece

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:45.630 position:56%
for us has been a physical site, and
so we're now actually moving forward

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:48.300
to building our own building,
along with some other partners,

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.930
so that at least we have a
permanent rehearsal space.

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:54.120
And so, we're just launching
a capital campaign on that,

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:57.110
so if anyone wants to support it.

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:59.100
I know you probably
understand what that means.

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.700
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: And it's
happening in San Jose Japantown.

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.210
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: It's in San
Jose Japantown, so we're very proud

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:05.900
of that too, and we're partnering

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.460
with several other
arts organizations,

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:09.870
but we look to have our
own permanent space.

00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:11.170
Hopefully, within the next three

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:14.350
to four years that'll be
completed, so we've very excited.

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:16.710
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And
having personally worked

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:19.380
at the National Endowment
for the Arts for 23 years

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:24.740 position:56%
as though having followed the San
Jose Taiko and the Taiko in general,

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:30.000
I expect that this dimension
of giving to the community,

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.680
of thinking bigger than music and
performance was part of the reason

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.910
that you were awarded the
National Heritage Fellowship

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:37.740
by the National Endowment
for the Art as well.

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:39.200
So, again, one more time,

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.270
congratulations on
that, and thank you.

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:42.570
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Thank you.

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:43.870
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And
there's a question here.

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:45.370
Yes.

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:47.730
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:50.830
I was very interested, you
know, you mentioned PJ,

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:54.100
your background is in dance.

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:57.400
Does someone who plays
another instrument have a leg

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:02.540
up if they decide they want
to try Taiko, say, a pianist

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:06.920
or a cellist, or does it matter?

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:12.630
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: I
don't want to stereotype.

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:15.990
But it's really interesting
to see that people who say,

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:20.020
"I'm a drummer," you know,
trap drummer, I can do that;

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:21.750
it's a different experience.

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:24.550
It's like once you put the
choreography in, oh, wow,

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:26.450
my arm doesn't extend
that far, and I can't do

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:28.780
that many beats, you know.

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:31.910
No, these all start
from zero; in fact,

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:33.670
that's what we do for training.

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:37.770
No matter what experience you have
when you come to San Jose Taiko,

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:40.620
I'm sorry, you're going to have to
strip to zero because we're going

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:46.720
to just layer that training
within, you know, layer by layer.

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.520
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: So, part of our,
you have one more question here?

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.900
Yes. We want to hear a
little more music, right?

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:54.200
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.500
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yeah, okay.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:56.800
So, let's have another question.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.100
&gt;&gt; That's okay.

00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.400
Just --

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.690
&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering, you
know, I'm from Indonesia,

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:09.560
and we sort of regard our
instruments as, I don't know,

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:15.690
holy or sacred, or we
have to respect them.

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:20.480
Do you teach them to respect
like you cannot step over it,

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:23.450
and you don't put stuff on it?

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:26.190
And people don't understand,
you know,

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:30.910
and so you always have
to teach them.

00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:32.210
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: Yes.

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:38.560
There's the values that are
integrated towards the practicing

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:42.810
of Taiko, and just because
Taiko itself is made

00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:51.260
out of three natural elements,
wood from tree, hide from animal,

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:56.990
metal tacks from earth, you know,
just to really understand, wow,

00:51:56.990 --> 00:52:00.110
this is what's gifting
us with this sound,

00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:03.790
and each sound has its own voice.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:06.930
How do you respect even that voice?

00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:09.710
Like this drum is like
another person.

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:15.040
How do you respect that drum
as I can equally respect you?

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:19.350
So, it's like looking at
each as a living being.

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:20.650
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Yeah

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:22.600
&gt;&gt; I think, you know,
lots of people don't,

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:26.450
I think lots of people don't
understand that, you know.

00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:29.890
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: Thank
you for asking that.

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:31.190
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Yes.

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:33.210
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Thank you for
that question and thank all of your

00:52:33.210 --> 00:52:36.470
for all of your questions, and
you think you could lead us

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:39.470
into what's going to
happen now with the -- ?

00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:40.770
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: [Inaudible]
I think it's important.

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:42.070
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Okay.

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:43.370
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: Yeah.

00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:45.420
We're going to play this one
song actually from Japan.

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:48.660
It's called Hutchi Jo [phonetic],
and the reason why we want

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:55.130 position:56%
to play this is because Hutchi Jo is
this very small island off the main

00:52:55.130 --> 00:53:01.690
island Hornshoe, not too far from
Tokyo, and Hutchi Jo is regarded

00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:07.540
as an island of exile where
they send political prisoners.

00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:14.070
And yet, people were exiled
to this little island;

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:18.500
it still flourished as
their own community.

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:23.140
So, just because you are
"exiled" doesn't mean

00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:26.130
that you can still
find beauty in life.

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:31.750 position:56%
So, they were able to take the Hutch
Jo drum or create a Hutchi Jo drum,

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:37.110
or a very small drum, where it
wasn't used for art sake per se.

00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:41.600
It was there to celebrate,
where people would just load up

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:44.740
and get drunk at parties,
and people just go up

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:47.750
and they just play on the drum.

00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:51.520
And the reason why Roy and I really
wanted to learn this piece is

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.840
because we felt that it really kind

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:59.540
of paralleled the Japanese American
experience of during World War II.

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:06.400 position:56%
The West Coast Japanese, people of
Japanese ancestry, were incarcerated

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:10.510
into like ten different
camps throughout the West.

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:17.080
And although they were there for
three years during World War II,

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:20.390
their communities in these
camps still were able

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:23.300
to find beauty and flourish.

00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:30.060
And so, we're playing this kind
of like that sense of freedom,

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:34.500
sense of connection,
and finding beauty

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:36.970
in whatever conditions, like today.

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:55.230
So, we're, I'm personally
being challenged to play this

00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:57.850
because Hutchi Jo is
usually on an up drum

00:54:57.850 --> 00:55:01.450
like this, and it's this high.

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:07.300 position:56%
So, if you see me whiffing at air,
it's because it's a different style.

Yes? Back here, we have a question.

So, I'm originally from
Los Angeles and, of course,

00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:14.390
I know Taiko drumming, especially
at UCLA, it's very, very popular.

00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:18.600
They used to play underground
in the parking lot

00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.670
when I was there 50 years ago.

00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:26.870
But now, I wanted to ask
about storytelling with music

00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:30.190
and specifically with
Taiko drumming.

00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:33.440
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Do you want?

00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:34.770
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: You go.

00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:36.070
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Okay.

00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:40.350
So, with that context of how Taiko
can be as storytelling, you know,

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:44.080
we've worked with performance
artists and theatre companies

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:47.660
in that way, and so and actually,
PJ has done a lot of work

00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:50.260
with Novo Kumiamodo [phonetic],
who's based in Los Angeles,

00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:54.220
with Great Leap [phonetic], who's a
great storyteller, dancer, singer.

00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:59.130
And so, actually, Taiko can be used
in many different ways to accompany

00:59:59.130 --> 01:00:01.050
that kind of action and things.

01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:07.220
And we've been, I guess, adding
to that in different, I guess,

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:11.460 position:56%
projects we've been doing more
recently, whether it's storytelling,

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:14.900
whether it's sensitive dance,
like Bhutto dance, or storytelling

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.740
within theatre, like working
with Luis Valdez and some

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.060
of its newest works that's going

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:21.700
on from the L. Theatre
Compasino [phonetic].

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:25.070
So, what we're trying to do
is really how can the music

01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:28.240
or the voice of the Taiko be
added on to what's happening

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.500
in that context is
something we're trying to do,

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.540
and I think it's a
great opportunity.

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:36.160
We, personally, we'd
like to do more of that,

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.620
but it has been happening
for quite a while.

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:40.890
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi:
Just one recent project

01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:44.650
that San Jose Taiko just
did, and their developing it,

01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:46.920
so it'll come out again next year.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:50.720
It's a collaboration of
three different groups,

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:56.050
and it's San Jose Taiko,
the Wesley Jazz Ensemble,

01:00:56.050 --> 01:01:00.640
and also Epic Immersion Theatre.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:05.510
So, this is just only last
weekend that it was performed,

01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:12.350
and it was an immersive experience
where the audience were told ahead

01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:16.230
of time, this is not a sit down
concert, that you are going to be

01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:21.070
in the round and that actors are
going to be coming in between you,

01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:26.980
and we also inspire you to dress
up in 1940 vintage clothing

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:31.180
because it was swing;
it was a swing era.

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.820
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Big Band Jazz.

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:34.120
&gt;&gt; PJ Hirabayashi: Yea.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:37.050
Big Band Jazz, and
so what the story was

01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:41.690
like Big Band Jazz
was very prominent

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:46.770
in these internment camps during
World War II, and it was the,

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:51.390
it was the activity of
dancing and making music

01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:56.900
that people found substance
and, you know, of living

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.300
and living out their lives in camp.

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:04.830
And so, it was really wonderful to
see how it sparked off this energy

01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:10.290
of people getting up and dance when
the Jazz Ensemble started to play,

01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:15.090
you know, and then interspersed
with the dialogue to talk

01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:20.170
about what was happening where they
had to decide and show allegiance;

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:23.220
do I sign up or get drafted?

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:26.880
You know, here I'm in camp,
but how do I show my allegiance

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:30.400
to America by serving the country.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.450
So, yes, I think we're
also exploring and trying

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:39.070
to find those ways to
really empower the potential

01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:42.370
of what our arts can do.

01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:44.350
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Well,
you've certainly empowered me,

01:02:44.350 --> 01:02:47.850
and I think a number of
people in this room today.

01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:51.250
So, PJ Hirabayashi and Roy
Hirabayashi, thank you so much.

01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:52.550
&gt;&gt; Roy Hirabayashi: Thank you.

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:54.250
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: For all
you've done, [inaudible]

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:56.650
[ Audience Applause ]

01:02:56.650 --> 01:03:00.350
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
