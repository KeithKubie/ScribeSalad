I'm of course talking about Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas!

Based on the hit kids' show about a bumbling inspector and his ignored prodigy of a niece,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.160
this special aired in December of 1992,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.100

First of all: Wow! Who know Dr. Claw was so short?

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.400
I guess sitting down so much just gives you the shin-legs of Hank Hill's father!

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.680
Second: His arms seem to have gotten pretty scrawny don't you think?

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.160
Does he eat carbs?

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.660
Third: What exactly is his scheme, again?

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:56.340
"I, Dr. Claw, will ruin Christmas myself, and the world will blame Santa Claus!"

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.200
That's a weird plan, buddy.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.780
What do you care if you ruin Christmas? Or even if Santa gets blamed?

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.960
You focus used to be robberies, terrorism, obtaining power.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.900
What does making Santa look lazy accomplish?

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.760
"Santa's name will be slush! His reputation will be ruined!"

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.460

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.100
having done that!

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:33.000
No wonder you kept losing to an 8-year-old; your criminal plans center around what 8-year-olds care about!

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.160

How'd he...what?

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.600
as Inspector Gadget is given his next assignment from the Chief, once again undercover.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.600
Y'know, the thought occurs to me that we're rather Claw-centric.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.980
Have we ever thought about going after ISIS?

of course brings his niece Penny along, who

"This must be where Dr. Claw hid Santa's real toys!"

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.500
OK, well, maybe she's popular from the other things she's been in, like:

If only we could fix the reception!

So we saw how easily Dr. Claw snuck in. I wonder if they beefed up security at all-

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.800
DO THEY EVEN LOCK THEIR DOORS?!

Aren't you even afraid those elves might be kidnapped by Willy Wonka when you're not looking?

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.580
Gadget, of course, goes to greet who he thinks is Santa.

OK, I'm just calling it right here.
