I am perpetually nervous

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.587

"You and your smile,"

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.539

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.709
27 minutes in.
It was time-stamped.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.244
And I was like,
"Why don't we meet up

00:02:58.244 --> 00:02:59.745

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:02.548

I'm like, "How do--how do you
know where I live?"

00:03:07.252 --> 00:03:09.789
She's like, "I know
many things about you,

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:13.459
including your father's
credit card information."

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.961
So then I have to type out
"Oh, my God,"

00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:19.298

And the worst thing
about this was,

00:03:57.836 --> 00:04:00.673
me and my brother
were never close growing up

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:04.343
because I thought he never
understood me as a person,

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:06.512
and in the 27 minutes

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:09.815
I talked to IguanaLover69,

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:12.452
he said everything I ever wanted

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:14.921
to hear someone say.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.755

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:19.659
And that is the worst
possible feeling,

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:24.296
to realize that your brother
is a fucking douche bag

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:27.099
but an incredible listener.

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.036
[laughter]

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.839
And so I was 15
when that happened,

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:35.941
and I was traumatized,
and at that point,

00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:38.644
I was like,
"I just want to find real love

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:41.347
"attached to a real,
actual person

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:42.548
that isn't my brother,"

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:45.484
and it happened
a few months later.

00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:48.221
And I--I met a girl named Beth,

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:51.190
and we started to go out,

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.726
and we're sitting
on a pickup truck

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:55.128
one day, making out.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:58.564
This was Florida.
That's how you dos.

00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:01.533
And she was like, you know.

00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:03.870
She was like, "This is great,"
and I'm like, "Yeah, it is,"

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.739
and I'm like, "So--so
when are we gonna do it?"

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:10.643
'Cause that's what people say
before they do.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.178
You know, "getting busy,"
"do it."

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:14.413
No one who's actually fucking
says those things,

00:05:14.413 --> 00:05:15.881
just horny teenagers.

00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:18.384
And she was like,
"I don't like the idea

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:19.685
of something inside me,"

00:05:19.685 --> 00:05:22.588
and I was like,
"Okay, that sounds great.

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:24.057
Let's stay together,"

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:27.693
and we did,
for six more years.

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:30.430
We never had sex once.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.763
Now, the weirdest part
about this

00:05:31.763 --> 00:05:33.366
is being able to look
at these women

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:35.701
and just see them go,
"Yeah, I could believe that.

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:37.736
I completely understand."

00:05:37.736 --> 00:05:42.241
Wait, isn't she
the protagonist now?

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:44.110
I know, it was a--it was a--
it was a tough thing.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.045
It--that is not
a good combination

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:47.613
when one person's prudish

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:49.215
and the other is respectful.

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:51.417
That never works out.

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:54.720
So I'm gonna talk you
through the years

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.422
of our relationship.

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:59.058
We started in 2000, 2001.

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:00.926
'Cause I always believed
that it would happen.

00:06:00.926 --> 00:06:02.694
I was like,
"This is gonna fuckin' happen."

00:06:02.694 --> 00:06:07.400
2001, got my hand over
the right boob,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.268
over the shirt.

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:11.303
2002, under the shirt.

00:06:11.303 --> 00:06:13.306
Yeah!

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:15.908
2003, left boob.

00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:17.744
Even let me get both in
at the same time.

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:19.078
It was amazing.

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:21.481
Like, she basically, like,
made me, like,

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:23.415
explore the boobs
in installments.

00:06:23.415 --> 00:06:26.251
Like, she "Kill Bill"-ed me
on the boobs.

00:06:26.251 --> 00:06:27.987
She was like, "I could
release this as one,

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:30.155
"but, you know what,
I'm gonna make him wait for it

00:06:30.155 --> 00:06:31.790
and make more money."

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.660
That marketing genius.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.096
So--and that's the thing.

00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:38.831
It's like,
I got to the first base,

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:40.499
but I think, like,
I don't think, like,

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:41.968
I--I hit to first base.

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:43.769
I think, like, I--
I was walked there.

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:45.003
You know?

00:06:45.003 --> 00:06:46.605
Like, I got there
on a technicality

00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:49.308
when it takes that long.

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:51.777
2004, finally,

00:06:51.777 --> 00:06:53.945
I get to--I get
to touch under the panties.

00:06:53.945 --> 00:06:56.515
She--she touches my dick
for the first time.

00:06:56.515 --> 00:06:58.084
Now, this is the thing.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.518
It didn't get hard at all,

00:06:59.518 --> 00:07:01.087
because at that point,
it was like

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:04.089
an old man waiting in the DMV
who just believed

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:07.626
his number was never
gonna be called at all.

00:07:07.626 --> 00:07:09.428
"Oh, wait, it is me?
Oh, shit.

00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:11.764
What am I here for again?"

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:14.200
[laughter]

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.303
And so I'm touching around
the--the--the pantie region,

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:19.271
and the thing you must know
about this girl, Beth,

00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:23.709
is that her father lived
next door--

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:25.043
in the room next door,

00:07:25.043 --> 00:07:27.646
even though her parents
had divorced.

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:29.882
He was just, like, a sad man

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:32.684
who listened to one song

00:07:32.684 --> 00:07:34.120
and would sing it out loud,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.221
because it helped him reconcile
with the divorce,

00:07:36.221 --> 00:07:38.891
and that song was
"A Long December"

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:42.127
by the Counting Crows.

00:07:42.127 --> 00:07:44.830
And I need to believe--
and I have no proof of this,

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.798
but I need to believe
that the moment

00:07:46.798 --> 00:07:49.568
that she pulled the pantie aside

00:07:49.568 --> 00:07:51.070
so that I could stick
my finger in

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.005
after four years
of being with her

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:56.308
is the moment in the song
where Adam Duritz goes...

00:07:56.308 --> 00:07:59.178
♪ Yeah 

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:02.081
[laughter]

00:08:03.048 --> 00:08:04.183
And it was an amazing feeling.

00:08:04.183 --> 00:08:05.650
I didn't see--I was like--

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.852
like, we were both on the bed,

00:08:06.852 --> 00:08:08.254
like, looking like this,
you know,

00:08:08.254 --> 00:08:10.723
like, looking through,
like, a kid's pillowcase

00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:12.024
for trick-or-treat candy,

00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:13.425
and all you pull out
is Tootsie Rolls.

00:08:13.425 --> 00:08:17.029
You're like,
"I wanted real food."

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:18.597
And then it was like, so--

00:08:18.597 --> 00:08:20.332
so we're gonna--
we're gonna have sex now.

00:08:20.332 --> 00:08:21.767
She's like,
"Yeah, let's try it."

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:24.103
So we go--
we go to the pharmacy,

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:26.205
and I send her in to buy
the condoms.

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:28.907
I can't buy condoms, because--
I mean, look at me.

00:08:28.907 --> 00:08:32.277
Like, I feel so bad
for that cashier

00:08:32.277 --> 00:08:34.547
that would have to imagine me
having sex.

00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:37.349
Like, she's making $8.75
an hour.

00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:39.284
She doesn't want to
also have to deal with--

00:08:39.284 --> 00:08:41.453
[groans]

00:08:41.453 --> 00:08:44.457
[laughter]

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:46.625
So she goes in.

00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:48.928
She buys a 12-pack of condoms.

00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:50.696
I was like, "Why did you buy
a 12-pack?

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:53.399
That's pretty optimistic."
She's like, "It was on sale."

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:55.801
I'm like, "Oh, that's why
we've been together."

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:58.437
[laughter]

00:08:58.437 --> 00:09:00.806
We go--we go home,

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:03.575
and I'm literally, like, I--

00:09:03.575 --> 00:09:06.211
I try to--to put it in,

00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:07.980
and she's like, "No, I don't--

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.648
I don't--I don't think we can."
I'm like, "Why?"

00:09:09.648 --> 00:09:13.652
And she goes, "I think--
I think my vagina's too small."

00:09:13.652 --> 00:09:14.920
And first off, that's fucked up.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.621
Like, all you have to say is,

00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:18.824
"I think your dick is too big."

00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:21.327
[laughter]

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:24.330
I get to feel great
about myself,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.997
and I'm still
not gonna fuck you,

00:09:25.997 --> 00:09:29.335
because I'm not an awful person,

00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:32.237
and I'm just like,
"Watch out, ladies.

00:09:32.237 --> 00:09:35.441
"It's 'Excalibur.'

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:38.476
Who is worthy?"

00:09:38.476 --> 00:09:40.746
So we just sit there the rest--

00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:42.281
the rest of the day,

00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:45.517
and we last together for--
for one more year.

00:09:45.517 --> 00:09:47.853
We try to spice things up
one more time.

00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:50.289
It was January 14th,
my birthday,

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:51.490
2005.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.258
She buys erotic dice.

00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:55.794
She's like, "Let's--let--
let's try something different."

00:09:55.794 --> 00:09:57.196
You guys--you guys know
erotic dice?

00:09:57.196 --> 00:09:59.198
So it's two dice, always.

00:09:59.198 --> 00:10:01.867
One dice is, like, a verb,
and it's always, like,

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:04.837
"peruse" or "tickle,"

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:07.172
and the other
is a body part like

00:10:07.172 --> 00:10:08.774
"earlobe" or "tummy."

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:11.143
Like, they--they--they
sound like they're all, like,

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:15.214
manufactured
by a Midwestern couple

00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:19.151
who hasn't touched each other
at all in years.

00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:20.385
"Let's peruse the tummy,

00:10:20.385 --> 00:10:23.155
don't you know,"
you know?

00:10:23.155 --> 00:10:27.659
"We're more frigid
than the winters in Minnesota."

00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:31.730
So I--I roll the dice,

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.067
and I get "lick inner thigh,"

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:36.568
and I'm like, "Yeah."

00:10:36.568 --> 00:10:38.737
I'm excited, 'cause you know,
I--I never--

00:10:38.737 --> 00:10:40.406
[stammering]
I never saw her vagina,

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:42.575
and I'm like, "I'm gonna
finally fuckin' see it."

00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:44.510
And she goes, "Yeah, sure,

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.845
but I'm not taking
my jeans off."

00:10:46.845 --> 00:10:50.749
[laughter]

00:10:50.749 --> 00:10:52.150
And I proceeded to go

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:56.088
down and rough
in that corduroy muff.

00:10:56.088 --> 00:10:57.422
[mumbling]
I was like, "This is--

00:10:57.422 --> 00:11:00.592
this is pretty good,
you know, this is."

00:11:00.592 --> 00:11:04.263
I had 100% cotton mouth.

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:05.664
And...

00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:07.433
as I'm doing it, she's like,
"You know what?

00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:08.901
"I don't think
this is gonna work.

00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:10.269
We should break up,"

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:12.070
and then I have to lift
my head above, like...

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.907
[mumbling]
"Are you sure about that?

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:18.743
We deserve to be
more than friends."

00:11:18.743 --> 00:11:21.380
And we--we--we--
we broke up,

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.882
and that always bothered me,
the fact--

00:11:23.882 --> 00:11:25.617
I'd never--
I never saw her vagina.

00:11:25.617 --> 00:11:28.554
Six years in, some of this,
some of that,

00:11:28.554 --> 00:11:29.755
never saw her vagina.

00:11:29.755 --> 00:11:30.956
So, after six years,

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:32.858
her vagina became, like,

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:36.795
Wilson from "Home Improvement"
to me.

00:11:36.795 --> 00:11:39.632
[laughter]

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:41.466
There were glimpses of it,

00:11:41.466 --> 00:11:44.770
but because I never got
to truly see it for what it was,

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:48.440
I gave it a power and wisdom
it didn't deserve.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.742
[laughter]

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:51.476
By the end, I didn't even want
to eat her out.

00:11:51.476 --> 00:11:54.313
I just wanted to seek guidance,
you know?

00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:59.585
So the epilogue to this is--

00:11:59.585 --> 00:12:00.785
so we broke up.

00:12:00.785 --> 00:12:01.987
I called her about a month later

00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:03.322
to see how she was doing.

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:04.823
She was like,
"Yeah, I've had sex.

00:12:04.823 --> 00:12:06.959
It's pretty good."
I'm like, "What?"

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:10.062
She's like, "Remember all
those times I said that it was--

00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:11.263
"it was me and not you?

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:14.399
I think it was you
the whole time."

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:16.434
And I was like, "All right,"
and I was upset,

00:12:16.434 --> 00:12:18.170
but then I was like,
"You know what, though?

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.272
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna one-up you."

00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:24.176
So I went on the dating website
"PlentyOfFish."

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:25.511
It's a dating website named

00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:28.680
for one of Jesus'
lesser superpowers.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.682
[laughter]

00:12:30.682 --> 00:12:34.086
And I was like, "I'm gonna
find myself a woman

00:12:34.086 --> 00:12:36.989
who's seen some things."

00:12:36.989 --> 00:12:38.357
I found--

00:12:38.357 --> 00:12:40.125
found a woman named Gladys.

00:12:40.125 --> 00:12:43.161
That is an out-of-model person.

00:12:43.161 --> 00:12:45.997
The Gladys factory
hasn't produced new product

00:12:45.997 --> 00:12:48.433
in over 35 years.

00:12:48.433 --> 00:12:49.968
There's just an old man outside

00:12:49.968 --> 00:12:53.472
like, "No one goes
in the Gladys factory."

00:12:53.472 --> 00:12:56.375
Her name--her name was Gladys.
It was intense.

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:58.543
Like, she fuckin'--
she was crazy.

00:12:58.543 --> 00:12:59.712
She--she sat on my face,

00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:02.381
which after not seeing a vagina
for six years,

00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:04.450
and then just seeing
too much vagina.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.385
It'd be like
if your first movie

00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:12.124
was all four Michael Bay
"Transformers" movies.

00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:15.527
Nothing at all--
too much!

00:13:15.527 --> 00:13:17.028
She was--
she was intense--

00:13:17.028 --> 00:13:18.730
she, like, smacked my balls.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.498
She was, like, she slobbered.

00:13:20.498 --> 00:13:22.468
She was like,
"Does Baby want some?"

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:24.569
And you know what, like,
it was crazy at the time,

00:13:24.569 --> 00:13:26.371
but it was perfect,
because at that point,

00:13:26.371 --> 00:13:27.740
I was like, "You know what?

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.242
"I'm not just gonna
lose my virginity.

00:13:30.242 --> 00:13:33.578
I'm going to throw it away."

00:13:33.578 --> 00:13:34.813
Thank you so much, guys.
