00:00:00.821 --> 00:00:02.792
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.792 --> 00:00:05.055
is prove to ourselves that the derivative

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:07.006
with respect to X

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:08.589
of natural log of X

00:00:09.423 --> 00:00:11.367
is indeed, equal to

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:12.284
one over X.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.019
So let's get started.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.436
So just using the
definition of a derivative

00:00:17.436 --> 00:00:19.090
if I were to say the derivative

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.321
with respect to X

00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:21.904
of natural log of X

00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:25.493
that is gonna be the limit

00:00:25.493 --> 00:00:27.660
as delta X approaches zero

00:00:28.587 --> 00:00:31.587
of the natural log of X plus delta X

00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:35.746
minus the natural log of X.

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:37.918
All of that over

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:40.516
delta X.

00:00:40.516 --> 00:00:43.671
So now we can use a few
logarithm properties.

00:00:43.671 --> 00:00:46.146
We know that if I have
the natural log of A

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.730
minus the natural log of B

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.832
this is equal to the natural log

00:00:50.832 --> 00:00:52.649
of A over B.

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.360
So we can use that right over here

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.319
where I have the natural
log over something

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:58.059
minus the natural log of something else.

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.186
So all of this is going to be equal to

00:01:00.186 --> 00:01:01.853
the limit as delta X

00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:04.841
approaches zero

00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:06.341
of the natural log

00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:09.481
of this divided by that.

00:01:10.405 --> 00:01:12.085
So X plus delta X

00:01:12.085 --> 00:01:12.918
over X.

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:15.534
X plus delta X

00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:18.799
over X

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.129
all of that over

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:21.582
delta X.

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:23.272
And actually, let me
just write it that way.

00:01:23.272 --> 00:01:24.417
All of that over

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.585
delta X.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.325
Well jee, all I did, if I have

00:01:27.325 --> 00:01:29.351
natural log of that
minus natural log of that

00:01:29.351 --> 00:01:31.338
that's the same thing as natural log

00:01:31.338 --> 00:01:32.723
of this first expression

00:01:32.723 --> 00:01:34.585
divided by that second expression.

00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:36.907
It comes straight out of
our logarithm properties.

00:01:36.907 --> 00:01:41.248
Well, inside of this logarithm
X divided by X is one.

00:01:41.248 --> 00:01:43.236
And then delta X divided by X

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:46.026
just write that as delta X

00:01:46.026 --> 00:01:46.859
over X.

00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:49.590
So that's another way of writing that.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.366
And then we could put a
one over delta X up front.

00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:55.780
So we could say this is the same thing as

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.666
this is equal to

00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:58.499
the limit

00:01:59.342 --> 00:02:00.175
as delta X

00:02:01.164 --> 00:02:02.390
approaches zero

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.028
of, I 'll do this in another color.

00:02:05.028 --> 00:02:09.152
So this, I can rewrite as one over delta X

00:02:09.152 --> 00:02:11.627
times the natural log

00:02:11.627 --> 00:02:12.460
of

00:02:16.122 --> 00:02:17.742
one plus

00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:19.075
one plus delta X

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:21.872
over X.

00:02:21.872 --> 00:02:24.200
Let me close that parenthesis.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.935
So now we can use another
exponent property.

00:02:27.935 --> 00:02:30.989
If I have, I'll write it out here.

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.024
If I have A times a natural log of B

00:02:34.024 --> 00:02:36.369
that is equivalent to

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.587
the natural log of B

00:02:38.587 --> 00:02:39.420
to the A.

00:02:40.265 --> 00:02:42.836
And so here, this would
be the A in that case.

00:02:42.836 --> 00:02:46.070
So I could bring that out and
make that an exponent on this.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.622
So this is all going to be equal to

00:02:48.622 --> 00:02:50.235
the limit

00:02:50.235 --> 00:02:53.154
as delta X approaches zero

00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:54.955
of the natural log

00:02:54.955 --> 00:02:57.205
of, give myself some space,

00:02:58.492 --> 00:02:59.325
one

00:03:02.587 --> 00:03:03.920
one plus delta X

00:03:05.407 --> 00:03:06.240
over X

00:03:07.198 --> 00:03:08.233
to the

00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:10.238
one over delta X power.

00:03:10.238 --> 00:03:12.708
One over delta X power.

00:03:12.708 --> 00:03:15.396
Now this might start to
look familiar to you,

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:18.049
it might start to look close
to the definition of E.

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.326
And we are, indeed, getting close to that.

00:03:20.326 --> 00:03:21.908
In order to get there fully

00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:24.366
I'm gonna do a change of variable.

00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:25.951
I'm going to say

00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:26.784
let's let

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.533
let's let

00:03:29.657 --> 00:03:31.574
N equal delta X over X.

00:03:33.572 --> 00:03:34.923
Delta X

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.222
over X.

00:03:36.222 --> 00:03:37.839
Well, in that case,

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.196
then if you multiply both sides by X

00:03:40.196 --> 00:03:42.779
you get delta X is equal to NX.

00:03:43.663 --> 00:03:46.066
Again, just multiply both
sides of this equation by X

00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:48.434
and swap to the sides there.

00:03:48.434 --> 00:03:51.404
And then if you want one over delta X

00:03:51.404 --> 00:03:52.737
one over delta X

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.727
that would be equal to

00:03:55.727 --> 00:03:56.644
one over NX

00:03:57.918 --> 00:04:00.487
which we could also write as one over N

00:04:00.487 --> 00:04:01.904
times one over X.

00:04:02.977 --> 00:04:04.359
Or actually, let me write it this way.

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.098
Actually, that's the way
I do want to write it.

00:04:06.098 --> 00:04:08.259
So these are all the substitutions

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:10.256
that I want to do when
I change a variable.

00:04:10.256 --> 00:04:12.003
And we also want to say, well look.

00:04:12.003 --> 00:04:14.503
As delta X is approaching zero

00:04:15.495 --> 00:04:17.953
what is N going to approach?

00:04:17.953 --> 00:04:20.620
Well, as delta X approaches zero

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:24.798
we have N will approach zero, as well.

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:27.094
Zero over X, well that's
just gonna be zero

00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:30.227
for any X that is not equal to zero.

00:04:30.227 --> 00:04:31.912
And that's okay because

00:04:31.912 --> 00:04:33.535
zero is not even in the domain

00:04:33.535 --> 00:04:34.954
of the natural log of X.

00:04:34.954 --> 00:04:38.260
So, this is going to be,
for our domain, it works.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.860
That is, delta X approaches zero

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.088
N approaches zero.

00:04:42.088 --> 00:04:44.872
And you could think about
it the other way around

00:04:44.872 --> 00:04:47.403
as N approaches zero,
delta X approaches zero.

00:04:47.403 --> 00:04:50.455
So now let's do our change of variable.

00:04:50.455 --> 00:04:52.719
So if we make the substitutions

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:55.438
instead of taking the limit
as delta X approaches zero

00:04:55.438 --> 00:04:57.112
we are now going to take the limit as

00:04:57.112 --> 00:04:58.529
N approaches zero

00:05:00.106 --> 00:05:01.617
of

00:05:01.617 --> 00:05:03.243
the natural log

00:05:03.243 --> 00:05:04.847
of

00:05:04.847 --> 00:05:06.796
give myself some parenthesis.

00:05:06.796 --> 00:05:08.629
And I'll say, one plus

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.442
and now this is the same thing as N.

00:05:12.442 --> 00:05:13.766
One plus N.

00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:15.786
And then all of that is going to be

00:05:15.786 --> 00:05:17.129
raised to

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:19.020
the one over N times one over X

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.386
that's what one over delta X is equal to.

00:05:21.386 --> 00:05:23.756
This is one over delta X right over here.

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:25.037
Which we have over here.

00:05:25.037 --> 00:05:26.573
And it's the same thing as one over N

00:05:26.573 --> 00:05:27.874
times one over X.

00:05:27.874 --> 00:05:29.169
So let me write that down.

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.007
So this is the same thing

00:05:31.007 --> 00:05:32.590
as one over N times

00:05:33.498 --> 00:05:34.415
one over X.

00:05:36.606 --> 00:05:39.224
Now we can use this same exponent property

00:05:39.224 --> 00:05:40.538
to go the other way around.

00:05:40.538 --> 00:05:42.699
Well actually, let me just
rewrite this another time.

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.968
So this is going to be the same thing

00:05:44.968 --> 00:05:45.968
as the limit

00:05:47.186 --> 00:05:48.853
as N approaches zero

00:05:50.155 --> 00:05:52.479
of the natural log

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:53.312
of

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:57.946
one plus, I'll just write this in orange.

00:05:57.946 --> 00:05:59.201
One plus N

00:05:59.201 --> 00:06:01.466
to the one over N.

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:02.864
If I raise something to the exponent

00:06:02.864 --> 00:06:04.338
and that's times something else,

00:06:04.338 --> 00:06:05.991
I can that's the same thing as raising

00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:07.199
it to the first exponent.

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.480
And then raising that to the second value.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.849
This comes, once again,
straight out of our

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:13.838
exponent properties.

00:06:13.838 --> 00:06:16.971
And now we can use this
property the other way

00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:19.493
to bring this one over X out front.

00:06:19.493 --> 00:06:22.277
But in fact, the one over
X itself is not affected

00:06:22.277 --> 00:06:23.783
as N approaches zero.

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:26.421
So we can even take it
completely out of the limit.

00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:29.113
So we could take it
all the way over there.

00:06:29.113 --> 00:06:31.535
And this is when you
should be getting excited.

00:06:31.535 --> 00:06:33.419
This will be equal to

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:34.252
one over X

00:06:35.555 --> 00:06:36.805
times the limit

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.807
as N approaches zero

00:06:41.653 --> 00:06:43.153
of the natural log

00:06:44.245 --> 00:06:45.078
of

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.653
one

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:49.847
one plus N.

00:06:51.287 --> 00:06:53.537
We do that in orange color.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.117
One plus N to the one over N.

00:06:58.492 --> 00:07:01.020
And now, what really gets affected

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.846
is what's going on inside
of the natural log.

00:07:02.846 --> 00:07:04.434
That's where all of the Ns are.

00:07:04.434 --> 00:07:06.323
And so let's bring the
limit inside of that.

00:07:06.323 --> 00:07:08.447
So this is all going to be equal to

00:07:08.447 --> 00:07:09.992
give myself some space.

00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:11.930
A little bit of extra chalk board space.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.863
This is going to be equal to

00:07:14.863 --> 00:07:15.696
one over X

00:07:16.652 --> 00:07:18.760
times the natural log

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.095
times the natural log of

00:07:21.095 --> 00:07:21.928
the limit

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:25.206
as N approaches zero

00:07:26.608 --> 00:07:27.441
of

00:07:28.876 --> 00:07:29.709
one plus N

00:07:30.755 --> 00:07:32.255
to the one over N.

00:07:33.117 --> 00:07:35.029
Close those parenthesis.

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:36.574
Now this is exciting.

00:07:36.574 --> 00:07:39.444
What is inside the natural log here?

00:07:39.444 --> 00:07:42.030
Well, this business
right over here, this is

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.447
a definition of the number E.

00:07:45.335 --> 00:07:47.347
So that is equal to E.

00:07:47.347 --> 00:07:49.265
Well, what's the natural log of E?

00:07:49.265 --> 00:07:50.633
Well that's just one.

00:07:50.633 --> 00:07:53.004
So it's one over X times one.

00:07:53.004 --> 00:07:55.276
Well, that is indeed equal to

00:07:55.276 --> 00:07:56.496
one over X.

00:07:56.496 --> 00:07:58.070
Which is exactly

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.084
the result that we were looking for.

00:08:00.084 --> 00:08:01.473
That the derivative

00:08:01.473 --> 00:08:03.370
with respect to X of natural log of X,
