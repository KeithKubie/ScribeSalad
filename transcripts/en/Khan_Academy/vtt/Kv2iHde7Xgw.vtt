00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.760
We're asked to solve the
log of x plus log of 3

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.840
is equal to 2 log
of 4 minus log of 2.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.530
So let me just rewrite it.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:15.080
So we have the log of x plus
the log of 3 is equal to 2 times

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.150
the log of 4 minus the log
of 2, or the logarithm of 2.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.110
And this is a reminder.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.010
Whenever you see a logarithm
written without a base,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.560
the implicit base is 10.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.640
So we could write 10 here, 10
here, 10 here, and 10 here.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.130
But for the rest
of this example,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.620
I'll just skip writing
the 10 just because it'll

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.730
save a little bit of time.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.320
But remember, this
literally means log base 10.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.820
So this expression,
right over here,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.580
is the power I have
to raise 10 to to get

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.595
x, the power I have to
raise 10 to to get 3.

00:00:45.595 --> 00:00:47.220
Now with that out of
the way, let's see

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.830
what logarithm
properties we can use.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.850
So we know, if we-- and
these are all the same base--

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.790
we know that if we have log base
a of b plus log base a of c,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.110
then this is the same
thing as log base a of bc.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.574
And we also know-- so let
me write all the logarithm

00:01:08.574 --> 00:01:09.990
properties that
we know over here.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.834
We also know that if
we have a logarithm--

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:17.750
let me write it this
way, actually-- if I have

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.580
b times the log
base a of c, this

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.847
is equal to log base a
of c to the bth power.

00:01:26.847 --> 00:01:28.680
And we also know, and
this is derived really

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.490
straight from both of
these, is that if I

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.170
have log base a of b
minus log base a of c,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.450
that this is equal to the
log base a of b over c.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.040
And this is really
straight derived

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.850
from these two right over here.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.550
Now with that out of the way,
let's see what we can apply.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.590
So right over here, we have
all the logs are the same base.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.570
And we have logarithm of
x plus logarithm of 3.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.200
So by this property
right over here,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.810
the sum of logarithms
with the same base,

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.840
this is going to be equal
to log base 3-- sorry,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.200
log base 10-- so I'll
just write it here.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.759
log base 10 of 3 times x, of 3x.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.320
Then, based on this
property right over here,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.700
this thing could be
rewritten-- so this

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.200
is going to be equal to--
this thing can be written

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:29.040
as log base 10 of 4 to the
second power, which is really

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.940
just 16.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.680
So this is just going to be 16.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.680
And then we still have minus
logarithm base 10 of 2.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.300
And now, using
this last property,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.260
we know we have one logarithm
minus another logarithm.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.310
This is going to be equal
to log base 10 of 16

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.880
over 2, 16 divided by 2,
which is the same thing as 8.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.060
So the right-hand side
simplifies to log base 10 of 8.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.570
The left-hand side
is log base 10 of 3x.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.430
So if 10 to some power is
going to be equal to 3x.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.210
And 10 to the same power
is going to be equal to 8.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.193
So 3x must be equal to 8.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.900
3x is equal to 8, and then we
can divide both sides by 3.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.770
Divide both sides by 3, you
get x is equal to 8 over 3.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.190
One way, this little step here,
I said, look, 10 to the-- this

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.180
is an exponent.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.720
If I raise 10 to this exponent,
I get 3x, 10 to this exponent,

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.600
I get 8.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.102
So 8 and 3x must
be the same thing.

00:03:41.102 --> 00:03:43.060
One other way you could
have thought about this

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.170
is, let's take 10 to this
power, on both sides.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.570
So you could say 10 to
this power, and then 10

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.430
to this power over here.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.920
If I raise 10 to
the power that I

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.760
need to raise 10
to to get to 3x,

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.020
well, I'm just going to get 3x.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.070
If I raise 10 to the power that
I need to raise 10 to to get 8,

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.160
I'm just going to get 8.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.500
So once again, you've
got the 3x is equal to 8,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.970
and then you can simplify.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.020
You get x is equal to 8/3.
