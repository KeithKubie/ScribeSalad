Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radio from w n y. S t e n n. P. R. Everybody level check. We're going to start the show with this fellow. His name's Ben Zimmer. He's the on language columnist for the New York Times magazine because we figured since we wanted to do a show called at break, we thought we should call Ben. And so we came into the studio and he brought with him a bunch of his favorite oops

Speaker 2:          00:30          example. I just wanted to give one of my favorite examples of a,

Speaker 1:          00:34          the first one that he hit us where the, uh, began its life. Was it in an AP, a news article?

Speaker 2:          00:40          Mm, well, it was an AP story, but the AP story was fine when the AP story appeared on a news site from the American family association, which by the way is a conservative Christian group. Um, the headline, first of all, said homosexual eases into 100 final at Olympic trials and then kissing guys with something that they would be good at. Well, if you read on, if you're confused by that headline, very, here's how it starts. Tyson homosexual easily won his semi-final for the a hundred meters at the u s Olympic track and field trials. And it goes on to say, you know, throughout the entire article, you know, on Saturday, homosexual misjudge the finish is opening heat. The entire article had the word homosexual in place of gay. The, his name is Tyson [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:32          According to Ben, this is a classic, classic example of a search and replace, oops. This group apparently did not like the word gay because gay makes homosexuality sound very nice and they're gay, right? So what they did was they ran a search and replace every instance of the word gay with the word homosexual, but then you get Tyson gay becoming Tyson homeless, sexual. This was just a one that a, they were a little careless with. Just to be fair, here's a contrasting example. In 1990, the Frizz Newbie ran martyr

Speaker 2:          02:05          about the, uh, Massachusetts budget crisis and had made reference to new taxes that will help put Massachusetts quote back into the African American. Um, and they had to issue a correction saying it should have said back in the day,

Speaker 1:          02:21          no, this one might've been a newsroom prank. We're not sure. Good. Then get into paper just for the hell of it. Here's one last one. This one happened after the famous broadcast, or Walter Cronkite died.

Speaker 2:          02:33          When did the Chicago Tribune did their online obituary for Cronkite? What happened was every instance of Cronkite got replaced by Mr Cronkite. You can understand the thinking behind that. They deciding, okay for deceased males, they should be referred to with the title Mr. But then what this, uh, turns into is an obituary where it says he was born Walter Leland, Mr Cronkite, Jr,

Speaker 1:          03:00          and he refers to his radio show, Walter Mister contact's 20th century. It's got things about his family has his son, Walter, Mr Cronkite, the third, his daughter, his daughter Kathy, Mr [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          03:14          My heart went, Ooh, Jed. The moment that my heart went, Ooh. And I'm Robert, I never will forget to this episode of Radiolab. The moment that I have for oopses starting with a tree. Oops. Then we've got a goose oops. And an entire town. Oh, oops. And a Harvard professor

Speaker 1:          03:39          that really want it. Yeah, no, we should just say before we start, oops. Oops. Is oops, can be a misleading term. Really what we're talking about here is something Greek. Well, you try hard to prevent one thing and then you get exactly what you didn't want to get back at you. Right. And our first story falls into that category. Back a few seasons ago, we were doing a show on deception and we ended up talking with a professor named Ruben Gore. Hello. Hi. Is this professor Gar? Yes. Speaking. He's a psychiatrist. Works at the University of Pennsylvania. And I'd call them to talk about his research on self deception, self deception. It's fascinating stuff. And I'm not gonna go into it now because somewhere along the way the conversation took a really weird turn. No. Oh yeah. Get Out. Yeah. Yeah. And it happened when he began to tell me about some studies, range studies done by a, uh, what was the guy's name? His name is hanging in, I don't remember. Second.

Speaker 4:          04:36          MMM. MMM.

Speaker 1:          04:39          What's his name? Henry Murray. And the reason we want to hear about Henry Murray is what? I built it up. Don't you want to know more than that yet? No. Hold on that. Tell me why. Okay. I'm going to let it unfold because we were so interested in what rubigard told us that we found a guy. Yeah. Hi. How's it going? Who knows a whole lot about professor. Mary's name is Austin Chase. Very windy day today, isn't it? He lives in a remote cabin in Mon Ghana. Got Another one coming in the foothills. Okay. Professor Marie was a very prestigious scholar. He had been a professor of psychology at Harvard before the Second World War. During the war. He, uh, went to work for the s Shasha Office of strategic services, which was the forerunner of the CIA. And a couple of years into his government service says Austin. Something happened. It really spooked him and spooked the country during the Korean War. Uh, there were some Gis, he said he'd been captured in Korea and afterwards, after the Korean War, they refused to come home. They appeared to have communist portrayed their country, their own country, and disappeared behind Red China bamboo,

Speaker 3:          05:48          correct John, if anybody wants to go home.

Speaker 1:          05:53          [inaudible] and their military establishment was very much concerned that the communists had found techniques for brainwashing and so Marie and other psychiatrists in the government were charged with preparing those soldiers to resist that kind of brainwashing. And Marie himself developed a style of interrogation. Stressful interrogation was the term used that the army could use on its pilots.

Speaker 5:          06:17          Yeah. He developed this method of kidnapping. Then before they were sent them to mission

Speaker 1:          06:22          and then says Ruben Guru. He'd run them through a battery of tests.

Speaker 5:          06:25          Let's just see if they break and if they didn't break, they were fine to fly.

Speaker 1:          06:29          This kind of psychological training was most kind of a new front in the Cold War and in the 1950s Marie's back at Harvard and he's thinking of ways to fine tune his techniques and this is where things get interesting. He took a clash of Harvard undergraduates, 20 some odd sophomores, mostly. Oh. Students were told to write an autobiographical essay like a diary, and he told him, you know what, make it very personal, right. You're deep his thoughts in their highest aspirations and hopes while you're at it, right about your sexual fantasies where class and after the students were done, he said to them, now I'm going to pair you up into groups of two to debate or discuss what they'd written. Students were like, okay, we'll share. No big deal, but they were duped. They were walked into this very brightly lit room. Just turned out to be an interrogation room with a one way mirror, put in a chair, strapped in.

Speaker 1:          07:28          Electrodes were attached to their arms, chest, their heart to measure stress basically, and they were also filming through the mirror and then instead of a classmate in want a total strange older man. This guy was holding their essay, they didn't know it, but Murray had trained to do everything he could to anger and humiliate the undergraduate and he just tore them apart piece by piece using the essay. The mock was shooting aspirations. Then after this was done, the students have to come back week after week to view themselves on film being humiliated. That to me seems like the worst part. After they'd been humiliated, they had to watch themselves being humiliated over and over.

Speaker 5:          08:19          People became tearful and miserable and he was proud how he destroyed people. What, what

Speaker 1:          08:25          kind of person is this? Like why did he do it? Yeah, why he did it. There were any one of a number of explanations and they all could be true. One is it was a grant grabbing. He was getting money to do these things. I'll say, you know, this was the Cold War. He was fighting communism may have thought it was justified. Yeah, but, but he, but he just said he was proud of this. Well, it also happens to be the case that he was having an affair for about 30 years with a woman, not his wife, and they had a sexual relationship that bordered on the shadow mask. In fact, wash sadomasochistic another word, Moorish interest in these was intensely personal. Whatever the case in those Harvard experiments, there was one student who was just not prepared for any of it.

Speaker 5:          09:11          His code name was lawful, lawful. They gave each of the students our code name because he was considered so conventional. He was really still just a boy. Graduated High School at 16 was living a thousand miles from home, two shirts and two charges to his name and lawful apparently was an especially lonely kid. The notes I found, okay,

Speaker 1:          09:31          Marie did refer specifically to lawful Sesay, which she shies highly alienated.

Speaker 5:          09:36          So when lawful walked into that room, sat across from that stranger. The guy really did a job on him. He was young so he was barely growing a beard. So the first thing that guy tells him is, what is this on your chin? Something trying to look like a beard. Then the guy opens up lawfully essay and lets him have it. Meanwhile, like all the students lawfully had been hooked up to all these stress monitors. I a analyzed his data compared to all the other participants he had firing awake, strongest response. Physiologically you mean like it's heartbeat. The fastest are linked to everything.

Speaker 6:          10:14          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          10:16          amazingly, this experiment went on for three years and decades later, a lot of the subjects were still upset, considered it one of the most traumatic experiences they'd had in their 20s lawful never forgot it. That's right. It was resentful at the way he was treated at Harvard. He had nightmares about Professor Murray after he left Harvard. So what happened to this guy? Oh, well he finished up his four years at Harvard, got his degree, and got a phd in math, and he began to teach math and then he became a household name. What do you mean? Well, I mean this,

Speaker 6:          10:53          yes, Bi raid began just afternoon in a remote mountainous area called Stemple pass about five miles outside the town of Lincoln, Montana.

Speaker 5:          11:01          Turns out that lawful, his real name your door Kosinski yeah, no. Oh yeah. Kazanski was no out. Yeah. The FBI dubbed him the Unabomber in nearly 18 years. He found targets all over the country. His meticulously made bombs have killed three people and injured another 23

Speaker 6:          11:18          blew my arm off to the side like this. And the first thing I thought was why did they do that?

Speaker 1:          11:25          Do you think that this study had anything to do with, uh, Ted Cruz in skis subsequent very infamous act?

Speaker 5:          11:33          Well, I think he probably would have, if it hadn't been for that experiment, he still probably would have been maybe reclusive living somewhere in a cabin in one [inaudible] regardless. But I think the evil twist was, uh, was done there.

Speaker 1:          11:50          Years later while he was researching a book, Austin Chase corresponded

Speaker 7:          11:54          with Kozinski

Speaker 1:          11:55          and one of his letters, he mentioned that he participated in some psychological experiments conducted by profession. Marie, of course, I was very curious and I wrote it back to tell me a little bit more about it. And he shed while you really, uh, don't, I don't know if you want to go into that can of worms.

Speaker 8:          12:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          12:24          Rubin Gore is a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and Austin Chase is the author of the book Harvard and the making of the Unabomber.

Speaker 10:         12:40          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         12:41          oops. Oops. Here's one more

Speaker 2:          12:48          from Ben Zimmer. What is the Cupertino effect? The Cupertino effects is the name given to the phenomenon of when you rely on a spellchecker too much, it will give you a suggestion. And very often it's a suggestion that you really shouldn't take. It would, why is it called the Cupertino effect? Well, in early spellcheckers, if you wrote cooperation, the word cooperation, c, O, o, p, e, r, a, t, I, O, n, perfectly typical spelling of the word cooperation in early spellcheckers. Um, that word was not there because it expected you to spell it c o Hyphen. And so what it would do is it would give you a suggestion and the suggestion was Cupertino is in another town and then in California. So if you look at documents that are still online from the UN, from the EU, from NATO, you'll find dozens and dozens of Cupertino's that have found their way in there. For instance, here's a German NATO officer was quoted as saying, the Cupertino with our Italian comrade proved to be very fruitful. And then there was a proposal from the EU scientific and technical research committee. They proposed quote, stimulating cross-border Cupertino.

Speaker 7:          14:06          Oops. Number two, you go the the next. This is the next one is just a different flavor entirely. We're going to meet someone. I don't know. I can't really say they did anything wrong. It's just, I mean this one is more like, like would you say luck mixed the poster. You just picked up a toothbrush and it was connected to a snake that was connected to a monster that was connected to the devil himself. You wouldn't know. You're just picking up a tooth. So this is a case where really bad things happen. The story comes from our, our own reporter Pat Walters. Yeah, it concerns [inaudible] go ahead and, okay, so just to start, I want you to imagine you're on a mountain top. Okay. This mountain is in western Nevada. The second highest peak in the state of Nevada got a name, it's called wheeler peak and it was this, this is Michael Cohen.

Speaker 7:          14:55          I go by Michael P. Cohen. He's a nature writer and he tells me that up on top of this mountain there is a grove of old trees. You can see the trees from a distance and Eric Wood is so bright that it actually glistens in the sun. What do they call it? Oh, bristle cone pines. Yes. Can you describe what they look like? Sure. They tend to be shorter, broad at the base. They get very, very old and as they get old they become towards your door gnarled. They sort of twist up towards the sky. The overall effect is sort of electrical. They look kind of like what you'd seen a Tim Burton movie. So you have that picture in your mind? Yep. Okay. So the story, it's about the scientist named Don Curry. I'm going to take a drink of water. Wait, I'm going to take a drink of water.

Speaker 7:          15:45          Okay. Story starts in 1964 don curry was a graduate student from North Carolina and he was young. Do we know how old he was? He was 30 years old and he'd just gotten a big grant from the national science foundation to do some climate change research. Not like climate change. Now though, climate change thousands of years ago because he learned that you can actually sort of travel back in time, go back into the past using this spacing between tree rings, the annual rings. This is Ron Lanner, he's a retired forest service scientist and he says you can use the width of the tree rings to determine whether it was colder at one time or Rainier at one period in the tree's life or whatever. So curry up on top of this mountain up amongst these trees and he needs to find one that he can look inside and kind of see what the weather was like.

Speaker 7:          16:34          Way Back in the past five minutes of looking is all it was involved. This is from a Nova documentary. Carrie died a few years ago and this is actually the only time that he ever talked about this story on tape. Literally he found a tree there, first old tree that we climbed to that uh, he described as looking super, super old. So curry takes out this special drill, which scientists used to take like a core sample to look at the rings. Yeah. And presses it up against the tree, give it a good push to get it through the bar and he starts twisting it in and clockwise into the tree. But he wasn't having much luck. The normal approach to coring the tree wasn't working. It becomes harder and harder for him to turn this thing into the tree and eventually the bit of his drill broke off in the tree.

Speaker 7:          17:33          Oh this isn't just any drill. He ordered it from Sweden and the whole time he's thinking, if I can't get this thing out of the tree, that would mean the research project would be lost for the year. So at this point, kind of lumbers back the mountain and dejected. He managed to find the district ranger and told him the problem guys might drill. It got stuck in the tree, what should I do? And they tell him, don't worry about it done. We'll just cut the tree down. This is one tree. There are dozens of these trees all around.

Speaker 11:         18:07          So they start slicing into the tree. It takes awhile to cut it down cause it's really dense. Knots are old and eventually the tree

Speaker 7:          18:21          falls over. Then they cut some slabs out of the lower part of the tree. Curry gets one of these slabs back to his lab, throws it on a big desk, finds a magnifying glass because the rains are really small and he starts counting one, two, three. As he counts, he's making little pin holes or pencil marks every 50 year, a hundred years, three 17 by the end of the first day, he gets back to a thousand years like the dark ages where in Europe eating raw pasta day to 2006 by the middle of the day he gets back to like Jesus, Roman Empire, gladiator, Centurion. But even at that point he was only like half [inaudible] wait, he finished. He kept counting. We can begin to see that we were getting over 4,000 years, over 4,500 over 4,600 and we ended up around 4,900 years. 4,844 annual rings in it and at that point, the oldest tree that anyone had ever found was 4,600 years old. In other words, he had himself the oldest tree ever, but he had killed it. And you've got to think, I've got to have done something wrong. I bet her recount. I better recount again. But no matter how many times he counted the rings, the number never went down.

Speaker 12:         19:53          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          19:53          the world's oldest tree was dead.

Speaker 13:         19:58          Uh,

Speaker 7:          20:03          it was, it was truly, it was horrifying. It was a, it was a, like a family tragedy.

Speaker 13:         20:11          Uh,

Speaker 7:          20:12          people had given these trees names. There was Buddha and Socrates and Methuselah. They called Curry's tree, the promethium tree. And the guy who named that particular tree was so angry that he wrote a magazine article where he called Don curry a murderer all across the country. There is a tremendous uproar. Same thing. What about killing the world's oldest living organism? Ma, I thought we were just saying it was the oldest living tree. It's, it's both. It's the oldest tree and it's the oldest organism. It wait, wait, wait. You mean that the oldest continuously living

Speaker 3:          20:53          okay.

Speaker 7:          20:53          And [inaudible] shrub mushroom, eh. Oh, you making it. Are you sure about this? This head with, this is the oldest living, continuous individual alive on the planet. I know what I said. This tree was older than any other tree on the planet, older than the oldest sponge, which is like 1500 years old and older than the oldest animal. Just some sort of oyster, which is 405 years old, older than any other living thing on the entire planet.

Speaker 3:          21:23          Oh God.

Speaker 7:          21:29          Where do we go? Here we go from there. So where does that leave you, Mr. Curry. So what happened to him? Well, right after this happened, Currie pretty much stopped doing research on trees. He basically studied salt flats for the rest of his career.

Speaker 3:          21:45          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          21:46          big treeless salt flats. And aside from that little Nova clip that we played before, he hasn't really ever gone on record talking about this. So it's hard for us to say like how we really felt about it. There was this one moment he was being interviewed by a TV reporter, like about his salt flats research. And this would have been in the 19 probably the late eighties early nineties years and years after the whole tree incident. All of a sudden out of a clear blue sky

Speaker 3:          22:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          22:15          the television reporter asked him, oh, aren't you the curry who killed the world's oldest tree?

Speaker 3:          22:23          He was completely empty. [inaudible] yeah.

Speaker 7:          22:29          Curry just turned his back and ran away.

Speaker 3:          22:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          22:36          who is it that's the same? It's just we're off. Somebody on the other hand, he, he did have the incredible ms switching to kill the oldest living organism on our planet. Yeah, but this is 25 years later and he's still getting hassled about this tree. [inaudible] we're talking about one tree here. Well No, we're talking about the tree here. Right, but thing about a tree that lasts for four almost 4,000 more than that. 5,005 almost five years. Is that the, it is a repository. It is a talisman for 5,000 years of earth history. But I mean would it be, would it be any less bad if the tree were three and a half thousand years old? This is just one more old thing. No, it is. It's the oldest of all taking like the Guinness Book of World Records. Oh, you keep making me into like a Ripley's believe it or not guy, but no really what you're being, no, no, no. There's a when you've been around longer than everybody else, there's a certain percentage of your experience. Yeah. Well I'm older than you. I walk in here and I look at you and I feel pity for other things. You don't know [inaudible] with the treatment of

Speaker 9:          23:46          film in a right blade, but it must have been around as your board and Pat Walters right about a month or you the round line and we're happy to say that since our original broadcast at the story, a new oldest living tree has been found. It's also a bristle cone pine also in the white mountains and its current age. According to Dr. Peter Brown of the Rocky Mountain Tree Ring Research Group is just about 5,060 years old, which makes it actually older than don Curry's tree when it was cut down. So Don Curry, if you're out there listening from the afterlife, you can now rest in peace. We'll continue in a moment. Little brains, man.

Speaker 2:          25:31          And now to keep us in our oopsie mood. Here's another Cupertino oops from language expert, Ben Zimmer. So back in October, oh six Reuters, the news wire had an article about honeybees. And uh, there was some very interesting sentences in this article about honeybees. For instance, did you know, quote Queen Elizabeth has 10 times the lifespan of workers and lays up to 2000 eggs a day. That's why she's a very nice girl, but doesn't have a lot to say because there's all these eggs dropping on the floor with it's highly evolved social structure of tens of thousands of worker bees commanded by Queen Elizabeth. The honeybee genome could also improve the search for genes linked to social behaviors. So every time a clean reference came in, they were commanded to that particular queen. Whenever the words, the Queen appeared in this article, they had to be the queen. So the queen was being replaced with Queen Elizabeth, unfortunately in an article about honeybee

Speaker 16:         26:28          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          26:33          Ma'am

Speaker 16:         26:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          26:38          this next, Ooh, singular. Ooh, wouldn't it be, I mean, if you have one, oop. Wouldn't never heard that, right?

Speaker 17:         26:44          No sister. A new clean edge. Oop. This next one, it raises the question of, I guess you'd say, of moral balance. The question that I don't think any of us would want to have to answer comes to us from our producer Lulu Miller. Okay, so set up this story a, this story happens and where it's in a little town in northern Michigan called Myo 7:00 AM just drove through the Delaware water gap. That's me on my way out there from New York. The Sun is rising and it's about an 800 mile drive and is just gorgeous out here. Listen to you lush and I'll enter the outdoors. No, yeah, I know, but I'm just one of those people by windows and when I get out into nature, bear dive, feel my place in the [inaudible] world. Anyways, it's crossed into Myo. What was the reason you were going again to see a bird?

Speaker 17:         27:38          A very, not just rare, not just the kind of bird birders get obsessed about this is a bird. This is what they call a life bird. Oh, life. Birders wait their life to see. It really only found right here. What's the bird called? The Kirtland warbler. Now have you, have you seen apparently before? No, I've never seen one. This is my first trip up here. This right here. Where are you? We're just outside of the town on the edge of the forest about to go in and I was standing with about 15 people who've come from everywhere. You folks coming from to see this bird Toledo. I'm from South Carolina. Yeah, we're from Oregon, Wyoming. We'll walk out to a spot, try to stay single file park ranger leads us down a path into a little clearing and pretty immediately in the background there. Way Back there.

Speaker 17:         28:27          The guy from Ohio spots of Kirtland. Huh? There you go. Good tiny yellow bird back there. Right there. Up High and the Jack Pine Tree. Oh Great. To sing it like crazy. The lady from Dayton starts clapping. Can you describe what you're seeing? I see a lovely bird with a gray back is a guy from Oregon, Jim Coleman, blue gray bag, and his wife read us smaller than a rob and brilliant yellow in the sunlight. It's just an absolutely radiant bird. Yeah. Is this worth the trip tomorrow again? Oh, you bet. I don't know. It just makes me thankful that I'm here. Yeah, so, and it makes me break for them. My wife is here. I know this is something she's wanting to see a lot. For a long time. Jim Actually starts to tear up. It's a very special bird. Hold my hand. He had a guy and that's what this story is really about. How special is this bird? Meaning well, how much is a species?

Speaker 17:         29:33          Um, well here's the backstory. Okay. In the early seventies the warbler almost went extinct. The reason why it thought was because of a little creature called the Calbert. I want to go in. Okay. That's just the sound of them. It's a parasite. You know when someone who is this guy, this is Chris Mensing fish and wildlife biologist with the u s fish and Wildlife Service, and we're standing in this cage full of Calbert, but it looks like we've got six males and one female. Let me grab a couple who just reached out and grabbed two of them. You can get it that the males, oh yeah, go ahead. Imagine a tiny little gnarly crow got really sharp little. Yeah. But with this blunt dagger like beat, very drab body. I'm very doll to, here's what the Calbert does to the warbler while the warbler is out of its nest, like getting an alarm or something.

Speaker 17:         30:25          Yeah. The Calbert lay is one of its own eggs in the nest to make room for it. So the warbler doesn't know anything is up. It pushes out one of the warblers eggs. Oh yeah. Out of the nest. [inaudible] and the timing is such that the cupboard egg will hatch first and will double its size in 24 hours. So by the time that the host birds hatch, that Colberg may be up to four times the size, and when they start begging for food foods, the parents, the loudest, most aggressive chick is going to get fed the cupboard chick. So the warbler mom ends up shoveling food into this Calbert chicken. Yep. Oftentimes it gets so much food that another Warburg chick will die. So when the cowbirds first showed up in this area in late 18 hundreds early 19 hundreds the warbler population just started plummeting. This huge drop by 1971 or only 200 males on earth. Wow.

Speaker 18:         31:12          So what do you do? Are you asking me? Hmm. Um, I guess you get it. Yeah.

Speaker 17:         31:18          Kill the cow. Birds. Um, this is one of 54 traps and new one that we just built this year, which is why we're out in this cage. It's actually a cowbird trap. Oh, she did? Yeah, she, yeah, she bite me just like anyone that's yet someone larger grabbing you. They don't appreciate it too much. And so anyone know how to kill, I kind of do. Yeah. The rassic compression is the term we use. We basically squeeze the bird, suffocating and preventing it from breathing just with your hands. There's no, Yup, Yup. Yeah. You have to do that. Yeah. Like all the time. Yeah. Did you see this? No, but 1972 fish and wildlife service sets up a bunch of traps a few years at about 12,000 dead cow birds. Later it work

Speaker 19:         32:05          [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         32:07          kind of the population stopped dying off, but then it didn't start bouncing back. What's going on? Yeah. Why aren't we seeing bigger numbers now that we're catching the competence? That's Rita Helgeson. She worked with the forest service back in the eighties and we thought, well, if we finally concluded it must be just there is not enough happening.

Speaker 18:         32:27          10 like they don't have enough trees. Is that right? Well, no, there are plenty of trees, but the thing about warblers is they like a specific kind of tree. They like them very young.

Speaker 17:         32:39          [inaudible] I could feel it at the same. They like I'm young now, but they like young trees is what you're saying? Yup. And there aren't young trees in this place? No. It's really weird. When when they started looking around this forest, they notice all the trees were really, really old. Why wouldn't there be young trees? Well us. Oh, you can [inaudible] hey, smokey bear. Let's see. When humans began to settle in this area of Michigan in about the 1880s they brought with them at certain human disdain for fire, could perforate forest fires. The fire is exactly what's needed up there to make new trees. Yeah. This ecosystem is a fire ecosystem. That's Chris. It Burns because when these trees burn, they release their seeds and make room for new trees to grow. It is a fire ecosystem. It is made to burn. So I asked

Speaker 18:         33:36          do you again, what do you do?

Speaker 17:         33:39          Do you start fires? Would that be the solution that would be the solution. Wild. So the forestry started doing what we call a prescribed burn. Basically says Rita, they burned down a little patch of forest, a few acres to regenerate it and one windy spring day in 1980 at a place called Mac Lake. The forestry service started a fire that they probably shouldn't have. Okay. My name is Dick Lord. At the time of the Mack lake fire, I was part of the ignition crew for the prescribed burn. What is an ignition crew? Uh, they light the fire. So at 10 in the morning they can his crew go out into the woods when the plants start setting up perimeters and they begin lighting, a few stands of shrunk. I was driving home, that's Bob Burner. Best name ever for firefighter. I could see forest service starting to do a burn, and I thought, this is not a good time. It was windy. They didn't have the man power, and I said, well, I'll probably be getting called out here. The name. Basically, we did not realize that the weather was going to change as rapidly as it did and the wind came up suddenly, something nobody could predict, and it took the fire across the road into a standard mature Jack Pine.

Speaker 20:         34:56          [inaudible] flames, probably a hundred 150 feet year solid. It's like a roaring train. Boys guys jump into their bulldozers trying to plow trenches alongside the fly, pinch at all, and you can feel the heat. It was really out of our control hitting the tops of the trees rolling. I knew at the rate it was traveling that nobody's going to be a major catastrophe

Speaker 17:         35:24          within six hours. It had burned over 20,000 acres. It's one of the fastest moving fires ever documented. Yeah, we're through here. [inaudible] as you can see, it was all black. These are two guys. Hi Bob. I'm like, oh, houses in the area that got burnt murder. The guy down there in the corner, yeah, grabbed it off there and dropped the black chard. Their houses were okay, but 41 houses were destroyed all the way up to the lake. She's completely, Yep. Nothing Green. No. Like something out of a moonscape fires. You could see everything gone and the worst part about it for all of us, that's three to help us. Then again, one said it killed one in the foreign service employees, a very young wildlife technician who was very well loved by his coworkers. A guy named Jim Swiderski. You know Jim was a good friend?

Speaker 11:         36:13          Yeah.

Speaker 17:         36:13          As well as an employee declared. Again, Jim's boss. He told me that Jim had been a postman for a few years, but just loved birds so much that he took a huge pay cut to come and help protect the warbler. Basically what happened was, oh, okay, the fire overran him. Oh, the press was having a heyday just tearing into the forest service from what had happened in the towns. People were very angry at the forest service. How could you do this? We just, as they were told not to wear their forest service uniforms in town. Gosh, it was so terrible in the forest itself. You know, there was nothing there. It was completely silent. But a year later, a little bit of green started to poke up and the next year a little bit more and eight to 10 years after that Mac like Bern just seemed like every word you turned around, you'd stop for, listen. No, hardly five or six birds. The tremendous,

Speaker 8:          37:16          that was the, the answer to the mystery. The fire, you know, if you look at a population graph, that's Christmas thing again. After that Mac lake burn population went like that, he points his hand straight up. So it's pretty dramatic. And today the numbers are up to almost 4,000 birth and growing singing like crazy. Now that the birds are back, but a man is gone. When you walk around this town, a question lingers in the air. Your wife over before your mum worth the life of a bird. Take a woman. Look at her. No,

Speaker 17:         38:03          in my opinion it isn't. This is Ed Faucet. I W I wouldn't trade your life for a bird and sitting with him and his wife, Mary Jane, a man in a diner and no matter where you go in this town, but the government doing people don't tend to be huge fans of the warbler. It's just a small bird. I've been up here since 68 I've never seen one. Did you ever see one? No, never have I seen it in and back to Ed. I just got, I say to you, what would you think about it if your father or were killed for a bird? Be Pretty hard to accept when, but if you zoom out one human life versus the end of a species, you know how many warblers there are in the United States, there's something like 37 species of warblers are the real number is actually closer to 60 wow.

Speaker 17:         38:54          That's kind of ridiculous. And that's not all they ask you. When are you done? And we really say never. Chris explained to me that they have to keep killing the Calverts and they have to keep doing burns, these smaller burns. But every single year if we let things be, the bird would be extinct. Wow. That's the hard thing about this job is knowing that we're never done. How many people are working, how much you're probably looking at hundreds of people. Well over $1 million a year spent. All of this began to really sink in. I'm one of my last mornings out there. All right. It is five in the morning. It was the annual Kirtland warbler. Census.

Speaker 17:         39:37          We're birders from all over the world show up to help count how many warblers there are out there. Is it like there is a warbler stepped up. Steps up. There is a warbler. Yeah, that's actually exactly how it works. I was paired up with this guy, Dave Mendez. We're going to kind of walk through the middle of these transects. We're going to come up. He's like, he's kind of a dude, dude. He's an older guy, got a beer and works for an electrical contractor. Told me he's got a man room and man room. You know most guys that got sports, but I've got Kirtland's warbler pictures up on the wall. Nice. So I went into it thinking like, this'll be really cool. We'll march along. We'll count it. I looked at the map. It was a mile maybe of a walk. We'll be done in 20 minutes. Well, okay, maybe not. We're walking through the forest on our top and they did. We set off dense brambly forest. Still Dark. That was a hermit thresh. Okay. Let me just play you a quick little time lapse. 20 to seven right now the sun's just coming up and it's getting a little muggy out here. That was the curtains. Oh yeah. Yeah. We can't count them though. He's in that intersection.

Speaker 17:         40:44          Seven oh seven heard one way back that way. Yeah. Yeah. There it is again. Yeah, but I'm not gonna mark them in because I don't know exactly where he's at. Seven 33 there we go. Yeah. Yup. Right there. Did you counter? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We want to be a lot more accurate. We want to triangulate them. Nine 56 and all's well and the warbler. Woods couple of anther bite me. Yeah, they hurt down there. They do a little bit. Yeah. Get out of there.

Speaker 19:         41:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         41:16          10:45 AM I know that there's a bird out there, I can still hear that burden way back there. So we ended up staying out there for seven and a half hours. Just marked one, right? Yep. I've only mark one and I don't mean sound like I'm making fun of Dave. I mean he's doing his job well, but at some point in between the fire ants and taking four hours to confirm this one bird, he's going to be right off right here. I just started thinking about all the effort. It takes Rosa trees over from us and I can't see him. I just suddenly thought

Speaker 7:          41:52          [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         41:53          it's missing Fussy, fragile little bird and it hasn't evolved. Who Cares? I mean this is not worth it. And so I started asking people who protect the bird, why I do that with so much money and it's all for a bird. And I could see it maybe if it was for some, but it's just one warbler of 18 million different kinds of warblers like why do it? Oh, we do it cause we, we should, you know, we're stewards of the land. That's Chris mincing again. Cowbird killer. It's for future generations and well, here's the firestarter Dick Lord. You know, the Kirtland's warbler was listed under the endangered species act and we had a charge under the law to do what we could to recover its existence. And that's the only thing that I can say that, you know, we had to do what the law required us to do, so we should do it and the law tells us we have to do it.

Speaker 17:         42:54          Vincent and that question is a little wasteful for firemen worth the life of a bird. And that guy, ed at the diner, it just duck in my mind. And I realized I couldn't leave this town until I talked to the people who lost the most and I just skated. Introduced yourself full name. Yeah, sure. Robert Sweaters, ski age 54 Kathleen Sweaters, Ski Florence, Wider Ski. The mother, mother and the mother. The guy died. Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's it. What ice tea or water or anything. We're all sitting around the kitchen table. There's a lot of dogs and bureau over there. Kim's brother-in-law's there too. So off Kevin, Kevin Debris and I asked them to tell me about Jim.

Speaker 7:          43:32          Pretty Guy. Soft spoken. Smart is quite a character.

Speaker 17:         43:38          Yup. They told me at first they were furious. They should have never ever sent him in there. Angry at the forest service. Angry about this bird. No. Very angry. Now, three decades later, I say you keep that a little vertical. Exactly. Really? Jim's younger brother Robert said that the thing he wanted the most is for the Kirtland's warbler to become the state Burke by that. That would be the ultimate, Huh? That would be the biggest accomplishment ever would be that be in a state bird. Well I guess I'm, I'm, I guess in some ways I'm surprised like I didn't mean to come here with expectations, but in some ways I thought if it was my family that I would hate that bird, but I would just hate that bird. No, it's not the bird. I mean that bird didn't do anything to any of us. You know, if we can keep it going, I mean that's what he out to do. Let's keep it going. They think about Jim's death. Any of the military guys like the death of a soldier, where would you be setting right now? We would have lost all those soldiers in world war one. World War Two, he died protecting us. You know, it's only one species. Well then this could be another species in another species, in another species. Next thing you know, he'll walk out in the morning and it'll be quiet.

Speaker 17:         44:59          Thank God for the Teddy Roosevelt and the boys that made our national parks. Imagine what if we didn't have those? It costs money. It's painful, blah, blah, blah. You gotta have the guts to do that. And Jim was really that kind of guy. Wow. That is convincing. Yeah, but I mean, do you agree for us? And I asked the mom, what can I say? The bird took become and back, but the life is gone. So why bring it up again? It's done. It's, you can't bring it back. So you have to live by that, but there's always a hole in your heart, something that none of us will ever forget forever. Don't ask me any more questions, please.

Speaker 3:          45:51          Okay.

Speaker 17:         45:55          And then, oh good. Oh, the power went out. Give me a break. Oh. Oh, cool. We go home and get the generator.

Speaker 21:         47:30          Didn't hate him. I'm Jed. I'm Robert Dune Dude. You and your topic remains. Oops. [inaudible] final loops coming up. [inaudible] it's sort of a double hoops. I would say we start with an oops. That leads to a another, oops. That then self negates. It comes to us from a fellow who within the confines of the show we will call oopsie wheeler. So maybe we could just start with the both of you kinda introducing yourself and saying who you are and what you do. I mean just something basically like I'm Andrea sterly. Oh me. I'm Donald Sterling. This is dawn and Andrew Sterling. They're chemists. They're actually a research team here at a University of Montana and they met back in the 70s 1979 at the University of California in San Diego. We met and almost fell in love at first sight.

Speaker 22:         48:18          We dated for a week. He proposed, I accepted they got married and not long after don got offered a job. So they left their home in Sunny California and mind you, we lived about half a mile away

Speaker 21:         48:29          from the ocean. Nonetheless, they packed up a truck with all of our stuff, including about 200 plants and they moved to a Butte, Montana, which is a different thing altogether, but an old mining town that barely had a tree in the city limits. I don't know if you want to know Andrea's first impressions of Butte or not that shirt. I actually burst into tears and then started laughing. I think we call that his [inaudible]. Yeah, the viewing stand used to be up on the hill over here when this was an operating pit, so I actually grew up in the town over from Butte, Montana. It's kind of that town that you were afraid to go to when you were a kid. Filled with abandoned buildings, depressed and actually if you walked through town right there, right next to the middle of town, remember exactly where it was.

Speaker 21:         49:26          I remember being consistently enormous open wound on the hill, like, oh wow, this, this deep pit. This is where the pit is, the Berkeley pit and the guy saying, wow is Barrett Golding. I actually, I couldn't get back to Butte myself, so I asked Barrett to go over there and visit with a couple of engineer's. So tell me who you are. Okay, well, I'm Joe Griffin, Montana Department of Environmental Quality and I'm Nick Tucci. I'm with the Montana Bureau of Mines and geology and the three of them are standing at the edge of the pit, which is kind of hard to imagine, especially the size of this thing, but when you're at the edge of the pit and you look down in what you actually see is how can you convey what we're seeing, this enormous lake kind of, well, it's 40 billion gallons of water, which is a lot of water. It's one of the larger lakes in the United States. It's carved into this hill. Yeah. The main difference though, between this lake and one that you might decide to take an afternoon dip in, is that this lake is a

Speaker 17:         50:27          color of the water, is red, is kind of sickly red, and also rains and gray and black.

Speaker 1:          50:38          Oh

Speaker 22:         50:43          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          50:44          shimmers in this way that like words can't describe. And when you're standing there you can't help but wonder

Speaker 17:         50:52          the question I really have, and I'll rephrase it after I ask it cause it's not quite, it's like what the, what happened? What happened? Well, it's just a, you know, the price of copper

Speaker 1:          51:07          in the 1920s when we were stringing up telephone wires and electrical wires and going through world wars, a third of the copper in the u s came out of this hill,

Speaker 17:         51:15          you know, the long and the short of it is, um, you wouldn't be standing here broadcasting this or recording this without copper in your wire right there.

Speaker 1:          51:23          And in his heyday, you know, before the pit was even around Butte was this mining boom town. But by the 1940s, the price of copper or drop a company that owned all the mines and BW wasn't doing so well. And so they figured if it'd be cheaper and easier to just blow the top off the hill. Things just kept getting worse. And by 1982 right around the time when don and Andrea were coming to town,

Speaker 21:         51:53          going over the man, mine's completely shut down when they shut the pit in early 1980s right?

Speaker 1:          51:59          Here's the things, while they're actually mining, they keep all the groundwater pumped out of there so that it's dry and they can work and when they shut the mines,

Speaker 21:         52:06          they shut off the pumps. The company turned off the pumps, I think it was Earth Day 1982 yeah. On Earth Day after that, the a p it started filling up with groundwater and it took a good 10 years to actually see a kind of a rust colored puddling in the bottom of the pit itself,

Speaker 1:          52:26          but it was a puddle that was growing and growing and growing and growing, growing. Now here's the thing about that water. The rock around the pit is filled with pyrite and when the water hits the Pyrite in the air, the three reacts to create sulfuric acid.

Speaker 23:         52:44          Oh, in turn, that's Edwin Dob. Freelance writer had been for about 20 years. I actually grew up in Butte. The sulfuric acid hastens the removal of the metals from the, or itself like gold and silver and copper, copper, cadmium and row sink,

Speaker 1:          53:02          iron sulfate, arsenic. And what you end up with is this toxic acidic disaster

Speaker 21:         53:09          and it's still rising. The fact that, you know, since we started working on this piece, Jed, it's arisen like about a foot.

Speaker 23:         53:18          Um, there was an incident, infamous incident in the mid 1990s.

Speaker 1:          53:22          Anybody who grew up anywhere near Butte knows this

Speaker 21:         53:25          one stormy night, some 340 snow geese landed. They landed on the water looking for shelter and they of course drink some of it. The next day there were 342 goose carcasses floating on the water. They were all dead and the autopsy showed lesions in the esophagus throughout the digestive system. Oh, so it's like the water ate their insights. Yeah. Were you struck at all like Alan Pon arriving there? Did you actually kind of go visit the mind? The old mine site avoided it like the plague. We were to staunch environmentalist in the idea of living in a mining town was so completely foreign. And when they first showed up in Butte, dawn and Andrea, or they were kind of struggling to fit in at the university because they're trying to study this, a little microorganisms sponge in Bermuda, but they're in Butte and locked Butte, Montana. To make matters worse when they took off for a year on Sabbatical, our college accidentally unplugged our refrigerator, destroying all of our samples on desperation. Definitely had no funding. We decided we just needed to start over. But one day a scientist named Bill Chatham came into their lab with a piece of wood and on this wood there was some green, slimy stuff and he says, you won't believe this, but I found this stick with the slime on it in the pit

Speaker 21:         54:50          floating about a foot below the surface of the water. No. Here's the thing. I mean that lake is, this is like, this is the most deadly place you can imagine. I mean, nothing grows here. Nothing should grow here. Nothing. Absolutely not. Not even anything but nothing. Yeah. Less than nothing. Maybe absolute nothing like negative numbers of nothingness. It's more than nothing is an active getting rid of thing. It's an a gating nothingness. You know how there's love and hate. This is not a lack of love. This is hate. Okay? But they got together with some colleagues. They looked at the slime and they realized against all odds the stuff was alive, life, an acid mine, waste life that no one had ever studied before. It really is what started everything we've been doing now. Gosh, for the last 15 years

Speaker 8:          55:44          [inaudible] so far we found virtually hundreds of compounds, organisms that were growing, organisms that make molecules that can fight viruses, several turn out to be good in our Andi cancer screen, like cancer, really per click acid in Berkeley ammonites and the Berkeley Assa Towel is now published. Tons of papers. I mean their work has just taken off, so it's been pretty exciting research.

Speaker 21:         56:14          But then they told me this story that totally took them by surprise. It was about a year after they'd first started looking at the Pittwater. We found this sort of a sticky, opaque, thick, gooey black organism. Then they noticed that weirdly, if you put this little guy into a thing of the water from the pit, it actually absorbs the metals in Pittwater. What does that mean? Like they're taking the metals out of the water. They become little metal sponge. Yes. But so they're cleaning the water is what you're saying? Yeah. And there's lots of people that work with micro organisms to try to clean up metal, laid in water. But usually these things take in maybe like, I don't know, 10, 15% of the metal. This little guy will actually absorb between 85 and 95%. Whoa. So they got really curious about it and they started trying to figure out where it had ever been seen before we had it identified and they eventually discovered that the only place this yeast had ever been found was

Speaker 24:         57:14          where?

Speaker 21:         57:16          Well, in the rectal swabs of geese.

Speaker 24:         57:20          Oh, okay.

Speaker 21:         57:21          You mean like the snuggies that landed on the water? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          57:25          Hmm.

Speaker 21:         57:27          The geese left a little, uh, a little something behind

Speaker 3:          57:41          [inaudible].
