00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.610
Welcome to the
presentation on limits.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.290
Let's get started with some--
well, first an explanation

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.530
before I do any problems.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.110
So let's say I had-- let me
make sure I have the right

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.070
color and my pen works.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.480
OK, let's say I had the limit,
and I'll explain what a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.840
limit is in a second.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.780
But the way you write it is you
say the limit-- oh, my color is

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.860
on the wrong-- OK, let me
use the pen and yellow.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:38.181
OK, the limit as x
approaches 2 of x squared.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.340
Now, all this is saying is what
value does the expression x

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.680
squared approach as
x approaches 2?

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.130
Well, this is pretty easy.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.065
If we look at-- let me
at least draw a graph.

00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:57.010
I'll stay in this yellow color.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.420
So let me draw.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.813
x squared looks something
like-- let me use

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:05.610
a different color.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.900
x square looks something
like this, right?

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:20.040
And when x is equal to 2, y,
or the expression-- because

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.320
we don't say what
this is equal to.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.570
It's just the expression-- x
squared is equal to 4, right?

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.100
So a limit is saying, as x
approaches 2, as x approaches 2

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.920
from both sides, from numbers
left than 2 and from numbers

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.940
right than 2, what does
the expression approach?

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.630
And you might, I think, already
see where this is going and be

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.920
wondering why we're even going
to the trouble of learning this

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.040
new concept because it seems
pretty obvious, but as x-- as

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.320
we get to x closer and closer
to 2 from this direction, and

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.530
as we get to x closer
and closer to 2 to this

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.940
direction, what does
this expression equal?

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.670
Well, it essentially
equals 4, right?

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.690
The expression is equal to 4.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.090
The way I think about it is as
you move on the curve closer

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.390
and closer to the expression's
value, what does the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.500
expression equal?

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.660
In this case, it equals 4.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.850
You're probably saying, Sal,
this seems like a useless

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.690
concept because I could have
just stuck 2 in there, and I

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.850
know that if this is-- say this
is f of x, that if f of x is

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.590
equal to x squared, that f of 2
is equal to 4, and that would

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.050
have been a no-brainer.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.840
Well, let me maybe give you one
wrinkle on that, and hopefully

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.970
now you'll start to see what
the use of a limit is.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:51.620
Let me to define-- let me say
f of x is equal to x squared

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.390
when, if x does not equal 2,
and let's say it equals

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.270
3 when x equals 2.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.560
Interesting.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.600
So it's a slight variation on
this expression right here.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.490
So this is our new f of x.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.670
So let me ask you a question.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.300
What is-- my pen still works--
what is the limit-- I used

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.180
cursive this time-- what is the
limit as x-- that's an x--

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.580
as x approaches 2 of f of x?

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.210
That's an x.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.120
It says x approaches 2.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.800
It's just like that.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.000
I just-- I don't know.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.460
For some reason, my brain
is working functionally.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.250
OK, so let me graph this now.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.360
So that's an equally
neat-looking graph as

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.100
the one I just drew.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.790
Let me draw.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.100
So now it's almost the same as
this curve, except something

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.330
interesting happens
at x equals 2.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.715
So it's just like this.

00:03:53.715 --> 00:03:58.480
It's like an x squared
curve like that.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.710
But at x equals 2 and
f of x equals 4, we

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.890
draw a little hole.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.050
We draw a hole because it's
not defined at x equals 2.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.320
This is x equals 2.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.960
This is 2.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.680
This is 4.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.690
This is the f of x
axis, of course.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.820
And when x is equal to
2-- let's say this is 3.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.860
When x is equal to 2,
f of x is equal to 3.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.240
This is actually
right below this.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.610
I should-- it doesn't look
completely right below it,

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.730
but I think you got
to get the picture.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.400
See, this graph is x squared.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.983
It's exactly x squared until
we get to x equals 2.

00:04:35.983 --> 00:04:40.030
At x equals 2, We have a
grap-- No, not a grap.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.770
We have a gap in the
graph, which maybe

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.720
could be called a grap.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.540
We have a gap in the graph, and
then we keep-- and then after x

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.350
equals 2, we keep moving on.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.300
And that gap, and that gap
is defined right here, what

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.350
happens when x equals 2?

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.300
Well, then f of x
is equal to 3.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.960
So this graph kind of goes--
it's just like x squared, but

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.470
instead of f of 2 being 4, f
of 2 drops down to 3, but

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.260
then we keep on going.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.400
So going back to the limit
problem, what is the

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.880
limit as x approaches 2?

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.050
Now, well, let's think
about the same thing.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.200
We're going to go-- this
is how I visualize it.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.000
I go along the curve.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.130
Let me pick a different color.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.050
So as x approaches 2 from this
side, from the left-hand side

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:35.200
or from numbers less than 2, f
of x is approaching values

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.520
approaching 4, right? f of x
is approaching 4 as x

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.540
approaches 2, right?

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.200
I think you see that.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.820
If you just follow along the
curve, as you approach f of 2,

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.420
you get closer and closer to 4.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.010
Similarly, as you go from the
right-hand side-- make sure

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.370
my thing's still working.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.780
As you go from the right-hand
side, you go along the

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:05.200
curve, and f of x is also
slowly approaching 4.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.120
So, as you can see, as we
go closer and closer and

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.610
closer to x equals 2, f of
whatever number that is

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.540
approaches 4, right?

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.860
So, in this case, the
limit as x approaches

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.130
2 is also equal to 4.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.120
Well, this is interesting
because, in this case, the

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:35.980
limit as x approaches 2 of f
of x does not equal f of 2.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.170
Now, normally, this
would be on this line.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.300
In this case, the limit as you
approach the expression is

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.030
equal to evaluating the
expression of that value.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.450
In this case, the limit isn't.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.220
I think now you're starting to
see why the limit is a slightly

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.260
different concept than just
evaluating the function at

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.770
that point because you have
functions where, for whatever

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.530
reason at a certain point,
either the function might not

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.640
be defined or the function kind
of jumps up or down, but as you

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.370
approach that point, you still
approach a value different than

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.700
the function at that point.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.110
Now, that's my introduction.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.020
I think this will give you
intuition for what a limit is.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.110
In another presentation, I'll
give you the more formal

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.460
mathematical, you know,
the delta-epsilon

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.890
definition of a limit.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.190
And actually, in the very next
module, I'm now going to

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.210
do a bunch of problems
involving the limit.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.510
I think as you do more and more
problems, you'll get more and

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.380
more of an intuition as
to what a limit is.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.490
And then as we go into drill
derivatives and integrals,

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.350
you'll actually understand why
people probably even invented

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.910
limits to begin with.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.930
We'll see you in the
next presentation.
