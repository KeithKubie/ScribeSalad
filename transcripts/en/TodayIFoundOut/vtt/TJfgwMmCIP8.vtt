00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.029
Hello I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
Today I Found Out YouTube channel, in the

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.560
video today, we're looking at that time a
young Fyodor Dostoevsky was put in front of

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.170
a firing squad and thought he was going to
die.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.630
On December 22, 1849, members of a Russian
intellectual literary group known as the Petrashevsky

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.810
Circle were sent to Semyonov Square to meet
their fate – death by firing squad.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.150
With the men pointing their rifles and fingers
resting on the trigger, a messenger from the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.870
Tsar rode into the square waving a white flag.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.830
Like something out of a Hollywood movie, he
declared he had an official pardon from the

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.980
Tsar of Russia, Nicholas I, in a “show of
mercy.”

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.720
This was not a show of mercy, but rather a
staged way of fostering fear, terror, and

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.720
gratitude.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.760
This was a “mock execution” and among
the victims was the famed Russian author of

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.510
Crime &amp; Punishment, Fyodor Dostoevsky.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.510
So how did he get here?

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.760
Fyodor Dostoevsky was born in November 1821
to a working class Russian family.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.690
His father worked for a hospital catering
to the poor and, while his family was better

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.300
off than most, he saw first-hand the poverty
and disillusionment of Russian society during

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.640
the 19th century.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.500
When he was a child, Fyodor’s father would
be promoted several times at the hospital,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.870
while coming into possession of lands and
serfs.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.500
This exposure to Russia’s system of serfdom
would greatly influence Dostoevsky later in

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.500
life.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.440
By the time he had turned 18, both of his
parents had died; his mother from consumption

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.970
(see our video on Why Tuberculosis was Called
Consumption) and his father under more mysterious

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:28.970
circumstances.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.000
While doctors said he died of a stroke, a
neighbor swore up and down that he was murdered

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.280
by his peasants, tied to a chair and drowned
in vodka.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.670
In 1846, Dostoevsky published his first work
Poor Folk (also called Poor People), a novella

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.240
depicting the lives of poor Russians and their
relationships with the rich.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.970
It was lauded as an achievement by critics,
newspapers, and the general literary community.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.280
Read the Russian political newspaper Northern
Bee,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.659
"News about a new genius, Mr. Dostoevsky,
is circulating across St. Petersburg.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.780
We do not know whether it is his real name
or a pen-name.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.870
The reading audience is praising his new novel,
Poor People."

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.560
Even the great Russian critic Vissarion Belinsky
praised the novel for being socially conscious

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.270
and written with great skill.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.730
Taking Dostoevsky under his wing, he introduced
him to a number of Russian writers, poets,

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.730
and artists.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.440
At least one Dostoevsky biographer believed
that this was not a good thing.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.030
Said Dmitry Grigorovich, “I can say with
confidence that the success of Poor People,

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.980
as well as the admiration of Belinsky, definitely
had a negative influence on Dostoevsky.”

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.730
Grigorovich goes on to describe how Dostoevsky
became arrogant, insufferable, and too confident.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.390
Only 15 days later, another short story of
his, The Double, was published in a journal.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.430
A few weeks later, this became Dostoevsky’s
second novel, a mere five weeks after his

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.430
first one.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.940
This one was not lauded nor loved and his
reputation almost immediately collapsed.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.540
As a recent Guardian article put it, “Not
merely trashed, the book was denounced.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.959
Dostoevsky became a bad joke.”

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.420
Partially due to the negative attention, Dostoevsky
began to suffer from health issues.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.980
He fell into severe financial trouble, as
well.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.760
This forced him to rely upon Belinsky and
his group of socialist friends for help.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.550
On most Saturdays and Sundays, Dostoevsky
could be found at Mikhail Petrashevsky’s

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.349
residence, who was an intellect and an advocate
for utopian socialism.

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.110
They would talk, eat, discuss the trying times,
and denounce serfdom.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.020
This weekend group became known as the Petrashevsky
Circle.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.860
Besides Petrashevsky, Dostoevsky, and Belinsky,
the circle was made up of such individuals

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.290
as the writer Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin,
the poet Aleksey Pleshcheyev, and the painter

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.870
Taras Shevchenko – all well known Russian
creatives who happen to be socialist-leaning.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.430
Besides serfdom, they also discussed socialist
politics, their opposition to the Tsar Nicholas

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.620
I, and read banned literature.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.879
This all came to a halt when, on April 23,
1849, 35 members of the circle were arrested.

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.540
There was also a note sent to police officers
calling for Dostoevsky’s arrest by name.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.540
It read,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.069
" According to the supreme order of the Tsar,
I command you to arrest Junior-Lieutenant

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.280
and literary artist Fyodor Dostoevsky at four
o’clock in the morning… to put a seal

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.090
on all of his papers, manuscripts, and books,
and dispatch instantly all these materials,

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.050
together with Dostoevsky to the Third Section
of the Royal Police of His Majesty… if Dostoevsky

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.519
claims that certain documents belong to other
people, ignore these statements and seal those

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.660
documents as well."

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.709
The group was incarcerated in St. Peter and
Paul Fortress Prison, or simply known as “Fortress

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.460
Prison,” where the worst criminals were
kept.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.449
After months in prison, they were convicted
of distributing letters with “abusive remarks

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.770
about the Orthodox Church and Government”
and conspiring to publish “anti-Government

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.770
propaganda.”

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.779
For this, they were sentenced to death by
firing squad.

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:40.990
On December 22nd, they were marched out blindfolded
to Semyonov Square in Saint Petersburg.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.889
As preparations were made, every person was
prepared to die that day.

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.240
As Dostoevsky would later write to his brother,

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.379
"There the sentence of death was read to all
of us, we were told to kiss the cross, our

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:54.879
swords were broken over our heads, and our
last toilet was made.

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.349
Then three were tied to the pillar for execution.

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:58.779
I was the sixth.

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:02.979
Three at a time were called out; consequently,
I was in the second batch and no more than

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.460
a minute was left me to live."

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.330
In his novel, The Idiot, he also perhaps shed
some light on his thoughts while he had that

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.490
minute left to live:

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.789
"…But better if I tell you of another man
I met last year…this man was led out along

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.670
with others on to a scaffold and had his sentence
of death by shooting read out to him, for

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.900
political offenses…he was dying at 27, healthy
and strong…he says that nothing was more

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.569
terrible at that moment than the nagging thought:
“What if I didn’t have to die!…I would

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:33.560
turn every minute into an age, nothing would
be wasted, every minute would be accounted

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.560
for…"

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.199
As the squad pointed their guns at the three
tied to the posts (as noted, not Dostoevsky,

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:43.059
who was off to the side), the shout went out,
“Prepare to fire!” and, then, another

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:46.979
sound rang out – that of a drummer who had
been commanded to beat the “refuse,” meaning

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.669
stop the previous order.

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.789
The messenger had arrived with Tsar Nicholas’s
I new order.

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.610
“Long Live the Tsar” was yelled, blindfolds
were taken off, and the prisoners, including

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.219
Dostoevsky, had tears in their eyes.

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:01.689
They were saved, but this wasn’t a last
second show of mercy.

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:05.869
This pardon was actually agreed upon the day
before, but with the orders that it was to

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:08.779
be announced only at the last possible second.

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:12.949
Mock executions have been a frequent torture
technique meant to cause trauma, fear, and,

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.529
at times, gratitude to those who “saved”
them.

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:17.690
They have even been used in modern times as
well.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:23.349
A recent ABC report stated that ISIS used
mock executions on American and Japanese hostages.

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:28.649
In 1979, during the Iranian hostage crisis,
those who worked at the American Embassy in

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:30.960
Tehran were subjected to mock executions.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.919
The Chicago Tribune also reported that America’s
CIA may have staged mock executions in hopes

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.270
of getting alleged terrorists to talk in 2004.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.990
Despite this reprieve, the prisoners didn’t
get off scot-free, far from it actually.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.710
Dostoevsky, along with several of his fellow
prisoners, were sent to work camps in Siberia,

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.399
where they spent four years doing hard labor.

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:57.770
When Dostoevsky was released in 1854, he was
still required to serve in the Siberia Regiment

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.309
for a number of years.

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:02.360
But he also went back to writing, most likely
humbled.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.430
In 1854, he published The House of the Dead,
a semi-autobiographical work about life in

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.979
a Siberian prison camp.

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:12.039
He continued to write and gain his literary
creditability back.

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:17.009
In 1864, Crime &amp; Punishment was published,
a novel about a young student plotting to

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:21.169
kill a pawnbroker to take her riches and rid
the world of “worthless vermin.”

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:23.479
This was Dostoevsky’s most famous work.

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:27.210
And, of course, it wouldn’t have been written
and you’d likely never have heard of him

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.830
if the decision to pardon Fyodor Dostoevsky
hadn’t been made.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:43.710
It would seem he really didn’t waste the
rest of his life.
