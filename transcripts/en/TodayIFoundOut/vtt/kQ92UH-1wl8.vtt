00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:13.950
Is a Dogs Mouth Cleaner than a Humans Mouth

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.739
If this were the case, I’m pretty sure a
dog’s mouth would be some sort of medical

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:23.400
miracle, considering: they rarely if ever
have their teeth brushed or mouths cleaned;

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.789
they literally put their mouth on everything;
and they use their tongue as toilet paper

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.880
for not only themselves, but also any other
dogs they encounter.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.760
Mouths are a great environment for bacteria
to thrive; so barring some innate very strong

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.570
anti-bacterial agent in their saliva, this
myth just wasn’t going to be true.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.970
There are also numerous types of diseases
associated with dog bites, including pasteurella,

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.620
tetanus, rabies, klebsiella, proteus, E. coli,
eikenella, etc, which point to the fact that

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.910
a dog’s mouth couldn’t be sterile, as
people often claim.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.880
Don’t just take my word for it though.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.850
According to a study on the relative amount
of microbes in a human’s mouth vs. a dog’s

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.140
mouth, dog’s mouths had significantly more
bacterial colonies than a human’s mouth.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.119
In this study, they measured the number of
bacterial colonies per square centimeter in

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.939
a dog’s mouth vs. a human’s mouth.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.539
The samples were taken after both had eaten
and without the humans being allowed to brush

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.500
their teeth before the sampling.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.810
The results were scaled down to a 1-4 scale
where 1 is the cleanest, with relatively few

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.000
bacterial colonies (“relative” being the
operative word as both human and dog’s mouths

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.819
are teaming with microbes), and 4 being the
grossest, meaning relatively high amounts

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.249
of different bacterial colonies.

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:44.369
According to the study, 10% of the dogs scored
a 1 (relatively clean); 30% scored a 3; and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.369
the remaining 60% scored a 4 (grossest).

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.969
With the humans, 70% scored a 1; 20% scored
a 2; and 10% scored a 3.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:58.109
This small study backs up the intuitive notion
that if you are someone who goes around eating

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:03.500
garbage, poop, and pretty much putting anything
and everything you find in your mouth, all

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.140
the while typically never having your mouth
cleaned in any way, then your mouth is going

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.890
to have quite a lot more types of bacteria
in it than someone who brushes their teeth

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.610
regularly and doesn’t go around eating poop
and other such microbial gold mines.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.470
So where did this myth come from?

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.870
It’s likely that it started from people
observing that dogs clean their wounds with

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.010
their mouths and it is scientifically proven
to have less chance of getting infected than

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.730
if they didn’t lick it.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.170
The problem with this is that any wound that
is cleaned regularly, by licking or simply

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.830
running water over it frequently, will give
you much less chance of infection than otherwise.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.680
There is no strong anti-bacterial agent working
here, it is simply a case of cleaning off

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.680
dead tissue and the like.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.680
Another theory of this myth’s origin is
the medical myth that if you are bitten by

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.680
a human, you’ll have a much greater chance
of having that bite become infected than if

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.680
you are bitten by a dog.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.680
This “fact” has been spread around in
antiquated medical journals for ages, but

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.680
has recently been shown to be incorrect.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.680
As stated in the 1988 Annals of Emergency
Medicine:

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.680
Recent study of human bites has shown that
the early literature depicting all human bites

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.850
as having an extraordinarily high infection
and complication rate was biased by its emphasis

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.070
on human bites of the hand that presented
late with infection already present.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.750
These bites, the so-called closed-fist injuries
(CFI), do indeed have a poor prognosis, but

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.370
it may be as much due to their location and
initial neglect as to the source of the injury.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.770
Human bites elsewhere do not seem to have
any higher risk than animal bites, which have

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.490
an infection rate of about 10%.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.730
A more recent 1995 study done by the Journal
of the American Academy of Dermatology, observed

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.730
the same thing:

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.350
Human bite wounds have long had a bad reputation
for severe infection and frequent complication.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.400
However, recent data demonstrate that human
bites occurring anywhere other than the hand

00:03:39.400 --> 00:04:02.660
present no more of a risk for infection than
any other type of mammalian bite.
