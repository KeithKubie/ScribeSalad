00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.610
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.210
<v 1>do you want to meet today is an evolutionary psychologist and author and</v>

3
00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:12.640
associate professor at the University of New Mexico.
Jeffrey Miller.

4
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.550
Welcome to the Rubin report to Dave.
Great to be here.
Good to be with you.

5
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:18.200
My friend.
You know,

6
00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:21.980
I realized I've had evolutionary biologists on the show.

7
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:26.600
I've had Bret Weinstein and Richard Dawkins.
I've had psychologists on the show,

8
00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:27.530
Jordan Peterson.

9
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.730
<v 0>I've never had an evolutionary psychologist.</v>

10
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.760
Never know for many of us how many of how many are there were almost extinct.

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.540
Um,

12
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.010
the big international conference we get maybe 300 people versus like a big

13
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:45.700
neuroscience conference will be 30,000.
That's gotta be a tough crowd.

14
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.950
It's a tough crowd.
Um,
we get a lot of flack from all directions,

15
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.480
but I would,
I wouldn't want to do anything else.
It's an that's an awesome field.

16
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.250
And um,

17
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.390
I can't imagine anything more fun than studying human nature for a living.

18
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.880
<v 1>Yeah.
And you're studying and I've written about so many incredible topics.</v>

19
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:06.290
I normally,
I always am PR.

20
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.410
I pride myself on the fact that I usually don't have to look at my notes when

21
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:10.131
interviewing somebody.

22
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:13.670
But you've hit so many things that every now and again I am going to be glancing

23
00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:14.990
down cause I don't want to miss anything here.

24
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.890
But usually the way I like to start these is just finding out a little bit of

25
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:19.701
someone's history,

26
00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:23.720
what sort of brought them to the place of expertise that gets them in that
chair.

27
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:27.650
So just tell me a little bit about,
uh,
you know,
growing up education,

28
00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:29.750
that sort of thing.
What made you interested in all this?

29
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.170
<v 0>Oh,
I was born and raised in Cincinnati,
Ohio.</v>

30
00:01:32.171 --> 00:01:34.330
Went to Undergrad at Columbia University.

31
00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:39.040
I studied psychology and biology and just anything that grabbed my interest.

32
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.570
So I kind of started out in neuroscience and I thought the brain's fascinating.

33
00:01:43.571 --> 00:01:46.030
And then I kind of drifted into cognitive psychology,

34
00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:50.680
which is studying human learning and memory and perception and how we categorize

35
00:01:50.681 --> 00:01:54.760
stuff.
And then I got really bored with that,
but I thought,

36
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.350
I dunno,
I'll go,
I'll go ph,
do a phd in that.
Anyway,

37
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.980
so I went to Stanford,
started doing cognitive psychology,

38
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.850
but when I was there,
I met these two brilliant,
um,

39
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.380
postdocs who were working with my advisor lead a cosmetic cosmetics and John

40
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:16.090
[inaudible] who had just come from Harvard and they basically invented the field

41
00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:20.380
of evolutionary psychology right there at Stanford in front of my nose.
Hmm.

42
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.400
From the ground up.
And they were like,
we're going to take evolutionary biology,

43
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.060
anthropology,
cognitive psychology,

44
00:02:28.061 --> 00:02:32.620
merge them all together and make this new science of human nature.

45
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.970
So let's slow down for a second.
What does that say that this is look like?

46
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.880
What does that even mean when they're talking about this?

47
00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:44.080
How do you take these things that are thought of as their own institutions and

48
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.580
you know,
put them into one box?
It's basically like the,

49
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.070
the key insight is if you want to understand human nature,

50
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.130
whether it's anything human sexuality or emotions or how we relate to other

51
00:02:56.171 --> 00:03:00.610
people or other groups,
you can always ask the,
where did we come from,

52
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.770
what challenges that our ancestors face in terms of surviving and reproducing

53
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:10.750
and raising kids?
And what exact structure did those challenges have?

54
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:15.370
Like what was ancestral life like?
We don't know every,
every detail,

55
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:19.510
but we do know a lot from anthropologists who had studied hunter gatherers.

56
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.260
We know a lot from primatologists who have studied,
um,

57
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.070
chimps and Bonobos and gorillas and orangutans.

58
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.640
And you can kind of triangulate on a picture of prehistoric life and figure out,

59
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.250
yeah.
Like why do we fear certain things,

60
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:38.740
snakes and spiders and bears and whatever.
Well,

61
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:41.260
it's because there were certain selection pressures.

62
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.420
Like if you don't fear those things,
you die.

63
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.160
Why do we look for certain things in mates when we're choosing sexual partners?

64
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.810
Well,
if you don't look for those things,

65
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:54.510
then you have bad relationships and bad kids,
etc. So it's a,

66
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.110
a way of looking at the past to inform our understanding of the present.

67
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.220
Um,
and that's not what most of psychology does.

68
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:07.210
So it's quite a novel kind of approach.
But I think we've got,

69
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.030
we've gotten enormous leverage out of it.

70
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.560
<v 1>Was there pushback from people within each discipline going,
Whoa,</v>

71
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.140
we've got all the answers right here.

72
00:04:16.141 --> 00:04:18.120
Why do we want to put these things together?

73
00:04:18.121 --> 00:04:22.200
Cause I would imagine there's always a certain inherent competition amongst all

74
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:23.220
of these different disciplines.

75
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.200
<v 0>Yeah.
The evolution biologists kind of hate it.</v>

76
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.491
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

77
00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:29.700
because that was going to be my next question since I know there's a couple of

78
00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:30.540
those guys,
they're

79
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.960
<v 0>happy to go,
here's how other animals evolve.
They're happy to go,</v>

80
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:38.950
here's how the human body evolved.
Here's how the human immune system involved.

81
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.940
But once you got above the neck,
then they're like,

82
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.620
you're just going to make trouble for us in biology because that's where things

83
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:52.621
got politically controversial is when you start explaining human behavior or

84
00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:57.460
individual differences are sex differences or human emotions with stuff like

85
00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:59.950
that.
So the biologists don't like it.

86
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.560
The anthropologists had a lot of the same issues.

87
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.160
Like we've spent the last century trying to get anthropology kind of away from

88
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:10.510
biology in a way.

89
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.160
So please don't drag us kicking and screaming back into that,

90
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.450
that swamp of controversy.
Um,

91
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.720
but we just kind of plowed ahead.
And,
um,

92
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.270
and I think it's been a big success story in the sciences in the last 30 years.

93
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.250
So what were the things that were intriguing to you that had sort of board you

94
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.733
for that?

95
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.750
I think that the fact that sexuality is central to evolutionary biology and

96
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:46.540
evolutionary psychology,
you know,
it's how,

97
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.280
how we get our genes and the next generation is choosing mates and having babies

98
00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:55.840
and raising,
raising kids.
And if you ignore that you ignore,

99
00:05:55.841 --> 00:06:00.680
I think one of the core driving forces in human nature and human culture.

100
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.511
Now,

101
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:07.511
most of psychology kind of ignores a mate choice and sexuality and reproduction,

102
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.943
um,

103
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.840
except insofar as it's kind of like seen as politically relevant.

104
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.610
So like you'll get a little bit on while their sexual discrimination against

105
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:20.990
certain kind of groups,

106
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:24.740
which is important to address like gay and lesbian rights and,

107
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.930
and so forth.
Um,

108
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.320
but they don't really see it as central to who we are into what motivates us.

109
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.150
<v 1>So do you see it as,
as the real pillar of what's motivating us?</v>

110
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.620
Like if we were sort of looking at this in concentric circles,
I think

111
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.840
<v 0>it depends on where you're at in life.
I think for young single people,</v>

112
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.680
what we call mating effort,
like the attempt to attract other people,

113
00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:54.640
whatever your sexual orientation,
that drives an awful lot of behavior,

114
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.660
how you dress,
what I ideas you adopt,
um,

115
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.080
why you bother to learn things,
why you bother to get credentials.

116
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.630
I think a lot of that is driven by meeting effort,

117
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.760
but then if you settle down and you're in a long term monogamous relationship,

118
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.770
you don't kind of need to do that stuff.

119
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.700
<v 1>But that's exactly when people get lazy.</v>

120
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.670
<v 0>That's where people let themselves go.
Right?
Um,</v>

121
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.910
they don't say in shape,
they dress more sloppily.

122
00:07:21.911 --> 00:07:26.900
They kind of don't bother reading like serious nonfiction anymore.
Um,

123
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:28.361
why?

124
00:07:28.361 --> 00:07:33.361
Because a lot of that sort of creative display has already accomplished.

125
00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:34.930
It's its purpose.

126
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.580
<v 1>So in that way,
that's not in real conflict with evolutionary biology,
right?</v>

127
00:07:40.581 --> 00:07:43.240
Because you want to look your best to get the best mate and all that.

128
00:07:43.241 --> 00:07:46.040
So in that way,
you guys are on the same practice.
So where does that,

129
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.270
where does that DV,

130
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.563
<v 0>well,</v>

131
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.400
so when biologists talk about courtship displays and here's the bower bird

132
00:07:53.401 --> 00:07:57.780
building its power and we talk about like ideological displays and here's people

133
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.020
showing off their virtues through virtue signaling,

134
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.000
the biologists know exactly what we're talking about and we know exactly what

135
00:08:06.001 --> 00:08:06.721
they're talking about.

136
00:08:06.721 --> 00:08:11.721
It's just often they don't want to get into trouble that that follows if they

137
00:08:12.331 --> 00:08:14.070
kind of make these analogies.
GS

138
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.060
<v 1>Two clearly.
Have you had any of these conversations with Bret Weinstein?</v>

139
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.380
Not Directly.
No.
I think I'm going to have to facilitate that one probably.

140
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.240
That'd be a lot of fun.
Yeah.
Yeah,
we'll do that for sure.
So it's interesting.

141
00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:27.751
Okay,
so let's,

142
00:08:27.751 --> 00:08:31.800
let's focus on the sexuality parties for a little bit because it seems like so

143
00:08:31.801 --> 00:08:36.801
many things that we used to be able to talk about we suddenly can't talk about

144
00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:42.150
or that academics are self selecting out of and things of that nature.
Now,

145
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.500
I said to you right before we started,

146
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.900
you're one of the few people I see on Twitter and I'm like,

147
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.200
oh he kind of gets what Twitter is cause you put out some smart stuff.

148
00:08:49.201 --> 00:08:51.540
You're kind of funny on there at the right time,

149
00:08:51.541 --> 00:08:55.470
you know when to go with snark and all of those things and that to seems the

150
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:56.100
only way

151
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.820
<v 0>that you would be able to have any of these conversations online.</v>

152
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.110
I think social media is actually really good for addressing some of these very

153
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:08.310
tricky issues like human sexuality and how it's playing out in the modern world

154
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.550
as long as you do it with humor and self deprecation and a little bit of

155
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:18.450
absurdity,
which is what I try to do in my Twitter game,
right?

156
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.820
Because if you approach it like well here's the next paper on like sex

157
00:09:23.821 --> 00:09:27.870
differences or the next paper on how courtship works or oh awesome.

158
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:29.400
A new virtue signaling paper.

159
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.980
People will quickly tune out on the last off often think,
well,

160
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:37.500
you're just kind of being doctrinaire here.

161
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.300
But the thing you quickly realize if you study evolution at all,

162
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:47.301
his evolution is a very weird process that often produces completely absurd

163
00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:51.720
results,
right?
You Watch any David Attenborough natural history,

164
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.430
you know,
documentary and it's like these animals are insane.

165
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.340
What they're doing is crazy and humans are no different.

166
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.670
And if you don't have a sense of that absurdity,

167
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.280
then it's very easy to get terribly,

168
00:10:05.281 --> 00:10:10.281
terribly serious and censorious and ideological and that really kept the highs.

169
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:15.840
A lot doesn't,
it's going on.
That doesn't really help anybody.
All right,
so let's,

170
00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:18.240
let's pause on sexuality for a second.

171
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:21.210
I don't want to get off that topic so to speak,
but um,

172
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.040
let's just do the two minute,
uh,
Twitter portion of the show,
which is,

173
00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:30.090
is there a evolutionary explanation to the way we're behaving with each other?

174
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:38.810
Is there a psychological explanation to the way we act one way on this medium

175
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.670
and another way on another medium and,

176
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:45.400
and how that has evolved because of communication?

177
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.690
It's a great question.
And I think honestly,

178
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.720
social media blindsided everybody.

179
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:56.710
I don't know anybody in the 90s in psychology or any behavioral science who's

180
00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.180
going,
here's what the Internet is going to turn into,
right?

181
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:05.180
It'll become this massive global system of very rapid fire,

182
00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:11.510
interactive,
snarky virtue signaling that drives everyone nuts.

183
00:11:11.511 --> 00:11:14.900
And yet we can't give it up.
Yeah,
I know Villain k Dick probably wouldn't,

184
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.900
but maybe nobody else.
Yeah.
Okay.
Dick,
maybe William Gibson,

185
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.140
a few other folks kind of add the insight.

186
00:11:22.141 --> 00:11:24.150
But honestly,

187
00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:27.690
nobody was derived and kind of from first principles.
Well,

188
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:32.691
we are a social primate and we love to gossip and we love to show off our,

189
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.680
you know,
our,
our virtues and our intelligence to each other.
And therefore,

190
00:11:37.681 --> 00:11:41.880
obviously there'll be this thing called Facebook and Twitter and whatever,

191
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.493
and it will

192
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.120
play out in this way and moreover it will revolutionize politics or culture in

193
00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:53.860
some way.
No,
nobody thought that.

194
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.530
So we can come up with post-talk reasons why that might've played out that way.

195
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.940
Um,
but I went on,

196
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.830
only do that with a very high degree of humility.
Like,

197
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:12.160
I don't know,
I don't,
now that we're here,

198
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:17.250
you can kind of a little bit make sense of it that well.

199
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:22.090
So almost like you can see the evolution,
Twitter,
you know what I mean?

200
00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:25.600
Where you now see people,
I'd like to include myself in that,

201
00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:27.850
where they're trying to clean it up a little bit.

202
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.440
It's like we all did this unknown thing of snark and everyone was trying to

203
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:36.490
destroy each other and one up each other in virtue signal about the things we

204
00:12:36.491 --> 00:12:37.450
care about and all that.

205
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.750
And it's like now I'm seeing a growing group of people that are like,
Whoa,

206
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:45.751
how do we deal with reality in the confines of social media?

207
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.370
But when the cerulean honestly and without just wrecking everything and that

208
00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:56.371
almost strikes me as a evolutionary function and its evolution is happening so

209
00:12:56.621 --> 00:13:00.910
fast and on such a huge scale.
I mean who could have predicted that?

210
00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:05.911
Like the more amateurish looking a visual meme is,

211
00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:11.290
the better it would spread.
That's completely bizarre.
Um,

212
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.420
or the fact that I can get more engagement if I do a really surreal poll on

213
00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:20.650
Twitter about something where all four categories are just completely insane.

214
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.230
Like people are more into that.
Right.

215
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:28.830
Then they are like even my snarky comment about political issue x or y.

216
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.310
So what does that tell you about the psychological state of how we interact with

217
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:35.500
these things?
Like the main ones really interesting.

218
00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:39.100
It's not the sleigh he produced thing,
you know,

219
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:42.970
really sharp looking images that go viral.
It's,
you know,

220
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.340
a frog on up black and white idiotic thing or crudely drawn yes.

221
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.730
Or that tree or whatever.

222
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:53.940
Like there's something really there today about how we react to images to this.

223
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.930
Also something kind of charming about the artlessness and amateurish quality.

224
00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:03.930
It's almost like I'm kind of fascinated by stand up comedy on the standup

225
00:14:04.031 --> 00:14:08.740
Comedians who are overly slick or never that funny.

226
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:13.120
And the ones who are a little bit shambolic like Steven right back in the 80s,

227
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.030
hilarious.
And he looks,

228
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:21.340
he looks like he's always on the edge of complete failure or a psychotic break.

229
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:26.500
And yet that's what makes it work.
Or I guess Seinfeld,
you know,

230
00:14:26.501 --> 00:14:31.100
in the 90s,
um,
to show it was also kind of has this artless quality.

231
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.070
Yeah.
Alright,
so let's jump back.

232
00:14:33.071 --> 00:14:37.960
So that Saturday now it's getting harder and harder to talk about these things.

233
00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:40.600
There's a set of people that think we're all exactly the same and then at the

234
00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:42.730
same time they're obsessed with all of our differences.

235
00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:47.320
I mean this is what seemingly is the most potent idea of the day right now.

236
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:52.250
Um,
what are,
what are the things that you're thinking about in realm of sexuality

237
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.570
<v 1>right now that are intrigued?</v>

238
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:55.573
<v 0>I'm thinking,</v>

239
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.870
I'm especially concerned about the fact that nobody seems to know what a

240
00:14:59.871 --> 00:15:04.670
successful long term relationship is seriously gonna look like in the early to

241
00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:09.671
mid 21st century that we don't really have a script for that we've kind of

242
00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:15.200
inherited,
you know,
the script of monogamous lifelong marriage,

243
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:20.240
but nobody really believes that that is going to kind of solve all of our

244
00:15:20.241 --> 00:15:24.680
problems and people don't enter enter into that very early in life.

245
00:15:24.681 --> 00:15:27.470
They spend their teens and twenties doing casual dating.

246
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.350
What is that like?

247
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:35.060
Nobody quite understands what the rules are,
the ethics of that are,

248
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.570
and that at a certain point you kind of get tired of that and you find a partner

249
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:40.100
and you kind of settled down and go,
okay,

250
00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:43.190
we're going to buy into the wedding industry now and do the wedding thing and

251
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.790
the ring and bottle.

252
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:50.590
But they're all these subcultures in America and around the world that are

253
00:15:50.901 --> 00:15:55.790
exploring all different aspect sexuality and kind of how to incorporate new

254
00:15:55.791 --> 00:16:00.180
insights into relationships.
Things like,
um,

255
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:05.260
BDSM or kink or polyamory and open relationships or the whole red pill

256
00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.320
manosphere subculture.
Um,

257
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:13.760
and then on the other side of the plug that have to do with sexuality,
well,

258
00:16:13.761 --> 00:16:18.680
it's a certain way of,
of men and women interacting,
right?

259
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.690
This sort of red pill vision of Male,

260
00:16:20.691 --> 00:16:24.980
female dynamics is that there's a really deep sexual polarity,

261
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:30.380
masculine and feminine.
And if you don't understand that polarity,

262
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.170
your relationships,
if they're heterosexual,

263
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.200
are going to fail and burnout and not be satisfying to either person.

264
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.920
So there's much subcultures.
They're all,
uh,

265
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:46.640
exploring different parts of human nature,
human sexuality,

266
00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:49.730
different possible ways to run a relationship.

267
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.750
And I think they all have valuable lessons that we can kind of learn and

268
00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:54.584
incorporate.

269
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.920
Like even if your vanilla and monogamous and straight and you,

270
00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.830
you don't believe all the,
the crazy manosphere stuff,

271
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.230
there's still important lessons there.

272
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.140
And that's kind of my interest now is sort of going around and,

273
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:15.250
and being eclectic and gathering those up and figuring out what,

274
00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:19.220
which of those might be useful.
Do people

275
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:25.180
<v 1>stay in those scenes for,
for a lifetime.
So I,</v>

276
00:17:25.181 --> 00:17:27.160
you know,
I could see where s where somebody,

277
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.700
you'd be an a whatever your thing is and I'm not passing judgment on Ebay.

278
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:31.541
Whatever your thing is,

279
00:17:31.541 --> 00:17:35.770
you do it for awhile and then eventually I guess it sort of is the,

280
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.010
you sort of get tired of it so you move on to something more traditional.

281
00:17:39.011 --> 00:17:43.510
Like is that just part of our psychology?
Like nothing kind of lasts forever.

282
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.780
<v 0>Some people do that.
Certainly there's a,</v>

283
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.900
there's a life profile kind of openness and experimentation where you try a

284
00:17:51.901 --> 00:17:56.901
bunch of stuff in your teens and 20s on a lot of it deviates markedly from the

285
00:17:57.001 --> 00:17:58.580
traditional culture you,

286
00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:02.750
you grow up in and a lot of that um,

287
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.630
hurts and it doesn't work and it's heartbreaking.

288
00:18:06.631 --> 00:18:09.750
And then a lot of people kind of drift back into the mainstream.

289
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.720
On the other hand,
you got people who marry young and they try the,

290
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.960
the standard vanilla monogamy thing into their thirties,
forties,

291
00:18:18.961 --> 00:18:23.670
50s and then go,
this is not working.
I need something different,

292
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:28.260
better,
more open,
whatever.
And I think,

293
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.070
um,
it can go either way.
You know,

294
00:18:32.071 --> 00:18:36.240
the psychological research on all these subcultures is lacking.

295
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.380
We don't know even which lasts longer.

296
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:45.690
A monogamous relationship or an open relationship.
Everybody,
we don't know.

297
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.830
There's not good data on that.
Huh?
There's lots of anecdotes.

298
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.550
There's examples on both sides,
but I think it's

299
00:18:55.350 --> 00:19:00.350
almost scientific misconduct not to ask those questions and instead to ask like,

300
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:05.850
let's do,
you know,
study on which alcoholism treatment works.

301
00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:10.851
Let's do the 5000th study on that before we do the first study on what kind of

302
00:19:12.031 --> 00:19:14.460
relationships last longest.

303
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.710
<v 1>So basically because you think if we could address some of those issues first,</v>

304
00:19:17.711 --> 00:19:21.030
perhaps the studies that we're focusing on unrelated out there as well as him

305
00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:21.864
and the rest.
Yeah,

306
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.050
<v 0>relationship satisfaction is really,
really important to people.
Um,</v>

307
00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.210
but it's one of the things that's,

308
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.480
it's not entirely taboo to study it,

309
00:19:31.481 --> 00:19:35.350
but it's pretty hard to get federal research funding to look at something that's

310
00:19:35.351 --> 00:19:38.920
kind of a cornerstone of American wellbeing.

311
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:43.470
<v 1>So when that New York Times article came out about Jordan Peterson and they said</v>

312
00:19:43.471 --> 00:19:48.060
he was four in forced monogamy,
which in effect just means marriage.

313
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:51.180
And have you used a couple of times in the times before?
Just to me marriage.

314
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:55.050
But everyone thought that man,
he wanted me in chains to be,
you know,

315
00:19:55.051 --> 00:19:57.240
dragged around by their husbands.
The,

316
00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.840
the argument that people that are for enforcement,
I,

317
00:20:00.841 --> 00:20:04.500
we are married basically make is that this is the best way to build a sort of

318
00:20:04.501 --> 00:20:07.860
functioning healthy society and that you can reproduce and have other

319
00:20:07.861 --> 00:20:09.360
generations.
And all of those things.

320
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:14.100
You just think we don't have enough information basically or enough.
Um,
right.

321
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.540
Well enough study on the information to know if that really is the best way to

322
00:20:18.541 --> 00:20:19.310
build a

323
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.440
<v 0>humane society.
Right.
We don't know if there's,</v>

324
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.740
there's good reasons to think that um,

325
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.910
monogamous marriage has been important in every major civilization.

326
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.590
Like it's kind of the most common way to arrange pair bonding.

327
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.473
Um,

328
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:40.750
and I'm sure Jordan Peterson has read the same articles I've assigned even in my

329
00:20:41.511 --> 00:20:42.740
polyamory class.

330
00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.380
That's about here are the benefits of monogamous marriage and there are many of

331
00:20:47.381 --> 00:20:48.214
it.

332
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:52.630
The question is once you have contraception,

333
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:58.090
once you have safer sex and STI testing,
once you have paternity testing,

334
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.800
once you have a lot of other technologies,
right,

335
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.980
the can solve some of the same issues that monogamy used to solve,

336
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.550
then what is monogamy still optimal?

337
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.990
Probably is for a lot of people probably is for lot.

338
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.400
<v 1>How much of it do you think just comes down to how you're wired?</v>

339
00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:20.910
<v 0>I think there's a lot of that.
Some people are just wired to go,
man,</v>

340
00:21:20.911 --> 00:21:21.990
I just want a pair bond.

341
00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:27.050
I want my mate and I want to keep it simple and that's good enough for me and I

342
00:21:28.411 --> 00:21:33.411
will get a lot of companion at love and attachment and it'll last a long time.

343
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.350
A lot of people are very happy with that and that's great.

344
00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:42.890
But a lot of people either want more sexual novelty and variety or they have a

345
00:21:43.051 --> 00:21:47.250
higher tolerance for sexual jealousy,
um,

346
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.320
or they just kind of get bored and longterm relationships.

347
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:58.190
And I think those people should not be prescribing like rampant polyamory for

348
00:21:59.821 --> 00:22:00.750
the monogamists,

349
00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:05.130
but the monogamous shouldn't necessarily be prescribing like our way is the only

350
00:22:05.131 --> 00:22:06.210
way for everybody else.

351
00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:11.000
<v 1>So I wonder how this is all related to the gay community because I don't know,</v>

352
00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:15.020
dare I mentioned the name Milo,
but when I had my low on my show years ago,

353
00:22:15.021 --> 00:22:19.020
really before he was in Milan,
so to speak,
um,
we got it.

354
00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.150
We had about a half hour chat on this where me as the married gay liberal and

355
00:22:23.151 --> 00:22:27.380
him as the unmarried gay conservative,
which is already sort of a flip on things.

356
00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:32.650
His argument was that he wasn't really for gay marriage because he felt that by

357
00:22:32.901 --> 00:22:34.060
being the outsider,

358
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:39.070
the gays have come up with art and creativity and music and comedy and all of

359
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:45.710
that incredible,
like just gestalt of it all that made this incredible community,

360
00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.260
like a diverse community in the right sense of diversity.
Yeah.

361
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:49.460
And my argument was,
well,

362
00:22:49.461 --> 00:22:54.140
you've got to at least give people the opportunity to be equal under the law so

363
00:22:54.141 --> 00:22:55.460
that they at least have a choice.

364
00:22:55.461 --> 00:22:58.490
I'm not denying that the gay community has come up with all sorts of incredible

365
00:22:58.491 --> 00:22:59.300
stuff.
Yeah.

366
00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.870
But like you gotta make them equal and then let them go either way on that.
Okay.

367
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.810
Yeah.
Do you think there is legitimacy to that and do you,

368
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:09.980
have you done or have you seen any studies on what the effects of the,

369
00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.380
of marriage on the gay community have been?

370
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.910
<v 0>I haven't seen a whole lot,
but I guess Molly too soon.
I mean,
my understanding,</v>

371
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.640
some of this comes from Dan Dan's habits,
right?

372
00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:26.350
Is that a lot of gay couples have a kind of monogamish relationship where it's

373
00:23:26.351 --> 00:23:28.660
like,
we are pair bonded,
we love each other,

374
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:33.930
but there's also a negotiated agreement that we can have outside lovers once in

375
00:23:34.181 --> 00:23:39.140
a while under certain conditions that we kind of mutually agree to see.

376
00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:39.860
It's funny,
I hear

377
00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.800
<v 1>that all the time and I don't know,
advocate couples that I know that are,</v>

378
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:46.460
that are married or,
you know,
really yeah.
Together.

379
00:23:46.461 --> 00:23:49.820
I don't know ones that are like that or at least that I know that they are like

380
00:23:49.821 --> 00:23:52.810
that.
Let's put it that way.
Okay.
But I know that this is,
uh,

381
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.880
something that's tossed out there so we can go with this for

382
00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.413
<v 0>so,</v>

383
00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:02.100
but I'm sure there's variety and I'm sure that there's also kind of social

384
00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:06.900
assortment.
All right.
So that the more monogamous gay,

385
00:24:06.901 --> 00:24:11.400
lesbian couples will kind of be more comfortable with each other and they might

386
00:24:11.401 --> 00:24:15.720
know those crazy monogamish folks down the road,
but,

387
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:17.323
um,

388
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.960
<v 1>or you just don't know your friends that well.
I mean,</v>

389
00:24:18.961 --> 00:24:20.820
I guess anything's possible.
Yeah.

390
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:24.770
<v 0>Yeah.
And honestly,
it's not that different from like the way,
um,</v>

391
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:30.350
even heterosexual relationships work in a lot of Europe where a lot of those are

392
00:24:30.351 --> 00:24:35.351
tacitly monogamish and there's a sort of understanding that um,

393
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:41.060
monogamy doesn't necessarily mean sexual exclusivity for either partner.

394
00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:42.110
Um,

395
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:47.110
America is extremely puritanical and kind of rigid about that and we think,

396
00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:48.883
um,

397
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:54.550
anything that happens outside the pair bond is almost by definition unethical.

398
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.920
Um,

399
00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:02.920
and there is research on sort of anti polyamory stigma where people actually are

400
00:25:05.511 --> 00:25:09.470
more prejudiced against people in open relationships then they are against

401
00:25:09.471 --> 00:25:11.990
almost any other group.
Um,

402
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.190
in terms of orientation or race or religion or,
or anything.
Um,

403
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.640
that might be gradually changing,
but I think it's a,

404
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.610
it's a huge social problem,

405
00:25:22.611 --> 00:25:25.460
especially among Gen z and younger millennials.

406
00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:30.000
<v 1>Yeah.
Where does the trans part of this all fit in?</v>

407
00:25:30.001 --> 00:25:33.300
Because I remember years ago when people would say,
when I,

408
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.830
when everyone started saying the LGBT community,
I remember thinking,

409
00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:42.480
I have no more insight into the t part of this,

410
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.410
then a straight cisgendered heterosexual male.
Would,
you know what I mean?
I,

411
00:25:47.411 --> 00:25:50.430
I just,
I don't,
I may be,

412
00:25:50.431 --> 00:25:55.431
I have somehow slightly a little more inherent empathy by being an outsider at

413
00:25:57.361 --> 00:25:59.640
some level,
but I don't have any more knowledge of it.

414
00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:04.470
And now it seems like the Trans issue has almost superseded all of the other

415
00:26:04.471 --> 00:26:07.270
issues at least in the last year.
I mean everywhere.
Yeah.

416
00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.990
Everywhere you go there's,
you know,
every time I opened the Twitter search bar,

417
00:26:09.991 --> 00:26:14.510
it's another trans story or someone's being fired for this joke or that or the

418
00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.250
other.

419
00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:18.990
What do you think happened there that catapulted this so quickly and what are

420
00:26:18.991 --> 00:26:21.540
the issues around it that were kind of afraid to talk about right now?

421
00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.770
It's a really complicated fraught topic I think trying to get you,

422
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:27.210
I think it's like,

423
00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.140
<v 0>I'm an issue about trans is there are people who um,</v>

424
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.020
are trans or field trends and they want their rights respected and that's

425
00:26:37.021 --> 00:26:39.300
totally legitimate and good for them.

426
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.120
And raising awareness about that is fine.

427
00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:47.690
There's a larger group of people who I think are using trans issues as a kind of

428
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:53.571
wedge to destroy the gender binary or to kind of muddy the waters or basically

429
00:26:56.431 --> 00:27:01.380
as a weapon to beat up evolutionary psychology or evolutionary biology to say

430
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.400
there's no such thing as sex.
Really.

431
00:27:05.401 --> 00:27:09.270
There's no such thing as biological sex or sex is totally dissociated from

432
00:27:09.271 --> 00:27:10.080
gender,
et Cetera.

433
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.480
When someone says that the next time someone says that on Twitter,

434
00:27:12.481 --> 00:27:15.450
what's the answer that the person watching this should give?

435
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:18.750
That maybe Twitter is not the best one report,

436
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:24.050
I mean male and female or evolved strategies that exist because over thousands

437
00:27:27.421 --> 00:27:32.421
of generations they were like the paths to successful reproduction.

438
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:34.290
Um,

439
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:39.290
if you're not clearly male and functioning as a male or you're not clearly

440
00:27:39.451 --> 00:27:43.440
female and functioning as a female,
you're your genetic dead end.

441
00:27:43.441 --> 00:27:48.441
So selection hammers against any ambiguity there.

442
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.800
So it's not surprising that the vast majority of humans alive today clearly

443
00:27:55.141 --> 00:27:58.170
identify as one sex or the other.
Um,

444
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.570
that doesn't mean everyone should,

445
00:28:00.571 --> 00:28:03.150
it doesn't have any kind of moral implications about that.

446
00:28:03.151 --> 00:28:07.990
But just descriptively,
it means there is a gender binary ended,

447
00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:13.010
evolved for good reasons and everyone teaches biology hopefully knows this and

448
00:28:15.511 --> 00:28:19.440
it shouldn't be that controversial right now.

449
00:28:19.441 --> 00:28:23.580
If we want to like genetically engineer people and use CRISPR and whatever to

450
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:28.470
destroy the gender binary for the 22nd and 23rd centuries,

451
00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:32.520
we could do that.
We could talk about that.
Um,

452
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.650
I don't have any particular attachment to the kind of male,

453
00:28:37.651 --> 00:28:41.130
female dichotomy ethically.
Um,

454
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:46.190
but I think descriptively it's really important to kind of accept it and to go,

455
00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.030
if it's here,

456
00:28:48.031 --> 00:28:53.031
it's valuable to understand and we shouldn't necessarily try to pretend it out

457
00:28:54.241 --> 00:28:56.080
of existence,
um,

458
00:28:56.310 --> 00:29:00.840
or pretend that we're doing it in the name of Trans Rights.
Right?

459
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:05.930
You can have trans rights without saying there's no such thing as sex.

460
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.460
So this gets to the heart of what I think is really happening in this country

461
00:29:11.461 --> 00:29:11.791
right now,

462
00:29:11.791 --> 00:29:16.791
which is everything has become politicized to the point that the experts in the

463
00:29:17.011 --> 00:29:22.011
field seem afraid to talk to you right now are taking a risk by talking about

464
00:29:24.241 --> 00:29:28.580
these issues.
Yeah.
Are you seeing this across the board?
You,

465
00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:32.730
are you seeing this amongst colleagues of fear to talk about these things?
Yeah,

466
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:33.863
absolutely.

467
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:39.120
Now the vast majority of people like at my university don't really touch upon

468
00:29:39.121 --> 00:29:42.280
anything that's particularly politicized,
right?

469
00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:46.370
They're just teaching civil engineering or law or,
um,

470
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.040
immunology or whatever.

471
00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:51.490
And most of that isn't really politicized yet,

472
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:56.260
however yet is the key word that,
right,
right.
Okay.
I mean,

473
00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:59.770
you get a little bit bit about what's the gender representation in certain

474
00:29:59.771 --> 00:30:03.970
fields,
but
in my department,
in psychology,

475
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.870
you do get almost everything having a kind of political edge.

476
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.280
And I have colleagues who are frightened to teach certain classes.

477
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:17.940
Like I teach psychology of human sexuality and I'm pretty upfront and outspoken

478
00:30:18.431 --> 00:30:21.040
about what I cover and what my view is.

479
00:30:21.041 --> 00:30:26.041
But a lot of my colleagues will not touch it with a barge pole because there's

480
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:31.530
so much risk that students will just get upset about one little thing you say.

481
00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:36.220
Yeah.
And complained to a dean and then you'll get called into the office.

482
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:37.660
And,
um,

483
00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:41.600
so what would be that type of thing but beyond what you just said about the
yeah.

484
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:46.480
And the evidence of,
of gender differences,
what,

485
00:30:46.481 --> 00:30:51.070
what are the other types of things that just talking about are scaring the

486
00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:51.904
academics?

487
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.950
It's very awkward to talk about sex differences in any mental traits or

488
00:30:56.951 --> 00:31:00.880
motivations or preferences.
It's hard to talk about sexual coercion,

489
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.010
rape date,
rape,
harassment,
stalking,

490
00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:08.230
etc. That was being incredibly difficult one.
Uh,
yeah.
Yeah.

491
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:13.720
Um,
it's hard to talk about,
um,
aggression in general,

492
00:31:13.721 --> 00:31:18.610
either between individuals or between groups and how that relates to sexuality.

493
00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:23.470
Like why hunter gatherer tribes go to war,
right?

494
00:31:23.471 --> 00:31:26.440
It's not typically about land or food,

495
00:31:26.441 --> 00:31:31.441
it's about women and that doesn't fit the kind of Marxist picture of prehistoric

496
00:31:33.401 --> 00:31:34.820
warfare.
Right.

497
00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:41.230
And then if you talked about stuff like,
um,
pregnancy,

498
00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.760
child care,
parenting,
are you being,

499
00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:47.410
you know,

500
00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:52.410
overly pro natalist and sort of family values for talking about that stuff?

501
00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.440
Is that alienating to certain students who might be homosexual or infertile or,

502
00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.500
or adopted kids or whatever?
Um,

503
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:05.980
it's so interesting because I obviously hear these types of stories from

504
00:32:05.981 --> 00:32:08.750
academics all the time,
not only in here but,
but online.

505
00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:13.180
And people email me all the time.
It's like,
God,
we've failed.
I mean,

506
00:32:13.181 --> 00:32:16.360
the university really had failed at that point.

507
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:20.770
Like if you're afraid to talk about child rearing because that might upset a gay

508
00:32:20.771 --> 00:32:25.720
person.
Yeah.
Jesus.
I mean,
what's left at that point?

509
00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:32.760
It's so frustrating and it means I feel bad for the students,

510
00:32:32.771 --> 00:32:36.310
but I also feel bad for the parents who are often footing the tuition bill

511
00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:41.910
because the parents have faith that if I send my kid to a state university and I

512
00:32:42.621 --> 00:32:47.180
paid tens of thousands and tuition and they take a course on topic x,

513
00:32:47.181 --> 00:32:48.350
like human sexuality,

514
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:52.850
that they're going to get professors who are willing to profess to say what they

515
00:32:52.851 --> 00:32:55.670
really think and often are not getting that.

516
00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.530
So there's a kind of bait and switch where universities are pretending to be

517
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:05.480
these bastions of free speech and inquiry and,
and honesty.

518
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.520
And in fact,
um,

519
00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:12.910
everyone's kind of running scared and these kids are not getting our best

520
00:33:13.641 --> 00:33:18.170
insights.
They're paying the money,
but we're not delivering the service.

521
00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:23.200
<v 1>How much of an infection,
not just in the classroom.
Do you see this as,</v>

522
00:33:23.201 --> 00:33:24.430
but I think,
correct me if I'm wrong,

523
00:33:24.431 --> 00:33:27.220
I think you've written around 110 published papers.
Is that right?

524
00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.760
Did I get the exact number right?
Is it a hundred more or less?
More or less?

525
00:33:30.761 --> 00:33:32.110
You lose count anything at some point.

526
00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:36.640
I'm sure you're well aware of the Peter [inaudible] socal hoax,

527
00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:40.420
that it's not just what's happening in the classroom that's causing the chaos,

528
00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:44.200
but it actually may be what's happening before that related to all of these

529
00:33:44.201 --> 00:33:47.560
papers that certain disciplines basically have.

530
00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.750
I don't think I'm all the rest of waiting.
They almost have no standards.
Yeah.

531
00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:56.380
At this point that that is got to be just incredibly frustrating for someone

532
00:33:56.381 --> 00:34:00.940
that actually has published some things legitimately.
It's kind of frustrating,

533
00:34:00.941 --> 00:34:03.880
but I can see you don't get frustrated easily.
But I'm like,

534
00:34:03.881 --> 00:34:08.400
it doesn't bug me as much as maybe it bugged some other people.
Partly because

535
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:13.810
<v 0>I spent a lot of my undergraduate,
um,
years taking courses on</v>

536
00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:16.840
<v 1>critical theory and I read a lot of dairy,</v>

537
00:34:16.841 --> 00:34:19.690
Don Fuko and Leotard and all those French dudes.

538
00:34:19.691 --> 00:34:24.691
And one reason I loved those courses is it was so easy to get an a by writing a

539
00:34:26.411 --> 00:34:31.411
kind of bullshit paper using the right terms and using sufficiently obscure

540
00:34:33.221 --> 00:34:37.930
syntax.
Right.
That so I know that game.
God,

541
00:34:37.931 --> 00:34:42.070
that's real.
Very well.
It's really real and it's great fun.

542
00:34:42.071 --> 00:34:43.480
I understand the appeal

543
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:45.600
<v 0>of that stuff.
It's just,</v>

544
00:34:45.601 --> 00:34:50.601
I can't imagine spending my adult life doing nothing but that and that's what's

545
00:34:50.821 --> 00:34:52.590
happening in a lot of the humanities.

546
00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.180
So it like if,

547
00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:00.000
if those folks want to do that and get paid,

548
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:05.190
typically not a very good salary to do that.
I don't,
it doesn't really,

549
00:35:05.191 --> 00:35:06.210
this really offend me.

550
00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:12.050
The only dangerous when is when they turn into activists and they give people

551
00:35:13.321 --> 00:35:17.280
like me grief based on not understanding what I do.

552
00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.790
<v 1>Well,
I would imagine a lot of interest in leaks into your classroom and then,</v>

553
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:26.320
and all bets are off.
It's weird.
It doesn't actually leak in.

554
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.270
Like when I teach human sexuality,
right.
The kids have a sort of vague,

555
00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.673
um,

556
00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:38.340
political correctness that they've absorbed mostly in k 12 public school

557
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.130
<v 0>I think.
But if you actually ask them,</v>

558
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:45.510
have you had any courses on gender feminism?
No.

559
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:51.450
Have you heard of any of these leading figures from critical theory or history

560
00:35:51.451 --> 00:35:55.470
of feminism or even history of gay rights?
I know nothing about,

561
00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.410
so it's not like they've been indoctrinated,

562
00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.770
at least not in big state schools,

563
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:05.340
but they've kind of soaked up some stuff from high school.

564
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:10.800
I think that influences how they interpret everything.

565
00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.160
<v 1>So as you guys wearing,</v>

566
00:36:13.161 --> 00:36:17.720
might I say very nice shirts right now is shiny purple shirt and a shiny blue

567
00:36:17.721 --> 00:36:20.930
shirt.
Let's talk about evolutionary aesthetics.

568
00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.960
Told people don't talk about aesthetics.
Yeah,
that much.

569
00:36:23.961 --> 00:36:28.340
But you think that sort of the things we're looking at in the west or maybe not

570
00:36:28.341 --> 00:36:31.250
as exciting as they should be and that there's a problem there,
is that

571
00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.660
<v 0>fair to say?
Yeah,</v>

572
00:36:33.661 --> 00:36:37.290
I've been really into art for a long time and I think art and beauty are

573
00:36:37.291 --> 00:36:38.450
important,
um,

574
00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:42.600
particularly to places people live and work.

575
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:47.250
And I think as humans we kind of deserve the best from artists,

576
00:36:47.251 --> 00:36:50.670
interior designers,
um,
stylists,

577
00:36:50.671 --> 00:36:55.620
whatever architects that make our lives as pleasant as possible.

578
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.380
And I think basically ever since about 1910,

579
00:36:58.381 --> 00:37:01.260
art in architecture is failed as not done.

580
00:37:01.261 --> 00:37:06.261
A very good job of delivering visual environments that are actually humane and

581
00:37:08.191 --> 00:37:13.191
appealing and enjoyable and that kind of promote mental and physical health.

582
00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.370
What happened around 19 modernism,
man,
um,

583
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:23.270
if you look at the way domestic architecture worked up until about that period,

584
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:29.990
it was all sort of human scale and arts and crafts and um,

585
00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:35.670
there are places you'd want to live where you didn't have to be educated into a

586
00:37:35.671 --> 00:37:40.290
particular elite notion of what a house should be in order to appreciate it,

587
00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.940
right?
And then you get the Bauhaus,
international modernism,

588
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.860
white structures,
Chris part lines,
um,

589
00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:56.310
bad acoustics.
And suddenly that becomes the fashion,

590
00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:59.970
right?
That becomes what people think or is the future.

591
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:05.640
And nobody likes it,
but it's kind of imposed top down by the elite.

592
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:09.090
You must live like this,
like it or not.

593
00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:12.750
<v 1>Is that top down from the elite or is that just that often those things are just</v>

594
00:38:12.751 --> 00:38:16.780
easier to build probably and cheaper to build or maybe that's the same actually.

595
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:22.100
<v 0>It's like you could have taken cheap,</v>

596
00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:26.860
easy to build reinforced concrete structures and built a lot of all,

597
00:38:26.861 --> 00:38:31.850
some cheap houses that were okay or you could do the traditional route,

598
00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.530
but instead of what you get is every house must be distinct and must have its

599
00:38:35.531 --> 00:38:38.740
own shape and there can't be any,
um,

600
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:40.990
standardization.

601
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:46.360
So the houses end up being expensive and experimental and hard to maintain and

602
00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:49.660
they leak and everyone's miserable.
Um,

603
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:54.820
so they're not really serving the needs of the,
the people at large,
they're just

604
00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:58.570
great for architect egos.
Yeah.

605
00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:01.810
It's interesting because I just spent a couple of months bouncing through a lot

606
00:39:01.811 --> 00:39:03.640
of different countries in Europe,
you know,

607
00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.300
especially while most of these countries,
because the history goes back so far,

608
00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:10.750
you see incredible architecture.
You see,
you know,

609
00:39:10.751 --> 00:39:15.460
I'd see chairs that were 150 years old and like the woodwork that would go into

610
00:39:15.461 --> 00:39:17.680
it and the craftsmen shit.
And it was like,

611
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.680
I don't think we could do this today or if we could do it today,

612
00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.290
this would've caught,
this chair would be in our dollars.

613
00:39:23.291 --> 00:39:28.270
It would be like a $6,500 chair where back then,
you know,
this is what a guy did.

614
00:39:28.271 --> 00:39:31.720
It took him a couple of days and he could sell it and earn a wage and it's like

615
00:39:31.721 --> 00:39:35.380
we've just,
the economics of everything had gotten out of whack.
Yeah.

616
00:39:35.381 --> 00:39:40.381
And like nice table here and this slash probably slide it on the table right

617
00:39:41.501 --> 00:39:42.870
when you walked in.
So I know you made it.

618
00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.710
I've made a few pieces of furniture in my day and that's,
that's pretty cool.

619
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.920
But yeah,
it was a visual art in particular.
Um,

620
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:55.950
the economics mean like abstract painting just is so much faster to do than

621
00:39:57.551 --> 00:39:59.740
representational painting,
right?

622
00:39:59.741 --> 00:40:02.830
If you're a young aspiring artist and you want a career and you want to give

623
00:40:02.831 --> 00:40:06.730
your gallery a certain flow of work that they can sell,

624
00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.710
it's a lot harder to do that.

625
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:12.190
If you're doing representational paintings that take a hundred,

626
00:40:12.191 --> 00:40:16.330
300 hours than an abstract work that takes a 10th of that.

627
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:21.760
So the economic pressures are also in that direction.
Yeah.

628
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:26.650
Um,
but people have,
um,

629
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:33.270
kind of voted with their feet and like they don't like elite abstract art.

630
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:38.650
They don't like conceptual art.
Um,
like the word the right word.

631
00:40:38.651 --> 00:40:39.610
They are or they just don't,

632
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:44.500
they just don't know or it's conditioning or it's that we all like to like what

633
00:40:44.501 --> 00:40:47.380
everybody else likes sort of thing.

634
00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:52.560
I think everybody knows that that kind of supposed to enjoy going to like while

635
00:40:54.131 --> 00:40:55.600
we're visiting the city,

636
00:40:55.601 --> 00:40:59.140
we should go to the contemporary art museum and they get there and there's a

637
00:40:59.141 --> 00:41:04.141
bunch of terrible video art and there's a bunch of very puzzling conceptual art.

638
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:08.310
And they read the little descriptions on the walls and they go,
it,

639
00:41:08.311 --> 00:41:13.311
this makes no sense cause it's written by an art curator for other art curators.

640
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:18.110
And it's all completely alienating.
And that's,

641
00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:23.140
that's sad because it means they're being told this is the highest expression of

642
00:41:23.261 --> 00:41:26.680
your culture,
but it's completely inaccessible to you.

643
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.140
So what,
uh,

644
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:33.800
what do you look at that give me some excitement or can still sort of

645
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:36.140
<v 1>renew your spirit,
let's say?</v>

646
00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:39.850
<v 0>Well there,
there is a movement of kind of neo traditionalism and,</v>

647
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:41.560
and art where there's,

648
00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:45.250
there's certain places like New York Academy of Arts that are actually teaching

649
00:41:45.251 --> 00:41:47.760
students how to draw and paint and sculpt and,

650
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:52.390
and do the sort of traditional,
um,

651
00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:56.710
skills that people associate with art.
Um,

652
00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:59.440
it's just a little hard to get a foothold in the,

653
00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:01.660
like the New York or London gallery system.

654
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:04.840
If that's the kind of work that you do.
Um,

655
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:09.050
but my hope is that like the bay area billionaires,

656
00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:13.960
we'll start collecting that stuff.
Um,
I think the Chinese aren't market is,

657
00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:19.320
has got a real thirst for good representational art and I think that's going to

658
00:42:19.931 --> 00:42:23.110
start to dominate the art world pretty soon.

659
00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.250
<v 1>So what's the evolutionary need for good art?</v>

660
00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:29.980
I mean what's the psychological,
I mean I know you're okay.

661
00:42:29.981 --> 00:42:33.340
There's an expression of something that can't quite be said,

662
00:42:33.341 --> 00:42:35.800
but what's like the driving force behind that?

663
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:42.940
<v 0>So yeah,
on the one hand there's,
why do we bother to make art?
On the other hand,</v>

664
00:42:42.941 --> 00:42:45.490
why,
why do we like certain kinds of art?

665
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:49.630
And there's been a lot more research on why did we like certain kinds of

666
00:42:49.631 --> 00:42:52.690
patterns and colors and forms and compensations and whatever.

667
00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:58.300
But there's no sort of unified theory of,

668
00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:00.640
of aesthetics.
In fact,

669
00:43:00.641 --> 00:43:05.641
I would say there's more good stuff published on that topic between about 18,

670
00:43:06.881 --> 00:43:09.610
17,
19,
20 than since.

671
00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:13.120
Cause that's when people were sort of there inspired by Darwin.

672
00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:18.340
Evolutionary aesthetics was a field.
There were dozens of books published on it.

673
00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:21.370
And then modernism came and everyone forgot all that.

674
00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:26.930
<v 1>How could this be connected to the earlier topic,
which is sexuality?</v>

675
00:43:26.931 --> 00:43:30.890
So for example,
my gay male friends generally speaking,

676
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:36.350
have a much better eye for art or for style or for fashion.

677
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.070
You know,
you could get away in that crew,
you know what I mean?

678
00:43:40.071 --> 00:43:42.330
Like you've got a nice blanket on,
you got to make sure that,

679
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:46.060
you know what I mean?
Like,
I mean,
that is a compliment.
Like where Jen,
again,

680
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.400
just broadly speaking,
it's like my straight guy friends,

681
00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.630
all kinds of wear big shirts and they don't know exactly how to do their hair

682
00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:54.560
and their,
you know,

683
00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:59.510
so there's some connection between sexuality and artistic vision.

684
00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.080
<v 0>I think that's absolutely true.</v>

685
00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:07.550
And it's not what you would predict from first principles.
It's really weird.

686
00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:09.560
If you look around at other species,

687
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:14.180
the males are typically much more ornamental than the females.
They have the,

688
00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:19.830
the amazing plumage and they do the incredible songs and dances and the females

689
00:44:19.941 --> 00:44:23.420
are usually kind of drab and not that aesthetic.

690
00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:27.860
The bower birds that make these incredible kind of installation works.

691
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:32.880
That's all the males.
Then you get to humans or at least American males,

692
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:37.460
American straight males.
And it's like,
can't you even find

693
00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:42.930
<v 1>clothes that fit would like colors that is the big shark and like what is up</v>

694
00:44:45.371 --> 00:44:46.570
with your house?
You know,

695
00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:51.580
and when I did the Jordan Peter's until 2 million copies to tell people to clean

696
00:44:51.581 --> 00:44:52.280
their room.

697
00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.113
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

698
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:58.760
So I have no idea why gay men had better taste than straight men.

699
00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:01.640
I think that's a fascinating,
there's some,

700
00:45:01.641 --> 00:45:05.180
there has to be something going on there.
Um,

701
00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.370
but I think men can level up obviously cause like British and European men

702
00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:14.060
aren't as hopeless.
If you grow up a young man in Italy,

703
00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:19.780
you kind of absorb some ideas about style and even the British,

704
00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.940
um,
kind of aristocrats landed.

705
00:45:22.941 --> 00:45:27.941
Gentry class have a certain look that it's a bit traditionalist,

706
00:45:28.731 --> 00:45:31.400
but at least there's taste.

707
00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:34.040
<v 1>I don't know if he's going to quite make sense,
but we're,</v>

708
00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:38.770
we almost getting there say 10 years ago with the rise of the metro sexual.

709
00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:39.491
Yeah,
man,

710
00:45:39.491 --> 00:45:43.510
it's sort of crashed because I guess maybe it relates back to what you said at

711
00:45:43.511 --> 00:45:45.610
the beginning about where we are more puritan.

712
00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:49.090
So were there was this idea there was this like mocking of them like Ah,

713
00:45:49.091 --> 00:45:51.520
they're just gay but don't want to admit it or something like that.

714
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:53.470
And that whole thing seemed to crash.

715
00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:56.860
Like there was this little brief window where straight guys were like dressing

716
00:45:56.861 --> 00:46:00.010
better had cooler haircuts or something,
something there.
Well,

717
00:46:00.011 --> 00:46:03.160
even five years ago when I lived in New York for a little bit,

718
00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:08.190
<v 0>uh,
I hung out,
hung out a lot in Brooklyn.
There was sort of,</v>

719
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:12.660
that was peak hipster in,
in Brooklyn and the guys there,

720
00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:17.370
the straight guys put a lot of effort into grooming and haircuts and authentic

721
00:46:17.371 --> 00:46:22.350
style and this or that is in fashion.
And I thought this is really cool.

722
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:26.970
This is like a Europeanization of male taste and culture.

723
00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:29.610
But it was also very masculine.

724
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:35.270
It wasn't sort of like late seventies disco culture or early nineties rave

725
00:46:36.301 --> 00:46:39.270
culture or,
or burning man culture.

726
00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:43.050
You sort of more old school masculinity school.
Like,

727
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:48.300
I want to go to a proper barber and get proper haircut and like it's all flannel

728
00:46:48.301 --> 00:46:52.200
and boots and whatever and I love that stuff.
Um,

729
00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:54.330
but I think it kind of had its moment

730
00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.690
and evaporated on.

731
00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:01.240
<v 1>I just have these,
they just priced themselves out of the market in Brooklyn,</v>

732
00:47:01.241 --> 00:47:05.470
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Or they just got all too busy on Twitter.

733
00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:08.410
Well that it always comes back to that.

734
00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:13.540
Let's talk a little bit about mate selection.
Regardless of your sexuality,

735
00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.930
there seems to be this new thing right now where if you're not open to dating

736
00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.750
absolutely anyone under any circumstances,

737
00:47:19.751 --> 00:47:22.570
no matter how they look or how they take care of themselves or whether they

738
00:47:22.571 --> 00:47:27.190
brush their teeth or whether they have a penis or a vagina or any combination of

739
00:47:27.191 --> 00:47:30.340
anything that if you are just to anything,

740
00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:34.210
there is a pretty loud and growing boys out there that is trying to frame

741
00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:35.550
everyone as a,
as a painter,

742
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:39.790
which is the reverse of what choosing a mate really has been about.

743
00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:43.600
It's insane.
I mean,
for 509 I got ya.

744
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:46.230
I got emotional Miller or

745
00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.770
<v 0>500 million years,
right?</v>

746
00:47:48.771 --> 00:47:53.540
Our vertebrate ancestors had been choosing them mates selectively because that

747
00:47:53.541 --> 00:47:58.541
is the highest stakes decision any organism makes is who do I recombine my jeans

748
00:47:58.851 --> 00:47:59.900
with?
Right?

749
00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:04.430
And so all the way through the coordinates and the vertebrates in the mammals

750
00:48:04.431 --> 00:48:06.560
and the primates,
you get,

751
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:11.330
particularly females being choosy about,
you know,
who they breed with,

752
00:48:11.331 --> 00:48:12.530
who sires are kids.

753
00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:18.340
But then as soon as humans start doing pair bonds million 2 million years ago

754
00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:21.860
and the male start investing more in offspring,

755
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:24.290
start forming longer term relationships,

756
00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:28.760
then we also have incentives to be choosy about our female mates.

757
00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:36.100
And so this is the one domain where if you have even a shred of libertarian in

758
00:48:37.431 --> 00:48:41.840
you or you respect freedom of association at all,

759
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:47.470
or you think it's okay to care who you spend your life with and like what kind

760
00:48:49.221 --> 00:48:51.410
of children you,
you create,

761
00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:56.720
then mate choice should be it kind of domain of freedom,
right?

762
00:48:56.721 --> 00:48:59.420
Like this is a good place to be prejudice,
so to speak,
right?
Yeah.

763
00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:03.800
You should add some.
Uh,
should you just be discriminating,

764
00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:06.230
have judgment.
Um,

765
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:12.370
and you can always be open to the idea that may be the current set of criteria

766
00:49:13.671 --> 00:49:14.310
that I have.

767
00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:18.500
Maybe could be nudged or improved or tweaked or maybe I'm subject to certain

768
00:49:18.501 --> 00:49:21.410
stereotypes and maybe overcome those.
True,

769
00:49:21.411 --> 00:49:25.670
of course people tend to get better at mate choice in their thirties and in

770
00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:26.504
their teens.

771
00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:32.060
But for someone to start lecturing you politically,

772
00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.540
like you shouldn't be attracted to women.

773
00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:37.580
You should be attracted to anybody or any,

774
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:41.600
any kind of being or what any species and the age like,

775
00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.740
no,
let please let me be attracted to,

776
00:49:45.741 --> 00:49:50.741
I'm attracted to because that should be like the pinnacle of human freedom.

777
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:55.730
Yeah.
If you don't believe in freedom anywhere else,

778
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:59.840
you should believe in May choice,
freedom.
It should be a fundamental human right,

779
00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:01.693
I think.

780
00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:07.480
And where you get horrible totalitarian societies really infringing on mate

781
00:50:09.051 --> 00:50:09.890
choice freedom.

782
00:50:09.891 --> 00:50:14.210
Like you're not allowed to marry that person or you know,

783
00:50:14.211 --> 00:50:17.180
you have to do an arranged marriage to that person.

784
00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:21.770
We kind of recoil at that and go,
that's horrible.

785
00:50:21.771 --> 00:50:25.610
And yet in America we have busy bodies,

786
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:28.610
virtue signalers um,

787
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:33.320
telling us your matrix criteria are too narrow.

788
00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:39.090
<v 1>So where do gay people fit in all of this?</v>

789
00:50:39.091 --> 00:50:42.840
Then I add a biological or an evolutionary perspective.

790
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:47.670
You've brought up the point of passing on genes many times down gay couples or

791
00:50:47.671 --> 00:50:50.250
gay people,
whether you're a couple or not.
Don't do that.

792
00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:55.230
At least biologically speaking.
Yup.
Um,
so what,

793
00:50:55.231 --> 00:50:59.500
what do you make of that condition?
Is that even the right word?

794
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.330
And I'm going to get,
I'm going to get us both in trouble.

795
00:51:01.331 --> 00:51:04.680
Probably just for me asking the question.
It's called a trait trait traits.

796
00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:06.850
Pretty neutral.
Okay.
Alright.
Trey,
it's pretty neutral.

797
00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:07.291
<v 0>Well,</v>

798
00:51:07.291 --> 00:51:12.291
here's the fascinating thing about homosexuality is people have been developing

799
00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:16.920
or trying to develop series of male homosexuality and it's kind of evolutionary

800
00:51:16.921 --> 00:51:20.100
origins and functions for 30,

801
00:51:20.101 --> 00:51:24.720
40 years and there is no good theory of it yet.

802
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:25.980
It's a complete mystery.

803
00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:31.140
I've never seen any compelling explanation of male homosexuality.

804
00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:36.180
So,
so what would be a compelling,
compelling argument would be,

805
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:37.190
okay,

806
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:42.190
there's costs of being like exclusively attracted to your own sex and therefore

807
00:51:42.781 --> 00:51:45.000
not typically having as many kids,

808
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:48.600
but there's some countervailing benefits of some sort,

809
00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:54.260
maybe benefits to your extended family or benefits to your group or something

810
00:51:55.021 --> 00:51:59.540
else.
But nobody can make the math work enough to,

811
00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:04.140
to kind of explain that.
Um,
female bisexuality is much easier,

812
00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:05.701
right?
You can go,

813
00:52:05.701 --> 00:52:10.701
well as long as a woman is sometimes attracted to men enough to have kids,

814
00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:16.490
then also being attracted to women might be no cost at all.

815
00:52:16.861 --> 00:52:19.560
Or it might even be a benefit in terms of social networking,

816
00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:24.080
making friends sex as a great way to make friends.
Um,

817
00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:30.510
if a lot more males were bisexual,
that would be equally easy to explain.

818
00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:35.430
Um,
it's exclusive homosexuality,
that's very hard to explain.

819
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:39.960
It certainly exists.
It exists at a,
you know,

820
00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:45.150
a percentage that's much,
much higher than you can explain is just,

821
00:52:45.151 --> 00:52:49.080
well,
it's just mutations where it's just maladaptive.
That won't work.

822
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:54.720
So this is where I'll be kind of epistemically humble and say,

823
00:52:54.721 --> 00:52:58.710
hey man,
I have no idea.
It's an,
it's a fascinating problem.

824
00:52:58.711 --> 00:53:02.040
Maybe somebody will crack it within 10 or 20.

825
00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:02.570
<v 1>Right.</v>

826
00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:05.180
It's interesting because if you were coming at it from another perspective,

827
00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.560
like a religious perspective,

828
00:53:06.561 --> 00:53:11.360
let's say you would find that to be a moral quandary that then you could

829
00:53:11.361 --> 00:53:14.220
extrapolate all sorts of different judgements on.
Yeah.

830
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:18.280
But I can see the way you answered it's like just is a thing.
Yeah.

831
00:53:18.281 --> 00:53:20.360
Maybe we'll get more data on it,
but it is.

832
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:25.010
But what do you make of the fact that there are seemingly many more bisexual

833
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.250
women where,

834
00:53:26.251 --> 00:53:29.160
I don't know any gay couple that one of the guys is thinking out at night to

835
00:53:29.161 --> 00:53:31.680
bang a woman.
I've never heard of that.

836
00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:35.360
But you have heard of obviously straightened couples where the guy is,
you know,

837
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.690
on the DL or whatever.
Yeah.

838
00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.013
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

839
00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:42.190
Well my girlfriend Diana Fleishman has a whole theory of female bisexuality.

840
00:53:42.191 --> 00:53:46.440
That's,
that's to do with the social networking benefits.
Um,

841
00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:52.420
but then the question is,
yeah,
why don't the men do that too?
Cause like if,

842
00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:54.580
if you're a guy and you kind of swing both ways,

843
00:53:54.581 --> 00:53:59.581
then like doing gay sex can be a great way to make male friends also.

844
00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:01.900
And it's,
well now I know

845
00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:04.620
<v 1>we have our,
uh,
our promo for the show.</v>

846
00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:10.160
<v 0>And so in a way the quandary isn't,</v>

847
00:54:10.161 --> 00:54:13.220
why do any male homosexuals exist?

848
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:17.870
The quandary is why aren't all males and females bisexual?

849
00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:22.580
And do you think some of that years from now we might look back and go,
Whoa,

850
00:54:22.581 --> 00:54:25.640
that's just societal pressure.
It might be.

851
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:30.560
I think certainly there's a huge amount of stigma against male bisexuals from

852
00:54:30.561 --> 00:54:34.270
both sexist.
Um,
but especially women.
Um,

853
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:38.660
female bisexuality used to be stigmatized maybe 30 years ago and not so much

854
00:54:38.661 --> 00:54:41.450
anymore.
Yeah.
So it could change.

855
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.250
<v 1>What are some of the other topics that are,</v>

856
00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:49.190
that are really on your mind these days?
Let's hit up effective altruism.

857
00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:50.450
Yeah,
let's talk about that.

858
00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:51.923
<v 0>Um,</v>

859
00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:56.610
I don't know if you've had many guests on talking about the fact of altruism,

860
00:54:56.611 --> 00:54:58.320
but it's not a ton,
actually.

861
00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:03.900
It's sort of my hot topic of the last few years.
So it's a social movement,

862
00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:08.670
a moral movement in some of the smartest young people I've ever met.

863
00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:13.500
And their basic goal in life is do the most good.

864
00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:18.710
They can based on reason and evidence rather than sentimentality and virtue

865
00:55:19.111 --> 00:55:19.950
signaling.

866
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:22.740
I've done a little bit of this sort of in an ancillary way with some of the

867
00:55:22.741 --> 00:55:24.690
libertarians that I yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

868
00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:30.620
And so the kind of major domains they tend to focus on are things like how do we

869
00:55:31.171 --> 00:55:35.310
get charities to be more effective at reducing global poverty or promoting

870
00:55:35.311 --> 00:55:36.540
global public health?

871
00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:41.820
How do we overcome factory farming and be nice to animals and promote animal

872
00:55:41.821 --> 00:55:42.391
welfare?

873
00:55:42.391 --> 00:55:47.391
And so a lot of the effect of altruists are Vegan for ethical reasons and then a

874
00:55:48.721 --> 00:55:53.160
lot of them are focused on just survival of the species.

875
00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:58.160
How do we reduce existential risks to humanity like nuclear war,

876
00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:01.920
bio weapons,
um,

877
00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:05.550
and artificial intelligence risks.

878
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:11.420
So maybe the most distinctive thing they have is this kind of ultra longterm

879
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:16.620
perspective that's like,
we are just these transient little beings.

880
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:21.680
The thing that really matters is what is humanity turn into?

881
00:56:22.051 --> 00:56:23.380
How long did we last?

882
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:27.160
Do we colonize the universe or do we fail?

883
00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:33.660
And folks who think most seriously about that think it's actually that lasting,

884
00:56:34.151 --> 00:56:38.890
minimizing existential risk that is absolutely crucial and everything else is

885
00:56:38.891 --> 00:56:40.480
just kind of fluff and bullshit.

886
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:45.250
The transhumanist through would sort of fit within.
Is there a risk?

887
00:56:45.251 --> 00:56:48.010
So I love this stuff because I'm a PSI Phi guy.

888
00:56:48.011 --> 00:56:49.450
Everything I mentioned Philip k Dick before.

889
00:56:49.451 --> 00:56:53.920
I mean every one of his stories or books are about the inevitability of all of

890
00:56:53.921 --> 00:56:55.900
these things.
Is there a risk though?

891
00:56:55.901 --> 00:57:00.100
We'll always looking at what's beyond the horizon instead of going on right now?

892
00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:05.620
I don't really think there's a risk unless like the vast majority of humans

893
00:57:05.621 --> 00:57:10.450
became effective altruists there's already so many people who are obsessed with

894
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:12.940
um,
you know,

895
00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:17.970
diversity and equity and inclusion and economic growth and all the ordinary

896
00:57:19.601 --> 00:57:24.601
problems that politicians talk about that that's covered this already.

897
00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:27.190
A lot of smart people working on that.

898
00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:32.890
The big neglected topics tend to be the kind of science fictiony topics where

899
00:57:33.941 --> 00:57:38.770
you need a sort of cadre of genius.
Ask Bs,

900
00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:43.990
right to work on it when nobody else is taking it seriously.
Yeah.

901
00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:46.210
Well speaking of the ass,
because that's the,
that's an interesting one.

902
00:57:46.211 --> 00:57:50.450
If we wanted to get into on this a little,
a little controversial as well.
Um,

903
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:53.680
what,
what is that all about?

904
00:57:53.681 --> 00:57:58.120
That so many of the creators now or the people that are coming out of the tech

905
00:57:58.121 --> 00:57:58.331
world,

906
00:57:58.331 --> 00:58:01.720
even though you can obviously make plenty of arguments that the 10 world is now

907
00:58:01.721 --> 00:58:05.740
in its sort of implosion and certainly not the creative place it was say 10

908
00:58:05.741 --> 00:58:06.520
years ago,

909
00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:10.720
but there's so much creativity came out of a world that had so many people that

910
00:58:10.721 --> 00:58:12.990
were seemingly uncreated.
[inaudible]

911
00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:17.200
I think it's fascinating.
Um,

912
00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:20.930
I sort of identifies moderately ask,

913
00:58:20.931 --> 00:58:25.600
be myself kind of high functioning Asperger's and I've written some stuff about

914
00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.050
how um,

915
00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:31.690
neurodiversity issues like being asked to kind of rub up against free speech

916
00:58:31.691 --> 00:58:34.920
issues cause like can you explain that people who are asked,

917
00:58:34.921 --> 00:58:39.010
we don't always do a good job of understanding the beliefs and desires of other

918
00:58:39.011 --> 00:58:42.360
people and particularly what they might find offensive.
Right?

919
00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:45.370
So they might just say something,
so I might just say shit.

920
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:49.060
And then these really surprised that it was distressing to someone.

921
00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:55.530
And so if you have a model of speech that says you must never cause a fence,

922
00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:00.640
that assumes you can anticipate what will cause a fence.

923
00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:06.190
And a lot of people can't anticipate that because their brains don't work that

924
00:59:06.191 --> 00:59:07.024
way.

925
00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:12.190
So you either need to say,
okay,
as bs,

926
00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:13.960
you can never say anything

927
00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:18.520
or cut them some slack and say,

928
00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:21.440
we understand you'll offend people once in awhile,

929
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:25.580
but that's okay because that's just,
that's part of your deal,
man.

930
00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:26.420
I've never thought about this,

931
00:59:26.421 --> 00:59:29.510
but does this somehow explain what's going on in Silicon Valley right now you

932
00:59:29.511 --> 00:59:33.230
have a bunch of people who are somewhat socially awkward,
let's say,

933
00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:37.700
created incredible technology that allowed us to all connect,

934
00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:40.730
but then when voices that are exposed,

935
00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:43.940
I suppose that's a horrible way framing it within voices that are a little out

936
00:59:43.941 --> 00:59:48.080
there or a little contrary or whatever that might include us actually get out

937
00:59:48.081 --> 00:59:48.201
there.

938
00:59:48.201 --> 00:59:51.890
The only way they can deal with it is to shut that voice off or something like

939
00:59:51.891 --> 00:59:52.730
that.
Like,

940
00:59:52.790 --> 00:59:55.880
which is why we're seeing so much d platforming and silencing and they're right.

941
00:59:55.881 --> 01:00:00.440
They have to be overly systematizing about it,
that they have to be like,
oh man,

942
01:00:00.441 --> 01:00:01.274
I can't,

943
01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:06.760
I can't navigate these gray areas if I'm running a social media platform or

944
01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:10.720
Patrion or whatever.
Right.

945
01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:15.760
So I'm gonna just have a hard and fast rule that says if I get enough

946
01:00:16.221 --> 01:00:20.390
complaints,
I d platform that person,
or um,

947
01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:27.430
I don't know the difference between porn and erotica and just slightly sexy art.

948
01:00:27.431 --> 01:00:30.720
So I'm going to say no nipples or whatever.

949
01:00:31.290 --> 01:00:34.530
That's a kind of asked be response to getting blow back

950
01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:40.350
from people were like,
you don't really know why they're upset.
So in a weird way,

951
01:00:40.351 --> 01:00:45.351
if you have a bunch of the creators of Silicon Valley then are coming from that

952
01:00:45.961 --> 01:00:46.590
world,

953
01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:50.610
and then you subtly bring in a bunch of executives that come from the social

954
01:00:50.611 --> 01:00:54.910
justice world that really shows like a,
uh,
that's a match made in hell.
Right?

955
01:00:54.911 --> 01:00:58.950
It's just matter.
Anti matter.
Yeah.
It's,
um,

956
01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.540
it's terrible.
And

957
01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:02.383
<v 3>okay,</v>

958
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:06.770
<v 0>what I hoped would happen is that maybe five or 10 years ago,</v>

959
01:01:06.771 --> 01:01:09.960
it seemed like,
Whoa,

960
01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:15.130
like tech is dominating culture generally on tech is dominated by aspy.

961
01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:21.410
So hopefully ask me values of being kind of tolerant and eccentric and nerdy and

962
01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:28.360
like getting weird little enthusiasms that that would kind of trickle down and

963
01:01:29.121 --> 01:01:32.960
create a more tolerant culture.
Is that what you would have predicted,

964
01:01:32.961 --> 01:01:36.840
say 10 years ago?
Yeah.
Really.
And instead you have the opposite.
You have the,

965
01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:40.820
the social justice activists taking over and basically saying

966
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:47.060
all of that quirky freedom that you,
you asked me people value,

967
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:51.860
we're going to legislate that away.
You can't have that.

968
01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.640
Um,
and it's,
it's tragic.

969
01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:01.970
I hope the pendulum swing swings back,
but um,

970
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000
as long as the leaders of the social media platforms don't have the guts to say,

971
01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:13.820
look,
this is our people.
Um,

972
01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:18.920
outspoken,
eccentric,
slightly socially oblivious people,
and that's,

973
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:23.040
and the rest of you just have to kind of suck it up and deal with it.

974
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:24.320
That's what they should

975
01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.940
<v 1>be doing.
Yeah.
It's interesting.</v>

976
01:02:25.941 --> 01:02:27.950
I'm at the point with all this and you know how Facebook,

977
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.310
Youtube and Twitter and patriotic and the whole thing,

978
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:34.460
I'm really at the point of this where I actually believe that that solution is

979
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:38.750
gone.
I don't think it can come from the top anymore.
I really don't believe that.

980
01:02:38.751 --> 01:02:42.560
I think that thing has become so corroded that I would say the only way it can

981
01:02:42.561 --> 01:02:46.490
come is now from the bottom and then the people will basically rise up against

982
01:02:46.491 --> 01:02:50.060
these things and I know that like it's sort of pie in the sky because what does

983
01:02:50.061 --> 01:02:54.220
that even mean?
Do we all sign off on the same day?
Do we all be,
you know,

984
01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:55.280
whatever that means.

985
01:02:55.281 --> 01:02:58.580
But I almost see that as the only way to do this because they've had,

986
01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:01.840
we've done everything else or,
or the government will get involved in.

987
01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:05.480
That certainly rings all the bells that I'm not happy with on my libertarian

988
01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:06.314
side.

989
01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.580
<v 0>Yeah.
I,
I think,
at least in terms of universities,</v>

990
01:03:11.581 --> 01:03:12.990
the only solution to,

991
01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:17.930
to some of the university problems is the government actually saying at least to

992
01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.450
the public universities that are in principle bound by the constitution.

993
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:26.340
You guys have to obey the first amendment or you lose federal funding.

994
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.740
I think that's the only leverage.
Yeah.

995
01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:33.960
And I was really kind of hoping that POTUS would do that at some point in the

996
01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.450
last year or two and pretty disappointed that he hasn't,

997
01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:40.280
<v 1>well,
in a weird way he almost benefits the more that they go against it.
Right?</v>

998
01:03:40.281 --> 01:03:44.700
Yeah.
Because that feeds his base of aggrieved and politically correct.
You know,

999
01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.150
that they see political correctness running muck.
Yeah.
Something like that.
Um,

1000
01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:48.381
all right.

1001
01:03:48.381 --> 01:03:52.520
Before we finish up gimme gimme one thing where at the beginning of 2019 right

1002
01:03:52.521 --> 01:03:57.380
now,
give me one thing that we should be sort of thinking about that we're not

1003
01:03:57.381 --> 01:03:58.370
thinking about right now.

1004
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:02.270
<v 0>I love the thought experiment of like,</v>

1005
01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:06.350
once Elon Musk succeeds and we start colonizing Mars,

1006
01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:07.490
what,

1007
01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:12.020
what are the relationships and social structures in the Mars colony is going to

1008
01:04:12.021 --> 01:04:14.720
look like?
I'm fascinated by this,
this issue,

1009
01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:19.340
like are the colony is going to be like

1010
01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:25.730
communist utopia?
Is are they going to be libertarian,
um,

1011
01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:28.760
aspirational states?
Are they,

1012
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:32.180
is everyone going to do monogamous lifelong marriage?

1013
01:04:32.181 --> 01:04:35.060
Is it going to be crazy polyamorous,
kinky stuff?

1014
01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:40.340
I think it's great to think about this stuff before we attempt it.

1015
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:46.510
And I think Mars is going to be this amazing experiment or like this colony gets

1016
01:04:47.151 --> 01:04:47.720
formed,

1017
01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:52.430
paste on these social and sexual assumptions and this one gets formed and this

1018
01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:56.720
one fails catastrophically or,
or it like,

1019
01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:01.130
it doesn't work well enough in it that just borrows the organization of this

1020
01:05:01.131 --> 01:05:01.964
other place.

1021
01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:06.230
So I think it'll be this incredible kind of behavioral Science Laboratory.

1022
01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:07.680
And I can't,

1023
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:10.890
<v 1>where I say that's not too far from the way the America we set up right.</v>

1024
01:05:10.891 --> 01:05:14.100
That this exactly.
To be those places of experiment.

1025
01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:17.410
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
it's,
yeah,</v>

1026
01:05:17.411 --> 01:05:21.970
it's the way the east coast was 200,
250 years ago.
And I think,
um,

1027
01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:27.370
the difference now is the colonies will be able to communicate with each other

1028
01:05:27.371 --> 01:05:31.510
and with us and be able to measure a bunch of outcomes and deliberately

1029
01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:32.344
experiment.

1030
01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:38.280
And I think we need to kind of get out ahead of that and start like rereading

1031
01:05:40.241 --> 01:05:43.510
all of our classic science fiction and figuring out how is this going to apply

1032
01:05:43.511 --> 01:05:46.870
for reals now,
now that we do it.
Yeah.

1033
01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:50.520
Which is still related to why you think guard is important because fiction's

1034
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.640
just as important.
I mean,

1035
01:05:51.641 --> 01:05:54.490
you realize you've all lands that eventually they figure it out.

1036
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.150
They have their tea party and then we blow them up like,
yeah.

1037
01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:02.950
But they do beautiful art nouveau like domes in the meanwhile.

1038
01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:07.240
Yeah.
Jeffrey,
I'm so glad we finally did this it again for sure.

1039
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:10.960
And if you want to see a good combination of bright,

1040
01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:15.520
smart thought and snark on Twitter,
follow Jeffrey at primal Polly.
