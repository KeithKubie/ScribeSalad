1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,890
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,891 --> 00:00:10,330
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast and ahhh

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,750
just checking in on you. I'm just
checking in on you. How's it going?

4
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:19,350
How's your Thursday? How's your
week? You have an a good time.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,100
I'll dare you getting ready to
eat your fucking face off. Hey,

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,210
well here's a good one for you.

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,560
You know you're going to eat like
an absolute pig on thanksgiving.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,140
You know you're going to eat all
the leftovers and all that crap.

9
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:34,080
You know you're going to drink your
face off the wind the Wednesday before

10
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:36,000
Thanksgiving going out there,
right?

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,520
Trying to meet some ladies, right?
Going back to your hometown,

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,010
you know you're going to do all of that
crap as I just the wind screen here on

13
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:51,540
the microphone. Um, you know,
you gotta to do all that Shit.

14
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:55,680
So why not? Why not before? Why not now?

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,270
Just do you do cardio every fucking day?
Giant Salad,

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,800
right? You've got a giant salad, but the
protein somewhere in your fucking day,

17
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:09,480
lunch at dinner. Why don't you do that
right up until thanksgiving, you know,

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,930
and right through the
Thanksgiving weekend. Why don't
you just do that every day?

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,340
Say I'm going to get on that fucking
motherfucking elliptical and knock out a

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:17,341
half hour.

21
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:22,050
Why don't you do that instead of eating
yourself into a food coma and then

22
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:23,280
you're going to have all that sugar,

23
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,000
sugar and salt in you and you know
what you're going to be thinking.

24
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:30,660
I should work out and all that fucking
stuff is going to be sitting on your

25
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:35,340
brain. Gone. No, they all
whoa. Working out is hard.

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,810
Shit near become enough fat.
Fuck is easy. Yes it is easy.

27
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,200
Anything worth anything where
something in life is difficult?

28
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,810
Um, come on guys. What are we doing
here? Huh? All right. We fat enough.

29
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,340
How much longer, uh, America are
we going to sit here and gloat?

30
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,350
How much poisonous food?

31
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,730
We have more poisonous food than any
other nation on the planet. You know,

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,220
how much longer?
It's not even really point.

33
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:09,210
I think most of it now that I'm starting
to watch these things on nutrition is

34
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:12,600
how they just had the whole thing upside
down in the whole food pyramid was

35
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:14,940
created by a guy who didn't
know shit about food,

36
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,090
who went to fucking Italy post World War
Two where they lost to bunch of Goddamn

37
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,040
nerds. Italy lost that. They lined up
with fucking a star over there, right?

38
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,900
Adolph Hitler. Right. They
lined up with him and they lost.

39
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:35,700
So he went over to a fucking war
torn country, postwar, right?

40
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,260
Everybody was fucking broke.

41
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:41,430
So everyone was skinny and he equated
it to their fucking diet and started

42
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:43,860
talking about how you wanted
to do a bunch of carbohydrates,

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,780
like these fucking guys who lost the
Goddamn war or not tell you if something

44
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:52,320
like that, I dunno, I'll post a video. Um,

45
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,890
but all I know is like y'all,
all that stuff is like the devil.

46
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,920
I still cannot get my head around the
fact that I can eat this much meat and to,

47
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:02,710
I still don't. I think, you know,

48
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,203
okay.

49
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,470
I guess is my mother always said
everything in moderation is she would yell

50
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:13,950
across the room. Right. Um,

51
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,650
so I guess that's what you want
to do. So I'm, I'm just going to,

52
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,990
I'm going to do what the fuck I always do.

53
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:22,050
I do a ton of Goddamn cardio when I
stopped beating around five o'clock,

54
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:23,940
six o'clock and then I
just crushed the waters.

55
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,080
One of the meals is a fucking
salad. That's what I do. All right.

56
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,280
That's so I lose weight.

57
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,200
I don't sit around blaming society or
the fucking industry I'm in, right.

58
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,660
Is I'm eating a fucking candy dapple.

59
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,483
Yeah.

60
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,610
Like a lot of these
fucking people out there

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,890
that if just give it in to their sugar,

62
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:49,891
salt coma and then want you to sit there
and accept their defeat rather than

63
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:55,150
standing up and giving them a
halftime fucking speech, you know,

64
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,690
grab it and by that back of their hair
and pulling it out of that bowl of

65
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:03,220
fucking peanut and fucking chocolate m
and m's and getting right in that grill.

66
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:07,450
Like Bobby Knight used to poke
at him in the chest, you know,

67
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:11,590
talking to them about their transition
game between one meal to another.

68
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,390
That's what's happening out there, right?
This, this fucking countries getting,

69
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,460
it's getting softer.
It's getting soft.

70
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:24,750
Everybody's at Goddamn fucking victim.
Everybody has a fucking excuse, right?

71
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:29,550
And everybody's letting them get away
with it going like now. Now, now, now.

72
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,413
All right.

73
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:32,610
Yeah.

74
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,310
It's not the potato chips fault.
It's your fault. All right?

75
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:38,820
You control your hands. Stop telling
your hands to go into the bag.

76
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,540
All right? You wait a head
of lettuce to what you eat.

77
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,700
Those fucking chips.
Like I'm telling you right now,

78
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,670
you'd be a goddamn dream boat.
You know what you got to do?

79
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:51,380
Quit your fucking crying.
All right, I'm done.

80
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,160
You know what song is in my head when
I want to? I was just talking to,

81
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:58,750
I'm in the middle of a radio tour
right now promoting my dates in, uh,

82
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,400
Albuquerque and an Arizona.

83
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,820
I didn't know where the hell I'm going
to be in Arizona, Tucson or some shit.

84
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,830
And then I got a Hollywood,
Florida and I have Orlando,

85
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,670
Florida. Well, I will be going
to the Orlando Magic game.

86
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,770
The last team I need to see protein that
I need to see in the state of Florida.

87
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,370
Plus I've seen the Miami hurricanes
and the Florida gators. What's left?

88
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:24,950
You ask the Florida State Seminoles.

89
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:26,670
Okay.

90
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,590
You know, in a central Florida
keeps making noise. I got,

91
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:33,120
I got to go down there
eventually. Right? Um,

92
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,660
okay.

93
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,520
I Dunno. I guess what's left is to
fucking try to swim Lake Okeechobee,

94
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:40,781
whatever the hell it is,

95
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:43,510
and try not to get eaten by an alligator
and maybe the python that ate the

96
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:47,240
fucking alligator. I don't,
I don't pretend to understand
these things. I don't,

97
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,450
I don't try to pretend to
understand what Florida is.

98
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,783
MMM.

99
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,481
But whatever.

100
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:57,530
I was just in the middle of this radio
tour and I was joking around this fucking

101
00:05:57,531 --> 00:06:00,620
guy that was interviewing me and somehow
we started singing that song. Brandy.

102
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,650
Remember that sound brandy was a fucking
bitch in depth of Buddha do and hippos

103
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,750
say it,
but he sat there,

104
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,460
hit Nona pirate and he
nibbled would commit to her.

105
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,120
That's such a sad song. When you really
listen to the fucking lyrics, it's like,

106
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,070
she sounds like such a nice woman.

107
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:21,950
Why doesn't she get out of that
fucking bar and stop talking to those?

108
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:23,910
Okay.

109
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,790
Those, those whalers, whatever
the hell she's talking to,

110
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,460
their job takes them out to sea.
I did one cruise ship in my entire career.

111
00:06:32,461 --> 00:06:36,660
I have never been further
away from anything that I
knew or love to in my life.

112
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,000
You know, people go on cruises to
get rid of their spouse, you know,

113
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,820
when they went through with the
marriage that they didn't want to be in.

114
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,490
And rather than just looking
at everybody just saying,

115
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,550
I don't want to do this and just let
everybody pelt you with the wedding cake.

116
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,770
Next thing you know,

117
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,400
you're laying in your little fucking
cabin on a cruise ship going like,

118
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,313
all right,
so

119
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,443
Allah,

120
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,680
I'll tell him that I'm going
to take a picture of her
and I'll, oh my God, I just,

121
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:08,900
the shit that people
do happens to guys too.

122
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,950
People fall overboard in those things.
Why am I talking about cruise ships?

123
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:13,790
I don't even know why.
Oh yeah.

124
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:17,770
So why would this woman commit to
these fucking people? You know,

125
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,050
they always make it out
like she's the victim.

126
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:24,880
I think what really happened was I
think brandy didn't want a relationship.

127
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,150
You know?
Maybe that's what it was.

128
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,520
I just feel like for me,
all right,

129
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:36,880
so I'm 91 days into did not drinking.
I'm in overtime right now.

130
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,750
The movie is wrapped. I'm basically
done with my gigs for this year.

131
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,100
I'm chilling out. I'm getting
into the holiday spirit or Billy,

132
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:46,750
the baker's going to rear its ugly head.

133
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,720
I think I'm going to make a
blueberry pie this year. You know,

134
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,670
I'm going to deep fry a fucking Turkey,

135
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:55,750
but my wife won't let me buy the
apparatus. Why can't we just order one?

136
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,200
I Dunno cause it's not as fun.

137
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,630
It's not that sense of
satisfaction knowing that
somebody else made the fucking

138
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:05,080
Turkey.

139
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,720
What kind of man am I am going to have
somebody else cook my fucking Turkey.

140
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,810
I mean it doesn't that sound borderline
filthy. That's like something.

141
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,010
If you whispered it in a woman zero work,

142
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:16,510
I mean you didn't have a fucking problem.

143
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,090
Heavy deep fry my Turkey for me.
The fuck did you just say to me?

144
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,220
All right.
Um,

145
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,171
I don't know.
But you know,

146
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:33,171
I'm getting to this point that I'm
starting to understand like this is weird

147
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:37,500
balance you have to have when you're
married you have to say exactly what the

148
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:38,280
fuck you thinking.

149
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,690
You have to be honest with your partner
while totally agreeing with everything

150
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:45,510
that they say.
I haven't figured it out yet.

151
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:47,763
You know,

152
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,990
hey me and some friends who go to brunch.
Do you want to go? No. No I don't.

153
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,160
Why? Because it's always
crowded. It's always crowded.

154
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,470
You go down there,
you got to stand there.

155
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:05,220
Then you standing outside waiting for
them to fucking call your name and then

156
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:06,510
when they finally call your name,

157
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,320
he's sitting there eating has all these
other people are eyeballing your plate,

158
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,080
breathing down your fucking
neck from across the room.

159
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,240
It's like the food
version of playing golf.

160
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,770
Is there anything worse than playing golf?
And you got that fucking do.

161
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:23,330
You got those goddamn borderline pros,

162
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:28,331
a plane right behind you and you just
see them just fucking like 80 yards away.

163
00:09:28,521 --> 00:09:30,350
Like throwing their hands
up like Jesus Christ.

164
00:09:30,351 --> 00:09:34,580
How many fucking attempts do you need?
It's that same kind of pressure.

165
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,880
It's just like it's fucking play through.
Eat through buddy.

166
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,610
You want to sit down and order?
I'll fucking pick my plate up.

167
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,450
I don't know. Somewhere in that I
was being honest with my wife. Yes.

168
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,690
So you know what?
I gotta rise you today.

169
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,250
Don't you like me anymore?
It's like, lady, I married you.

170
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,140
I'm paying all the bills.

171
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,390
Okay.

172
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:56,721
Okay.

173
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,020
What more do this whole thing crumbles
over some fucking eggs that I don't want

174
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:02,120
to go down and get. We got
eggs in the fridge. Sweetheart,

175
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,260
why don't you bring your friends over
here? They'll sit out on the back porch

176
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,830
cause you want to get dressed up.

177
00:10:09,831 --> 00:10:14,750
We want to go out and look cute and have
other women resent us for how cute we

178
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:19,751
are talking about spit yourself or
they're being cute and so fucking mad at

179
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:21,120
them.
Um,

180
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,600
yeah.

181
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,050
All right,
so now that I'm back,

182
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,250
I ordered the NHL and the
NBA package as of yesterday.

183
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,080
I watched my first NHL game.

184
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:34,880
Why at a y yesterday ruins
verse the Anaheim Ducks.

185
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,920
And if you were rooting for the Bruins,
what a fucking stick around.

186
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,700
Yeah,

187
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,870
I know we're really banged up on
that type of thing. But Jesus Christ,

188
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:50,710
the one problem the Boston Bruins have
had ever since they decided to blow up

189
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:56,561
the team is we lack that
fucking power forward.

190
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,240
That person that is on the ice that
everybody else has to be like, oh fuck.

191
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:06,320
Keep your head on a Goddamn swivels.
So and so's out there. Every team,

192
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:09,770
if you want to compete in the NHL,
you gotta have that.

193
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,520
It's like a fucking great white shark.
Just swimming around.

194
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:16,290
Everybody's just hoping the thing just
got done eating, you know what I mean?

195
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,980
And you always keeping an eye out.
Where the fuck is that thing? You know,

196
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,570
it was great white sharks. They just, they
just swim so goddamn slowly until POW,

197
00:11:23,571 --> 00:11:25,490
they fucking turn it on.
Next thing you know,

198
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,640
you've got fucking 90 rows of
teeth coming at you, right?

199
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,720
Yeah.

200
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,700
You're all drunk,
swimming naked out to a bully,

201
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:35,070
whatever the fuck it is you're
doing at the beginning of jaws.

202
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,360
We don't have that ever since we
got rid of Lou Cheech and, uh,

203
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,790
I don't think that those people
come and go out on a limb and say,

204
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:45,000
those guys are very few and far between.
We got to have our guy,

205
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,620
um, who's our enforcer, I don't even know.

206
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,800
And I looked at the Celtics roster as
I mentioned. It's like I knew every,

207
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,080
everybody on the Celtics and
now I know like three of them,

208
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:56,980
they got rid of everybody,

209
00:11:56,981 --> 00:12:00,010
but I heard they're playing great and
I believe they have a game tonight.

210
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,060
So I'm going to watch that.

211
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,670
And I also want to say the Bruins
and playing back to back down here.

212
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,860
I think they're playing the kings.
Um,

213
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,530
these are always brutal games. Bruins
always come out here and fucking loose.

214
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,180
I can't believe the king's it took them
so God damn long to win this many games.

215
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,251
All these years.

216
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:21,970
Everybody comes down here and wants to
just party in Hollywood and try to fuck a

217
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:24,370
movie star. That's what
everybody's doing, right?

218
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:27,670
So then they come to the
game all hung over, right.

219
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,300
Smelling like the flavor of the month.
Whoever the fuck they just banged.

220
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,610
And then they go in there and they just
walked through the game and they get

221
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:36,490
their fucking asses kicked it.
This is what happens every goddamn time,

222
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,970
but at least you can go down to
Anaheim and beat the ducks. Right?

223
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,220
The, the, the, the, the, the
equally injured ducks. But we wait,

224
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:46,080
we couldn't get it done.

225
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,490
We couldn't get fact that ducks have
won the last eight regular season games

226
00:12:50,491 --> 00:12:52,320
against the Bruins.
They fucking owners.

227
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,280
But t were an original 16,

228
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:59,970
getting owned by a team that's
made after a Disney kid movie.

229
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,980
How fucking sad is that. I
have no idea. So anyways,

230
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:05,810
uh,

231
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,643
yeah,

232
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,510
I am just going to keep going
with the streak. I'm not, I'm,

233
00:13:09,511 --> 00:13:12,660
I'm going to get to at least a
hundred days and then see how I feel.

234
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:14,460
But if I go through the end of the year,

235
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:19,170
I'll have four solid months that I
didn't drink. So that's like a 30 year,

236
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,720
which for most people would be good.

237
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:26,280
But if you saw the level
with which I abused alcohol,

238
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:30,400
just slapping it all over,
all over the room, uh,

239
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,200
I would feel better if that
number was up around six. But, um,

240
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,480
as I've mentioned, I'm turning 50
next year and I'm going to be fucking,

241
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:43,830
I'm going staying in my fifties.
I'm going to try do anyways.

242
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:46,420
I might regret telling you guys that I'm
doing that, but I'm telling you if I,

243
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:50,730
if I can ever get fucking healthy,
I got another injury.

244
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,290
All right. Listen to this.
I did a inside the NFL,

245
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:59,700
which you can watch this week
on showtime, right? And, um,

246
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,540
not doing this show. I'm having
a great time. Oh, you know,

247
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,930
it was fucking hilarious. I was in the
green room and I walk in it and, uh,

248
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,960
Ray Lewis is there and I start telling
them how I scalped a ticket to go to a

249
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:15,970
ravens game.
I've told this story before,

250
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:19,270
I scalped a ticket and I go in and I
sit down. I'm like, Holy Shit, this is,

251
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:22,630
I could like announce the game from
where I'm sitting. And I'm like,

252
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:25,660
this is the one of the best scalp tickets.
I have a gun for a great price.

253
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,020
Then all of a sudden the security
guy just goes, excuse me sir. Ah,

254
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,260
I've been sad for about, you know,
half hour. Uh, is that your seat?

255
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:35,280
Do you have to take it for the echo a
yet? Yeah, it is. And he goes, oh, great.

256
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,630
Could you come out to the aisle for a
second? So I came, I looked at my ticket.

257
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,170
He goes, yeah, that is, you're
a, that is your seat. Um,

258
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,440
where did you get this ticket? And I was
like, hey, scalped it outside. He goes,

259
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,650
okay, I understand. I understand. Can you
just come down the stairs for a second?

260
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:49,810
So I come down the stairs.
Now there's another security personnel.

261
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:50,800
There's two security people.

262
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,150
Can you describe the person that you
bought this ticket off of? I'm like,

263
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,780
I don't know. He had a shirt. I don't
know what's going to go. Ah, no,

264
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:02,690
it's just we just have some questions.
Can you walk down this aisle?

265
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,740
He'd come like underneath.

266
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:05,900
So now we're underneath the thing and
I find just say to the guy, go look,

267
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,290
can you quit kicking me out of
this stadium 10 feet at a time?

268
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:13,070
What's going on here? And then the
guy goes, well these were stolen.

269
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,380
Um, these are season tickets and they were
stolen out of one of our season ticket

270
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:22,070
holders, mailboxes. So, um,

271
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,470
this is a stolen ticket. I
go, oh, so what? Some school?
And they go, no, no, no.

272
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,560
Well we're going to try to see if, uh,
you know, we can get you another ticket,

273
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:32,540
blah, blah, blah, and they will
get me all the way downstairs.

274
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,360
Now I'm right next to the two,
like the side door. And I go,

275
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,940
can you get me another ticket?
They're like, yeah, unfortunately not.

276
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:38,870
And then they just kicked me out.

277
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,300
The whole thing was they didn't want me
to flip out and scream and yell in front

278
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:44,180
everybody. The fucking NFL
is just, it's such cunts.

279
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,660
God forbid there's an issue,
right?

280
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,790
So I'm telling the guys there the story,

281
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,650
they're all laughing.
So I went out and I scalped it.

282
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,560
I actually was so mad that I was getting
kicked out that I said the fucking

283
00:15:57,561 --> 00:16:00,980
scalper was a tall, skinny white dude.
It was actually a short black guy,

284
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,460
and I don't even know why I did that.
I was just so fucking mad.

285
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:08,270
I didn't want to help anybody out. So I
went back outside scalped another ticket.

286
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,230
I paid even more money. Now I'm sitting
in the lower deck and I said, yeah,

287
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:15,500
and I go that. And they're all laughing,
listened to the story and go, yeah,

288
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:17,480
that's the game that it
was against Cleveland.

289
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:20,720
That was the game with that dude on the
browns ran for like 300 yards and set

290
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:23,270
the rushing record and all
of a sudden ray Lewis just,

291
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:27,620
he dropped his head a little bit and
he just starts staring at me and I'm

292
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:28,790
laughing. I'm going. So man,

293
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:33,570
that guy put up like 295 yards because
what are you talking about? I go,

294
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,480
Denny, did he run? And then he
goes, then he goes, no, he goes,

295
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:42,050
that was our guy. I forget. He
said the guy's name. He goes,

296
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:46,580
he ran for like two 95. And I said, ah,
I'm sorry, my bed that I laugh. I go,

297
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:50,000
Jesus Christ, dude, you fucking looking
at me. You went all full metal jacket.

298
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,220
And everyone just started laughing.

299
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,600
Do Ray Lewis is like the fucking
coolest guy ever. And he's still like,

300
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,670
if you saw how like hurt he was,

301
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,700
that I would ever suggest that anyone
put up close to 295 yards on a Raven's

302
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:12,590
defense that he was a part of.
Um,

303
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,090
I got to ask all those guys so many
cool questions. I actually, uh,

304
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,120
I asked Ray Lewis if he had a heart,
you know,

305
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:24,830
what's it like being one of the great
linebackers of all time watching how these

306
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:27,260
linebackers, you know, get
to just sort of, I mean,

307
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,980
it's the wide receivers just to kind
of get to skip down the damn field now.

308
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,160
And he goes, oh, he goes, I can't, I
can't, I have hard time watching. He goes,

309
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,720
I've got to take like
blood pressure medicine.

310
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,640
I'm like walking around watching the game.
So anyways,

311
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,130
where uh,

312
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,520
we're in between segments and they
actually did this segment on like how the

313
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,080
guys on defense don't know what
they can and can't get away with.

314
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:57,081
So they're playing timid and these wide
receivers and quarterbacks and running

315
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,350
backs. So having a field day out
there. So of course boomer is size,

316
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,440
then is siding with the offense and um,

317
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,490
everyone on the show was signed with
[inaudible], that's overpoliced and blah,

318
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:09,460
blah, blah, blah, blah. So anyways,

319
00:18:09,461 --> 00:18:13,200
so the segment ends and boomers
continue with the conversation. He goes,

320
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:16,230
did you see what happened to
Aaron Rodgers? And he goes to,

321
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,800
the guy came over and he pay and boomer
walks over and he goes to pick me up and

322
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:21,900
I don't know why I
should have said boomer.

323
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,200
I saw the play so he goes to pick me up.

324
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,700
But you know when you
go to pick somebody up,

325
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:29,940
what you do is you pull them in towards
you and you put the pressure of you

326
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:32,610
lifting them up across their back.
He didn't,

327
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,950
he tried to pick me up from my side and
like crush my rib cage and you just hear

328
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,490
it. I just started. You
just heard something pop on
my right side and he goes,

329
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,420
oh shit. And he put me down any and
I got, I don't know why just go.

330
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:49,140
I think that was my back and he goes,
really? It sounded like your ribs.

331
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,680
And I knew instantly that he fucked me up.
He,

332
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,540
I don't know what the fuck
he did to my obliques.

333
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,070
It's not like some lifelong shit, you
know what I mean? I'm not a millennial.

334
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,910
I'm not going to sue anybody. This is
just like four days. Epson salt bath.

335
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,613
But like,

336
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,330
I knew immediately fucked me up and
if somehow somebody sends this to him,

337
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,180
I want him to know that when
I sit here it doesn't hurt.

338
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:15,000
But I drove my car down at,
uh,

339
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,920
in alley yesterday trying to like
beat this traffic and it had all these

340
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:22,710
potholes. So like the suspension
was rocking back and forth.

341
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:25,260
So I was going side to side
and I had to use my old bleaks.

342
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,540
I was just going down
the alley going like,

343
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,890
ah, ah, ah, ah,

344
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:37,020
but I've got, cause I can laugh right now.
It's still feels fine. But uh, yeah, this,

345
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,340
you know, it would have been such
a cooler story if it was Ray Lee,

346
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,090
Ray Lewis who did it to me as opposed
to a quarterback. But here's the deal.

347
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,141
He's still like six,

348
00:19:45,141 --> 00:19:49,310
four and all of those guys have like
fucking gorilla strength and I'm just a

349
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:52,820
comedian and my baby blue sweater.
Um,

350
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,310
anyways,
so how funny is that?

351
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:59,960
I actually went on a fucking football
program with ex NFL players. Hey,

352
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:02,720
came out of there with an injury.
I'm like day to day right now.

353
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,660
I would still start on Sunday.
If we were playing football,

354
00:20:05,661 --> 00:20:08,930
they'd spray it with
something. Um, but anyways,

355
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:13,690
I had such a great time with
all of those guys and uh,

356
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,450
Ray Lewis, Nate and a boomer, I had
such a great time on that whole thing.

357
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,720
And of course B,
we were all teasing him about his haircut.

358
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,501
I don't know if it made it,

359
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:27,340
but I said he looked like count Basie
and they were trashing me for being bald

360
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:29,920
and all of that. It was just
a, I wish I lived in New York.

361
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:32,890
That's how much fun I had on that show.
Um,

362
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,670
but also I also realize like how little
football I watch when I was on there,

363
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:39,730
like when I had to pick the teams,
like I had no idea what anybody's doing.

364
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,730
You know, my daughter's crawling, she
starting to stand up at this point.

365
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,040
I mean that alone I could barely pay
attention and I was in the writer's room

366
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:52,990
and then immediately went down to the
acting gig. So, uh, my apology, I mean,

367
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,780
of all the fucking years for me to
get back on that show, the one year,

368
00:20:55,781 --> 00:20:58,900
I think next year I'm going to
get to watch a lot more. But, uh,

369
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:03,520
I was sitting there like before I went on
the show, like trying to study up, like,

370
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:07,110
you know, the day before you finally,
and you know, you're not gonna pass,

371
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,530
but you're just trying to get a
respectable flunking grade. And, uh,

372
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,410
you know,
even after all that studying,

373
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:15,910
I have no idea what the
fuck's going win it.

374
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,460
I know the eagles and the rams are
doing well as a, the Vikings and,

375
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,630
uh, and even though the Patriots has
72, I never believe in our defense.

376
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:29,830
I just don't think we get enough pressure
on the fucking quarterback. And, uh,

377
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,490
they seem to be able to do pretty
well against our secondary this year.

378
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:35,440
So we'll see. I don't know. But anyways,

379
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:40,180
thank you to everybody over there for
having me on inside the NFL. Please, uh,

380
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,830
watch it. This week, uh,

381
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:45,760
Nate gave me shit about deflate gate and
I of course took the bait. Once again,

382
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:50,530
I always take the bait. I should've just
been like, hey man, you know, fucking,

383
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,480
I got five reasons to not get upset
holding up all five fingers for the five

384
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,800
rings we got. And I never thought
to do that. I immediately quit.

385
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,121
Um,
so anyways,

386
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:05,680
so I did the fucking show and
then immediately I went down to a,

387
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:10,090
I went right to the airport because
I wanted to see, uh, get onto my fam,

388
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,390
my family over my family bank,
west out west.

389
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,450
You go back east and you go out west and,
uh,

390
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:21,990
I get to Newark Airport and I'm hungry
and I quickly realized there's no way to

391
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:26,260
get food in the air. I flew United
in the entire fucking terminal.

392
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:29,140
When you showed up,
wherever you went to sit down to eat,

393
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,320
if there's any sort of sit down and
eating, you had to be your own waiter.

394
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,430
You had to interact with this fucking
iPad. And the second I sit down,

395
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:40,180
I'm looking at my face on the screen.
I'm like, what the fuck is this?

396
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,550
So I cover the camera with my
wallet and the lady comes out right.

397
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,170
Do you know how to use it? I'm
like, I'm not a waiter sweetheart.

398
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,470
I don't work at this restaurant. Why
am I being, why don't I'm, you know,

399
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,760
and I was being a dick to
her and everything. Um, in
the end I tipped her in cash.

400
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:57,940
So I did. I said, listen,
I'm not upset with you.

401
00:22:57,941 --> 00:23:02,080
I'm just upset with his fucking apparatus
here. I like human beings. Okay.

402
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,270
And I don't like this thing,
you know, filming me here.

403
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,000
Cause that's that filming you. It's just
going to take a picture, your ticket.

404
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:10,810
It's like, what the fuck does Wendy's
give a fuck about what airline?

405
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:14,500
I'm flying on you gathering information
and you have to sit there and act like

406
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:15,850
this thing isn't filming me.

407
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,300
They're going to be like white
male looks to be about this.

408
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:23,560
A old ordered the fried chicken sandwich
and they're gonna use, just take it.

409
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,860
They're just constantly sucking this
fucking information out about you.

410
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,640
So I'm just sit down,

411
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:35,020
don't scan your fucking ticket.
Um,

412
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,410
they're gonna use all that
information like, oh no, we're
just trying to, you know,

413
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,340
if it's getting too close in your, your,
your plane is boarding and blah, blah,

414
00:23:42,341 --> 00:23:45,320
blah. They're not, that's what they're
doing on one side. But on the other side,

415
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,190
they're figuring out what race, what
sex, what you ordered, where you live,

416
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,360
how you dressed,

417
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:55,190
all of this fucking information so you
can get bombarded with even more fucking,

418
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,930
uh, you know, I don't know,
even more advertising. However,

419
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:01,970
if you just committed a
murder and you think that,

420
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:03,620
you know by them filming you there,

421
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:06,740
and that's a good alibi than bought
by all means, don't cover it. But, um,

422
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,540
I don't know if the whole thing
is fucking annoying to me.

423
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,120
And next time I go to Newark Airport,

424

can to see if I remember how to do it.

490
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:19,290
But I've been hitting the
practice pad pretty hard. Um,

491
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:23,960
getting back to taking some lessons.
Um, I'm going to be that fucking guy. I,

be able to do on drums. All right?

493
00:28:26,131 --> 00:28:29,040

547
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:52,960
I'll tell you why because for some fucking
reason I have been gone. I've been,

548
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,840
I've been going to sleep like a little
old lady this week, you know you have,

549
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:00,980
but just to get in one of those weird
sleep patterns where a right after the

550
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:05,210
evening news, you know, you
watch a little bit of jeopardy,

551
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,760
you slip off your loafers.

552
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,050
So you sit there on the Davenport.

553
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,110
Trying to think of some fucking old
people terms here. I don't know.

554

And I've been going to
bed like at nine 30,

555
00:32:16,911 --> 00:32:20,930
10 and then I've been getting up at
six in the morning like a farmer,

556
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,650
you know, like a farmer. I just said that,

somebody told me to rent that,

566
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:04,010
that a documentary food inc and let me
tell you, it was very, very interesting.

567
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:08,320
Very interesting to see where
the food comes from and uh,

568
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:13,330
what exactly goes on to the food
before the food gets to my table and a,

569
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:17,810
which is why this morning I want, I got
up so early to go to a farmer's market.

570
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,030
I wanted to go where the, uh, with
the local guys make it, you know,

571
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,030
where they let the chickens run
free before they murder them.

572
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,910
This is a free range chicken.

573
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,920
It had up fucking wonderful seven weeks
on this planet before we stuck it in a

574
00:33:38,161 --> 00:33:42,510
funnel and sliced it throat actually
had video of how they kill the chickens.

575
00:33:42,511 --> 00:33:45,080
That's what they stick them in.
These little, uh, the, the, the,

576
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:49,800
the down home farmers, the regular old
farmer who hasn't given into the man dude,

577
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,990
um,
they got like a,

578
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:57,830
you ever see like those fancy Baker's
right as opposed to the blue collar bakers

579
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:02,040
who got those fat little
thumbs. Um, the fancy Baker's,

580
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,990
when they go to make
one of those, those, uh,

581
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,160
cakes for some fancy fucking douche
bag who's probably a slumlord, right?

582
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,230
You know, when they go to put
the frosting on, you know,

583
00:34:10,231 --> 00:34:13,830
that little fucking reverse
trumpet thing that they use.

584
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,810
Why am I going so far? Look at, do you
remember? You have a seat back in the day,

585
00:34:18,811 --> 00:34:22,490
the original football games when
they're like, Rah Rah, shh. Just by

586
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:27,990
[inaudible] that little fucking,
that little fucking funnel thing,

587
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,770
it had a handle on it.
I know.

588
00:34:31,771 --> 00:34:34,550
You guys know what I'm talking about
where they have those and they,

589
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:35,940
they have like the part,

590
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:39,570
you know the part where you yell
into that's on that would be like,

591
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,880
oh Jesus, how can I explain this picture?
If you had one of those Rah Rah sis,

592
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:45,300
boom,

593
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,900
buy things right and you wanted to yell
up to the heavens and you fucking cock

594
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,800
and neck back and the thing
was going straight up.

595
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,980
That's the way they have these things.
And they have them in a circle, like,

596
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,440
like 10 silver ones.

597
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:03,441
And they take these chickens
and [inaudible] and they
fucking stick them in head

598
00:35:03,571 --> 00:35:07,890
first. So they go right down the fucking
funnel and then that little chicken had

599
00:35:07,891 --> 00:35:11,970
sticking out the bottom and they're like
all and then they fucking sliced their

600
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:13,080
throat and they bleed them out.

601
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,330
That's how they do it on the
regular little farms. That's
how they do it. And uh,

602
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,080
the other ones more industrial once
they don't quite do it that way.

603
00:35:22,081 --> 00:35:24,840
So Watch our food inc,
check it out. Um, you know,

604
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:29,580
at the end it's a bunch of fucking
dead animals. But uh, I dunno,

605
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:34,560
I like clean food. Call me crazy.
But I like clean foods. So anyways,

606
00:35:34,561 --> 00:35:36,480
I was supposed to get up,
you know, early this morning,

607
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,330
I've been excited all this
week cause you know me,

608
00:35:39,331 --> 00:35:42,450
I see one little thing that says
a corporation is fucking me over.

609
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,450
And then that becomes my
quest for that week. You know,

610
00:35:45,451 --> 00:35:49,050
it's why I don't talk on my cell phone
anymore. It's why I don't trust banks.

611
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,360
It's why I'm not a Democrat or Republican.

612
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,830
It all comes down to some fucking
video that some fat fuck living in his

613
00:35:55,831 --> 00:36:00,030
mother's basement has made. And I just
take it as law. That's how I do it. Okay.

614
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,950
And,
um,

615
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,130
so the whole week I've been obsessed with
going to the fucking farmer's market.

616
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,760
Every day I've been going,
well going right, we're going.

617
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:11,010
And finally yesterday my girl couldn't
take anymore. And she's like, yes,

618
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,910
but going, you know, and they get that.
Okay. They get like that fucking uh,

619
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:22,340
tone in their voice and I was just like,
what I do, she was my immediate thought.

620
00:36:22,341 --> 00:36:24,470
I just turned around and
walked out because, uh,

621
00:36:24,471 --> 00:36:27,710
you can't slap them even though
they deserve it sometimes.

622
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,720
At least she could throw something at him,
you know,

623
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:34,790
something that's inbetween nerf in
a blunt object. What would that be?

624
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,840
You know, beyond a pillow but
not quite the refrigerator door.

625
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,990
How about a soft covered book isn't that,

626
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,610
and you know, Frisbee it Adam, cause
that might catch the corner in their eye.

627
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,240
What you do is you sort of lob it at him,
you know,

628
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:58,390
like a Robert Parish foul shot,
half that, not the rainbow,

629
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,510
sort of like a half rainbow, you
know, and it just lands on them.

630
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,990
The fucking meaty part of their
thigh makes that nice slap sound. Um,

631
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,980
anyways. Yeah. So she annoys the shit
out of me. Right? Well again, a got okay.

632
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,690
They typical broad acting like I'm
being a fucking Douche bag. Right.

633
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,100
And what happens this morning?

634
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,460
She's fucking sleeping like boxcar
Willie until like 11 in the morning.

635
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,420
And she clearly told me like fucking
months ago that you have to get over there

636
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,730
early because if you don't
get over there early enough,

637
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:33,170
there's just gonna be a
bunch of strawberries laying
on the sidewalk, you know,

638
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,050
so she finally gets up, right.
You're finally gets up around,

639
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,550
she's in the other room,
so you have to whisper here.

640
00:37:37,551 --> 00:37:39,290
She finally gets up around fucking 11.

641
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:40,920
Yeah.

642
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,340
You know, I'll all sleepy. And she's
like, and she knows she fucked up.

643
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,890
She knows it. I know it. The
downstairs neighbor knows it.

644
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,610
Everybody knows she's fucked up. Why did
she fuck up? Because she overslept now.

645
00:37:52,611 --> 00:37:56,420
She fucked up cause she was a Douche
the day before acting like I was

646
00:37:56,421 --> 00:38:00,140
overreacting like that way. We got
a fucking Gal. And what does she do?

647
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,453
She goes out,

648
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,270
she has a couple of pops and next thing
you know she sleeps till fucking 11 all

649
00:38:06,271 --> 00:38:09,750
right. And you'd probably be like, well
bill, why didn't you go in their wake?

650
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,280
Wake her up. Oh, I'll tell you why.

651
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,570
Because she's been breaking my balls
about how I keep going to bed at nine 30

652
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,680
and then I start puttering around like
some war veteran at five in the morning,

653
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:20,730
this whole fucking week.

654
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:25,260
So I let her sleep thinking maybe she
get up at night and maybe she get up at

655
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,710
nine 30 maybe 10 at 10 I just said,
you know what? Who gives a fuck?

656
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:29,860
Yeah.

657
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,490
I haven't eaten corn fed beef for the
law my whole fucking life. You know,

658
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,400
I'm still walking around. I'll do it
for week. Who gives a shit? Right.

659
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,200
Since she wakes up 11 she's
a, Hey Stan. I said, okay God,

660
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:45,160
he's still gonna go to the fire is bad
again. And I was like, no, no we're not.

661
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:50,200
She's like, why not? I go, cause
you told me all this shit was uh,

662
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,090
is gone if you don't get there early,

663
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:56,140
so why do I want to go over there and
now I also like going over there earlier

664
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,860
because I'm a redhead and we live in a
desert and I don't feel like standing out

665
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:03,310
in the middle of the fucking street
at 11 o'clock in the morning.

666
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,450
Plus the football games are already on.
So then what does she do?

667
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:11,860
You know, the typical codependent shit.
She keeps trying to get me to go with her.

668
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,940
Well, there's still going to be
some stuff left. They'll have Kale,

669
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,640
they'll have some broccoli.
Yeah. I don't give a shit.

670
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,700
I was going over there for the meat.
That's what, that's what I was doing.

671
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,190
So you can't come with me.
No.

672
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,180
Aaron Sealey can come with me.

673
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,720
That fucking nightmare and
I just refuse to fucking go.

674
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,410
I'd gotten on with my day.
I started paying my bills for Monday.

675
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:39,840
I was going to do the podcast, I'm
going to go fucking workout. And uh,

676
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:43,090
of course the second I started this
podcast, who comes walking in the door,

677
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:48,340
my girl comes walking in and informs
me that there was still plenty of shit

678
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:50,440
left,
which is still not my fault.

679
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:54,160
I went by her information that nothing
would be left and for all I know she's

680
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:58,840
fucking lion. You know, there was plenty
of stuff left. He could have come with me,

681
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:04,150
asshole. Um, so that's been
my fucking morning. Um,

682
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,340
and I also realized that my fucking
patriots don't play until eight o'clock at

683
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:11,880
night, which is five o'clock
out here at five 30. So,

684
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,140
so I had nothing better to do.

685
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,590
I decided I'd do a fucking podcast rather
than sitting here doing nothing when

686
00:40:17,591 --> 00:40:19,510
she came home because then she
could have been like, well,

687
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:24,160
why didn't she come with
me? Um, anyways, uh, let's,

688
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:28,660
this is the Monday morning podcast.
Did any of that make any fucking sense?

689
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,740
What does that just a classic
boring fucking relationship story?

690
00:40:32,741 --> 00:40:36,460
Did I just bore you for fucking nine
minutes and 33 seconds? Well, I hope you,

691
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:39,790
I hope I did because I been getting
too many complaints about the fucking

692
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,930
podcast lately. I liked it back in
the day. You are more angrier, Bill,

693
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,790
do it on your cell phone again.

694
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,980
You know whoever's wrote me that,
you know, what did you use to do?

695
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,090
Why don't you go do that?

696
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:55,840
Why don't you stop evolving as a fucking
human being and just do it the way you

697
00:40:55,841 --> 00:40:59,980
did it two years ago where the same
fucking shirt. You know what I mean?

698
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:04,270
You want it the exact same way.
Every fuck enough.

699
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,920
Hey fucking idiots, dude.
I like the new stuff.

700
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:11,170
I like their first two albums.
I don't like that.

701
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,710
I don't like when they changed and you're
like, people were into bands like that,

702
00:41:14,711 --> 00:41:17,050
like people were into like
fucking youtube. You know?

703
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,340
People just can't fucking respect for
the fact that that they've continued to

704
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:25,090
fucking evolve and put out
killer songs changed their sound,

705
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:29,260
come back to their sound,
divert from it become huge.

706
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:30,970
Rockstars mock being huge.

707
00:41:30,971 --> 00:41:35,150
Rock stars always coming up with a new
way to make it a little bit different.

708
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:39,800
There always has to be that fucking
douchebag going. I liked it back.

709
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,850
I only liked him.

710
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:46,040
I liked him up until war or
boy or whatever the name of
their fucking albums are.

711
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:46,880
I don't even remember.

712
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:50,990
I remember that one that had that
fucking creepy looking kid, you know,

713
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:55,280
looks like the poster for the grudge
like 20 years before it fucking came out.

714
00:41:55,281 --> 00:41:56,690
Like there's always people like that.

715
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,420
Yeah.

716
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:03,420
Granted there are bands that evolve and
then they suck like Jefferson airplane

717
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:06,610
when they became Jefferson Star ship.
But I,

718
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:11,630
I challenge you to find anything in the
u two catalog that comes anywhere near

719
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,330
sucking to the level of,
we built this city on rock and roll.

720
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,010
That is one of the worst.

721
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,280
Okay.

722
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,113
Everything,

723
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,050
you know that they like when they show
some of the worst dictators and I'm

724
00:42:26,051 --> 00:42:28,540
really trying to avoid you say
Adolf Hitler because he becomes,

725
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:32,680
he's become like the hacky reference
when you talk about evil, you know,

726
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,530
and I really think that that guy is a,

727
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,460
and a lot of ways overrated when you look
at is number of kills verse Stalin's.

728
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:44,800
Okay. I've talked about this before.
Stalin has 20 million confirmed kills.

729
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,220
Okay.
That's fucking like what?

730
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,220
14 million more.

731
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:57,510
14 million more than Hitler
and about fucking 19 million.

732
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:04,010
900,000
more than fucking Rambo.

733
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,750
Okay. Um, I'm, you know what? I'm
good. That's my, that's my thing.

734
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:13,751
That's what that's going
to be my contribution to
conversation in fucking dinner

735
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,300
parties. You know, I'm going to
start going to those, by the way,

736
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:19,670
I'm going to get a smoking jacket and
all that. And then when people go like,

737
00:43:19,671 --> 00:43:23,960
oh my God, he's like the next Hitler
and I mean, now he's the next styling.

738
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:25,680
Yeah.

739
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,630
Who is that? I don't know who the fuck
that. Of course you don't get dumb. Fuck.

740
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,270
You probably know. You know
what Hitler did. Do you,

741
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,120
are you just sputtering fucking
spout in the shit out the way?

742
00:43:34,121 --> 00:43:38,950
I do every week on the podcast. You
dumb fuck I'm speaking of which this is,

743
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:41,560
this is a new part of the
podcast. It's, it's as the bills,

744
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:45,790
dumb bill's dumped quote of the week.
Um,

745
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,500
I had a bunch of people,
um,

746
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:52,510
correct me on something that I have been
saying for years. I used the expression,

747
00:43:52,511 --> 00:43:57,511
I said for all extensive purposes and
somebody wrote for all extensive purposes.

748
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,410
It's not,
um,

749
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:04,270
you don't say it that way and you don't
say it the way most other people say all

750
00:44:04,271 --> 00:44:05,740
intensive purposes.

751
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:09,610
It's actually for all intents and purposes

752
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,760
you like that most people say for all
intensive purposes when they fuck it up,

753
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,640
Bill Burr took it to a whole new level
of stupid and said for all extensive

754
00:44:21,641 --> 00:44:22,474
purposes.

755
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,030
Yeah,

756
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:28,890
I do that all the time. I
say there's something else
I say it has to do with, ah,

757
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,310
what the fuck is it the beginning of
your college year when you're a freshman?

758
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,540
Ah, Jeez. My memory is just fucking shot.

759
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,690
I used to always work those things
as a stand up comic. He'd come in,

760
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,040
it'd be like the first, ah, why
do I keep thinking salutation?

761
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:49,170
That's not what it is.
I know it begins with an s though.

762
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:55,310
Oh,
this happens to me like 20 times a day.

763
00:44:55,311 --> 00:44:58,460
Is it some sort of fish that I can
be eating to help me with this?

764
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:00,680
I used to do the gigs every year,

765
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,440
the beginning of the year and coming
freshman gigs. You'd come in and they,

766
00:45:03,441 --> 00:45:07,940
we sit in there with their parents and
my college age, it'll be like, uh, uh,

767
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:11,540
Billy we got, uh, we got,
I got a Gig for, yeah,

768
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:14,550
the parents are going to be there
so it makes sure you don't say fuck

769
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,910
God damn it. I forget.
But whatever I used to,

770
00:45:18,911 --> 00:45:23,350
I used to fuck that word up
all the time. Um, so whatever.

771
00:45:23,351 --> 00:45:26,290
So I learned something.
It's for all intents and purposes,

772
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:32,110
I used to say Pelo instead of pillow,
p. E. L. L. O, I'm a fucking moron.

773
00:45:32,111 --> 00:45:34,120
And I don't know why you guys,
you know what? You assholes.

774
00:45:34,121 --> 00:45:37,560
I know why you listen to me. You listen
to me because my level of stupidity,

775
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,390
he makes you feel better about
yourself, doesn't it? Huh?

776
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,660
What does that say about you?
You fucking whores.

777
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,770
See how I got out of that by trying
to blame you. That's, that's it.

778
00:45:47,771 --> 00:45:51,430
That's a technique I use in my arguing.
Um, but it hasn't, it wasn't all bad.

779
00:45:51,431 --> 00:45:55,780
I actually got, I got some thanks
last week from a, from a hormone.

780
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:00,570
It said Bill. Um, you were
wondering if there are any, ah,

781
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,290
Jesus Christ.
I fucking,

782
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:08,490
I copied and pasted the wrong
one here. This isn't from
a woman. Listen, this bill,

783
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:10,380
uh,
you were wondering if there were,

784
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:12,630
there are any Jews that
listened to your podcast.

785
00:46:12,631 --> 00:46:16,410
There are Jews who listened to your
podcast. I am one of them. And in fact,

786
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,160
an Orthodox Jew. I'm not
Hasidic, I'm not a Hasidic Jew,

787
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:23,610
but it's the same thing without
the curls. Dude, that's bullshit.

788
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:27,770
There's got to be something more than
that. I know you just made a joke there.

789
00:46:27,771 --> 00:46:31,310
What is the difference between an
Orthodox Jew and a Hasidic Jew? I know.

790
00:46:31,311 --> 00:46:31,960
I could fucking

791
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,120
Google that right now and get
some other morons. Fucking not,

792
00:46:35,121 --> 00:46:36,550
I'm not saying you're a moron,
you know what I mean?

793
00:46:36,551 --> 00:46:40,450
Just get some morons
version of what that is. Um,

794
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:45,970
what was the name of that place I used
to go to down on ninth avenue and it was

795
00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:50,860
a best electronic store, uh,
and fucking New York Jr's,

796
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:52,601
something like that.

797
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:56,560
It was like a block over from Madison
Square Garden at where are they now?

798
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:59,650
Those guys or those guys?
Orthodox Jews are they Hasidic Jews?

799
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,810
I don't know what they were,
but they were the shit.

800
00:47:01,811 --> 00:47:03,700
They knew about everything and uh,

801
00:47:03,701 --> 00:47:07,420
they had great prices and they weren't
open on Sundays and I respected that.

802
00:47:07,421 --> 00:47:08,830
You know,
somebody still doing it.

803
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:13,120
The little house on the prairie
way observing the sabbath.

804
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:18,160
That's one of the worst things that
we've done as a culture as far as getting

805
00:47:18,161 --> 00:47:21,970
away from religion is we got,
we got away from a fucking day off.

806
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:26,860
You know, this is how old I am. I remember
when fucking malls and all that shit,

807
00:47:26,861 --> 00:47:30,100
we're closed on Sundays.
You buy liquor.

808
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,280
Is that still true? Can you still
not by luck, he couldn't buy bear.

809
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:34,540
You couldn't fucking do anything.

810
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:38,860
He just had to sit there and think about
why God was going to send you to hell,

811
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:42,400
you know?
But at least you weren't working.

812
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,150
Do you guys remember that little house
in the prairie episode where fucking, uh,

813
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:46,931
uh,

814
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:50,410
Michael Landon was busting his ass all
week and then they had to go to church on

815
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:54,490
Sunday and he was so fucking tardy,
fell asleep in his church clothes.

816
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:58,000
And the mother looked at him
and he's like, should I wake
them up? And she's like,

817
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:01,990
God, no, he's sleeping like an angel. God
wouldn't want me to bring them to church.

818
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,540
He eat. He should. This is a day of rest.

819
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:08,620
He's resting like the Lord after
six days of creating a universe.

820
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,420
So the bitch goes to church,

821
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,670
she goes to church,
and when she comes back,

822
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:20,700
this asshole woke up from his little
slumber and he was outside with an ox and

823
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:23,500
he was plowing the fields again
and all did she get mad at him?

824
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,620
She really got mad at
him. And, uh, then that,

825
00:48:27,621 --> 00:48:31,240
that little girl is skipped down the hill
and she fell into some shrubs and that

826
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,970
was the end of it. And that was another
episode of Little House on the prairie.

827
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:37,510
Let's continue on with the
orthodox Jewish person's email.

828
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,360
Cause last week I was talking
about a beanie. Is that,

829
00:48:40,361 --> 00:48:41,890
is that offensive or whatever he said,

830
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:46,800
I wanted to let you know that there
is essentially the Yamaka. Um,

831
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:50,350
and yes, there is an r in there. Um,

832
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:54,430
but it's sort of silent is a
skullcap as opposed to a beanie,

833
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:58,060
which you were sort of confused about.
Sort of confused.

834
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:01,750
You'd be in Nice here I'm
calling it a beanie. Uh,

835
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,450
should not insult anyone.
It's almost the same thing.

836
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,750
What is the pope were technically,
it's called a,

837
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:13,060
I can't even read what the w Z.
Kevo. Zee you see c. H. E. T. T.

838
00:49:13,061 --> 00:49:17,680
O m also means skullcap.
Um,

839
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:22,710
the real meaning of the
Yamaka is Yar fear of Maca.

840
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:27,930
The king and exciting signifies that
there is someone up above and that we are

841
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:33,610
limited moral beings. Well,
what do you mean it's sick?

842
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,473
Okay.

843
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:35,900
Yeah.

844
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:40,250
Doesn't it really signify that there's
someone above that you should be scared?

845
00:49:40,251 --> 00:49:42,570
Shit of and that we're limited debts.
Easy.

846
00:49:42,571 --> 00:49:46,970
That's the thing that I never liked about
organized religion is the bully factor.

847
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:51,380
I can, it's just like, why is this
guy, how is God already mad at me?

848
00:49:51,381 --> 00:49:53,900
I'm six years old.
You know what I mean?

849
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,370
It just created like if you
believe in this higher power,

850
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:03,260
it's just fucking angry. Douchebag always
looking down at you. Pissed off at you.

851
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:07,460
You know what I mean? Why are you
fucking mad at me? You made me,

852
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:11,510
you know what I mean? If I fucking built
a car from ground up and it didn't run,

853
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:15,080
didn't run correctly,
who the fuck am I going to blame the car?

854
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,080
That doesn't make any sense.
Did what I just say make any sense?

855
00:50:20,081 --> 00:50:22,330
I don't fucking know where I
like to just finish this. Um,

856
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:27,590
also you mentioned how the guy on the
plane was wearing a Yamaka so big.

857
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:31,460
You weren't sure if it was a hat
or some sort of giant Yamaka.

858
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:32,720
I totally agree with you.

859
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:37,430
I wear a normal size Yamaka and am a
little annoyed even when someone wears one

860
00:50:37,431 --> 00:50:42,290
so big that it covers their whole head
almost like a hat, but to each his own,

861
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:43,124
I guess.

862
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,600
Um, anyways, a big fan of your
comedy and your podcasts. Uh,

863
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:50,750
well thank you for listening. I
appreciate that. You know what?

864
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:55,190
I actually have a theory on
those big time. Yamakas I
think that that is the, uh,

865
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:00,140
that's the poor man's toupee after a
while because if you're going bald in the

866
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:02,210
back, you start to lose
it in the back like I am.

867
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:08,170
I'm a Yamaka is great because at buys
you another three years of people not

868
00:51:09,531 --> 00:51:10,820
knowing that you're losing your hair.

869
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:13,570
Okay.

870
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:13,751
See,

871
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:16,870
a lot of people don't realize that Sammy
Davis Jr was actually losing a little

872
00:51:16,871 --> 00:51:19,900
bit of his Afro and that's
why he converted to Judaism.

873
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:23,380
A lot of people thought it was a, it
was a show business move, but it wasn't,

874
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,000
he was going bald. You're
here to, you heard it here
first. So now I'm fascinated.

875
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:31,870
What is the difference between an
Orthodox Jewish person in a Hasidic Jew?

876
00:51:31,871 --> 00:51:36,100
What is the difference? And also,
do you believe in an afterlife?

877
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:39,190
Do you believe that God is mad at you?

878
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:43,870
What are the Catholic Shit that I learned?
Um,

879
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,420
can you eat a cheeseburger on Friday?

880
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:52,410
Yeah.

881
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:56,100
And I know like all religions,
you consider yourselves 100% right?

882
00:51:56,101 --> 00:52:00,270
And the chosen ones, do you guys have
the Notre Dame? God loves us best.

883
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:05,070
You know, do you have that to that
disease that is in every fucking religion?

884
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,640
You shouldn't kill anyone,
but God loves us the best.

885
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:11,370
And anyone who doesn't believe what
we believe, it's going to hell.

886
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:13,170
Have a great week everybody.

887
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,260
Be sure to pass that on to
people who don't believe in us.

888
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:19,350
Why does every character my
fucking act talk like that?

889
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:21,510
Yeah.

890
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:26,370
What did the priests used to sound
like at my church? Hey, how you doing?

891
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:31,500
Hey look, I'm pretty good in that outfit.
Go ahead. Lifted up a little bit. Um,

892
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,400
thank you. That was my impression
of a Catholic priest. All right.

893
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,570
I've been doing a lot of ranting and
raving on this podcast. People, um,

894
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:42,970
talking about those little save,
you know,

895
00:52:42,971 --> 00:52:45,400
those little scan cards
at the grocery store.

896
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:50,680
And somebody told me that what you're
actually doing is taking a survey and a,

897
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:50,951
you know,

898
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:53,620
to help them figure out what products
you can't live without so they can jack

899
00:52:53,621 --> 00:52:56,800
the price up.
And I've actually taken that as law.

900
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,500
So this is somebody I've had
a bunch of different theories.

901
00:52:59,501 --> 00:53:01,180
There's another theory.
Um,

902
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,440
a couple of weeks ago you brought up the,
uh,

903
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,430
Saber cards at the store and is wondering
what the purpose of you are wondering

904
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,560
what the purpose of them was.
Um,

905
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:11,920
you speculated that it was so they knew
what you were buying to jack up the

906
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:15,310
prices. But with the Bard
Chords, Barre chords scanning,

907
00:53:15,311 --> 00:53:18,940
they already know how much inventory they
move and what sells better than other

908
00:53:18,941 --> 00:53:21,820
things. The purpose of the car
is to gather your information,

909
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:26,220
to sell it to mailing lists,
who then send you junk mail

910
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,790
or spam. Since they always
ask for an email address,

911
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:33,900
they also can be used as an incentive to
keep you going to the store instead of

912
00:53:33,901 --> 00:53:37,920
a competitor. I, he going to
Macy's instead of JC penny's. Uh,

913
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:41,800
they give you the discount without the
cart occasionally so you can be learned

914
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:45,180
into saving 10% or so every time you go
there so they can eventually get your

915
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:49,500
information. Um, hey, your guests good
as mine. I don't know what they're up to,

916
00:53:49,501 --> 00:53:53,850
but I also noticed that most of the shit
that's on sale is there bootleg version

917
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,960
of the real shit. You know what
I mean? Like Ralph's olive oil,

918
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:02,430
you know, I've noticed that,
uh, that's another great
way. Like they could be like,

919
00:54:02,431 --> 00:54:06,420
okay, we're selling the food.
What if we made it also, you know,

920
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:09,030
and had our own fucking farms.
I Dunno. I just don't like,

921
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:12,390
I don't trust people who are going out
of their way to give me a fucking break.

922
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,220
I don't,
you know what I mean?

923
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:15,670
Yeah.

924
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:18,460
That's like the fucking
Andrew Carnegie kind of like,

925
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:20,230
yeah,

926
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:22,690
when you're doing shit, you know,
you fuck people over your whole life.

927
00:54:22,691 --> 00:54:23,560
And then the NTL life,

928
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:26,530
you're worried that maybe really
there is a god and then you become a

929
00:54:26,531 --> 00:54:29,650
philanthropist and you start
giving you shit away. Fuck you.

930
00:54:29,651 --> 00:54:32,230
You sit there with your guilt.
I'll pay full price for the peanut butter.

931
00:54:32,231 --> 00:54:34,600
Thank you very much. All
right, another theory.

932
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,260
Um, uh, what the fuck is this one?

933
00:54:38,261 --> 00:54:41,770
This guy says I'm a software engineer
who finished working for a company that

934
00:54:41,771 --> 00:54:45,670
stores and reports on all
sorts of insane sales data.

935
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,590
Some examples of that type of data.

936
00:54:47,591 --> 00:54:52,140
They can gather a sales of
products based on ethnicity. Yeah.

937
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:55,120
See this is why I think they also want
the car cause it's not enough to know all

938
00:54:55,121 --> 00:54:59,560
we sold 20 boxes of fruit loops.
They want to know was it a guy,

939
00:54:59,561 --> 00:55:04,510
was it a fucking girl? How
old were they? What color?

940
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:10,420
Um, the main data I saw on this kind
was defined as Hispanic or non Hispanic.

941
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,820
And I guess that's sales
based on ethnicity. Um,

942
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:16,210
this is a guy who gathers this data.

943
00:55:16,211 --> 00:55:19,210
I guess he says if there is a
floor display in some store,

944
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:23,590
what is the effect on the sales
of the item while it the display

945
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,173
what

946
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,650
I'm the worst?
If there was a floor display in the store,

947
00:55:29,651 --> 00:55:33,970
what is the effect on sales of that
item while the display is present?

948
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:38,650
Let's say for example, there was a
NASCAR event sponsored by Coca Cola.

949
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:43,840
They keep track of coke sales in that
region around the time of that event.

950
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:47,830
Furthermore, they analyze if the cost
of sponsoring this event made it,

951
00:55:47,831 --> 00:55:51,820
that made them enough money to profit
to make it worthwhile sponsoring similar

952
00:55:51,821 --> 00:55:52,630
events.

953
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:56,740
This is just a small portion of wacky
shit that they update weekly that was

954
00:55:56,741 --> 00:56:00,580
written in capital letters weekly. I
guess that's important. Weekly. Um,

955
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:04,360
they know every single damn item that
was moved out of each and every store

956
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,150
every single week.
So basically the stores with the savvy,

957
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,570
the savvy saved cards
get two huge benefits.

958
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:15,250
They sell this data to my old company
to make money and they let the consumer

959
00:56:15,251 --> 00:56:16,061
feel as they got,

960
00:56:16,061 --> 00:56:20,770
they have some kind of superhuman power
to save 40 cents when they buy three

961
00:56:20,771 --> 00:56:24,280
gallons of milk in one visit.
So there you go.

962
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:26,170
I don't know you're helping
them gather information.

963
00:56:26,171 --> 00:56:31,160
I don't like the fucking pricks
so I'm not using one. Um,

964
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:35,290
all right, now let's get to the meat
of the podcast here. People, shall we,

965
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:39,280
I'm doing this on a football fucking
Sunday right now cause I could give a shit

966
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,160
about other teams in a league right now.

967
00:56:42,161 --> 00:56:44,830
All I give a fuck about
right now is my patriots.

968
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,620
And it's basically because I've watched
so much fucking hockey this week that

969
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:51,710
I'm kind of all, I'm done
with sports. I watched,

970
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:56,240
I was flipping back and
forth between the Ohio state,

971
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,480
Iowa Hawkeyes game this week.

972
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:04,600
And I was also flipping back between
that and the USC Stanford Game and Jesus

973
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:06,950
Christ.

974
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:11,950
How about a moment of silence for the
fucking fans of the USC Trojans who went

975
00:57:13,731 --> 00:57:18,440
out to see that? I mean that
was our fucking ass rape.
And you guys took, you know,

976
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,810
and I'll tell you right now,
Trojan fans,

977
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:25,990
you have no fucking right getting mad
at Jim Harbaugh for going for two point,

978
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,860
let me, let me, let
me, let me set this up.

979
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:33,280
Basically Stanford was up 48 to 21 for
those of you overseas usually just kick

980
00:57:36,331 --> 00:57:37,170
an extra point,

981
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:41,830
right to make it 49 or you can
go for a two point in version.

982
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:45,930
There's no reason to go for a two point
conversion when there's six minutes left

983
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:50,520
and you're up by four or five scores and
they went for it and the crowd started

984
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,820
bowing and um,
you know,

985
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,970
you got gotta understand you
guys USC for the last five years,

986
00:57:56,971 --> 00:58:01,380
you have been raping everyone in the
pack 10 you're bent him over you, I mean,

987
00:58:01,381 --> 00:58:06,381
how many times did you guys score a 50
60 points sent the other team crying on

988
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,670
that little team bus, send
them home crying, right?

989
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:12,840
Well what goes around comes around.
And a,

990
00:58:12,841 --> 00:58:15,510
I became a huge Stanford
and Jim Harbaugh Fan,

991
00:58:15,511 --> 00:58:18,690
but the fact that he went for two
points and then he also, in the end,

992
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:21,150
they got the ball back again
and he went for the end zone.

993
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:23,610
The end up winning 55 to 21.

994
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:29,070
Jim Harbaugh was trying to literally
end the football program at USC.

995
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:32,040
Uh,
it was one of the most vengeful back,

996
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:34,690
the biggest acts of vengeance
I've seen in sports in awhile.

997
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,740
I fucking loved every second of it.
Um,

998
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:43,440
and I was also watching the, uh,
the Osu, uh, Iowa Hawkeyes game.

999
00:58:43,441 --> 00:58:46,320
And those are the fans of the podcast
know that my new tradition is I go to the

1000
00:58:46,321 --> 00:58:49,230
rose bowl every year. So both
of those games were huge. I was,

1001
00:58:49,231 --> 00:58:53,580
I know I really didn't want to see
USC again. Mainly because, you know,

1002
00:58:53,581 --> 00:58:57,780
I like variety. And that fat cunt from
La last year's game was a USC fan,

1003
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,650
so I'm happy that she had a miserable day.
You know,

1004
00:59:01,651 --> 00:59:04,230
she probably didn't know
100%. She probably, you know,

1005
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:08,880
I had a dozen donuts in front of her,
so it wasn't a total loss. Really. Bill,

1006
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:13,860
11 months later, you're still giving a
shit about our weight. Yeah, I am. Um,

1007
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:18,950
and then Iowa, you know that
fucking quarterback for Iowa,

1008
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:22,010
that kid's 19 years old.
I'll tell you all you

1009
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:25,010
longhorn fan sitting there
talking about that Colt Mccoy,

1010
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,670
that kid at Iowa's was,
those are the fucking plays.

1011
00:59:28,671 --> 00:59:31,820
Those are the passes you have to make
to make it onto the fucking pros.

1012
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:32,961
All right?

1013
00:59:32,961 --> 00:59:37,040
You have to throw the same kind of
throws that they throw at the NFL level.

1014
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:41,420
You can't be running the fucking option
and gain in like 150 yards a game and

1015
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:45,590
then also throwing for 200 no one gives
a fuck the second you start running.

1016
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,010
Watch Tim Teebo watch that guy.
When he goes into the draft,

1017
00:59:49,011 --> 00:59:53,900
that guy is going to be like,
I sweat if he goes in the second round,

1018
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:54,950
it's not going to surprise me.

1019
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:00,250
He's a tight end playing fucking,
you're not getting that Jesus Freak.

1020
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:04,090
I don't give a fuck how many psalms he
writes underneath his fucking eyes is

1021
01:00:04,091 --> 01:00:08,620
going to get laid out and the pro level,
he's going to get fucking laid out.

1022
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:11,050
I guarantee that's my prediction.
All right.

1023
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,500
And they're gonna make them a flanker.
They're going to bring back that position.

1024
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:16,780
Um, so anyway, so I did that.

1025
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:18,150
I watched the,
uh,

1026
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:23,820
and then I watched the flyers in the
sabers and I watched the Bruins and the

1027
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,870
penguins game. Um, actually watch
the penguins game this morning.

1028
01:00:27,871 --> 01:00:32,580
I want you to fucking recording of
it. So I'm all, I got nothing left.

1029
01:00:32,581 --> 01:00:35,700
I can't watch any more fucking sports,
but I have to watch the patriots tonight,

1030
01:00:35,701 --> 01:00:39,450
play a con face Magoo and
the Indianapolis Colts.

1031
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:41,520
Um,

1032
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,810
and I really hope to patriots win
because I really want to hear how Peyton

1033
01:00:45,811 --> 01:00:49,290
manning is going to figure out how to
complain about Bill Belichick and the

1034
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:50,250
Patriots this year.

1035
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:55,380
That guy's one of the biggest fucking
babies in the history of the NFL.

1036
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,550
One of the biggest crybabies in
the history, uh, the fucking NFL

1037
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:03,100
they were holding on you
are receivers and night.

1038
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,300
I couldn't get to Paul to them.

1039
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:09,790
I remember that year he cried
about it after the game,

1040
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:14,710
he made a tape. Three weeks later
at the pro bowl, he cried about it.

1041
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:17,710
He quiet about it all the
way to the draft. Now,

1042
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:22,000
if you're ever watching the NFL and you're
wondering why is it illegal to cover

1043
01:01:22,001 --> 01:01:26,080
receivers now it's because
of Peyton manning whining.

1044
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:31,800
He wore a diaper from fucking January
until may crying about this fucking game.

1045
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,090
Hey,
whoa.

1046
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:38,910
[inaudible] fell like a jerk.

1047
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:42,363
Yeah.

1048
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:43,950
And then what happens?

1049
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:48,450
They make this rule where basically you
can't cover a receiver and the very next

1050
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:52,200
year he goes out. Not only does he
break Dan Marino's touchdown record,

1051
01:01:52,201 --> 01:01:55,530
he shatters it. A record that had
been around for 20 years. You know,

1052
01:01:55,531 --> 01:01:58,050
I'd been around for 20 years.
I'll tell you why.

1053
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:01,710
Because you could cover receivers
and Dan Marino was the shit.

1054
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:05,820
That's why Dan Marino owns every
fucking passing record out there,

1055
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:09,720
except Brett Farve decided to
play till he was 50 you know,

1056
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,210
Jesus Christ. If Dan Marino
play til he was 50 you never,

1057
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:16,720
you never want to see and you
couldn't cover receivers that gay.

1058
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:21,540
What a fucking throw 90 touchdowns.
And I hated the Guy Patriots Fan.

1059
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:24,840
He used to kill us all the time and
people still give the guys shit cause he

1060
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:26,430
never won a super bowl.
What was he supposed to do?

1061
01:02:26,431 --> 01:02:30,540
Tackle people to you fucking morons.
The guy never had a running back.

1062
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:34,650
Dan Marino is the greatest quarterback
that ever fucking played the game.

1063
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:39,030
The guy was a beast. Second Year in the
league, he throws for like 5,000 yards.

1064
01:02:39,031 --> 01:02:42,510
Who does that? Nobody.
Nobody does that. Okay.

1065
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:47,250
So this half retarded
Frankenstein is coming in as
big Frankenstein fucking head.

1066
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:51,480
He's coming in at a play the Patriots
today and I dunno what's going to happen.

1067
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:54,390
You know what's great is I'm recording
this before the game happened.

1068
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,300
So I gotta I gotta talk some Shit here.
What I think's going to happen,

1069
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:01,380
I actually think the cults are gonna win.
I think the Patriots' defense is still,

1070
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,510
it's too new.
It's too young.

1071
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:08,430
And even though bill Belicheck
is a defensive genius and
he slowly molding them

1072
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:13,440
into that suffocating,
quote unquote boring defense that we had.

1073
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:16,110
Remember that the beginning of the
two thousands when everybody said the

1074
01:03:16,111 --> 01:03:18,600
Patriots were a boring
team with no stars on it.

1075
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:23,900
And I take Peyton manning over fucking
Tom Brady wants to score three Superbowls

1076
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:28,950
to one. Really? You'd rather have fucking
one title rather than three. Well,

1077
01:03:28,951 --> 01:03:32,970
good luck to you. So, um, I dunno,

1078
01:03:32,971 --> 01:03:35,430
I dunno what's going to happen
today, but, uh, I have faith,

1079
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:38,910
I have faith in my boys and I think we're
gonna fucking now we're going to eke

1080
01:03:38,911 --> 01:03:43,110
out a victory and I think fucking Peyton
manning is going to cry about it and

1081
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:45,240
he's going to throw his
team under the bus. We Hash,

1082
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:50,130
we have some protection issues. We had
protection. Your shoosh fucking what?

1083
01:03:50,131 --> 01:03:52,710
A douche bag.
You know what I mean?

1084
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:56,260
They should go have a sword fight with
that fucking idiot kicker. His, alright,

1085
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,540
there you go.
That's my prediction.

1086
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:04,490
Um, anyways, was there a
prediction in there? Yeah, I'm,

1087
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:07,980
I'm my heart saying my heart is saying
that the Patriots are going to win by

1088
01:04:07,981 --> 01:04:12,750
three. My brain is telling me that we
might lose by seven just because, um,

1089
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:15,030
I just, I, like I said,

1090
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:18,500
we have a brand new fucking defense
and it's going to take them,

1091
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:19,140
believe it or not,

1092
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:23,730
it does take a good year or two for guys
to get used to each other to know where

1093
01:04:23,731 --> 01:04:25,890
they're going to be at,
you know,

1094
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,230
to know where you got help and
all that type of shit. So anyways,

1095
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:32,430
let's continue on with the
podcast. Oh, let's get into this.

1096
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:37,110
Shitstorm last week I did a,
uh,

1097
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:41,820
somebody asked me a question about
why when a guy does something,

1098
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,470
um, for his girlfriend, why is
it never enough? And one of the,

1099
01:04:46,471 --> 01:04:50,660
one of the problems that I've had and
that this guy had last week as you,

1100
01:04:50,661 --> 01:04:55,661
you try to plan something that both you
and your girlfriend can enjoy as your

1101
01:04:57,481 --> 01:04:58,110
night out.

1102
01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:03,110
And evidently women have a problem when
you pick something for the both of you

1103
01:05:03,571 --> 01:05:06,810
to do that.
You as a guy will also enjoy

1104
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:12,810
evidently from what I'm reading from these
fucking psycho emails that I got this

1105
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:17,440
week,
is that if it's not 100% about them,

1106
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:21,160
if you don't literally make
a rose bowl fucking float,

1107
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,120
set them on it and then drag it down
the street with your fucking teeth.

1108
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:31,110
They feel that you got too much
and enjoyment out of the evening.

1109
01:05:31,111 --> 01:05:34,500
So basically the evening was there.
It was really your evening.

1110
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,050
It was re look at the fucking wedding day.

1111
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:41,710
You stand in a like an idiot and
she makes this grand entrance.

1112
01:05:41,711 --> 01:05:44,040
She gets some one of a kind dress and you,

1113
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:48,370
you get a Tuxedo that some fucking drunks
gonna wear at a 15 year anniversary

1114
01:05:48,371 --> 01:05:52,030
for a bowling alley the next fucking
week. You know what I mean? All right,

1115
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:56,500
let's listen to what the twats had
to say to this week. Um, all right,

1116
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,570
here is this, this, this wonderful girl.

1117
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:01,750
And I said she's wonderful because she
actually admitted that she was a psycho

1118
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,170
because I actually emailed her and asked
her, why do you only respond to male,

1119
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:08,020
female shit? And she sort of
in her own little cute way,

1120
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:10,480
admitted that she was a psycho.
So I can't hate her. But anyways,

1121
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,520
this is her email.
Hey Bill,

1122
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,180
I love the clueless email
questions from your male listeners.

1123
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:17,950
That's always a great way,
by the way,

1124
01:06:17,951 --> 01:06:21,550
to get the other people to listen to what
you have to say right out of the gate.

1125
01:06:21,551 --> 01:06:25,780
Just start insulting them and talking
down to them. Um, he said, uh,

1126
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:30,640
the guy was asking, why is it never enough
to please a woman since he admit he?

1127
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:33,430
Um, and then she's referring
to his email. He, she says,

1128
01:06:33,431 --> 01:06:35,800
since he admits he isn't home a lot,

1129
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:40,510
I'm guessing his wife slash girlfriend
is doing all the dirty work for him,

1130
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:45,640
his laundry, cleaning, cooking, picking
up after him, et Cetera. All right,

1131
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,380
let's stop right there.

1132
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:51,880
She's doing all the dirty work.
Let me ask you guys a question.

1133
01:06:51,881 --> 01:06:55,120
Would you rather sit home doing laundry?
First of all,

1134
01:06:55,121 --> 01:06:58,120
laundry is the most
overrated fucking chore ever.

1135
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:00,910
If you have laundry in
your fucking apartment,

1136
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,210
what that takes all of a minute
to load the fucking thing in.

1137
01:07:04,211 --> 01:07:05,440
And if you're not colorblind,

1138
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:09,430
it probably takes 45 seconds to load it
in and then you go back to watching the

1139
01:07:09,431 --> 01:07:13,930
prices. Right? Cleaning,
cooking, picking up after him.

1140
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:16,690
I would rather do that than do
what this other guy's doing.

1141
01:07:16,691 --> 01:07:21,610
This other guy is working like
60 hours a fucking week. Okay,

1142
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:24,640
let's, let's move it. She's already
made this assumption. Okay. Then she,

1143
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:26,470
then she wants him to spend some,

1144
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:31,120
set some time with him and he comes up
with something that he wanted to do.

1145
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,330
Just like when you took your
girlfriend on that drive,

1146
01:07:34,331 --> 01:07:37,990
all we heard about was the love
story between you and the car.

1147
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:40,480
You were more excited about
the car than anything.

1148
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:44,500
It was like you were on a date with the
car and your girlfriend just came along

1149
01:07:44,501 --> 01:07:45,334
for the ride.

1150
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:49,230
Listen back to even the tone in your
voice when you were talking about it.

1151
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:54,040
It's like you were talking about another
woman. All right. You know something.

1152
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:58,780
I could sit around for 20 years trying
to come up with the perfect paragraph to

1153
01:07:58,781 --> 01:08:03,190
talk how insanely jealous and
psychotic women are. Can you,

1154
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:08,200
they are the jealous about an inanimate
object. She's talking about a car.

1155
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:12,130
It's almost like you are talking
about another woman lady.

1156
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,260
You are out of your fucking mind.

1157
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:19,870
You're out of your fucking mind and you're
totally ignoring the fact that I took

1158
01:08:19,871 --> 01:08:22,270
her out to dinner,
I took her out to lunch,

1159
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,660
I took her up for a ride up
to Pacific coast highway.

1160
01:08:25,661 --> 01:08:28,870
People fly out here as
a vacation to do that.

1161
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:31,150
A lot of couples do that
and I'll tell you right now,

1162
01:08:31,151 --> 01:08:32,980
they don't do it in a
corvette convertible.

1163
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:38,050
They do it in like a fucking
whatever our Buick century.

1164
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:43,220
Really,
I mean it literally is never enough.

1165
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:46,250
You're actually proving this guy
point this guy's points as she says,

1166
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:48,410
my husband does the same damn thing.
I'm like,

1167
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:51,080
what can we do for fun
today slash tonight?

1168
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:56,000
And the only thing he can come up with
are things that interest him. Well,

1169
01:08:56,001 --> 01:08:57,110
what can you come up with?

1170
01:08:57,111 --> 01:08:59,270
Can you come up with anything
that doesn't interest yourself?

1171
01:08:59,271 --> 01:09:02,360
You're selfish cunt.
You're doing the exact same fucking thing.

1172
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:07,290
And it's unbelievably selfish for you
to sit here and, and, and have like a,

1173
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:12,230
a day that's for both of you and it has
to be 100% about you because what you

1174
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:15,890
did, some laundry, you lazy. Fuck
your base. You know what women are,

1175
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:19,280
they're basically, they're like
adult children. That's what they are.

1176
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,700
They never get beyond their,
like juveniles.

1177
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:27,200
They're adults, but they still want to
be treated like they're not of age. It's,

1178
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:31,320
it's just fucking boggles my goddamn mind.
Um,

1179
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,320
she goes,
I'd rather not do anything at all.

1180
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:39,380
I think itself is an egg nog and obnoxious
that everything we do has to have his

1181
01:09:39,841 --> 01:09:41,400
interests before mine.

1182
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:46,560
So everything that they do should
have your interests before his,

1183
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,930
you're right. Yeah. He's, he's fucking
broad. So right at the seat, this is,

1184
01:09:50,931 --> 01:09:54,950
this is my thing. This is why you
should, you should never get married.

1185
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,960
You should never be in
a fucking relationship.

1186
01:09:56,961 --> 01:10:01,961
You shouldn't because they just
constantly fucking hack away,

1187
01:10:02,481 --> 01:10:03,950
itch a goddamn knees.

1188
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:09,140
And their idea of a relationship is that
you do everything that they want to do.

1189
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:12,980
And right now they're sitting there
shaking their heads, they're going now.

1190
01:10:12,981 --> 01:10:15,020
Now even the girl wrote,
that's probably saying no.

1191
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:18,230
And then there's a bunch of other
women going like, I'm not like that.

1192
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:20,750
And I like that.
I went to a ping pong convention.

1193
01:10:20,751 --> 01:10:23,090
They always come up with some
stupid ass fucking example.

1194
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:26,780
And at the end of the fucking day,
you have to do everything that they do.

1195
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:30,890
The you have to do what the fuck they
want to do or else they get mad. Okay.

1196
01:10:30,891 --> 01:10:35,891
And that my friend is when jerking off
comes into play because when you really

1197
01:10:36,651 --> 01:10:38,660
break it down, what's the worst thing
that they're going to do to you?

1198
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,570
They're not going to fuck
you for a few days. Okay.

1199
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:46,010
And I gotta be honest with you, once
you rub one out, who gives a fuck?

1200
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:50,420
And you have to have that clarity
when you're nuts are full.

1201
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:54,230
Do you know what I mean? Am I sounding
like a fucking maniac here? I know I am.

1202
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:58,940
I know I am. But you got, you got to hear
what the, what this, what this other,

1203
01:10:58,941 --> 01:10:59,960
this other woman wrote.

1204
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:04,640
And of course I don't have it in front
of me because I'm an idiot with a fuck it

1205
01:11:04,641 --> 01:11:07,100
is it all right.
Um,

1206
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:10,550
I am writing to comment on the wide has
never enough discussion on your last

1207
01:11:10,551 --> 01:11:14,070
episode episode. I'll start
by saying that the, that wrote

1208
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:18,990
in and to a slightly lesser extent,
you come off as total Douche is,

1209
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,170
let me explain my view of the writers,

1210
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:27,570
the writers situation. Oh, I guess
the guy sent the email. Uh, and yes,

1211
01:11:27,571 --> 01:11:32,340
I am one of those manipulative,
selfish creatures known as women. Um,

1212
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:34,950
yeah,
you are what you call yourself out on it.

1213
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:37,770
Now Suppose Oren was I supposed to
like read that and be like, Whoa,

1214
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:39,600
I really am too harsh on women.

1215
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:44,250
Say you're like trying to manipulate me
with your fucking bullshit already. Okay,

1216
01:11:44,251 --> 01:11:46,160
here we go. Um, I don't
remember the names,

1217
01:11:46,161 --> 01:11:50,100
so I'll call him Bob and his wife Sally.
Bob Neglect Sally.

1218
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:54,840
A huge fuck up on Bob's part.
Now let's, let's get back to the,

1219
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:58,440
to the detail here. He's
neglecting her. What does he,

1220
01:11:58,441 --> 01:12:00,390
is he out at the bar chasing other women?

1221
01:12:00,391 --> 01:12:04,410
This guy is out working
his fucking ass off.

1222
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:09,290
This is the thing that
women don't understand. What
they don't understand is I,

1223
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:12,360
this is maybe I'm being a more on,
again, are a Douche as this lady says.

1224
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:15,270
I think a lot of women don't understand
what it takes to be successful.

1225
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:19,620
What it takes is sacrifice and in your
20s you have to work your fucking ass off.

1226
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:23,460
That's what I did for five years with
my first five years in this fucking

1227
01:12:23,461 --> 01:12:27,990
business. I had no girlfriend. I
had no social life and nothing.

1228
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,620
All I was doing shows and
and fucking rubbing one out.

1229
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:34,350
That's what the fuck I did.
Every God damn day I went to work.

1230
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:39,030
I was writing jokes at work and at
night I got an a piece of shit car and I

1231
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:43,950
would sometimes drive to another
fucking state and you know why I had no

1232
01:12:43,951 --> 01:12:48,030
girlfriend during that time because none
of them could understand what I had to

1233
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:51,510
do to get where I am today.
All of them were giving me shit.

1234
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:54,120
You're doing fan of again tonight.

1235
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:59,910
Do you realize how many Richard Pryor's
are fucking working at a home depot or

1236
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,740
Jimi Hendrix because they hooked up with
the wrong fucking Twat who talked him

1237
01:13:04,741 --> 01:13:07,460
out of their goddamn dream
because they didn't want,

1238
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:11,550
they didn't want to hear it because
they said you needed some sort of

1239
01:13:11,551 --> 01:13:12,510
responsibility.

1240
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:16,410
This fucking guy is doing the right
thing and she's calling him selfish.

1241
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:21,270
He's at work busting his ass trying
to get ahead. So when he's 40,

1242
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:23,510
he's not a fucking loser and he has,
let's see.

1243
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:26,670
And they all want the fucking house.
They all wanted fucking yesterday,

1244
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:28,530
but they don't want to get
through the bullshit of it.

1245
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:31,850
They don't want to go through the bullshit
of it where you actually have to, uh,

1246
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:36,270
not see him for a little while
cause he's out working. So anyways,

1247
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:40,830
huge fuck up in his fart part to be a
busting his goddamn ass. So he says,

1248
01:13:40,831 --> 01:13:45,780
Bob Decides to make it up to her by taking
her to see your live show, she says,

1249
01:13:45,781 --> 01:13:49,110
which is awesome. And a dinner,
which is pretty standard.

1250
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:52,440
This is how out of control women are.

1251
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,560
She's getting a free fucking meal and
they're so spoiled as a sex that she's

1252
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:03,570
describes a three
fucking meal as standard.

1253
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,370
Do you know what I have to do
as a man to get a free meal?

1254
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:12,910
I have to like when like a fucking,
like a radio contest,

1255
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:13,720
you know,

1256
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:17,830
I got to call up this radio station and
imitate the local sports guy and I have

1257
01:14:17,831 --> 01:14:21,680
to beat out all these other
fucking guys who are, uh,

1258
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,300
I haven't had a free meal since I was
like eight years old and my parents took

1259
01:14:25,301 --> 01:14:28,330
me to Mcdonald's or whatever.
Like maybe 13,

1260
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:33,331
14 women are so fucking spoiled that this
guy is busting his ass at work that's

1261
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,850
viewed as selfish.

1262
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:41,050
He's buying this girl a free
dinner and it's viewed as standard.

1263
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:43,390
They're out of their fucking
mind. So anyway, she goes,

1264
01:14:43,391 --> 01:14:48,391
Sally basically tells her friends who
may or may not know that Bob has been

1265
01:14:48,491 --> 01:14:52,360
fucking up. Once again, Bob is fucking
up because he's busting his ass at work.

1266
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:56,140
So when they're 40, they're going to be
uneasy street. He's fucking up right now.

1267
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:59,950
Um, the same bitches who make you
fucking, you know, not chase your dream,

1268
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:04,090
leave you when you're 38 because you're
a fucking loser. Right? All right.

1269
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:07,930
I love generalizing. It really gets
these twats can hairs in a fucking,

1270
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:11,240
I didn't want to, I can't even finish that
sentence. That was so evil. All right,

1271
01:15:11,241 --> 01:15:13,750
let's, let's plow ahead. Um,

1272
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:19,780
who may or may not know that Bob has been
fucking up that this night out is not

1273
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:21,100
what she had in mind,

1274
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:26,080
but she is taking what she can get
playing the victim are the poor baby.

1275
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,120
She's taking what?
She got a free meal.

1276
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:32,110
She's just taken what she can get and
she's getting a show to come out to my

1277
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:36,370
show. One of the best fucking
comedians in the country. You like Dad,

1278
01:15:36,371 --> 01:15:40,390
I'm talking shit. It's football Sunday
and I'm a plus. I'm reading the ric Flair,

1279
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:44,050
the best comic on the
biggest hill. Um, anyways,

1280
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,350
our Bob gets upset and
determines that no one has ever,

1281
01:15:47,351 --> 01:15:52,180
or will ever be able to please any female
code for why should he even make an

1282
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:55,780
effort to make his wife happy in their
marriage? That's not code for that.

1283
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:58,690
That's how you read into it.
You've never met Bob.

1284
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:03,190
You've made all kinds of assumptions
here. Poor, poor Bob. Bob's do.

1285
01:16:03,610 --> 01:16:06,820
Sherry becomes a crystal,
becomes crystal clear when he is,

1286
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:10,960
when he says something to the effect of
this whole night out was supposed to be

1287
01:16:10,961 --> 01:16:12,710
about her.
This is a,

1288
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:17,850
this is classic male privilege wankery
but I realized this is hard for you and

1289
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:23,860
Bob to see. So I'm here to help.
Um, I'll try to make it simple.

1290
01:16:23,861 --> 01:16:28,390
When you piss off your wife bringing her
along to a show you already wanted to

1291
01:16:28,391 --> 01:16:31,900
go to and that she is
only mildly interested in.

1292
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:33,520
Then being a little,

1293
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:38,020
scroll them about it when she's is
underwhelmed by the fact that you are

1294
01:16:38,021 --> 01:16:40,390
actually making an effort
to go out with her,

1295
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:45,490
which is what you should have been doing
as a matter of course is not the way to

1296
01:16:45,491 --> 01:16:48,370
go. Oh my God. I mean
the arrogance in this,

1297
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:51,790
I love people who are arrogant and they're
calling you out for being arrogant,

1298
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:55,180
bringing her to a show.
Do you understand? Like,

1299
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,700
I'm going to stop being a jerk here
because maybe I can actually convince a

1300
01:16:57,701 --> 01:17:00,670
couple of women. Do you understand
what it takes this, this will actually,

1301
01:17:00,671 --> 01:17:01,504
you know,
I've been generalizing.

1302
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:06,600
There are women out there who understand
what it takes to become successful and

1303
01:17:06,701 --> 01:17:10,310
I guarantee you most of them are not in
relationships and they have a difficult

1304
01:17:10,311 --> 01:17:13,220
time being in relationships.
You know?

1305
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:17,210
Because the guy that with wants to go
home and play fucking footsie or once her

1306
01:17:17,211 --> 01:17:22,130
around and doesn't understand that these
are the years where she has to bust our

1307
01:17:22,131 --> 01:17:25,130
ass to get where the fuck
she's going to be. You know?

1308
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:26,530
Yeah.

1309
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:30,490
So Lady, both of you guys
are a hundred percent wrong.

1310
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,370
I could see if this guy was
out drinking with his buddies,

1311
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:37,870
if this guy was out fucking around on
her or if he was just sitting there

1312
01:17:37,871 --> 01:17:41,320
staring at the TV watching football and
that paying attention to her when he

1313
01:17:41,321 --> 01:17:42,460
brings her out.
Yeah.

1314
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:47,170
Then I could see that he should have some
sort of mini all about you wedding day

1315
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:52,180
for her. Okay. But if this guy is
busting his ass, if fucking work,

1316
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:54,940
okay, he's not going out
having a good time either.

1317
01:17:55,090 --> 01:17:58,270
So he should be allowed to
have some sort of enjoyment.

1318
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:02,290
You don't understand. He should
be able to enjoy some of the day,

1319
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:05,710
some of the night also. And this another
thing that you haven't even brought up,

1320
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:07,780
how much of the rent do you
think he's fucking pain?

1321
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:12,090
I'd be willing to bet that
he's paying more than she is.

1322
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:15,480
A lot of guys are in that situation too.
When you get this,

1323
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:19,950
the adult child version of a
fucking woman, I'm telling you,

1324
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:21,090
you women,

1325
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:24,210
I'm telling you the tool who wrote
in your way out of line on this one.

1326
01:18:24,211 --> 01:18:27,810
I'm not even trying to be funny right now.
You're 100% in the fucking wrong here.

1327
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:32,790
You're being selfish. Beyond fucking
selfish. This guy is at work.

1328
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:34,740
He's busting his ass trying to get ahead.

1329
01:18:34,741 --> 01:18:38,250
Do you think this guy wants to
fucking work 60 hours a week?

1330
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:41,400
Nobody dreams about doing that.
Why do you think he's doing that?

1331
01:18:41,401 --> 01:18:44,930
He's trying to become successful.
You know?

1332
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:48,650
So the next time you're,
you know, I like I said,

1333
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,120
if this guy had been fucking around
or if this guy had been sitting there

1334
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:52,910
watching you know,

1335
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:56,810
sports and not paying attention to you
and hadn't given you a compliment since

1336
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:00,350
you could fucking remember. Yeah, then I
could understand, you know what I mean?

1337
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:02,870
Taking you to the whatever
the fuck you wanted to go to,

1338
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:06,590
but for you to sit there and this
guy spends his hard on fucking money,

1339
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:09,560
takes you out to dinner.
Okay.

1340
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,570
Which you got understand is not standard.
Okay.

1341
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:15,161
And your home,

1342
01:19:15,161 --> 01:19:18,740
how fucking spoiled to you that you
think that that is step is standard.

1343
01:19:18,741 --> 01:19:22,730
I got the fucking hiccups here. I'm
so God damn upset. Um, you guys are,

1344
01:19:22,731 --> 01:19:24,950
you guys are 100% wrong.
And if any brides out there,

1345
01:19:24,951 --> 01:19:27,230
one want to try to come out
and support these two girls,

1346
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:30,590
I mean go for it because I
don't see how they're wrong.

1347
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:34,970
This guy did nothing wrong.
He took her out to go see a show.

1348
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,570
It's just in order to stand up,
comedy is not respected. It isn't.

1349
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:43,170
If he took you out to see a Broadway
show or a fucking musical or are,

1350
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,500
I guess that's the same thing.
I Dunno what,

1351
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,630
I guess if he took you out for dinner
and a movie. I love that. Like,

1352
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:53,600
like guys always have to show some
sort of imagination. It's standard.

1353
01:19:53,601 --> 01:19:56,690
It was just an imagination.
We like surprises and it's like,

1354
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:00,590
when was the last time your girl actually
showed any fucking imagination when

1355
01:20:00,591 --> 01:20:03,620
they got you a shirt,
you know,

1356
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:08,000
or some sports DVD you,
did

1357
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,670
they ever really show any sort of fucking
imagination? I'll tell you who does.

1358
01:20:11,671 --> 01:20:12,121
My girl,

1359
01:20:12,121 --> 01:20:17,121
she actually showed some imagination
one year when I first met her,

1360
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,090
she, I uh, I was playing drums, you know,

1361
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,200
she knew I was in a drum. She knew I
loved them and she actually got me this,

1362
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:26,240
this pair of drums.

1363
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,590
She gave me a pair of drum sticks and
we'd only been going off for like a month.

1364
01:20:28,591 --> 01:20:30,930
So there was like that thing,
you can't get a really huge gift,

1365
01:20:31,650 --> 01:20:34,890
but you got to get him some, she got me
a pair of drum sticks and she had my,

1366
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:39,330
my initials engraved on them. I never
even used them. I thought it was really,

1367
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,010
it was unique. It was
loving everything, know,

1368
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,640
and it didn't cost that much money
and it was totally fucking cool.

1369
01:20:44,641 --> 01:20:48,540
I wouldn't be like, well, you know
that's, you got to do that every birthday.

1370
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:52,770
You know, surprise me like you
did with the drumsticks. Xx.

1371
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:57,600
Spend a ton of fucking money to, you
know, I didn't know if that even fucking,

1372
01:20:57,601 --> 01:20:59,940
I think I started to make one point and
then I made another one in that one.

1373
01:20:59,941 --> 01:21:02,580
I'm so fucking annoyed by these.
These women, they're there.

1374
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:06,060
They're out of their fucking minds.
You're out of your fucking minds.

1375
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:08,003
Okay?

1376
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:11,250
If the guy who wrote that email last
week don't listen to these fucking twats,

1377
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,340
all right, you bought, you're out
there, you're busting your goddamn ass.

1378
01:21:14,341 --> 01:21:18,900
You have to sit down and you have to
explain to your wife or your girlfriend or

1379
01:21:18,901 --> 01:21:20,100
whatever the fuck she is.

1380
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:22,920
What it takes to become successful
because I'm telling you,

1381
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,320
you understand what it is you're doing.

1382
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:30,240
What everybody else did in their
20s all those people out there,

1383
01:21:30,241 --> 01:21:33,690
you know the brides with the tramp
stamps and the guys with the tribal band

1384
01:21:33,691 --> 01:21:37,770
tattoo who are out there doing keg
stands and fucking everything that moves,

1385
01:21:37,771 --> 01:21:40,980
doing their best to catch herpes
every fucking weekend. Those people,

1386
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:44,880
they wonder what happens when they get
to their thirties and their forties they

1387
01:21:44,881 --> 01:21:47,610
wonder what the fuck happened.
You know?

1388
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:51,220
And they're looking at you like you're
a shithead. You know? Now the payoff is,

1389
01:21:51,221 --> 01:21:54,810
is usually when you become successful,
you end up renting a corvette at 41

1390
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:03,480
having sort of a mini midlife crisis.
But I'm telling you,

1391
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,710
I'd rather be me than those other
fucking dudes. I really would.

1392
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:12,920
So you really need to explain to this
woman who looks at you busting your ass as

1393
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:17,220
neglect, as, as being selfish.

1394
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:20,490
It's just beyond me.
It's fucking beyond.

1395
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:25,320
You're doing what you're supposed to be
doing as a man is a man is supposed to

1396
01:22:25,321 --> 01:22:27,960
work and he supposed to
provide for his family.

1397
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:33,080
And what you are doing as you are laying
the groundwork for you to do that as

1398
01:22:33,601 --> 01:22:37,050
best as you possibly can. And for
someone to say that that is selfish,

1399
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:41,160
it's just fucking beyond me.
Okay. Let me ask you this.

1400
01:22:41,161 --> 01:22:43,200
When you went out that night,
how fucking tired were you?

1401
01:22:43,201 --> 01:22:47,610
How many times did you yawn from working
all fucking week? You know what I mean?

1402
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:49,680
Yeah.

1403
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:53,520
You know, aren't you allowed to go out
and have a good time with your girlfriend,

1404
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:56,750
with a little bit of Shit that she enjoys?
A little bit of stuff that,

1405
01:22:56,751 --> 01:22:59,880
that you enjoy. Isn't that like
a fucking relationship? I mean,

1406
01:22:59,881 --> 01:23:03,900
am I out of my fucking mind here
anyways?

1407
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:06,010
Um,
this is really just to

1408
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:09,520
become a, a woman bashing thing.
This really just fucking tapped into.

1409
01:23:09,521 --> 01:23:11,140
This is another email I got bill.
This,

1410
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:15,700
this got me so pissed off and I swear
the first thing that came to my mind was

1411
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:20,020
wait until bill, here's this shit. Um, I
guess I listened to your show too much.

1412
01:23:20,021 --> 01:23:21,070
So here's the story.
He goes,

1413
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:24,540
I went on my lunch break with the
female coworker today. And the,

1414
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:28,720
the true mind of a female really shined.
I'm telling you a women,

1415
01:23:28,721 --> 01:23:32,020
you really got to chime in here and trash
guys, because this is really becoming,

1416
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:36,760
this is like, like the guys this week
or Stanford and women are fucking USC.

1417
01:23:36,761 --> 01:23:41,710
But uh, whatever, watch Oprah. You always
went on that show. Here we go. First off,

1418
01:23:41,711 --> 01:23:45,130
I'm not interested in this female.
Uh, we are just friends. We have,

1419
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:49,600
we've even talked about this and I
have explained to her and we agree,

1420
01:23:49,601 --> 01:23:52,510
nothing is happening
there. No problem. Uh,

1421
01:23:52,511 --> 01:23:56,920
so we go out to get a sandwich
and her ATM account is frozen.

1422
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,360
She calls the bank and they
think something's wrong and
won't give her the money

1423
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:06,460
till they talk tomorrow. Right there.
Fuck the banks. Right, exactly.

1424
01:24:06,461 --> 01:24:10,540
You can't even get your own fucking
money. Um, provided she's not overdrawn.

1425
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,780
So here we go. So he goes, I would have
lent her the cash, but I was broke.

1426
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:17,170
I offered to give her all the money,
all the money in my pocket,

1427
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:22,180
about $2 and 50 cents in pocket change
that would at least bought her a coffee

1428
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:26,920
mug. I already paid for my sandwich,
uh, when we found out about the ATM.

1429
01:24:26,921 --> 01:24:28,300
So she turns down that,

1430
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:32,860
but asked me to drive her a few blocks
to go to the bank and I happily do, um,

1431
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:35,830
that doesn't work and we
have to go back to work.

1432
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:38,170
This is all during your lunch hour.
Um,

1433
01:24:38,171 --> 01:24:43,000
she asked me to borrow a credit card or
something to get food. I don't have any,

1434
01:24:43,001 --> 01:24:47,620
so she can't. So she calls back the job
in the ass. Another guy for five bucks.

1435
01:24:47,770 --> 01:24:49,750
He says, yes. Uh,

1436
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:53,800
she then asked me for the two 50 she
turned down before. I said, sure,

1437
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:58,510
now here is the fucking kicker.
So now this girl has seven 50.

1438
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:02,740
She then tells me word for word.
Well, since I got five bucks,

1439
01:25:02,741 --> 01:25:04,570
now let me tell you something.

1440
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:08,830
And with this fake grin on her
face trying to soften the blow,

1441
01:25:08,831 --> 01:25:13,210
actually she wasn't. She's going
into cut mode. Here she goes, uh,

1442
01:25:13,230 --> 01:25:16,870
if you were in this jam, I would
have offered you half of my sandwich,

1443
01:25:16,871 --> 01:25:21,430
but that's okay. I'm just saying.
And the guy said, I was floored.

1444
01:25:21,431 --> 01:25:23,380
I was like, Yo, first off,

1445
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:27,850
you only said this after you got the money
because you knew how it might make me

1446
01:25:27,851 --> 01:25:31,840
feel and now you have my money
and don't need my sandwich.

1447
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:35,410
So basically you just wanted to make me
feel shitty for not living up to your

1448
01:25:35,411 --> 01:25:39,180
standard of friendship. She
laughed it off and said, uh,

1449
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:43,000
she was trying to offend me. She wasn't
trying to offend me and let it go.

1450
01:25:43,001 --> 01:25:45,100
Bullshit.
You called her out on a shit.

1451
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:48,130
Notice how she waited
till she got your two 50,

1452
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:51,250
and then did the little fucking
two point reversal on you.

1453
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:55,570
Then she brings it up again and now I
realize she was really bothered by the

1454
01:25:55,571 --> 01:25:59,560
fact I didn't offer the sandwich I bought
with my last five bucks to my name.

1455
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:03,980
Meanwhile, she, uh, she
has 400 bucks in the, uh,

1456
01:26:03,981 --> 01:26:06,950
they just won't give it to her tomorrow.
She will be fine.

1457
01:26:06,951 --> 01:26:10,820
I will still be broke yet she still
thinks I should have given her half of the

1458
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:14,150
last sandwich I can for
a week till I get paid.

1459
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:19,310
Um, the thing that gets me the
most is we work a labor job.

1460
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:23,360
I'm always helping her lift and move
things because she herself brings up the

1461
01:26:23,361 --> 01:26:28,280
point. She is a girl, yet she talks all
the time about how men and women are, um,

1462
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:31,250
are equal in the workplace and
she should be treated the same.

1463
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:35,420
And this is in some dumb cunt. She went
to school for four years, got a degree,

1464
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:36,290
changed your mind,

1465
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:39,710
and now she's going back to get another
degree that will take her six more year,

1466
01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:42,170
years.
She reads and studies all day.

1467
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:46,070
And I enjoy your conversations because
she smart. But at the end of the day,

1468
01:26:46,071 --> 01:26:50,540
I have learned she's still a woman and
she still feels she should somehow be

1469
01:26:50,541 --> 01:26:54,860
baby by other men simply because she
is a woman. I'm not sleeping with her.

1470
01:26:54,861 --> 01:26:57,980
We are just friends. Why do you
feel entitled to half of my last,

1471
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:01,820
even if after I go out of my way,
um,

1472
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,500
oh half of my sandwich.

1473
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:07,940
Even if after I go out of my way
every way I can to help you. Exactly.

1474
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:11,840
You went, you gave her every
last cent in your fucking pants.

1475
01:27:11,841 --> 01:27:14,150
You drove her down to the bank,
he drove her back to work.

1476
01:27:14,151 --> 01:27:16,040
This was all during
your fucking lunch hour.

1477
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:20,720
You're lifting her boxes and all
that type of shit. I mean, I dunno.

1478
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:22,851
I Dunno what to tell you.

1479
01:27:22,851 --> 01:27:25,270
I mean maybe you could have given her
half your fucking sandwich. I haven't,

1480
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:28,610
I don't know what your relationship
is with her, but that's the classic,

1481
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:34,190
you know, I could see if she
got the $5 out of the other guy,

1482
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:39,590
you know and didn't take your two 50 but
she gets to five and then takes you to

1483
01:27:39,591 --> 01:27:43,430
50 and then brings it up.
You know what I mean?

1484
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:47,510
I'm telling you do right then like I,
I like if someone did that to me,

1485
01:27:47,511 --> 01:27:49,820
I would be done with them.
I will be done with them.

1486
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:52,610
I wouldn't tell him that it would
be done with them. What I would do,

1487
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:56,500
it was I would wait for the next time
she needed me to lift something. Um,

1488
01:27:56,540 --> 01:28:01,070
I would do a country smile back to her and
be like, you know, if I was asking you,

1489
01:28:01,071 --> 01:28:04,250
I would, I would make sure that I would
live half the box with me, you know,

1490
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:09,110
or whatever the fuck you want
to say. Um, anyways, he said,

1491
01:28:09,111 --> 01:28:14,000
thanks for letting me, uh,
event signed the Jewish dude.

1492
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:21,710
Um, all right, let's see here.
I think that might be at a,
that it, that's it, right?

1493
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:25,880
I think that is it. That is it for the
podcast. All right, well let me say it.

1494
01:28:25,881 --> 01:28:30,140
Let me state for the
record here. Um, I dunno,

1495
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:33,470
after the second time reading that maybe
you could have given her half you st or

1496
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:37,520
party his sandwich offered
her a bite. But uh, you know,

1497
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:40,580
you spend all your fucking money,
then she finds out she's fucking broke.

1498
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:45,260
But that is the typical female fucking
thing. Okay. Where Equal Rico rescue me,

1499
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:50,030
rescue me, we're equal.
We're equal. Rescue me. They
basically, they ride that fence.

1500
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:51,680
Okay.

1501
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:56,680
And what most of them do is when
it's a good thing to be equal,

1502
01:28:56,990 --> 01:29:00,890
then your equal. And when it's a bad
thing to be equal, like, you know,

1503
01:29:00,891 --> 01:29:05,880
I to pick up something heavy then, then
it's like, oh, I'm just a girl, you know,

1504
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:09,750
or dinner comes along and the check
comes along. Then I'm a female.

1505
01:29:09,751 --> 01:29:14,400
You should be a gentleman. I did a bit
about this a long fucking time ago. Um,

1506
01:29:14,401 --> 01:29:17,460
so basically they can, I mean, what
are they doing that's wrong there?

1507
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:21,030
They're just trying to manipulate
the situation to their advantage.

1508
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:22,410
All you have to do as a guy,

1509
01:29:22,411 --> 01:29:25,770
just be conscious of it and
call him out on this shit.

1510
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:30,970
Um, you should have asked for
you to 50 back when she said, no,

1511
01:29:31,210 --> 01:29:33,190
you should have demonstrated
your strength as a man.

1512
01:29:33,191 --> 01:29:37,480
Tipped her upside down and
shook it out of her. Um,

1513
01:29:38,470 --> 01:29:41,410
that's it. That's it for the Monday
morning podcast. That was kind of dark.

1514
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:45,640
That was kind of evils, kind of ugly. And
I anticipate a lot of emails, but, uh,

1515
01:29:45,641 --> 01:29:50,140
that's how the podcast goes sometimes.
And, uh, I know it wasn't on a cell phone,

1516
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:53,230
but a go fuck yourself.
That's how I'm doing them.

1517
01:29:53,231 --> 01:29:55,420
That's how I'm going to continue
doing them. If you don't like it,

1518
01:29:55,421 --> 01:30:00,070
fucking go listen to the old ones. Go
listen to the old bunch of pricks. Um,

1519
01:30:00,071 --> 01:30:03,730
this week I'm going to be at the
Improv in Tempe, Arizona. All right.

1520
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:08,110
I'm going to be there on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday. And uh,

1521
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:10,210
there's been a little
switcheroo on my schedule.

1522
01:30:10,211 --> 01:30:12,160
I was supposed to be going to Seattle.

1523
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:13,560
Yeah,

1524
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:17,220
I was supposed to be going to
Seattle to play giggles comedy club,

1525
01:30:17,221 --> 01:30:20,880
but I'm unfortunately that
comedy club does not advertise.

1526
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:26,400
So the only way I sell tickets is to go
on this one particular radio show and

1527
01:30:26,401 --> 01:30:29,370
they changed the format and
got rid of my hookup up there.

1528
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:33,300
So there's no way for me to go into town
to let anybody know that I'm going to

1529
01:30:33,301 --> 01:30:37,080
be there. So the club owner would
just lose a ton of fucking money.

1530
01:30:37,081 --> 01:30:41,160
So like a class guy, I
switched out the date. Okay.

1531
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,940
So basically I think I'm going to
be maybe doing Seattle in January.

1532
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,240
So instead of going to
