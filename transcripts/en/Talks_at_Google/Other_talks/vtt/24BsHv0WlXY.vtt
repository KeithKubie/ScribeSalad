00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.725
ANNOUNCER: Please
welcome David Gelles.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.840
DAVID GELLES: Thank you.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.381
Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:08.870
How are you all?

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.370
Good?

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.820
Good lunch?

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.540
We also have Mindful
Work stress balls

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.440
over where we're
selling the book, so be

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.430
sure to pick one of those up.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.227
Well, thank you all so
much for being here.

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:18.810
It's an honor.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.910
Today is actually the
publish-- pub date for my book.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.740
I see a couple friends
in the audience.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.810
Which is thrilling.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.950
I mean after 2 and
1/2 years, more,

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.650
of working on this, to actually
have this thing in the wild

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.290
is pretty extraordinary.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.990
And so I'm thrilled
to be here on pub day.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.069
Before I prattle on
about mindfulness,

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:39.110
for a few minutes-- and
we'll have plenty of time

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.050
to talk and questions--
I wonder if I

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.652
might draw you all in to
this practice, whatever

00:00:43.652 --> 00:00:45.735
this mindfulness thing is
that we're talking about

00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:47.390
and actually just make us sit.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.190
We're going to practice
mindfulness just

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.420
for a minute or so.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.690
So if I may ask, if you could
shut your laptop screens,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.550
if you could put your phones
away just for a minute here,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.850
I promise it won't
take too long.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.280
And for those who haven't
practiced mindfulness before,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.710
here's what we're going to do.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.751
I'm going to ring a bell.

00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:08.010
And at that point, find an
upright, comfortable, erect

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.884
posture.

00:01:09.884 --> 00:01:11.800
Close your eyes if you're
comfortable with it.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.330
And just notice the
sensations of your breath.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.716
This kind of
fundamental exercise

00:01:15.716 --> 00:01:17.840
underlies all the things
we're going to talk about.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.054
So just notice what it
feels like to breathe.

00:01:20.054 --> 00:01:21.970
We're breathing all the
time, but how often do

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.300
we actually notice
what it feels like?

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.650
So if that's the air passing
in and out of your nostrils,

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.850
if that's the diaphragm
rising and falling,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.476
just try to tune in
on that sensation.

00:01:32.476 --> 00:01:34.100
And what's going to
happen, I guarantee

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.199
you, after 5 seconds
or 30 seconds,

00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:37.490
is your mind's going to wander.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.720
You're going to wonder
what's for lunch after this,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.700
why is this guy talking to me,
why aren't we doing anything.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.830
And here's the whole game.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.670
When that moment happens, just
gently bring your attention

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.589
back to the breath.

00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:48.880
It's just attentional training.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.140
So just try to return
the attention back

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.720
to those physical sensations.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.907
Let's try it for just a
short little bit here.

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:56.901
[BREATHES DEEPLY]

00:01:56.901 --> 00:01:58.392
[RINGS BELL]

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.880
If the mind's wandered, just
gently bring the attention back

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.926
to the breath.

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:39.294
[BREATHES DEEPLY]

00:02:39.294 --> 00:02:40.290
[RINGS BELL]

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.330
OK.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.760
I hope that wasn't too painful.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.720
Good.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.030
A lot of people actually
find it's rather enjoyable.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.320
The velocity of our
days are so intense,

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.230
taking just that
brief moment to pause

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.740
can be actually refreshing.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.840
And now, before I get started,
just a quick show of hands,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.297
how many of you are kind
of believers in this?

00:03:01.297 --> 00:03:03.630
And how many of you have some
understandable skepticism?

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.050
How many of you have taken
Search Inside Yourself

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.830
and lead the meditation groups,
as I know some of us do?

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.690
And how many of you
are kind of skeptics?

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.700
So I want a show
of hands, 0 to 10.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.260
0 is I think this is all hokum.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.500
This is New Age bogus.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.672
I'm here to ridicule you
during the Q&amp;A. 10 being,

00:03:18.672 --> 00:03:20.130
I'm leading Search
Inside Yourself.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.140
Just give me a
quick show of hands.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.760
What do I see.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.060
I see 8s.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.510
I see 2s.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.010
Good.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.250
We have some work to do.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.860
3s.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.490
All right.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.990
Thank you.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.280
So we have a range of
perspectives on mindfulness

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.630
and mindless in the workplace.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.560
Well, whatever
mindfulness is, and we'll

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.640
talk a bit about
this, it is spreading

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.060
throughout the business
world, as I've discovered.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.880
At Goldman Sachs,
they're teaching

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.490
meditation and mindfulness to
their traders, their investment

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.234
bankers.

00:03:47.234 --> 00:03:48.900
And there's a board
member, Bill George,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.930
who's actually espousing the
benefits of mindful leadership.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.700
At this small tech company
you probably haven't heard of,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.630
Facebook, they are
actually retooling

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.250
some of the algorithms,
trying to make

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.249
them more compassionate.

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:01.790
They have Compassion
Research Days.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.640
And of course, you guys are
doing great work here as well.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.360
At General Mills, big food
company in Minneapolis,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.370
Minnesota, there's a meditation
room in every single building

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.080
on corporate campus.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.120
That's pretty extraordinary
for the Midwest, I think.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.890
It's not just the
business world.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.019
In healthcare,
nurses and doctors

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.810
are finding that
mindfulness training makes

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.470
them more resilient during
these 12, longer hour shifts,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.950
allowing them to be more
compassionate and more

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.200
attentive to their patients.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.480
And patients, too, are
finding that mindfulness

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.550
and meditation, it might
not make the pain go away,

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.890
but it helps them suffer
just a little less.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.550
They can manage
that pain better.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.500
In schools, kids are meditating.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.060
They're finding that it
actually improves test scores.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.890
Studies are finding
that teachers

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.870
are finding that it
helps them actually

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.203
deal with these kids a bit
more, especially the ones who

00:04:49.203 --> 00:04:50.860
aren't meditating, perhaps.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.800
And in the military, the Army
and the Marines here in the US

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.370
are both using
mindfulness training,

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.160
not to make more
effective fighters, not

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.850
to make more accurate snipers,
but to help these guys

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.980
deal with whatever it was they
encountered on the battlefield

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.710
when they come home,
to help cope with PTSD

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.510
and some of the other things
they have to carry with them.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.040
And even in sports, this
guy, he came very close

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.500
but didn't quite get it.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.190
But for the last two
years, the Seahawks

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.740
have been incorporating
mindfulness training side

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.240
by side with their
weight training.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.300
They say it's
almost as important

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.820
as the physical preparation,
is the mental preparation.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.611
These guys are doing
it in the locker room.

00:05:31.611 --> 00:05:34.300
They have a full-time
mindfulness coach on staff.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.176
I was in Davos just in
January, and every day,

00:05:38.176 --> 00:05:39.550
the World Economic
Forum actually

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.719
began with an hour of
mindfulness meditation, which I

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.010
thought was just extraordinary.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.300
And I wrote a story about
it, "Amid the chattering

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.400
of the global elite,
a silent interlude."

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.580
And I guarantee you it was about
the only moment in this week

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.280
that people actually
shut up there.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.720
And there, of course, is a
magazine, "Mindful Magazine,"

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.380
detailing all these stories.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.140
So what is mindfulness?

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.710
Well, a common
definition is it's

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.310
paying attention in
a particular way,

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.450
on purpose, in the present
moment, and nonjudgmentally.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.150
And I know that
sounds like a lot.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.480
It's quite a mouthful.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.210
But if you unpack it, I
think it's really just

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.520
about being right
here right now, not

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.530
getting lost in
ruminations about the past,

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.280
unpacking mistakes we
may have just made,

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.749
not getting stuck in
fantasies and preparations

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:32.540
for the future, but
actually just attending

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.570
to the present moment
right here, right now

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.185
instead of letting our minds
essentially carry us away.

00:06:39.185 --> 00:06:40.550
Who's the guy that coined this?

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.630
It's Jon Kabat-Zinn.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.830
He's a molecular
biologist from MIT.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.860
And he's done more than
just about anyone else

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.590
in the last three decades or
so to popularize mindfulness.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.230
He realized when he
was studying to be

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.270
a doctor, that in
fact, mindfulness

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.530
was helping him reduce his
stress, maybe alleviate

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.840
some pain he was having.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.464
So he thought, what would happen
if I brought this to the place

00:07:04.464 --> 00:07:07.090
where the most pain I know
is, which was hospitals.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.077
So he started going to doctors.

00:07:09.077 --> 00:07:11.160
And he said, bring me the
patients who you're just

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.630
not curing, the
ones who are just

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.510
in pain that will not go away.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.540
And he developed a
system called Mindfulness

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.976
Based Stress Reduction, MBSR.

00:07:20.976 --> 00:07:22.820
And what they found
was, again, it

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.284
didn't make the pain go away.

00:07:24.284 --> 00:07:26.450
Of course, the physical
sensations were still there.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.220
The neurons were still firing.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.260
But the stress levels
of these patients

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.660
started to come down just
through that simple attentional

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.870
practice that we
practiced very briefly.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.930
And again, how did he say you
have to cultivate mindfulness?

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.540
Well, unfortunately,
it's meditation.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.880
And I know for a lot of
people, meditation's hard.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.490
And I get it.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.630
It's hard for me, too.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.000
It's not the only way,
but Jon Kabat-Zinn

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.530
reemphasized over and over
that practice matters,

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:57.470
that simple attentional
training-- come on in.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.240
Meditation is actually just a
tool to train our attention.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.140
And when we train
our attention, we

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.710
can have more control over
how we respond to things.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.580
Mindfulness meditation,
we did it briefly.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.080
You set upright
comfortably, feel

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.536
the sensations of your breath,
notice what's happening.

00:08:16.536 --> 00:08:18.660
And then, when your mind
wanders, just begin again.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.350
That's the whole game.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.400
And so again, let's just do
it for 30 seconds right now.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.270
If you're eating, just
put your food down.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.510
If you've got your
phone out, that's fine.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.685
We're just going to sit for
just a few more seconds.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.370
[BREATHES DEEPLY]

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.864
[RINGS BELL]

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:03.410
[RINGS BELL]

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:07.700
OK.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.160
Again, not too painful, I hope.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.330
That's a basic kind of sitting
or standing meditation.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.490
And that's a common practice.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.810
It's easy just to find
a comfortable posture

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.102
and try to focus on the breath.

00:09:20.102 --> 00:09:21.518
But there are other
ways to do it.

00:09:21.518 --> 00:09:23.130
And you can learn
about those at MBSR,

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.450
or I think Google even
has some classes here

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.145
that teach not just
sitting meditation--

00:09:28.145 --> 00:09:31.140
because not everyone's able to
just sit still all the time--

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.850
but walking meditation, or
even things like the body scan,

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:37.410
where we bring that kind
of laser-pointed attention

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.200
to all the different
sensations of our body.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.750
What happens when we start
to do this over time?

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.200
It doesn't happen immediately.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.450
But over time, a lot of
people talk about the movement

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.500
from reaction to response.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.720
So we're bombarded
with stimulus all day.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.940
It can be an email.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.590
It can be a sharp
remark from a colleague.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.560
It can be the call to a meeting.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.140
And so often, we just react.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.920
We don't even take time
to pause and consider

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.850
what we're going to
do next, to consider

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.510
what an appropriate
response might be.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.960
But mindfulness, that
training and attention,

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.250
it's shown over and over that
it gives us just a moment

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.600
to breathe, a moment
to pause, to find

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.670
that appropriate response
before we respond.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.640
So to move from
reaction to response

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.890
can be totally valuable.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:25.790
I find it every day.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.880
Even before I pick
up the phone, I often

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.190
let it ring one or two times.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.510
And the person is always
there after two rings.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.075
But I've given myself
just a moment to calm down

00:10:35.075 --> 00:10:37.130
and to get myself a
little more centered

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.570
and hopefully approach
it not with whatever

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.530
it was I was doing in my mind
when I pick up that phone,

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.910
but with a fresh mind.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.570
Now, mindfulness is an
innate human quality,

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:48.440
I like to call it.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.600
It's something that
we all possess.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.360
It's something every culture
has touched on over the years,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.767
every tradition.

00:10:54.767 --> 00:10:55.350
But it's true.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.880
I don't want to
hide the ball here.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.340
Mindfulness as it's
being practiced today,

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.770
secular mindfulness, Mindfulness
Based Stress Reduction,

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.670
has its origins in
Buddhist practice.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.740
The term mindfulness is kind of
sprinkled across the Buddhist

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.870
teachings like
stars in the night.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.980
And Buddhist meditation
itself is largely

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.422
designed to cultivate an
experience of mindfulness.

00:11:16.422 --> 00:11:18.880
But I can't emphasize enough,
over the last 30 years or so,

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.280
thanks largely to Jon Kabat-Zinn
and some of his peers,

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.390
it's become a purely
secular thing.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.580
What we practice in
these boardrooms, what

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.510
Goldman Sachs is doing,
what you're doing here,

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.060
it is areligious.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.510
It may have drawn
its inspiration

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.930
from Buddhism many
years ago, but it's

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.230
a purely secular practice.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.080
You're not going to find
references to the sutras

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.270
when you go to Search
Inside Yourself.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.670
And this secularization, this
essentially cultural migration,

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.070
which I think is just
a fascinating story,

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:54.700
is what's allowed big companies
to embrace mindfulness.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.679
About 10 days ago, I had a
piece on the cover of the Sunday

00:11:57.679 --> 00:12:00.220
Business Section of "The Times"
that profiled Mark Bertolini.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.130
He's the CEO of Aetna.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.290
It's a Fortune 100 company,
550-some-odd billion

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.040
in revenues, big healthcare
provider in Hartford,

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.110
Connecticut.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.010
And Mark's just got
an amazing story.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.740
About 10 years ago, he
had a skiing accident,

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.410
and it almost killed him.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.610
His vertebrae were
cracked in five places.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.350
The nerves were separated
out from his arm socket.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:24.970
And they thought
not only might he

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:26.600
not live-- the
priest administered

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.630
last rites at the hospital.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.670
But he was so debilitated
when he got back

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.450
that his colleagues
said, you should just

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.400
take early retirement.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.441
You've risen high enough.

00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:35.650
He wasn't quite CEO now.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.090
He was Executive Vice President.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.798
You've risen high
enough in this company.

00:12:38.798 --> 00:12:41.880
Just take the package and work
on taking care of yourself.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.550
But he was persistent.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.190
So he tried
conventional therapies.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.700
He tried OxyContin,
Fentanyl, all sorts of drugs.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.540
None of them worked.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.820
The pain just wouldn't go away.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.650
Finally, he tried a
craniosacral therapy.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:56.510
Then he tried yoga.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:59.250
And these things started to make
a difference where the drugs

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.110
didn't.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.360
He was able to eventually
get off the drugs.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.380
And then he discovered
mindfulness meditation,

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.780
started practicing mindfulness.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:11.060
And in the matter of
months, he suddenly kind of

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.360
had the bounce back in his step.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.360
He was able to really
get past the drugs.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.010
He had four surgeries, of
course, to repair the damage.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.336
But he was able to come back to
work with really renewed vigor.

00:13:21.336 --> 00:13:23.210
Eventually, just around
the financial crisis,

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.840
he became CEO, and he took over.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.680
And at that moment, I think
he kind of had a choice.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.890
He could have said, all right,
what do my investors, what

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.110
do my board members expect.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.734
They expect me to kind of double
down, batten down the hatches,

00:13:35.734 --> 00:13:39.210
get through this tough
period, and see it through.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.560
And he did that on
the performance level.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.240
Aetna's doing better now
than it was five years ago.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.880
But he also said, listen.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.650
This experience I've
had, it's transformed me.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.260
It's given me new
insights into the way

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.539
that alternative therapies
can work to heal people.

00:13:53.539 --> 00:13:55.580
And what are we in the
business of here at Aetna?

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.595
We're in the business
of providing healthcare.

00:13:57.595 --> 00:14:00.550
So he said, let's
start a pilot program,

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.490
just with a few hundred
patients at first,

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:06.690
and offer yoga and
meditation to our employees.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.450
He took this to the
Chief Medical Officer,

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.645
a guy named Lonny Reisman,
very serious clinician.

00:14:10.645 --> 00:14:13.210
He said, I want to offer
mindfulness and meditation.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.125
And Lonny said, heck, no.

00:14:15.125 --> 00:14:16.280
Are you crazy?

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.560
I mean, just because you've done
it, you think we all should?

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.120
Calm down.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.450
And Mark said, OK.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.870
He appealed to the
clinician in Lonny.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.630
He said, let's
measure the results.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.800
We'll work with Duke University.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.680
And self-reported stress
results are notoriously

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.290
kind of fungible,
so why don't we

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.569
measure heart rate variability.

00:14:34.569 --> 00:14:36.110
Why don't we measure
cortisol levels?

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.640
And why don't we just
see what happens?

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.390
They did a 10-week pilot,
yoga and meditation

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:44.950
for about 500 employees.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.200
Then they did all the results.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.200
The self-reported stress,
perhaps unsurprisingly,

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:49.700
went down.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.470
It's nice to take a break
in the middle of the workday

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:52.980
and maybe do a
little gentle yoga.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.670
It's nice to maybe pause and
just quiet down as we did.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.230
But then they checked the data.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:04.280
And the biostatisticians, Mark
told me, they were floored.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.780
Because all the numbers,
the heart rate variability,

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.080
the cortisol, they
all came down.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.160
And so there was
real data that showed

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.910
actually the physiological
impact of this

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.480
was just as real as the
self-reported "I'm feeling

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.990
better at work."
something actually

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.284
seemed to be happening
in these people's bodies.

00:15:22.284 --> 00:15:23.200
So they rolled it out.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.240
They scaled this program with
the help of Duke University.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.580
Rolled it out to thousands
and thousands of people.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.640
They also rolled out a
mindful eating program,

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.390
which is perhaps
appropriate to talk about

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.730
while we're here at lunch.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:39.710
And so they got people focusing
on not only what they were

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.070
eating, but when and
how and what else they

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.660
were doing when
they were eating,

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.200
and how much they were eating.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.670
And they really brought
that fine-grained attention,

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.820
that mindfulness practice,
to the act of eating.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.570
It's something you learn in
some mindfulness classes.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:57.050
And they measured this
over several months.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:01.010
And they found that actually,
in a sampling of overweight

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.990
and obese Aetna
employees who wanted

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.540
to try this intervention as a
potential weight loss therapy,

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.460
it worked.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.650
Just by actually bringing more
mindfulness, more attention

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:13.635
to the act of eating, they found
that they were eating less,

00:16:13.635 --> 00:16:15.530
they were eating
healthier, and they

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.350
were eating fewer times
throughout the day,

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.760
not snacking, just
compulsively eating.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.760
And that, I just want to
offer, is a simple tip.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.635
I know it's not easy.

00:16:22.635 --> 00:16:25.840
I am fully guilty of
scarfing down soup at my desk

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.010
far too many times
during the workweek.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:32.950
But when I find the willpower
essentially to pause

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.760
and actually enjoy a
meal, eat mindfully,

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.910
I find that I eat
less, I eat healthier,

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:42.030
and I frankly enjoy
my food a bit more.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.710
So then an amazing
thing happened.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.940
About a year after
Aetna had really

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:49.700
scaled these programs,
offered it all,

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.674
he was reviewing the 2012
financial performance

00:16:52.674 --> 00:16:53.340
for the company.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.840
And he noticed
something astounding.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.680
In the midst of the
financial crisis,

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.242
healthcare costs at the
company had fallen 7.3%

00:17:00.242 --> 00:17:02.575
in the full year after they
did the mindfulness and yoga

00:17:02.575 --> 00:17:03.590
and prevention.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.910
And by this time, it was
reaching tens of thousands

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:07.460
of employees.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.792
That amounted to $9
million for Aetna.

00:17:09.792 --> 00:17:10.500
And I asked Mark.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.660
I said, are you saying that
yoga and meditation saved you

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.640
$9 million?

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.910
Is it that direct of a line?

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.530
He said no.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.349
We were doing a couple
other wellness interventions

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:20.320
at the time.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.819
We were doing more
health screening.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:24.140
We had this weight
loss program going on.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.114
But, he says, it
has to have helped.

00:17:26.114 --> 00:17:27.280
There's nothing else we did.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.600
And we were measuring it
on a per-employee basis.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.949
So the fact that they
may have hired or fired

00:17:31.949 --> 00:17:33.990
a few people, that wasn't
going to matter either.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.950
And so they've
continued to do it.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.910
And health care
costs now remain well

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.930
below what they were
on a per-employee basis

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.470
before they started
these interventions.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:44.850
Then Mark, he said, OK.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:46.060
It's working here.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.510
13,000, about a third of
the company's workforce,

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:49.870
has now done it.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.630
They've now started working
with other companies

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:53.766
to bring these programs.

00:17:53.766 --> 00:17:55.140
And they're offering
it as a paid

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.930
service, part of their
broader wellness initiative.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:01.660
So all a pretty extraordinary
story of how mindfulness,

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:07.700
yoga actually took hold at
one big Fortune 100 company.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.290
And I thought that was kind
of the end of the story.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.930
I had written all
this for my book.

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:13.130
The book was all done.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:17.010
And then in January, I saw
an extraordinary headline.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:21.780
Mark Bertolini had read this
book over the Christmas break.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.119
He came back to
Aetna in January.

00:18:24.119 --> 00:18:25.660
And he said, I'm
giving all my lowest

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.630
paid workers a 33% raise.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.376
And for these workers
in Tallahassee

00:18:32.376 --> 00:18:34.840
who were making $12 an
hour at a call center,

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.760
a 33% raise was huge.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.070
He announced it at a
meeting down in Florida.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:42.797
People started crying
in the audience.

00:18:42.797 --> 00:18:44.380
And it was this
transformative moment.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.294
He said, I was so moved by
the stories and the arguments

00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:48.960
I read in "Capital
in the 21st Century,"

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.540
this treatise on inequality,
that I couldn't help but not

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.130
do this.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.142
And when I saw Mark, I said, OK.

00:18:55.142 --> 00:18:57.350
But are you saying your
meditation practice-- I mean,

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.325
is there any relation whatsoever
between yoga and meditation

00:19:00.325 --> 00:19:04.140
and giving people a raise.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:04.870
He said, listen.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.260
It's not a direct
line of causation.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.890
But mindfulness has made
me so much more aware

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.470
of what's going on in
my mind and my body,

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.900
and it's also made me more
aware of my impact as a CEO

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.690
and as a business leader,
that when I read this book

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.300
and I considered what was
going on with my employees,

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.900
I couldn't help but
not make this decision.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.010
And now Aetna, true to form,
is working with the Peterson

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:32.040
Institute to help other
multinationals figure

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.300
out would it be actually
economical, might

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.000
it be a good thing, to
raise wages for some

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.110
of the lower paid workers.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:43.590
And even in the last few weeks,
we've seen Walmart follow suit.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.430
Why am I the person up here
telling you this story?

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:47.920
Well, just in brief,
I grew up here

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.170
in San Francisco,
beautiful Bay Area.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.550
Looks pretty appealing
after this winter.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:57.000
And I, as a teenager, was asking
all of life's big questions,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.690
looking for answers, and
getting absolutely nowhere.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.250
And then freshman
year of college,

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.174
I opened up a book
about Buddhism,

00:20:03.174 --> 00:20:04.590
started reading
about mindfulness,

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.740
and suddenly something
started to make sense.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.849
It said, there's
a way to get off

00:20:08.849 --> 00:20:10.140
this hamster wheel of our mind.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.540
There's a way to actually
be in the present moment

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.895
instead of constantly
thinking about the future

00:20:14.895 --> 00:20:17.360
or dwelling in the past.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.520
So I did what any parent
would hope their kid do.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:25.420
I got on a one-way ticket to
India and moved to Bodh Gaya.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.310
I spent my 21st birthday
in a Buddhist monastery,

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:32.730
where saffron robed monks woke
me up every morning at 4:00 AM.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.845
There were peacocks
roaming the courtyard.

00:20:34.845 --> 00:20:36.645
It was a pretty wild place.

00:20:36.645 --> 00:20:38.190
And for about six
months, I stayed

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:41.184
in Bodh Gaya, which is the place
where the Buddha ostensibly

00:20:41.184 --> 00:20:41.850
was enlightened.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.220
That's the Bodhi temple.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.405
That's the tree under
which he ostensibly sat

00:20:45.405 --> 00:20:48.620
or at least a relative,
many generations removed

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.400
from the original, of course.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.020
I studied with Zen masters.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.680
I studied with
Tibetan rinpoches,

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.440
supposedly reincarnated.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.960
And I studied with
this guy, Munindra-ji.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.734
And Anagarika Munindra-ji
is a Bengali man.

00:21:03.734 --> 00:21:05.650
He looks a little like
Gandhi, and weirdly, he

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.370
was a close friend of Gandhi.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:09.880
But he was also one of
the great mindfulness

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.120
teachers of the 20th century.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.940
He instructed a
generation of teachers

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.250
who then, in the mid '70s,
came back to the United States

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.570
and founded some of
the retreat centers

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.950
that would eventually kind
of give birth to this secular

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.860
mindfulness movement
today, teachers

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.110
like Jack Kornfield, Joseph
Goldstein, and Sharon Salzburg.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:31.440
They founded Insight
Meditation Society.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.210
And that's where Jon
Kabat-Zinn was in 1978

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.020
or '79, when he had that
epiphany, when he said, wait.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.160
This might actually help me
reduce my personal stress.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.280
What happens if I take
it to the hospital?

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.130
And I was really fortunate to
spend a fair amount of time

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:49.115
with Munindra-ji during some
of the later years of his life.

00:21:49.115 --> 00:21:51.080
It was an honor.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:55.350
And there I am sitting under
the Bodhi tree with Munindra.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.020
There I am with a
Tibetan rinpoche.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.090
And I think if I
had stayed in India,

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:01.740
this is what I would look like.

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.070
That's Yogi Mike.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.790
He's been in Bodh Gaya
for a very long time.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:07.240
I didn't stay in India.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:07.880
I came back.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.010
I'm now a reporter at
"The New York Times."

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:12.180
I was at the "Financial
Times" before that.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.170
And I've continued to
practice meditation.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.110
I still try to go on
retreat when I can,

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.920
harder now with an
11-month-old and a busy job.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.870
But it's important.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.250
It's important
for me to get back

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.964
to try to remember what it
was like over there in India.

00:22:24.964 --> 00:22:27.380
But instead of retreat centers,
I've spent most of my time

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.088
in places like this,
"The New York Times"

00:22:29.088 --> 00:22:32.040
newsroom, which is one
of the least mindful

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.820
places I know, full of screaming
editors, tight deadlines,

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.890
and angsty reporters.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.440
And it was while
I was at the FT,

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.800
though, that I wrote an
article that actually got me

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.625
to this very stage right now.

00:22:44.625 --> 00:22:46.910
It was called "The
Mind Business."

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:52.145
And what I had done at the FT,
I had recently profiled Zuck,

00:22:52.145 --> 00:22:54.970
I had interviewed
Bernie Madoff in prison,

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:56.940
and I was at a loss
for a good story.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.070
I desperately needed a good
story to sink my teeth into.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.272
And I was kind of frustrated
that I didn't have one.

00:23:02.272 --> 00:23:03.980
And then I was combing
the wires one day,

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.145
and I saw an article
that jumped out at me

00:23:06.145 --> 00:23:07.270
like nothing else ever had.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:09.870
It said, in
Minneapolis, Minnesota,

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.397
a company, General Mills,
was offering meditation

00:23:12.397 --> 00:23:13.105
to its employees.

00:23:13.105 --> 00:23:14.246
And I said, huh.

00:23:14.246 --> 00:23:15.870
And for the first
time, I thought maybe

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:19.010
there was a way to bring these
two disparate parts of my life

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:19.880
together.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.230
So I got on a plane, and I
went out to General Mills.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.160
And this is, you
know, the company

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.700
that makes Haagen-Dazs
ice cream, and Cheerios,

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.710
and Hamburger Helper.

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:31.750
I didn't know what to expect.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.550
I was a little skeptical.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:38.510
Would what they were doing
be anything I recognized?

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:41.970
Would it resemble anything I
had practiced in the centers

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.340
that I'd been going to
for all these years?

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.330
I didn't know.

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:49.820
And then I showed up in this
conference room, 3 o'clock

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.200
on a Tuesday.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.720
And this is several
years ago now.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:58.660
And there was 60 or so-- maybe
not quite that many-- employees

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.580
all practicing
mindfulness meditation.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.800
They were totally silent.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.460
And the woman
leading them seemed

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.250
to know what she
was talking about.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.060
This woman, Janice Marturano,
she was the Deputy General

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.410
Counsel at the time, very
senior lawyer at the company.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.370
She worked on mergers
and acquisitions.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.460
She did the Pillsbury
acquisition.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.871
And in the midst of that
particular deal, a $10 billion

00:24:18.871 --> 00:24:21.120
merger that she was fighting
to get through regulators

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.840
in Washington, both of
her parents passed away.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:28.140
So this personal blow on
top of the stresses of work

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.000
just laid her out.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.319
And she could barely
get back to work.

00:24:33.319 --> 00:24:34.610
A friend suggested mindfulness.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:35.570
She said, no way.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.600
I'm a good Midwestern girl.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.099
No, thank you.

00:24:39.099 --> 00:24:40.890
A few weeks later, they
suggested it again.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:42.020
She was at her wit's end.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:42.900
She said, fine.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.550
She got a plane,
went to Arizona,

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.830
and met Jon Kabat-Zinn.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.295
And Jon Kabat-Zinn kind of
instructed her on mindfulness.

00:24:49.295 --> 00:24:50.670
When he said, for
the first time,

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:52.420
we're going to sit in
silence for an hour,

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.760
she almost got up
and walked away.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.780
And I don't blame her.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:58.644
But five days later, after
kind of gradually becoming

00:24:58.644 --> 00:25:00.810
immersed in this practice,
she didn't want to leave.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:01.309
But she did.

00:25:01.309 --> 00:25:03.240
She came back.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.420
And one by one,
at General Mills,

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.600
people started to notice
that she was a bit changed.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.093
She seemed to, again, have
maybe a little more bounce

00:25:10.093 --> 00:25:10.730
in her step.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.340
She was calm at meetings when
everyone else seemed frazzled.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.550
And they said,
what are you doing.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:15.258
What's different?

00:25:15.258 --> 00:25:16.282
What drugs are you on?

00:25:16.282 --> 00:25:17.990
And she said, I'm
practicing mindfulness.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:19.406
If you're interested,
let me know.

00:25:19.406 --> 00:25:20.830
I'm not pushing it on anyone.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.040
Eventually, she had a quorum.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.180
And they took a small retreat
up at the Fetzer Institute

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.900
in Minnesota.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.720
And they loved it.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.560
People came back, and
they said, we want more.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.940
So it snowballed, just a
very organic, ground-up kind

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.930
of thing.

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:39.930
She felt relatively empowered.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.144
But this wasn't coming
from the C-suite.

00:25:42.144 --> 00:25:44.560
And so they started doing this
mindful leadership training

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.800
at General Mills.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.870
Eventually, it really
started to scale.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.490
There were more people
that she couldn't handle.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.180
She brought in
other instructors.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:55.250
And now, as with Aetna, there
are thousands of meditators

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.080
and a meditation room
in every building.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.860
And Janice, she was
the one that taught

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.560
me that trick with the phone.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.120
And she talks about
these purposeful pauses,

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.550
just taking brief moments
throughout the day

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:09.200
to interrupt our
reactive routines,

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.510
to stop what it is we think
we're just automatically

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:15.430
supposed to do and
instead just pause,

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:18.250
consider the appropriate
response, and then take action.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.990
It's nothing too dramatic, but
it can make a big difference.

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.310
And it's probably
prevented me from getting

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:26.550
in a lot of hot water with
editors and other reporters

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:27.790
over the years.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:29.670
And here are other
General Mills employees

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.760
taking a different kind
of purposeful pause.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.580
I don't necessarily
advocate this

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.560
in the middle of a meeting.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.970
"The Mind Business"
went viral inasmuch

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:43.200
as an FT article behind
a paywall can do.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.360
Everyone wanted to know more.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.650
Where could they
find information?

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:49.020
Who else was doing this?

00:26:52.392 --> 00:26:53.640
What's this is all about?

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.890
And I didn't have the answers.

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:56.660
I was kind of blindsided
by the interest.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.780
And it was at that point
that I realized maybe

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.440
I need to keep
working on this story.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.910
So I got a book
deal, I went out,

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:05.160
and I set out on what I
think of as kind of a journey

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.460
into the contemplative
heart of the working world,

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.670
to the contemplative heart
of corporate America.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.900
Again, didn't know what
I was going to find,

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.860
but was happily surprised.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:17.710
All these companies and
more, in one way or another,

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:20.650
are bringing mindfulness to
bear on their decision-making.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:23.640
Eileen Fisher, Patagonia,
Ford Motor Company,

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.000
Google-- thank you guys
for having me-- BlackRock,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.154
more, Bank of America.

00:27:28.154 --> 00:27:29.570
I mean, the list
goes on, and it's

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:33.417
growing every day, which
is just extraordinary.

00:27:33.417 --> 00:27:35.750
One of the companies I came
across early in my reporting

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.530
was Green Mountain Coffee.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.440
Not great coffee, but an
interesting and influential

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.400
CEO.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.810
Guy's name was Bob Stiller.

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:48.030
And he maybe is actually
a likely candidate

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:48.720
for this stuff.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.445
Before he took over
Green Mountain Coffee

00:27:50.445 --> 00:27:52.570
and turned it into the
multi-billion dollar company

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.792
it is, he founded Easy
Wider Rolling Papers.

00:27:55.792 --> 00:27:58.000
So you get a sense of where
this guy was coming from.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.550
That's him in a picture
taken for "Forbes Magazine,"

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:05.575
meditating on a bag
of coffee beans.

00:28:09.189 --> 00:28:10.980
And essentially, once
he was a billionaire,

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:11.720
he said, what the heck.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.580
Let's roll out
meditation in the office.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.955
Didn't know what
he would expect.

00:28:14.955 --> 00:28:16.380
Brought it first to C-suite.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.220
They all loved it.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.520
They would just take brief
pauses, moment of silence

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.930
before they started a meeting.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:22.054
Loved it.

00:28:22.054 --> 00:28:23.720
Rolled it out then
to middle management,

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.447
to graphic designers, who said
it helped them focus better.

00:28:26.447 --> 00:28:28.280
They were actually able
to stay in the zone,

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.105
doing their creative
work more effectively.

00:28:31.105 --> 00:28:31.980
And then I love this.

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:35.070
About a year, two years into
this program, they said,

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.845
wait a sec.

00:28:35.845 --> 00:28:37.950
It's great that we're
doing this for all

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.450
our C-suite executives
and our white collar,

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:41.810
middle management.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:46.600
But we run dozens of factories
that employ thousands

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.365
of people around the country.

00:28:48.365 --> 00:28:51.830
We have these blue collar
guys roasting these beans,

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.660
packing them in these
heavy bags and boxes,

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.720
driving our trucks delivering
this stuff all over the place.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.110
What do we have to offer them?

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.674
So they worked with
a yoga teacher.

00:29:01.674 --> 00:29:04.090
They brought over the Head of
Wellness from Ben &amp; Jerry's.

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:06.520
And they developed a
mindful stretching routine

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.365
for their factory workers.

00:29:08.365 --> 00:29:10.540
And so every day,
before these guys

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:14.100
start their 12-hour shifts,
they go into their locker room,

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.500
which was once kind of
this kind of rowdy place,

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.150
and they practice mindfulness.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.070
And it's an extraordinary
sight to see,

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:25.640
these very hard-edged, tough--
northern Vermont is where

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:30.130
I was-- guys, bandannas on
their heads, Red Sox hats,

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.820
and all of a sudden, they just
take a few moments and practice

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.040
mindful stretching.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.590
It's a sight to behold.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:38.490
And I actually think that
there's a lesson here.

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:41.880
It's what some people called
your mindfulness zones.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.360
They're just these physical
spaces in your workplace

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.430
that can be prompts
to remember to just do

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:49.760
a quick 30-minute practice.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.290
For me, at times,
it's the elevator.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:54.070
If I get on the elevator and
I'm lucky enough to be alone,

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.785
I actually just don't
look at my phone,

00:29:56.785 --> 00:29:59.160
I don't worry about what's
going to happen when I get off

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.120
at the next floor.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.200
I just try to check in with
my body, feel my breath,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.350
notice what's happening.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.750
Other people say
it's just a corridor.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.870
And I'm sure you all have
your highly trafficked areas

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:11.946
in this building.

00:30:11.946 --> 00:30:13.820
And I would invite you,
if you're interested,

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.670
just pick one and see
over the course of a week

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:20.150
if you can use it as a prompt
to remember to just put away

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.650
your phone, stop the incessant
yakking in our heads,

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:25.765
and just see how you're feeling.

00:30:25.765 --> 00:30:26.890
Some good might come of it.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:28.890
We'll see.

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:30.490
So what does all this get us?

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:32.970
Well, at Aetna, the
data started to come in.

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:34.200
It makes us less stressed.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.590
That's why Jon Kabat-Zinn
focused on Mindfulness Based

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:39.120
Stress Reduction.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.470
There's a study
with a big number--

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:44.240
no faith in the
methodology-- but it

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.780
said that it cost
businesses $300 billion

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:50.270
per year, by the World
Health Organization.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:53.040
Again, no idea what that number
means, but I think the point

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:53.700
is accurate.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.820
And I think we saw it
reflected in Aetna.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.120
Stress is debilitating
in many ways.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.850
It can reduce productivity.

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:03.650
It can make us vulnerable,
susceptible to illness.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:05.900
And to the productivity
point, I forgot to mention it.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:06.580
Aetna.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:07.704
Another thing they noticed.

00:31:07.704 --> 00:31:11.680
They noticed three
key metrics come down.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.170
Stress levels decreased.

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:16.120
Perceived pain levels decreased.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.930
Sleep quality improved.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:22.910
And at Aetna, workers reported
to gain 62 additional minutes

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:24.910
per week of productive time.

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:28.610
And Aetna-- actually,
there's a methodology

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:32.090
I do believe in that they use
to come up with this number.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.270
And they say that that
actually amounted,

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:37.860
they believe, to $3,000
per year per employee.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.080
So again, productivity
perhaps as well.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.430
And that's the focus.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:46.140
Meditation seems to
improve our focus.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.690
A nice way to think about
it is like going to the gym,

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:50.290
to use the Seahawks analogy.

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.020
Just as going and
lifting weights

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.842
kind of improves the muscles in
our biceps perhaps, meditation,

00:31:55.842 --> 00:31:57.550
that training, that
attentional training,

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:59.258
bringing our attention
back to the breath

00:31:59.258 --> 00:32:02.494
over and over, essentially
training for our minds.

00:32:02.494 --> 00:32:04.660
There's a great study that
shows meditation actually

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:06.400
reduces task switching.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.640
So they put office
workers, give them

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.730
a ton of tasks to complete
in a finite amount of time.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:15.610
And non-meditators
switch between tasks

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:17.550
every three, five
seconds, I mean,

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.990
just scrambling to
get things done.

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:23.350
The meditators,
instead, focused on one,

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.780
did it not entirely
to its completion.

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:29.690
But they actually stayed on each
action item for a longer time.

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:32.030
And the results were
pretty dramatic.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:34.380
Mindfulness also seems
to improve our health.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.829
Aetna again showed us this.

00:32:35.829 --> 00:32:37.370
And there are other
studies that show

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:39.600
mindfulness meditation
can actually

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.560
boost the immune system.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:45.210
In an incredible study, they
took psoriasis patients,

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:47.830
gave them the traditional
UV lightbox therapy.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:50.870
And one group kind of did
the traditional therapy.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:53.810
And in the other, gave them
the traditional therapy,

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:57.110
but also gave them mindfulness
meditation instructions

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:59.910
over the course of several
weeks as they were doing this.

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:01.870
And they healed faster.

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:03.310
Amazing.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.110
Mind over matter, perhaps.

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:08.210
In any case, leading
to healthier employees.

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.390
Now all this research
into our brains and bodies

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:13.090
has been accompanied over
the last several decades

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:16.040
by new insights
into what happens

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.480
in the brains of meditators.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.870
For a long time, people
thought about the brains

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:25.100
as essentially
fixed, static items.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.460
Once they evolved, they
were kind of mature.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.062
Then they slowly degraded.

00:33:30.062 --> 00:33:32.520
Recently, though, we found out
that our brains are actually

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.019
plastic.

00:33:33.019 --> 00:33:34.000
They're malleable.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.690
This term
neuroplasticity suggests

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:38.870
that whatever we put
into our brains, whatever

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:40.700
stimulus we present
ourselves with,

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.450
our brains become more
accustomed to that.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:43.762
They're very flexible actually.

00:33:43.762 --> 00:33:45.470
And there are studies
that now show this.

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:48.980
In the minds of meditators,
in the prefrontal cortex--

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:52.040
that's the area associated
with higher order processing.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.789
It's evolutionarily
the newest part

00:33:53.789 --> 00:33:55.580
of our brain, kind of
the part of our brain

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.080
that makes us very human.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.538
In the minds of
meditators, there's

00:33:58.538 --> 00:34:00.960
actually more gray matter.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.970
And in another study that's
been repeated many times,

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:07.570
they show that the amygdala,
this almond-shaped region

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:10.530
near the center of our brains,
controls our stress reaction,

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.790
releases stress hormones.

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:14.469
It's actually less reactive.

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:18.159
There's less cortisol
pumping through the amygdala

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.290
in the minds of meditators.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:22.710
I had my own brain studied.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:23.560
This isn't my brain.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.510
But this shows the
increasing gray matter

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:26.790
in the prefrontal cortex.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:29.458
There I am at Yale
getting my brain scanned.

00:34:29.458 --> 00:34:30.624
And this is what they found.

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:34.080
It's not perfect.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.280
Mindfulness is
definitely no cure-all.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:40.920
So healthier, less stressed,
maybe even a little happier,

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.510
maybe a little more productive.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:45.610
I'd like to offer one more thing
that mindfulness maybe can do.

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:46.929
This is Tim Ryan.

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:51.409
He's a congressman, represents
Ohio's 13th district.

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:55.280
He's a Catholic high school
quarterback from Ohio.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.880
Perhaps not your most likely
advocate for mindfulness.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.990
But in recent years,
that's just what

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:02.840
he's become on Capitol Hill.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.802
He leads the Quiet Time Caucus.

00:35:04.802 --> 00:35:06.010
You may not have heard of it.

00:35:09.709 --> 00:35:11.875
And he wrote a book called
"A Mindful Nation," where

00:35:11.875 --> 00:35:14.360
he really looks at how
to bring mindfulness

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.200
to our schools and our
veterans, in particular,

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:21.000
two of his passions.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.610
I said, Jim, what has
this done for you overall.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:25.910
I mean, I get maybe it's
helped you be less stressed.

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:27.467
But what's the
impact on your work?

00:35:27.467 --> 00:35:29.050
I mean, you still
have to be out there

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:30.320
representing your constituents.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.070
You still have to be
dealing with everyone

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.010
on the other side of the aisle.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.980
He said, mindfulness
has made me slow down.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.710
You actually slow down
enough to pay attention

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:42.350
to someone other than yourself.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:45.390
It's made me a little more
sympathetic, empathetic,

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:46.470
and compassionate.

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:48.640
And I think this is
radical, because so often we

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.200
think about mindfulness
as something

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.900
like, I'm doing to myself
to make me perform better.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.630
But Tim's actually saying it's
not about that in the end.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:59.780
It's about how he can
help other people.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.600
And we saw with
that Aetna as well.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.980
And we see it in the
work of Eileen Fisher.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:09.790
Eileen developed her own very
successful clothing company.

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.900
And she ran a very conventional,
if private, company

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.145
for many years.

00:36:14.145 --> 00:36:15.520
And it was only
several years ago

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.050
that she began
practicing mindfulness.

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:22.400
First yoga, then began
mindfulness meditation.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.920
And initially-- the story
may be familiar now.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.190
She started kind of with
her close associates.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.260
She reorganized the
way they did meetings.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.810
Instead of her sitting at the
head of a conference table,

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:33.990
she got round tables
so-- she calls it

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.910
the circle way, trying to
reduce some of the hierarchy,

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:38.520
value other people's
opinions more.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:42.550
She started offering new
health and wellness initiatives

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:43.950
for her employees.

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.950
And then she had that
same moment that Mark had,

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:48.940
the same moment that Bob
Stiller at Green Mountain had.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.590
She said, what about the
people at the very other end

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:52.830
of my workflow?

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:55.500
What about the people in
China in the factories

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.920
that make all this clothing?

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.196
What do we do for them?

00:36:58.196 --> 00:37:01.180
She said, it's probably
not practical to introduce

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.280
meditation in mainland China.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.810
But how else can I help?

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:09.790
So she improved healthcare
for her workers there.

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:11.540
She improved working conditions.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.970
She started using more
sustainable products,

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:15.631
less toxic dyes.

00:37:15.631 --> 00:37:17.630
And then she started an
entrepreneurship program

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:20.130
for her Chinese workers,
actually giving them

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:22.550
the training to start their
own businesses so they could

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:24.000
actually get out
of her factories

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.216
and start doing their own work.

00:37:28.216 --> 00:37:28.840
So I love this.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:34.740
It's another example of kind
of a top-down initiative, how

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.040
an empowered leader
said, I'm going

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.070
to start changing
the way we work here.

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:41.540
And I'd like to just frame it.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:45.320
There's bottom-up and top-down.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.840
Eileen Fisher, Mark
Bertolini, kind

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.010
of this top-down model
as CEO, saying, here's

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.055
how we're going to
do it, and it scales.

00:37:52.055 --> 00:37:53.180
And then there's bottom-up.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.350
And I think you guys are
kind of a borderline.

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:57.690
I know Meng, who got
the ball rolling here,

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.850
he's one of the early employees.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:02.160
But he really just
started this himself.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:06.740
It wasn't as if Eric or
Larry or Sergey said,

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.157
you're all going
to meditate now.

00:38:08.157 --> 00:38:10.490
It was an organic thing that
started very much like what

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:11.766
happened to General Mills.

00:38:11.766 --> 00:38:14.390
And so people often ask me, how
do I bring mindfulness to work.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:16.210
Well, there's a lot
of ways to do it.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:17.260
And how do we practice?

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.020
Well, I hope I gave
you a couple tips.

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.890
There's just brief meditation
. practice we did earlier.

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:24.520
There's mindful eating.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.120
You can take that
purposeful pause

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.850
before picking up the phone.

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:30.280
Or you can find
your kind of space

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.640
in the office that's maybe
a cue, a reminder just

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.910
to practice.

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:36.430
And so I hope that's
given you kind

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:40.510
of a flavor for how mindfulness
is out there in the world

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:43.450
transforming big businesses,
small businesses.

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:47.480
And now I'm going to
potentially imperil myself.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.930
But I'm going to ask again.

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:53.410
Quick show of hands, show
me again, skeptics 0,

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:55.360
still think it's absolute hokum.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.760
10 is you're signing
up with [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.390
and doing the 2 o'clock
meditation today.

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.550
So if I could just
again, 0 to 10?

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:04.710
Any movement?

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:05.550
Any movement?

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.810
I think I turned a 3
to like a 4 and 1/2.

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:09.650
That's all I ask.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:11.600
I got a 2 to a five.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.790
My work here is done.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:16.510
Mindfulness is no panacea.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:19.450
It maybe can make
us less stressed,

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:22.920
maybe a bit healthier, maybe
a bit more focused, maybe even

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.470
kinder, maybe a bit more
socially responsible.

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:27.830
But it's not going to make
a bad boss behave better.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:30.200
And it's not going
to give us a raise

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.780
overnight just because
we start sitting.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.380
But it's out there.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.620
It's working.

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:36.770
It's spreading.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:38.780
Anderson Cooper did
it on "60 Minutes."

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.120
I hear he's a committed
meditator now.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.854
"Time" magazine featured it.

00:39:42.854 --> 00:39:44.520
Recent companies that
have embraced this

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.770
are Intel and Adobe.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:50.680
And I hope that gives you a
flavor for just how mindfulness

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.390
is spreading through
the working world

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:54.807
and how it might offer
us a new way to work.

00:39:54.807 --> 00:39:55.640
Thank you very much.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.062
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:00.749 --> 00:40:03.040
If there are questions, people
can maybe find their way

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:03.831
to one of the mics.

00:40:06.984 --> 00:40:08.400
If there aren't
any questions, I'm

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.240
going to make us
all meditate more.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:11.740
Yeah.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:12.570
Hi, how are you?

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:13.290
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:14.180
My name is Matt.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.810
I recently started
mindfulness meditation.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.320
I've been very pleased so far.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.240
My question for you is, is
there a place for mindlessness

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.200
in the day to day?

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.810
I know mindfulness is kind of
this-- or some people frame

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:29.620
it as this superior
state of being.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.360
But I guess, is there a
place from alternating

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.300
between the two, or
should one always try

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.829
to be mindful whenever possible?

00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:38.370
Because I feel like,
at least for me,

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:40.120
it's kind of
difficult to maintain

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.201
this always mindful state.

00:40:42.201 --> 00:40:43.700
DAVID GELLES: It's
a great question,

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.470
and it's absolutely hard.

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:47.460
And I think it's not
realistic to expect

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:49.820
ourselves to be always mindful.

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:54.480
I guess what I'd say is
I would try not to create

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:58.370
such a polarization and such a
dichotomy between mindfulness

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:01.470
as this kind of paradigm
of healthy living,

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:07.580
and whatever is not mindfulness
as some reckless state.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:10.920
I think the nature of
the mind is to wander.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:14.730
And the nature of the mind is
to be intrigued by stimulus

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:16.480
and to want to check
our smartphones.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.840
And I'm not suggesting that
we stop doing any of that.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.770
I think what
mindfulness meditators

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:26.100
advocate is that by training our
attention, by giving ourselves

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:30.500
the ability, the potential,
the willpower, essentially,

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.960
to bring ourselves back to
the present moment in very

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:37.960
deliberate ways, good things
can happen in those moments.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:44.250
So I love the
question, and I think--

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:47.650
I want to consider a more
fulsome answer ultimately.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:51.019
But I guess I would start
by trying not to perpetuate

00:41:51.019 --> 00:41:52.560
this myth that
mindfulness is somehow

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.240
this elevated
state that suggests

00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:00.340
every other way of
being is inferior.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.719
Anyone else?

00:42:02.719 --> 00:42:03.260
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:06.120
So I actually-- I read your
article in "The Times" Business

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.590
section about Aetna.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:13.360
And there were several
comments by skeptics.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.860
And my recollection is
that they were actually

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:18.407
people in the
scientific community

00:42:18.407 --> 00:42:19.490
and the medical community.

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:22.950
And I always-- I see that a lot
in articles about mindfulness.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.860
And I was just wondering,
is that sort of an attempt

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:29.740
to sort of balance
being too fervent

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:31.890
and include the skeptical view.

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:34.390
Because I do notice that
trend in almost every article

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:35.720
I read about mindfulness.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:35.840
DAVID GELLES: Yeah.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:36.740
No, it's a great question.

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.610
And here we're just
talking more about kind

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:40.735
of the editorial practices
of "The New York Times."

00:42:40.735 --> 00:42:42.910
But I'll see what I can
do without getting myself

00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:43.920
in trouble.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.840
So in the book, I
include a whole chapter

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.360
on what people are dubbing
McMindfulness, which

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:52.640
is essentially the critics.

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:56.110
They say it's not
based in science.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:59.110
It's denaturing a
robust tradition.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.895
And there's all sorts of reasons
why we shouldn't be doing this.

00:43:01.895 --> 00:43:05.320
And in the article, the
excerpt of the article,

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.450
the Aetna stuff didn't
quite fit neatly with that.

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:09.720
So my editor, she
actually said, we

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.050
need some more skeptical
voices in here.

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:13.760
So I did a few things.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.360
One, I actually
pulled some material

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.470
from that portion of
my book, which I think

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:20.760
is a valid kind of
path of inquiry.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.610
I think it's important
to address the skeptics,

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:27.720
even if to wholehandedly
dismiss them.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.780
And so I did that.

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:30.660
And then I also kind
of went a bit further.

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:34.070
Given that it's "The Times"
and we have high editorial

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:36.450
standards that some
people occasionally

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:39.700
accuse us of false subjectivity,
it was important for us

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.007
to actually get in there
and give some voice to them.

00:43:42.007 --> 00:43:44.090
But even then, I think
you'll find in the article,

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:46.010
I couldn't find
anyone who said, it's

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:48.800
absolutely irresponsible for
businesses to be doing this.

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.116
Some people said the
science is very early.

00:43:52.116 --> 00:43:53.115
And I think that's true.

00:43:53.115 --> 00:43:55.880
I mean, we're kind of in
the first inning of all

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.660
this research and exploration.

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:01.320
But I still have
yet to find someone

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.410
who says it's actually
harmful to introduce

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:06.050
these things in the workplace.

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:07.183
So I hope that helps.

00:44:07.183 --> 00:44:07.836
Yeah.

00:44:07.836 --> 00:44:08.336
Hi.

00:44:08.336 --> 00:44:08.877
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:08.877 --> 00:44:10.260
I'm Amy.

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.440
Thanks for coming today.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.320
My question is what
do you think is

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:19.110
lost in the secularization
of mindfulness.

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:20.860
I started in a
Shambala tradition,

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:25.050
and I found that the philosophy
was-- like, I almost liked

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:27.660
that part better than sitting.

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:30.160
And as someone who's
studied in probably

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.680
more of a spiritual
tradition, what

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.390
do you think about the
loss of all that philosophy

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:37.120
in taking it to
corporate America?

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:37.490
DAVID GELLES: Right.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:38.406
It's a great question.

00:44:38.406 --> 00:44:41.530
I'm actually-- before
I got on stage here,

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:44.070
I was having some angstiness
because I'm in the midst

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:47.780
of a heated debate on email with
a guy who's-- he's come after

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:48.280
me.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:52.340
And he really thinks that
offering and promoting

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:55.200
secular mindfulness
can actually do harm,

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.410
and it actually is a way of
reinforcing the self instead

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:00.120
of kind of breaking
down the self,

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.180
as the origins of these
traditions would suggest we do.

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:06.110
And what I say to
that is, I don't

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:07.990
think anything's
getting lost, because I

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:12.220
think this is something other
than the Shambala tradition.

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:14.860
And this is something
other than the Buddhism

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.110
that I studied in India.

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:18.640
And this is something
other than what

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.890
this guy is expecting of me.

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:26.320
And can this, can
mindfulness, can

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.200
secular mindfulness essentially
be a first step on a longer

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.030
journey?

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:31.030
Sure.

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:33.970
But I'm not here trying
to offer a Trojan

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:35.280
horse to Buddhist meditation.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.640
I don't think that's
what this is about.

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.430
Instead, what I think
is-- mindfulness

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:42.680
can help in all sorts
of very practical ways.

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.510
And if it can make
people a little less

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:47.700
stressed and a little
healthier and a little kinder,

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.680
and if it can reduce
suffering on the margins

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.990
and make businesses behave
a bit more responsibly,

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:56.300
I don't see how we
can argue with that.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.720
And no one I've found is
presenting secular mindfulness

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.680
as essentially kind of
traditional Buddhism

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:03.410
in disguise.

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:06.430
And I guess that's where
I would take umbrage with.

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:09.300
This notion that these are
exactly the same things,

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.680
I think, is how we
start to get in trouble.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.590
Instead, I recognize that
they're really robust,

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:18.180
really rich, and
wonderful traditions,

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:21.220
and that secular mindfulness,
Mindfulness Based Stress

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.860
Reduction, what's being
practiced here and Goldman

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:27.590
Sachs, it may have originally
taken its inspiration from some

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:29.990
of these practices,
but I don't think

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:32.820
it's trying to accomplish
the same goals either.

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:35.410
But if it can, again, help
on the margins, that's

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:36.591
a good thing, I'd say.

00:46:36.591 --> 00:46:37.340
I hope that helps.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:37.965
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:37.965 --> 00:46:39.470
Thanks.

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:41.334
DAVID GELLES: Hi.

00:46:41.334 --> 00:46:43.530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:46.450
You sort of lumped in yoga
together with meditation.

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:51.180
And I had a question
specifically about that.

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:55.070
I completely buy that yoga
works and that meditation works.

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:56.720
But the reason it
works, in my mind,

00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:00.050
is because yoga, for example,
is a form of exercise.

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:03.320
Is there any study
that compares yoga

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.620
versus more traditional
forms of exercise

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.909
and what's more effective there?

00:47:07.909 --> 00:47:10.200
DAVID GELLES: I don't know
the answer to that question,

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.910
but you're right to
call me out on kind

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:13.970
of lumping things together.

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:16.570
What happens here--
mindfulness becomes

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:18.610
kind of a very vague term.

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:20.256
And in fact, I have
a whole passage

00:47:20.256 --> 00:47:21.880
in the book where I
kind of try to come

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.590
to terms with what it is
we're actually talking about.

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:26.320
I will say all the
studies I pointed

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.430
to and all the research
that I include in my book

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:32.360
is mostly about Mindfulness
Based Stress Reduction or kind

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.570
of pure mindfulness
attentional training,

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:36.200
what we practiced earlier on.

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.760
Where yoga comes in--
it's often essentially--

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.610
it's how people find
out about mindfulness.

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:42.910
It's how both Mark and
Eileen Fisher, for example,

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:44.140
came to the practice.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:47.570
And at Aetna, in some of the
studies, in some of the data

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:51.340
they did, they lumped together
the results from both yoga

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.340
and meditation practice.

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.620
But I try to be
pretty deliberate

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:57.820
about differentiating
between the two.

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.660
Nonetheless, for kind
of a lay audience,

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:05.390
it's often easy and
kind of helpful to group

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:09.740
these complementary practices,
as they're known, together.

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:11.680
I don't know the answer
to the yoga question.

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.490
There's actually a
great book by a guy

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:15.696
named Bill Broad about yoga.

00:48:15.696 --> 00:48:17.070
He's a "New York
Times" reporter.

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:18.220
I see people wandering out.

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:19.160
I don't have a clock.

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.174
So maybe we'll take
one more question.

00:48:21.174 --> 00:48:22.090
But I hope that helps.

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:25.171
I can give you name of that book
after the talk if that helps.

00:48:25.171 --> 00:48:25.671
Hi.

00:48:25.671 --> 00:48:26.110
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:26.984
Thank you for coming.

00:48:26.984 --> 00:48:29.700
I had a question specifically
about the meditation part.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:33.610
Once you decide to set aside
that time, what have you found

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:36.860
is effective for not
actually just continuing

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:38.865
those practices of either
dwelling on the past

00:48:38.865 --> 00:48:40.240
or just worrying
about the future

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.552
and just carrying that same
behavior into that time

00:48:42.552 --> 00:48:43.510
that you've carved out.

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:47.490
So are there recommended phrases
you're supposed to meditate on?

00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:50.200
Or how do you recommend not
just doing the same thing,

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.160
but just sitting down
in a quieter space.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:52.951
DAVID GELLES: Yeah.

00:48:52.951 --> 00:48:54.590
It's hard, no doubt about.

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:57.240
Mindfulness meditation
is, I should add,

00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.554
one of a variety of
meditative techniques.

00:48:59.554 --> 00:49:00.970
There's transcendental
meditation.

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:02.490
There's mantra meditations.

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:04.680
So mindfulness meditation
doesn't necessarily

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.510
use any phrases.

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:10.380
Instead, the goal,
essentially, the practice

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:13.570
is just finding those moments,
essentially remembering.

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:18.010
And actually, that's one
Sanskrit interpretation

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:18.515
of the word.

00:49:18.515 --> 00:49:19.890
The Sanskrit word
for mindfulness

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:21.840
is actually remembering--
so remembering

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.160
to come back to the present
moment over and over and over.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.120
I wish I had a shortcut,
but what I would say

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.416
is it doesn't have to
be five minutes or 30

00:49:30.416 --> 00:49:32.415
minutes every day for an
extended period, amount

00:49:32.415 --> 00:49:33.160
of time.

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.701
I was talking to
[INAUDIBLE] earlier.

00:49:34.701 --> 00:49:37.720
It's the short moments many
times throughout the day--

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:41.280
can be just as impactful
as a month-long retreat,

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.219
for example.

00:49:42.219 --> 00:49:42.760
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:43.260
Thank you.

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:44.610
DAVID GELLES: Yeah.

00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:45.530
Thank you all so much.

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:47.110
You guys have made my day.

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:48.830
Thank you.
