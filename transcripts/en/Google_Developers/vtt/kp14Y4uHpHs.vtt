00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.976
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.380
SPEAKER: Do you ever wish to
create a very, very custom user

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.700
interface?

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.310
With Flutter you have access
to low level paint calls.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.520
These are fast and
efficient, and let

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.470
you build slick graphics.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.620
For example, the Material
ink ripple effect

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.780
is implemented using a circle.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.440
First, add a CustomPaint
widget to your widget tree.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.220
Give it a size and a painter.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.530
Then implement your painter.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.400
It's a simple class that extends
CustomPainter and implements

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.780
two methods--

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.120
paint and shouldRepaint.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.000
The shouldRepaint method is
called when the CustomPainter

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.970
is rebuilt. You can
tell the framework

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.020
to reuse the previous
result of paint.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.370
The paint method is where
you get your canvas,

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.260
and are free to draw.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.210
You can draw lines, rectangles,
circles, arcs, paths, bitmap

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.200
images, nine patches--

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.110
even paragraphs of text.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.990
And you have full control
on how to paint these--

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.380
colors, shaders,
blend modes, and more.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.920

and all the other widgets,
