00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.443
Cedar Wright:<i> Yeah there's
 tons of pain, exhaustion,</i>

00:00:11.443 --> 00:00:14.580
<i> but the same time there's
 a lot of beauty, and laughter,</i>

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.883
<i> and really special moments,</i>

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:21.120
<i> and it all combines into this
 unforgettable life experience.</i>

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.390
<i> Woo! Yeah!</i>

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:29.495
( applause )

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:31.230 line:0%
So, how does a...

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.298 line:0%
...a little kid, well,
named Cedar Wright--

00:00:33.298 --> 00:00:35.101
Obviously hippie parents, right?

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:38.905
<i> ...and an amazing dresser
 later in life become...</i>

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:39.905
( audience laughter )

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:42.875
...the superman of rock
climbing, that I am today?

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:47.046
Well, actually,
some people might
disagree with that statement.

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:50.382
<i> But basically it started
 for me in Yosemite Valley.</i>

00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:51.884
<i> I started out living
 in my truck.</i>

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:55.287
<i> And doing, kind of,
 what climbers call
 "the dirt-bag existence".</i>

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:57.223
<i> And that basically involves,
 you know,</i>

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.592
<i> diving in dumpsters,
 surviving on next to nothing</i>

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:01.860
<i> and climbing all the time</i>

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.529
<i>in this place, Yosemite Valley.</i>

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:07.867
<i> And I soon got a job on
 Yosemite Search and Rescue.</i>

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:11.104
<i>And this is my first sponsorship
 in a way. It was...</i>

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.439
<i> it was a way for me to live
 full time in Yosemite Valley.</i>

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.742
Occasionally, I would
perform a rescue,

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.677
help drag somebody
off a cliff or

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:20.079
carry somebody down with a
sprained ankle from a trail.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.017
<i> It allowed me to really hone
 my craft as a climber.</i>

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.018
<i> And because I had
 my Bachelor's in English,</i>

00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:28.721
<i> I started to write about
 my exploits and tell stories.</i>

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:32.091
And this led eventually
to climbing sponsorship.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.460
I actually convinced some...

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.962
companies that they
should sponsor me,

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:37.930
including The North Face.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.166
<i> That would really kinda
 transform my whole life.</i>

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.301
<i> It allowed me to travel
 the world</i>

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:45.938
<i> and have these incredible
 adventures all over the globe.</i>

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:49.976
<i>And also do some really sketchy,
 awesome stuff like this.</i>

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:52.878
<i> This was in the Ukraine.</i>

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:56.315
( audience gasps )

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:58.150
This is a 600-foot fall.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.553
( audience gasps )

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:03.422
And actually the rope breaks,
so I'm gonna--

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:04.624
I don't want you
guys to see...

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:05.724
( audience laughter )

00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:06.993
...the next part.

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:09.295
But I...
I had a remarkable recovery

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.498
and I'm here with us today.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.234
Eventually that led
into filmmaking.

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:16.602
<i> Because I had appeared
 in some films,</i>

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:18.971
<i> I started to be really
 interested in how
 that all worked.</i>

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:21.240
<i> And I started working
 with a bunch of my friends and</i>

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.342
<i> shooting a bunch
 of really good climbers.</i>

00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:24.977
And also Alex Honnold.

00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:26.245
And...

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:29.215
( audience laughter )

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:31.017
...you have to wonder how
this like, you know,

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:32.618
extreme badass,

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:35.788
legendary free-soloist
and all round rock god

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.189
came from this.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.291
( audience laughter )

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:41.027
<i> - You know?
 -</i> Alex:<i> Yeah, yeah.</i>

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:43.229
<i> He is...
 I wonder myself</i>

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.497
<i> and then got to...</i>

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.132
<i> got eventually to this.</i>

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.136
Alex:<i> Climbing Half Dome took
 me two hours and 15 minutes.</i>

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:51.871
<i> And it's hard to
 be completely focused</i>

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:54.174
<i> and completely on
 your game for that long.</i>

00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:04.050
<i> Basically, when I'm soloing,</i>

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.084
<i> Normally I have almost,
 like, a mental armor.</i>

00:03:06.084 --> 00:03:08.054
<i>You could say I am in the zone.</i>

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:09.655
<i> I have something that's,</i>

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:12.658
<i> let's say, protecting my
 head from thinking too much.</i>

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:14.827
And for whatever
reason on Half Dome

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:16.930
I ran out of whatever
armor I had.

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:34.747
<i> I found myself like
 1800-feet off the ground.</i>

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:36.649
I was like,
"What am I doing up here?

00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:38.917
Why am I doing it?"
You know,

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:41.788
just all the questions
all a sudden entered my mind.

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:50.129
<i> I think doubt is probably
 the biggest danger in soloing.</i>

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.931
Because basically as
soon as you start to hesitate

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:53.299
then you're screwed.

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.134
Alex: Just a sec.
I'm freaking out actually.

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:00.240
Alex:<i> I just had this, like,
 mini-nervous breakdown.</i>

00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:04.077
<i> I never had anything
 quite like that happen before.</i>

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.448
Cameraman: Just come back if
you're not feeling it.

00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:11.384
Alex: Right. That's the thing,
Is I'm like...

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:17.156
Alex:<i> Nothing really happened.</i>

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.790
<i> It just all happened
 inside my head,</i>

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.093
<i> while I stood there
 for a few minutes.</i>

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.429
<i> At some point in there I just
dealt with whatever was going on</i>

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:24.564
<i> and then just climbed it.</i>

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:29.835
<i> Yeah, it was cool to, like,
 escape, you know,
 my little prison.</i>

00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:33.773
<i>I haven't had a moment of panic
like that in a really long time.</i>

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:36.542
I was like...
( panicked breathing sounds )

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.658
<i> Once I made that move
 and was suddenly into
 the easier terrain,</i>

00:04:52.658 --> 00:04:54.093
<i> it was fantastic.</i>

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:56.596
<i> And I just charged the summit.</i>

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:16.048
So, that looked
pretty mellow, Alex.

00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:18.217 line:0%
- Looks pretty chill.
- Yeah, super mellow.

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:20.753 line:0%
Yeah, yeah, thanks Cedar
for that rousing intro.

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:22.021 line:0%
- That was a delight.
- ( audience laughter )

00:05:22.988 --> 00:05:24.256
<i>Like you said, I mean, I guess,</i>

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:27.025
<i> I'm predominantly known as
 a free-soloist but...</i>

00:05:27.025 --> 00:05:28.927
<i> in reality I spend probably
 95 percent of my time</i>

00:05:28.927 --> 00:05:31.196
climbing with a rope,
with partners.

00:05:31.196 --> 00:05:32.531
You know, just doing
conventional climbing.

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:34.033
I grew up climbing in a gym.

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:36.569
<i> And so, this represents like a
 very small percentage
 of my climbing</i>

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.203
<i> even though it makes
 all the best photos.</i>

00:05:38.203 --> 00:05:40.405
<i> And part of what has drawn
 me to this kind of soloing,</i>

00:05:40.405 --> 00:05:41.707
<i>and being up on walls like this,</i>

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:43.776
<i> is just sort of the adventure.
 Like, this is sort of</i>

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:46.079
<i> the adventure end of the
 rock-climbing spectrum.</i>

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.412
I wouldn't say it's uncertain
because obviously

00:05:47.412 --> 00:05:48.548
I'm not like going up
on these walls

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:50.616
just rolling the dice being
like, "Let's see what happens."

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:51.717
You know,
there's a lot of confidence,

00:05:51.717 --> 00:05:53.252
I know I can climb these

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:54.754
<i> but it still feels
 quite adventurous.</i>

00:05:54.754 --> 00:05:55.821
<i> You're still alone
 in this position</i>

00:05:55.821 --> 00:05:57.156
<i> where you're like,
 "This is pretty amazing,</i>

00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:58.757
<i> I can't believe I'm here."</i>

00:05:58.757 --> 00:06:01.828
<i> And so, that feeling of
 adventure, like, that I get
 from soloing</i>

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.996
<i> and this kind of stuff,
 is kind of what led us</i>

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:05.964
<i> into Sufferfest One,
 which is a bike tour</i>

00:06:05.964 --> 00:06:07.800
<i> that we did two years ago now.</i>

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.270
<i> And we climbed the 15,
14,000-foot peaks in California,</i>

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.404
<i> as a bike tour.</i>

00:06:12.404 --> 00:06:14.006
<i> But so you can see
 this is Mount Whitney</i>

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:15.474
<i> and the Keeler Needle
 next to it.</i>

00:06:15.474 --> 00:06:18.210
<i> And that's, you know,
the tallest peak in California.</i>

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.013
<i> Looking at those peaks
 you can see it's, like,
 big granite walls,</i>

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:23.082
<i> lots of scrambling,
 lots of climbing.</i>

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:26.919
And so, for our bike tour
we basically soloed
whichever routes,

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.588
you know, inspired us, like,
on all these 14,000-foot peaks.

00:06:29.588 --> 00:06:31.791
And, you know, that's kind of
getting back to the

00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:33.959
<i> adventurous routes of
 climbing for us, you know?</i>

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:35.928
<i> It was cool to, like,
 get on bikes,</i>

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:37.330
<i> even though we don't
 know anything about them</i>

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.432
<i> and then go climb these
 mountains in kind of a</i>

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:40.633
<i> cool and new way.</i>

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:41.767
Cedar:<i> Yeah.</i>

00:06:41.767 --> 00:06:43.269
And then I was all, "Alex,

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:45.438
we should do Desert Towers

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:46.572
in the Four Corners.

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:47.873
<i> It'd be epic.
 You know, it's like...</i>

00:06:47.873 --> 00:06:50.909
<i> every tower is, like,
 super unique."</i>

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:53.145
And in the meantime,
over the last few years,

00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:54.713
I've started the
Honnold Foundation,

00:06:54.713 --> 00:06:56.382
which is sort of like
an environmental non-profit

00:06:56.382 --> 00:06:59.351
<i>and just my way of giving money
 back to environmental groups</i>

00:06:59.351 --> 00:07:01.587
<i>that improve standard of living.</i>

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:05.357
And I've been sort of
looking for a hands-on
project to support

00:07:05.357 --> 00:07:07.492
because I've just been giving
grants to other non-profits.

00:07:07.492 --> 00:07:09.194
And this seemed like
a perfect opportunity

00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:12.498
because Cedar's idea
of doing Desert Towers

00:07:12.498 --> 00:07:14.433
<i> works in really nicely
 with the Navajo Reservation.</i>

00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:16.135
<i> This is in Monument Valley,
 which is basically the</i>

00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:18.036
<i> most dense cluster
 of desert towers,</i>

00:07:18.036 --> 00:07:20.372
<i> the most iconic desert
 towers in the whole country.</i>

00:07:20.372 --> 00:07:22.975
But, at the same time
there are 18,000 Navajo living

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:25.277
without access to
power in this region.

00:07:25.277 --> 00:07:26.412
And so...

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:28.614
I found the opportunity to
support this group,
Elephant Energy,

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:30.249
which does installation,

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:32.318
well, solar installation
work with Navajo.

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:33.886
And it seemed like
a perfect opportunity

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:35.721
to kind of tie that together
with the climbing trip.

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:36.922
You know,
make it like a nice adventure

00:07:36.922 --> 00:07:38.758
but give it slightly
more of a purpose.

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:40.492
And, I mean,
it made for a really nice

00:07:40.492 --> 00:07:42.028
final destination to wind up

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:44.896
on the Navajo Reservation
with these epic towers.

00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:46.732
And it just--
It sort of made sense,

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:49.435
and so we're like,
"All right, let's try to make
this happen."

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:52.938
I look good in spandex.
Oh, yeah.

00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:56.641
Cedar:<i> I threw out the idea
 of a tower bagging tour.</i>

00:07:56.641 --> 00:07:57.810
<i> And Alex was stoked on that</i>

00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:00.880
<i> because he's been doing a
 bunch of alternative energy
 non-profit work</i>

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.248
<i> and we would be climbing
 on the Navajo Nation</i>

00:08:03.248 --> 00:08:05.517
<i> where he wanted to
 do a solar installation.</i>

00:08:05.517 --> 00:08:07.653
<i> And so we put
 together an itinerary</i>

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:10.056
<i> of 45 of the raddest
 towers in the desert,</i>

00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:12.424
<i> and planned to basically
 bike over 800 miles</i>

00:08:12.424 --> 00:08:14.694
<i>starting in Southwest Colorado,</i>

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:16.028
<i> moving into Utah,</i>

00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:17.229
<i> popping over to New Mexico</i>

00:08:17.229 --> 00:08:18.831
<i> and then finishing the trip
 in Arizona,</i>

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.466
<i> where we would be
 doing our solar project.</i>

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.903
So, I thought it would be
appropriate that we would start

00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:26.572
our mission with the
first desert tower ever climbed.

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:28.774
Nice. It's begun.

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:31.410
- Oh, yeah.
- All right, summit one.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.080
Now we're headed over to
The Medicine Man over yonder.

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:36.515
Cedar:
<i>The attraction of desert towers</i>

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:38.751
<i> is that not only are
 they beautiful but, you know,</i>

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:41.386
<i> it's a summit. It's more than
 just, like, enjoying climbing.</i>

00:08:41.386 --> 00:08:42.788
<i> It's about getting to the top.</i>

00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:44.924
<i> To me they call out to
 be climbed.</i>

00:08:46.458 --> 00:08:48.427
Alright, Honnold, I'm off belay.

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:50.662
Oh, yeah!

00:08:50.896 --> 00:08:52.064
Cedar:
<i> So, we're stoked, two down.</i>

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:54.767
<i> Now we just have to ride
 80 miles to the Fisher Towers.</i>

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:58.270
Alex:<i> We think we would've
 learned from our last mission</i>

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.106
<i> not to just blindly follow
 Google Bike directions.</i>

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.275
We went the wrong way already.

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:04.843
- We're off to a...
- Well, it's like...

00:09:04.843 --> 00:09:07.412
- is that surprising?
- No.

00:09:07.412 --> 00:09:09.882
Cedar:<i> True to form,
we ended up instantly off route,</i>

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:12.751
<i> and biking for 15 miles</i>

00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:15.788
<i> of mountain biking
 on hybrid bicycles.</i>

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:18.290
Alex:<i> We sort of envision
 this trip being like</i>

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.691
<i> great climbing on good rock.</i>

00:09:19.691 --> 00:09:21.660
<i> Then starting on
 day two we were, like,</i>

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.929
<i> in straight choss
 in the Fisher Towers.</i>

00:09:24.596 --> 00:09:26.832
<i> Choss is pretty much
 the catch-all term for</i>

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:30.536
<i> loose rock, or things
 falling off, or things that
 are coated in mud.</i>

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:33.172
<i> I mean, Choss is, like,
 the inclusive term for
 all things bad</i>

00:09:33.172 --> 00:09:34.172
<i> about rock climbing.</i>

00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:36.174
Cedar:<i> As a testament to the
quality of rock in the Fisher's,</i>

00:09:36.174 --> 00:09:38.811
<i> less than three months
 after we climbed Cobra Pillar</i>

00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:39.946
<i> it fell over.</i>

00:09:45.417 --> 00:09:46.952
Whoo!

00:09:46.952 --> 00:09:48.153
Alex:<i> Pretty amazing.</i>

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:50.189
Cedar:<i> That evening
 after climbing the Titan</i>

00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:52.558
<i> we hopped on our bikes
 and rode about 20 miles</i>

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:53.692
<i> over to Castle Valley.</i>

00:09:54.593 --> 00:09:56.362
<i> I think it was on
 the ride over to Castleton</i>

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:58.730
<i> that I realized how screwed
 I was.</i> ( laughs )

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.232
<i> We'd climbed seven towers,</i>

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:03.569
<i> biked over a hundred miles,
 and I was worked.</i>

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:06.338
<i> And this was day three
 of a three-week trip.</i>

00:10:06.338 --> 00:10:08.373 line:0%
Alex:<i> The thing with everything
 on this trip though is that</i>

00:10:08.373 --> 00:10:10.242 line:0%
<i> you're like,
 "Urgh, this is so hard."</i>

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:12.111 line:0%
<i> And then it gets worse.
 And you're like,</i>

00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:14.980 line:0%
<i> "Urgh, now we are
 really building character."</i>

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.516
And we got cell service
and we got a text from

00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:18.617
one of our friends saying,

00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:21.119
"FYI. There's a strong wind
advisory for tomorrow.

00:10:21.119 --> 00:10:24.489
Gusts up to 55 miles an hour.
Sandstorm."

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.391
Cedar:<i> It could be fine.</i>

00:10:26.391 --> 00:10:28.127
<i> How bad could it be?</i>

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:31.497
( strong gusts of wind )

00:10:33.665 --> 00:10:36.335
Alex:<i> I can see
 a wall of sand and dust.</i>

00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:39.237
<i> Raging with the wind you
 can see a wall of rain
 coming towards us.</i>

00:10:39.237 --> 00:10:40.272
<i> We just stood on the summit</i>

00:10:40.705 --> 00:10:43.075
<i> and when you lifted your
 hand, it went "buzz",
 electricity style.</i>

00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:44.709
It's time to get
down off this tower.

00:10:44.709 --> 00:10:47.045
Cedar:<i> Things are getting grim
 up here.</i>

00:10:47.045 --> 00:10:48.214
<i> It's been a long day.</i>

00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:50.716
Alex: Oh, no!

00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:52.651 line:0%
Cedar: And then Honnold almost
rode off the cliff.

00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:54.386 line:0%
Dude, you got f****** worked.

00:10:54.386 --> 00:10:55.788 line:0%
Can you see my buttocks?

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:56.989 line:0%
<i> That was...</i>

00:10:57.689 --> 00:10:59.624 line:0%
I told you I went down
kinda hard.

00:10:59.624 --> 00:11:01.927
It got my arm, got my whole leg.

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:04.363
<i> Oh, my God, dude,
 your ass is like ripped open.</i>

00:11:05.697 --> 00:11:07.032
That is not good.

00:11:07.032 --> 00:11:08.968
<i> Dude, that lower one is bad.</i>

00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:11.504
Is it wrong for me to say,
"better you than me?"

00:11:14.673 --> 00:11:17.843
Sufferfest was...
Sufferfest today.

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:20.245
Cedar:
<i>I found out on these trips that,</i>

00:11:20.245 --> 00:11:22.180
<i> you know,
 there's gonna be these moments</i>

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.916
<i> that're just really heinous.</i>

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.217
<i> But at the same time</i>

00:11:25.217 --> 00:11:28.320
<i> there are also some unexpected
and amazing things that happen.</i>

00:11:29.054 --> 00:11:30.956
<i> So, there I am on the highway,</i>

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:33.391
<i> I gotta take a leak,
 so, I just pull over randomly</i>

00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:35.193
<i>and I walk out into the desert,</i>

00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:39.031
<i> and I hear this whimpering
 sound to my left.</i>

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:42.168
Cedar: Well, we found a puppy
in a ditch

00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:44.269
and, like, gave him a
place to sleep last night.

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:46.238
<i> Somebody just threw
 him on the side of the road.</i>

00:11:46.238 --> 00:11:47.807
<i> It's super grim.</i>

00:11:49.074 --> 00:11:51.010
( laughs )

00:11:51.977 --> 00:11:54.579
Cedar:<i> Poor little guy.
 Little Sufferpup.</i>

00:11:54.579 --> 00:11:56.281
<i> What have we got rocking here?</i>

00:11:56.281 --> 00:11:58.083
Alex:<i> Oh, we got some...</i>

00:11:58.083 --> 00:12:00.352
We're making dog
kennels here now.

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:02.354
( laughs )

00:12:03.155 --> 00:12:05.056
Come out, pup.

00:12:05.056 --> 00:12:06.191
Cedar: Sufferpup.

00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:07.926
Cedar:<i> With our new buddy
 Sufferpup in tow,</i>

00:12:07.926 --> 00:12:10.062
<i> we headed to Indian Creek,</i>

00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:13.399
<i> which is the Mecca
for crack-climbing in the world.</i>

00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:18.870
Cedar:<i> This, like,
 red sandstone desert out here</i>

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.639
<i> in the Four Corners</i>

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:23.442
<i> is some of the most beautiful
 land in the world.</i>

00:12:23.442 --> 00:12:25.143
<i> It's really just
 something to behold.</i>

00:12:25.143 --> 00:12:26.946
<i> And that's why I
 love doing these trips</i>

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:29.581
<i> is to really embed
 yourself in the landscape,</i>

00:12:29.581 --> 00:12:31.316
<i> to really slowly move
 through it,</i>

00:12:31.316 --> 00:12:33.685
<i> so you can really appreciate
 just what a beautiful</i>

00:12:33.685 --> 00:12:36.121
<i> and incredible place this is,
 you know?</i>

00:12:36.121 --> 00:12:37.889
<i> Now we're going to be
 entering the Navajo Nation</i>

00:12:37.889 --> 00:12:39.658
<i> and then we'll
 climb a few more towers</i>

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:42.294
<i> and then start working
 on our solar project.</i>

00:12:42.294 --> 00:12:45.197
Alex:<i> The climbing on this trip
really culminated in the Whale.</i>

00:12:45.197 --> 00:12:46.966
<i> It was almost like our
 final exam</i>

00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:50.269
<i> because it combined horrific
 choss and horrific weather,</i>

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:52.804
<i> and this one just really
 horrible experience.</i>

00:12:52.804 --> 00:12:54.939
Cedar: Whoo!

00:12:55.373 --> 00:12:58.944
Tower number 45,
hard to believe.

00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:01.246
Alex: Well,
that just made us men.

00:13:01.246 --> 00:13:03.882
I think I just felt, like,
four hairs sprout out
of my chest.

00:13:03.882 --> 00:13:05.417 line:0%
Cedar:<i> These are the moments
 that kinda make these trips</i>

00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:07.852 line:0%
<i> awesome in the end,
 I tell myself.</i>

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.889 line:0%
Oh, my ******* God!

00:13:10.889 --> 00:13:12.057
Thank God it's over, dude.

00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:13.792
I'm going to throw my bike out
in traffic real quick.

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:15.694
( laughter )

00:13:15.694 --> 00:13:19.031
I hope I never have to
get on it again.

00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:21.600
Cedar:<i> The entire trip
Alex and I joked about suffering</i>

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.867
<i> and how heinous it was.</i>

00:13:22.867 --> 00:13:26.071
<i> But the reality is, is that
 this is kind of a luxury.</i>

00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:29.308
<i> We're lucky to be able to
 electively suffer like this.</i>

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:31.977
<i> And one thing we talked about
 at the start of this journey</i>

00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:34.345
<i> was that we really wanted
 to finish it off in a way</i>

00:13:34.345 --> 00:13:35.647
<i> that acknowledged that fact.</i>

00:13:36.548 --> 00:13:38.049
Alex:<i> The thing is,
 our trip is probably easier</i>

00:13:38.049 --> 00:13:39.785
<i>than most people's normal lives.</i>

00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:40.786
<i> Just in Northern Arizona</i>

00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:43.956
<i> there are 18,000 Navajo
 with no access to electricity.</i>

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.458
Cedar:<i> One of the cool things
 about this trip was</i>

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:48.159
<i> that we got to visit
 one of the projects</i>

00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:49.394
<i> that Honnold is supporting,</i>

00:13:49.394 --> 00:13:51.296
<i>which is a solar energy project</i>

00:13:51.296 --> 00:13:52.731
<i> on the Navajo Nation,</i>

00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:54.366
<i> near some of the towers
 we were climbing on.</i>

00:13:55.634 --> 00:13:57.102
Alex:<i> I mean,
 as much as I love climbing,</i>

00:13:57.102 --> 00:13:58.303
<i> it doesn't really matter.</i>

00:13:58.837 --> 00:14:00.038
<i> But it's nice to do something</i>

00:14:00.038 --> 00:14:01.973
<i> that has like a slightly
 bigger impact on the world,</i>

00:14:01.973 --> 00:14:03.508
<i> like, something that
 actually matters,</i>

00:14:03.508 --> 00:14:05.711
<i>that affects, like, the quality
 of other people's lives.</i>

00:14:07.412 --> 00:14:08.948
<i> Something that I
 thought about a lot,</i>

00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:12.150
<i> that sort of applies
 to both climbing and
 the environmentalism</i>

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.419
<i> of the non-profit type stuff
 that I've been working on,</i>

00:14:14.419 --> 00:14:16.121
<i> is basically the idea
 of just, like,</i>

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:18.790
<i> tiny little steps towards,
 like, a bigger objective,</i>

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.458
<i> where you have some kind of,</i>

00:14:20.458 --> 00:14:23.795
like, long term goal that seems,
sort of, insurmountable

00:14:23.795 --> 00:14:25.130
if you think about the
whole thing,

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.565
but then once you
start into it and

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:27.966
<i> you start chewing
 off little pieces,</i>

00:14:27.966 --> 00:14:29.033
<i> you do it and you're like,</i>

00:14:29.033 --> 00:14:30.802
<i> "Oh, wow,
 it turns out it is possible."</i>

00:14:30.802 --> 00:14:33.606
<i> A trip like this, 30 or 40
 towers in a couple of weeks,</i>

00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:36.174
<i> that sounds exhausting,
 like there's no way.</i>

00:14:36.174 --> 00:14:37.676
<i>But then once you start doing it</i>

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:39.578
<i> and you start climbing
 a bunch of towers everyday</i>

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:42.080
<i>and loving life, and climbing a
 couple of towers the next day,</i>

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.282
<i> and before you
 know it you're like,</i>

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:45.217
<i> "Wow, we sure have
 climbed a lot of towers."</i>

00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:46.418
Heya...

00:14:46.418 --> 00:14:50.556
Cedar:<i> Yeah there's tons of
 pain, exhaustion,</i>

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:54.292
<i> but at the same time there's
 a lot of beauty, and laughter,</i>

00:14:54.292 --> 00:14:56.128
<i> and really special moments</i>

00:14:56.128 --> 00:15:00.632
<i> and it all combines into this
 unforgettable life experience.</i>

00:15:00.632 --> 00:15:02.200
Yeah!

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.936
( applause )

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:06.672
So, I hope you guys
enjoyed the film.

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:10.075
It's great to...

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:11.709
...you know,
to see people enjoy it.

00:15:11.709 --> 00:15:13.645
It was... it was a lot of work.

00:15:13.645 --> 00:15:15.214
<i> One of the frustrating
 things about this trip</i>

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:16.748
<i> was that we were
 upstaged by a dog.</i>

00:15:16.748 --> 00:15:18.516
( audience laughter )

00:15:18.516 --> 00:15:20.452
<i> You didn't really get
 the full story of Sufferpup.</i>

00:15:20.452 --> 00:15:23.054
Sufferpup had actually
climbed into this little tire,

00:15:23.054 --> 00:15:24.790
like, on a cattle guard grate

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.158
and was, like, hiding from
the wind. He was... ( whimpers )

00:15:27.158 --> 00:15:28.927
And he was still
nursing when I got him.

00:15:28.927 --> 00:15:30.628
And so, when I first got
him I was like trying to...

00:15:30.628 --> 00:15:31.896
I just didn't know what to do.

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:34.333
We didn't obviously have
dog food with us or anything.

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:38.470
And so, I just started, like,
nursing him, like, off of my...

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.338
...like, giving him
water off my thumb.

00:15:40.338 --> 00:15:41.607
And he was basically
nursing off my thumb.

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:42.774
And then I was like,

00:15:42.874 --> 00:15:44.610
"Well, what would they eat like
when they're like so little?"

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.179
And then I was like, "Oh, milk,
they'd be like drinking milk."

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:49.081
- And I was like--
- You gave him string cheese.

00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:50.382
- String cheese, yeah.
- ( audience laughter )

00:15:50.382 --> 00:15:51.850
I don't know if that's
exactly what you feed a dog.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.085
At first he was, like, all...
( whimpers )

00:15:54.085 --> 00:15:55.386
and then he ate, like,

00:15:55.386 --> 00:15:57.889
like, half a chunk
of string cheese.

00:15:57.889 --> 00:15:59.624
And I was like we better cut
him off. I don't want him to--

00:15:59.624 --> 00:16:01.493
And then didn't he poop
in the cameraman's sleeping bag?

00:16:01.493 --> 00:16:03.227
- Yeah, he like--
- ( audience laughter )

00:16:03.227 --> 00:16:04.596
So, that was kind of a bummer.

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:07.065
The first night, he like
**** all over my...

00:16:07.065 --> 00:16:08.300
( audience laughter )

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.902
...all over my sleeping bag.

00:16:09.902 --> 00:16:11.670
And then he, like, kept on,
like, whining and whining,

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.071
I couldn't quite figure out
why he was whining

00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:14.172
and then he
pissed in my sleeping bag.

00:16:14.172 --> 00:16:15.307
( audience laughter )

00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:16.574
<i> But he was adorable.</i>

00:16:16.574 --> 00:16:18.944
He was freaking, like,
the most adorable little puppy.

00:16:18.944 --> 00:16:19.978
And so the whole time,
I was like,

00:16:19.978 --> 00:16:21.780
"Oh, what are we gonna
do with Sufferpup?

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.149
You know, like,
we can't obviously,

00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:26.018
you know,
we can't like abandon him."

00:16:26.018 --> 00:16:28.553
And so,
I reached out to my wife.

00:16:28.553 --> 00:16:31.489
And my wife,
like, you know, she loves dogs.

00:16:31.489 --> 00:16:34.025
But I was like, "I think
Sufferpup's going to be big."

00:16:34.025 --> 00:16:35.327
And we're kind of, like--
We have, like,

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:37.363
a little tiny black
pug that I love,

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:38.463
all-terrain pug.

00:16:38.463 --> 00:16:39.964
And you can follow
him on Instagram,

00:16:39.964 --> 00:16:41.833
@allterrainpug. Shameless plug.

00:16:41.833 --> 00:16:43.235
( audience laughter )

00:16:43.235 --> 00:16:44.536
He's all, "Really again?"

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:45.637
( audience laughter )

00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:49.407
But... one of her co-workers

00:16:49.407 --> 00:16:51.376
took Sufferpup,
and so at the end I knew

00:16:51.376 --> 00:16:53.478
I had to go back and
check in with Sufferpup

00:16:53.478 --> 00:16:54.880
and see how he was doing.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.981
<i> And I just knew that the
 audience was just going
 to be like,</i>

00:16:56.981 --> 00:16:58.149
<i> "Well, what happened
 to Sufferpup?"</i>

00:16:58.149 --> 00:17:00.218
<i> You know,
 and so it was cool to see--</i>

00:17:00.218 --> 00:17:02.253
<i> And I couldn't believe
 in like four months</i>

00:17:02.253 --> 00:17:04.055
<i>he's like frigging grown like--</i>

00:17:04.055 --> 00:17:05.290
Alex:<i> It's good you didn't
 keep him.</i>

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.959
Yeah, he wasn't the smartest
dog, but he was adorable.

00:17:07.959 --> 00:17:10.062
- ( audience laughter )
- But...

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:11.196
A lot like you.

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:12.264
( audience laughter )

00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:13.532
Actually,
you should've kept him.

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:14.799
You should've kept him.

00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:16.200
I should've. It could've
been, like, I know,

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.903
together we could've
been this amazing team..

00:17:18.903 --> 00:17:21.239
But... basically it's about,
like, you know,

00:17:21.239 --> 00:17:22.974
<i> the laughter and, like,
 the joking.</i>

00:17:22.974 --> 00:17:25.443
<i> And laughing in the
 face of discomfort is like,</i>

00:17:25.443 --> 00:17:27.245
<i> is a skill that we both have.</i>

00:17:27.245 --> 00:17:29.447
<i> And we had an amazing
 time out there.</i>

00:17:29.447 --> 00:17:31.616
<i> You know, like, Alex is
 one of my best friends.</i>

00:17:31.616 --> 00:17:33.051
<i> And he kinda likes me.</i>

00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:34.552
You know, tolerate.

00:17:34.552 --> 00:17:36.354
- Tolerates me.
- ( audience laughter )

00:17:36.354 --> 00:17:37.856
It's worth adding that
last photo.

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:40.392
We rode past that little section
probably six times for Cedar,

00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:43.962
who put his iPhone
into a pile of cow poop,

00:17:43.962 --> 00:17:46.130
propped up just
perfectly with a timer.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.666
And then, like, we would ride by

00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:48.734
and this thing would
fall off the poop.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:49.967
- He'd be like, "Oh!"
- ( audience laughter )

00:17:49.967 --> 00:17:51.102
And he'd like set it up again.

00:17:51.102 --> 00:17:52.504
And I was like,
"Really, do we have to--"

00:17:52.504 --> 00:17:53.671
But then it turns
out it was a nice photo.

00:17:53.671 --> 00:17:54.839
- Yeah, yeah.
- ( audience laughter )

00:17:55.139 --> 00:17:57.409
But what you can't see is
all the poop piled up
underneath there...

00:17:58.276 --> 00:18:00.378
It's a poop-pod,
it's like revolutionary.

00:18:00.378 --> 00:18:01.846
- ( audience laughter )
- Yeah.

00:18:01.846 --> 00:18:03.181
It's ground breaking.

00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:04.750
So, if you ever see
cow patty in the ground

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.752
- and you need to get that shot.
- It's like guerilla filmmaking.

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:08.920
- It is.
- You know, just... Yeah.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.389
But the Navajo land was, like,
it was really cool.

00:18:11.389 --> 00:18:13.358
<i> I mean, some of the
 most iconic peaks are there,</i>

00:18:13.358 --> 00:18:16.595
<i> like Ship Rock here,
 which was the largest tower
 that we climbed.</i>

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:18.196
<i>-</i> Alex:<i> It's like a mountain...
 - It's like a mountain.</i>

00:18:18.196 --> 00:18:19.931
- ...<i> more so than a tower.
 - Yeah.</i>

00:18:19.931 --> 00:18:22.634
<i> The Navajo Nation definitely
 had more of the feel of
 the Wild West</i>

00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:25.270
<i> than, like, the established
climbing areas that we were in.</i>

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.339
In fact, at one point Alex got
chased down on horseback--

00:18:28.339 --> 00:18:29.474
Yeah, both of us.

00:18:29.607 --> 00:18:31.410
So, the thing with the Navajo
Nation is that you kinda need

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.111
like a guide or somebody
to give you permission

00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:35.347
to access all these towers.
So, we had this Navajo

00:18:35.347 --> 00:18:36.881
climber with us

00:18:36.881 --> 00:18:38.316
who reassured us
that it was totally fine,

00:18:38.316 --> 00:18:40.284
you know, he knew
this guy that knew this guy

00:18:40.284 --> 00:18:42.487
and it was fine.
And so, he drove in to this

00:18:42.487 --> 00:18:44.122
tower in a truck.

00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:46.758
And then,
we were, like, biking behind.

00:18:46.758 --> 00:18:49.894
And basically the shepherd
that owned the land

00:18:49.894 --> 00:18:51.863
saw the truck go by,
and got kind of fired up

00:18:51.863 --> 00:18:53.532
and then saw us
biking really slowly.

00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:55.400
He just like jumped on his
horse, like, with no saddle,

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.769
no anything and just
tore ass across the desert

00:18:57.769 --> 00:18:59.371
to, like, ride us down
and yell at us.

00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:01.672
It was like... It definitely
felt like the Wild West.

00:19:01.672 --> 00:19:03.307
I was, like,
I had headphones in and I could,

00:19:03.307 --> 00:19:04.342
like, look over and I was like,

00:19:04.342 --> 00:19:05.243
"Whoa!

00:19:05.443 --> 00:19:06.745
- There's a dude on a horse
- ( audience laughter )

00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:09.280
like going superfast
and yelling at me."

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.483
And I kinda, like,
my first instinct was, like,

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:14.252
just look forward and hope
that he's not coming towards me,
you know?

00:19:14.252 --> 00:19:16.955
I was like, "If I don't
make eye contact,
he won't notice."

00:19:16.955 --> 00:19:18.023
And so I keep pedaling

00:19:18.023 --> 00:19:19.824
but that actually just
like made him more upset.

00:19:19.824 --> 00:19:22.828
Understandably. And so,
I mean, it worked out fine.

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:24.429
Basically, you paid
him and it worked out fine.

00:19:24.429 --> 00:19:26.464
( audience laughter )

00:19:26.464 --> 00:19:28.867
But that's kind of the thing
with climbing access there,

00:19:28.867 --> 00:19:31.770
is that it's a little more
nebulous than like
on BLM land or,

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.505
you know, any of the other
places that we were climbing.

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:35.306
- Yeah.
- And then eventually

00:19:35.306 --> 00:19:37.508
<i> somehow, someway
 we finished and then</i>

00:19:37.508 --> 00:19:39.510
<i>started the solar portion of it.</i>

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:41.946
<i> And, it was a really cool way
 to finish the trip,</i>

00:19:41.946 --> 00:19:44.849
<i> I thought. I guess, like,
you know, if I was gonna, like,</i>

00:19:44.849 --> 00:19:46.785
<i> leave you guys with, like,</i>

00:19:46.785 --> 00:19:49.354
<i> any lessons or perhaps
 cautionary tales</i>

00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:50.621
<i> from our experience,</i>

00:19:50.621 --> 00:19:52.724
I think it's, like,
I would just say that,

00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:56.461
"Yeah, we're professional
climbers. And, you know,

00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:58.062
we do stuff like
this for a living,

00:19:58.062 --> 00:19:59.564
which we're very lucky to do.

00:19:59.564 --> 00:20:03.168
But anyone can plan
their own Sufferfest.

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:06.138
You know, anybody can
come up with a crazy,

00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:08.239
audacious idea,

00:20:08.239 --> 00:20:10.842
a set of goals. Maybe it has
nothing to do with climbing,

00:20:10.842 --> 00:20:12.377
or biking, or anything,
you know,

00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:14.145
it really can be anything.

00:20:14.145 --> 00:20:16.881
And then if you just,
if you just chip away at it,

00:20:16.881 --> 00:20:19.851
one step at a time,
you might injure yourself.

00:20:19.851 --> 00:20:21.018
( laughs )

00:20:21.018 --> 00:20:22.520
<i> No, but you might pull it off,
 you know?"</i>

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.123
<i> And so,
 I just hope that, you know,</i>

00:20:25.123 --> 00:20:26.792
<i> people have their
 own Sufferfest,</i>

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:28.961
<i> to have their own
 crazy experience</i>

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:30.428
<i> and yeah...</i>

00:20:30.428 --> 00:20:31.730
And Sufferfest Three?

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:34.065
- No.
- ( audience laughter )

00:20:34.065 --> 00:20:36.134
- Okay. All right.
- We're still working on it.

00:20:36.134 --> 00:20:37.201
Coming up with good ideas.

00:20:37.201 --> 00:20:38.469
Give it a...

00:20:38.469 --> 00:20:41.273
give it a few more months
and I'll have him bagged.

00:20:41.273 --> 00:20:43.141
But yeah, I hope you guys

00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:45.877
enjoyed the slideshow
and enjoyed the film.

00:20:45.877 --> 00:20:48.580
- Cool.
- ( applause )

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.550
( outro music )
