00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.070
Let's do another one of these
dependent probability problems.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.670
You have 4 coins in a bag.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.460
3 of them are
unfair in that they

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.440
have a 45% chance of coming
up tails when flipped.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.640
The rest are fair.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.640
So for the rest of them, you
have a 50% chance of tails

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.910
or a 50% chance of heads.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.860
You randomly choose
one coin from the bag

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.310
and flip it 4 times.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.720
What is the percent
probability of getting 4 heads?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.189
So let's think about it.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.150
When we put our hand in the bag
and we take one of the coins

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.430
out, there's some probability
that we get an unfair coin.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.240
And 3 of the 4 coins are unfair.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:50.080
So there's a 3/4 probability
that we get an unfair coin.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.230
And then there is only 1 out
of the 4 coins that's fair.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.995
So there was a 1/4 probability
that I get a fair coin.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.780
So unfair, let's
remind ourselves--

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.290
an unfair coin has a 45%
chance of coming up tails.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.580
So this means that I have a
45% chance of tails, which also

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.220
means-- and we have
to be careful here

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.520
because they're asking us
about heads-- if I have

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.580
a 45% chance of
getting tails, that

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.929
means I have a 55%
chance of getting heads.

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.970
I have a 100% chance of
getting one of these two.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.740
If it's 45% for tails, 100
minus 45 is 55 for heads.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.430
For the fair coin, I have
a 50% chance of tails

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.600
and a 50% chance of heads.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.340
50% heads.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.400
Fair enough.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.580
Now I want to know, in
either of these scenarios,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.170
what is the percent probability
of getting four heads?

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.540
So given I've got
the unfair coin,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.420
the probability of
getting four heads

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.580
is going to be 55% for
each of those flips.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.610
So the probability of
getting exactly four heads

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:10.860
is going to be 0.55 times
0.55 times 0.55 times 0.55.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.410
And so the probability
of picking an unfair coin

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.300
and getting four
heads in a row is

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.130
going to be equal to 3/4 times
all of this business over here.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.230
So that's 3/4 times--
and this is 0.55 times

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.274
itself four times, so I
could write it as 0.55

00:02:32.274 --> 00:02:35.070
to the fourth power.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.500
And we'll get the
calculator out in a second

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.020
to actually calculate
what this is.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.090
Now let's do the same
thing for the fair coin.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.370
If I did pick a fair
coin, the probability

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.650
of getting heads four times in
a row is going to be 0.5 times

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.130
0.5 times 0.5 times 0.5.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.110
Or the probability of
getting the fair coin, which

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.050
is 1/4 chance, times
the probability--

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.150
and getting four heads in a
row is going to be 1/4 times

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.710
all of this.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.850
So it's going to be 1/4 times--
this is just 0.5 times itself

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.297
four times, so that's
0.5 to the fourth power.

00:03:16.297 --> 00:03:18.130
So let's get the
calculator out to calculate

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.210
either one of these.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:28.520
So we get 3 divided
by 4 times-- and it

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.390
knows that when I do
the multiplication,

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.320
it's not in the
denominator here.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.809
So it's 3/4 times-- and I'll
just do it in parentheses,

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:36.600
which I don't have to
do it in parentheses,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.183
because it knows
order of operations--

00:03:38.183 --> 00:03:45.690
so 0.55 to the fourth
power is equal to 0.--

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.370
let me write it down.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.224
Let me take it off the screen
so I can write it down properly.

00:03:50.224 --> 00:03:52.390
Actually, let me just do
both of these calculations.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.820
So this probability is
that one right over there.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.840
And then this one down here
is 1 divided by 4 times 0.5

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.470
to the fourth power.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.040
So it's equal to that
right over there.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.940
And so let's be clear.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.420
The probability of
picking the unfair coin

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.070
and then getting four heads
in a row is this top number.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.720
It's like roughly 6.9 chance
that you get the unfair coin

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.350
and then get four
heads in a row.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.560
The probability that
you get the fair coin

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.480
and then get four heads
in the row is even lower.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.460
It's only a 1.6% chance.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.640
Now the probability of getting
four heads in a row either way

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.180
is going to be the
sum of this and this,

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.740
or the sum of that
and that, which

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.350
is going to be-- let me
keep my calculator out--

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.900
so it's going to be
equal to-- I can just

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.040
take the previous answer.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.360
Let me just retype it
so I don't confuse you.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:05:07.030
So 0.015625 plus 0.0686296875.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.530
I'm going to round it anyway,
so it won't matter too much.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.750
So if I take the sum-- let
me take this off screen

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.980
so I can still see it
and then let me write it.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:23.040
So what I got here,
this one is 0.068629.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.990
And I'll round it, 7.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:33.670
This down here was 0.015625
and when you add these two up--

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.902
because we just care about
getting four heads either way.

00:05:36.902 --> 00:05:38.360
There's a probability
of getting it

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.849
this way with the unfair coin.

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.140
This is the probability of
getting it with a fair coin.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.490
We want it either way.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.380
So let's add the two, which we
already did on our calculator.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.080
So if you add that
number to that number.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.950
You get 0.08425
and it keeps going,

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.280
but I'm just going to round it.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.980
This is equal to
8.425%, or if I want

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.880
to round it a little
bit more, 8.43%

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.610
chance of getting
four heads in a row.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.170
And once again, that's
a slightly higher number

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.580
than if all of the
coins were fair.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.110
Because there's a
3/4 chance that I

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.780
get a coin that has a better
than even chance of getting

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.280
heads.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.780
So that's why this number is
going to be a little bit higher

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.470
than the probability if I had
a fair coin, of just getting

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.470
four heads in a row.
