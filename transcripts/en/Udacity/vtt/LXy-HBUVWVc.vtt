00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.059
p = 2, pencils are $2 each.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.770
In this equation, the term with
the variable is alone on one side of

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.240
the equation, but
the coefficient is not 1.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.370
The coefficient is 4.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.410
To make the coefficient 1, we can
divide both sides of the equation by 4.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.935
4p/4 is just p.

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:25.610
8/4 is 2.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.740
So p = 2.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.481
Remember that in 4p/4,

00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:34.490
we can just cross out these 4's because
any number over itself is equal to 1.
