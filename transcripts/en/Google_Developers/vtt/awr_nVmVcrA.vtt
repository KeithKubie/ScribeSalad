LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back
to Google Developers

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.684
Weekly for February 10, 2014.

00:00:09.684 --> 00:00:11.600
I'm Louis Gray, and this
is our highlight reel

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.849
of what's happening in the
world of Google Developers,

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:14.910
on the set and off.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.210
The big news of the week
comes from a little device.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.930
Chrome Cast is now open to
developers for the Google Cast

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.890
SDK.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.600
We have four DevBytes
this week covering

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.058
how you can get
started, as well as

00:00:24.058 --> 00:00:26.440
special focuses on
developing for Chrome and iOS

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.100
in addition to Android.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.020
We then brought in the
analytics team Brian

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.890
Kuhn, Lukas Bergstrom,
and Andrew Wales

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.056
to learn more about how the
Google Tag Managers data

00:00:34.056 --> 00:00:36.640
layer makes implementing
analytics easy.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.450
From Paris, Alexis MP brought
us a pair of interviews,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.660
first with Nicholas Jeffrey
of the Dart team talking

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.339
Dart 1.0 for web developers,
and then [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.630
from the Chrome team to talk
Yeoman and other developer

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.170
productivity tools.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.429
Then from New York,
Jeff Posnick is back

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.720
with the latest tips on
migrating from YouTube data API

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.520
version 2 to version 3.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.894
This week, he walks you
through the V3 API calls

00:00:56.894 --> 00:00:58.560
needed to subscribe
to a YouTube channel

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.150
with live demos using
the API Explorer.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.124
And the Women Tech
Makers crew back.

00:01:03.124 --> 00:01:05.540
First, we start with the Gnome
Outreach Program for Women,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.050
helping lady coders get
involved in free and open source

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.960
software.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.060
Then, en espanol,
Francisco [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.977
hosted the winners of
Developer Bust 2013,

00:01:13.977 --> 00:01:16.310
including three who are
tackling challenges facing women

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.460
in tech in their own countries.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.110
Usually hailing from our Tokyo
office, [INAUDIBLE] Suzuki

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.430
hosted Google Developer
expert, Atusi Nakamura

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.020
here in Mountain View this week.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.920
The pair discussed
Google's App Script API

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.180
and developing for App Script.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.290
The event's in Japanese, so have
your Google Translate handy.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.330
From Madrid, Frances Campoy, in
collaboration with the Madrid

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.610
GDG, presents the
commonalities and differences

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.790
of Go and Python,
specifically talking

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.800
about decorators, generators,
concurrency, and more.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.050
And as we've discussed before,
Google's Summer of Code

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.508
is a chance for young coders
to shine and for organizations

00:01:46.508 --> 00:01:47.880
to be valuable mentors.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.562
Open source maven Cat
Allman hosted Carol Smith,

00:01:50.562 --> 00:01:52.020
and talked about
what organizations

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.103
interested in applying for
Google's Summer of Code

00:01:54.103 --> 00:01:55.980
need to know,
wrapping our events

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.430
in the studio for the week.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.030
But there's one more thing.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.980
We know coders are
creative artists.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.020
So now's your
chance to prove it.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.670
Google and the
Barbican in London

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.850
are looking for your
art made with code.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.199
If you wow the judges, you
could earn a commission

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.730
to join the exhibit alongside
world-renowned creative

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.570
artists.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.820
So warm up both
sides of your brain.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.951
And to make sure you
never miss a thing,

00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:18.450

Google Developers,

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.030
