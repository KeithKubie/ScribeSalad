00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.880
Is there anything about your genetic code that would ever make you

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.090
change your mind or change reproductive decisions for yourself in any way?

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.660
&gt;&gt; Well in the Jewish community, Tay-Sachs, is an issue.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.460
I don't know how many people are aware of that. But.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.222
&gt;&gt; Just really quick, can you tell us what Tay-Sachs is?

00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:25.567
&gt;&gt; Tay-Sachs is in the same family as Gaucher's disease,

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:30.805
which is one of the diseases that I have, it's a lipid storage disease. And in

00:00:30.805 --> 00:00:36.960
Tay-Sachs babies, the lipid accumulates in the brain, and the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.320
baby dies within a short period of time. And they, under two years old, usually,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.220
typically. And there is no treatment, and it's pretty much erradicated,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.750
because either people don't marry who are pre-tested

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.820
before, I'm talking about the orthadox Jewish community, where people

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.470
are tested beore marriage. And they

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.730
wouldn't have an abortion, so it prevents two people who carry that

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.980
mutation from getting married and having a child who would die in a.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.390
&gt;&gt; Which

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.290
is interesting because in my community we, we come into the union knowing

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.810
full well what our options are and many still go through with it.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.310
&gt;&gt; You know, this is interesting because, so, Tay-Sachs is a recessive trait.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.260
&gt;&gt; Right. Right.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.220
&gt;&gt; And Achondroplasia is a dominant trait, which means

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.980
that in the Tay Sachs world having, being a carrier

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.080
means you're not affected. whereas in the case of

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.290
Achondroplasia, if you're a carrier it means you are affected,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.940
you're affected as a carrier. so, I, I'm interested to hear these sort of

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.890
slightly different perspectives here, on the ability

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.700
to sort of think and, and plan.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.360
&gt;&gt; Well, with a Tay-Sachs baby, the baby is going to die. I mean

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.730
that's, that's the story today. I don't know if that will be the case in the

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.390
future. I never knew that I was a Tay-Sachs carrier until now, and I'm not

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.720
having any more children, and it my husband would have to be a carrier as well.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.760
but

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.066
there are people in the Jewish community who would test. Maybe at a

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:25.910
later weeks, I don't know what the right time and it is to test

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.150
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.560
&gt;&gt; For any genetic diseases or any situations and I

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.600
guess its a decision at that time of what to do.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.620
&gt;&gt; I think I am, I just based on the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.180
information I already have. Nothing would affect, it's kind of a,

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.870
at this point because of the results that I have

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.520
from 23 and me, nothing would really impact my decision

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.470
to have children. It's more of a, my wife works

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.773
in biology, and it's really fun doing the Punnett squares

00:02:54.773 --> 00:02:55.307
[LAUGH]

00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:58.780
between our possibilities of what kids are. Fun for her, I think.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.780
&gt;&gt;

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.228
[LAUGH]

00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:01.940
&gt;&gt; But, so, yeah, I think you know I

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.120
can't speak for, if something were there, I don't know

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.730
what I would do, that's kind of one of those

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.230
things that I think you have to cross that bridge

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.810
&gt;&gt; When you get there.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.720
&gt;&gt; When you get there, and it is impossible to predict what I might, what

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.350
how different, if things have been different. I

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.570
don't know how it would have affected anything.
