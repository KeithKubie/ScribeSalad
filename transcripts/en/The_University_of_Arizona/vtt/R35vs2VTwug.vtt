00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.570
Agrivoltaics is
our new take on how

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.240
to transform how
we do agriculture

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.010
in the dry lands of the world.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.160
And so it's really a
co-location of solar panels,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.140
or renewable energy, over
an understory, if you will,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.580
of agricultural plants.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.780
We essentially carry around
this portable biosphere.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.780
This way of dialing the
environmental conditions

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.000
of what plants need--
the carbon dioxide

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.700
level of the atmosphere,
the temperature, the light,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.440
the relative
humidity-- everything

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.200
we can control inside the
biosphere at a larger scale,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.360
we control at the smaller scale.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.750
We could be really applying
these simple principles

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.390
to really change how we go
into the future in terms

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.570
of how we approach local
agriculture, how we approach

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.410
renewable energy.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.830
All these things that
the next generation

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.914
finds really important.

00:00:49.914 --> 00:00:51.830
We're here at University
of Rincon High School

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.040
and this is a satellite garden
to the agrivoltaic garden

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.470
at Biosphere 2.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.530
And so, we've replicated
some of the conditions

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.807
and replicated some
of the plant choices.

00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:04.640
And we're engaging with
high school students

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.670
to help with some of the
monitoring and data collection.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.160
This is citizen science
in a different way.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.370
This is a permanent
installation.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.620
And so we have time
to bring scientists

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.530
in to work with us on
procedures and protocol.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.920
And we have time to
collect data and to process

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.270
that data in a meaningful way.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.430
And we have time to
build relationships

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.350
with those researchers,
where they come in

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.070
and these kids become
really a significant part

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.910
of the research.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.780
Here these high school kids are
contributing to big science.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.130
And they make the science
at Biosphere better science.
