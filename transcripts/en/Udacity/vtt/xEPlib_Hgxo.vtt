00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.020
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And welcome back. While we were away we actually had to sensley take home the

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.815
the Golden Brain for detecting a difference of under 2%.

00:00:09.815 --> 00:00:13.650
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's amazing, I guess that you were proved wrong, but your human difference

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.990
threshold average of 3%.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.915
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, Andy, that is why they call it an average.

00:00:17.915 --> 00:00:21.941
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, either way, it's pretty amazing and even more importantly I'm okay and my

00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:24.185
bleeding has stopped.

00:00:24.185 --> 00:00:26.085
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Andy, it was a paper cut.

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:27.063
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Lauren, it hurt.

00:00:27.063 --> 00:00:28.565
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I'm glad you're feeling better.

00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:31.066
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks, but this bandaid actually feels a little weird.

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:31.645
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How so?

00:00:31.645 --> 00:00:33.626
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I don't know. There's all these little groves in it, and they're kind of

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:34.309
bothering me.

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.437
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hmm. That's your mechanoreceptors sensing that.

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:39.668
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wait. My what?

00:00:39.668 --> 00:00:43.538
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Your mechanoreceptors. They're little neurons in your skin that are sensitive

00:00:43.538 --> 00:00:46.824
to different things, like grooves or texture, shape, even vibrations and

00:00:46.824 --> 00:00:48.272
motion.

00:00:48.272 --> 00:00:53.136
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And each one is sensitive to its own specific sort of texture? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:56.402
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's really fascniating. It's almost like the rods and cones in our eyes,

00:00:56.402 --> 00:00:57.659
which we use to.

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.509
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Andy, I'm going to stop you there, I just gt word from Susan that they're

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:04.589
going to start the brain ceremony. We'll get back to that in a minute.
