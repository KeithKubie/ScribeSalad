this really flies in the face of our

this really flies in the face of our
 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.990
this really flies in the face of our
urge to live which we're coming out of

the earliest detailed elaborate burials
 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.480
the earliest detailed elaborate burials
were thirty thousand years ago you know

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490
were thirty thousand years ago you know
 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.000
were thirty thousand years ago you know
human beings not only died but they they

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010
human beings not only died but they they
 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.760
human beings not only died but they they
know they're going to die of course many

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770
know they're going to die of course many
 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.610

this fact and so try to build up various

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140
this fact and so try to build up various
 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.620
this fact and so try to build up various
kinds of mythologies about afterlife

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630
kinds of mythologies about afterlife
 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.470
kinds of mythologies about afterlife
but I think the basic reason it's just

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480
but I think the basic reason it's just
 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.800
but I think the basic reason it's just
it's abhorrent to us it's you know we've

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810
it's abhorrent to us it's you know we've
 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.920
it's abhorrent to us it's you know we've
built up the self we we we've had for

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930
built up the self we we we've had for
 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.810
built up the self we we we've had for
the most part enjoyable experiences

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820
the most part enjoyable experiences
 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.520
the most part enjoyable experiences
there's more to experience we have loved

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530
there's more to experience we have loved
 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.910
there's more to experience we have loved
ones we we have roles in life and

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920
ones we we have roles in life and
 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.350
ones we we have roles in life and
suddenly to know that that's just going

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360
suddenly to know that that's just going
 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.259
suddenly to know that that's just going
to all be ending snuffed out at some

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269
to all be ending snuffed out at some
 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.890
to all be ending snuffed out at some
point is you know really puts in a kind

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900
point is you know really puts in a kind
 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.380
point is you know really puts in a kind
of a primal dilemma to our to our minds

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390
 
 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.470
 
yeah I think some of these urges to like

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480
yeah I think some of these urges to like
 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.190
yeah I think some of these urges to like
conquer death or to live for a long time

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200
conquer death or to live for a long time
 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.860
conquer death or to live for a long time
you know have to do with this this this

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870
you know have to do with this this this
 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.560
you know have to do with this this this
primal fear of death itself of course we

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570
primal fear of death itself of course we
 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.580
primal fear of death itself of course we
want to stay healthy

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590
want to stay healthy
 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.800
want to stay healthy
it's painful to get ill it's painful to

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810
it's painful to get ill it's painful to
 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.930
it's painful to get ill it's painful to
get old to have injuries that don't heal

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940
get old to have injuries that don't heal
 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.180
get old to have injuries that don't heal
so well to have permanent pains so some

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190
so well to have permanent pains so some
 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.070
so well to have permanent pains so some
of that is overcoming just a sense of

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080
of that is overcoming just a sense of
 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.990
of that is overcoming just a sense of
unwell being that happens to us we want

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000
unwell being that happens to us we want
 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.720
unwell being that happens to us we want
we want medicine to make progress and

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730
we want medicine to make progress and
 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.710
we want medicine to make progress and
and keep us healthy but the other factor

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720
and keep us healthy but the other factor
 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.740
and keep us healthy but the other factor
is is wanting to live for a long time

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750
is is wanting to live for a long time
 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.290
is is wanting to live for a long time
and maybe you know maybe forever it's

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300
and maybe you know maybe forever it's
 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.760
and maybe you know maybe forever it's
not clear what we would do or how that

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770
not clear what we would do or how that
 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.910
not clear what we would do or how that
would affect our our lies and some times

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920
would affect our our lies and some times
 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.380

science fiction writers explore those

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390
science fiction writers explore those
 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.280
science fiction writers explore those
kinds of themes but I see that it's

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290
kinds of themes but I see that it's
 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.990
kinds of themes but I see that it's
incredibly natural and I do think it's

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000
incredibly natural and I do think it's
 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.700
incredibly natural and I do think it's
going to not that we're going to live

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710
going to not that we're going to live
 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.440
going to not that we're going to live
forever necessarily I don't have a an

be in the mud in the shallow water and
 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.930
be in the mud in the shallow water and
eventually crawl up out of the ocean so

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:41.940
eventually crawl up out of the ocean so
 

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.790
eventually crawl up out of the ocean so
so death has really been essential an

we're looking at so for example the the
 

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.330
we're looking at so for example the the
skin the cells and the skin are turned

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:03.340
skin the cells and the skin are turned
 

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.150
skin the cells and the skin are turned
over approximately every month of time

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.160
over approximately every month of time
 

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.100
over approximately every month of time
your skin is migrating new cells are

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.110
your skin is migrating new cells are
 

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.750
your skin is migrating new cells are
migrating outward and the old cells are

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:09.760
migrating outward and the old cells are
 

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.390
migrating outward and the old cells are
slough off and that makes some sense the

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400
slough off and that makes some sense the
 

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.100
slough off and that makes some sense the
skin is the subject to a lot of wear and

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.110
skin is the subject to a lot of wear and
 

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.010
skin is the subject to a lot of wear and
tear and abrasion it's it's in contact

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:17.020
tear and abrasion it's it's in contact
 

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.189
tear and abrasion it's it's in contact
with the with a harsh environment and so

00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:20.199
with the with a harsh environment and so
 

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:21.780
with the with a harsh environment and so
for the skin to have some kind of way to

for the skin to have some kind of way to
 

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.060
for the skin to have some kind of way to
renew itself is very essential by having

renew itself is very essential by having
 

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.900
renew itself is very essential by having

there's not just one death there's
there's different forms of death there's

there's different forms of death there's
 

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.220
there's different forms of death there's
there's the death of our bodies that has

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:58.230
there's the death of our bodies that has
 

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.560
there's the death of our bodies that has
to do with the senescence of us being a

to do with the senescence of us being a
 

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.600

having to do with the slowing down of

the repair mechanisms but there's also a
 

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.600
the repair mechanisms but there's also a
lot of death inside our bodies as we

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:11.610
lot of death inside our bodies as we
 

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.110

go through a kind of suicide program so

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:23.520
go through a kind of suicide program so
 

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.460
go through a kind of suicide program so
there's a lot of death inside our bodies

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:25.470
there's a lot of death inside our bodies
 

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.610
there's a lot of death inside our bodies
all the time going on that is essential

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:28.620
all the time going on that is essential
 

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.580
all the time going on that is essential
to our life and this is somewhat of a

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:31.590
to our life and this is somewhat of a
 

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.140
to our life and this is somewhat of a
different death from that from the death

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:33.150
different death from that from the death
 

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.920
different death from that from the death
of our bodies as as large organisms and

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:36.930
of our bodies as as large organisms and
 

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.900
of our bodies as as large organisms and
then there's also death on smaller

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:38.910
then there's also death on smaller
 

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.990
then there's also death on smaller
scales in bacteria that either have to

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000
scales in bacteria that either have to
 

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.250
scales in bacteria that either have to
do with they're running out of nutrients

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.260
do with they're running out of nutrients
 

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.860
do with they're running out of nutrients
that's that that is an inadvertent form

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:45.870
that's that that is an inadvertent form
 

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.770
that's that that is an inadvertent form
of death but there's also kinds of

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:48.780
of death but there's also kinds of
 

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.980
of death but there's also kinds of
bacteria which are multicellular and

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:51.990
bacteria which are multicellular and
 

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.870
bacteria which are multicellular and
they can have programmed cell death in

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880
they can have programmed cell death in
 

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.730
they can have programmed cell death in
there as when they go into the

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:55.740
there as when they go into the
 

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.850
there as when they go into the
reproductive phases so one issue about

00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860
reproductive phases so one issue about
 

00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:59.960
reproductive phases so one issue about
death that I find particularly

00:11:59.960 --> 00:11:59.970
death that I find particularly
 

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.920
death that I find particularly
fascinating is that there is not just

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:02.930
fascinating is that there is not just
 

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.360
fascinating is that there is not just
one kind of death but death has been

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:05.370
one kind of death but death has been
 

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.150
one kind of death but death has been
really incorporated into life in various

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160
really incorporated into life in various
 

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.190
really incorporated into life in various
forms depending on what scale of nature

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200
forms depending on what scale of nature
 

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.880
forms depending on what scale of nature
were looking at

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:14.890
 
 

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.980
 
our our closest primate relatives are

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:17.990
our our closest primate relatives are
 

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.080
our our closest primate relatives are
the chimpanzees and gorillas with the

the chimpanzees and gorillas with the
 

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.620
the chimpanzees and gorillas with the
chimpanzees being closer in to us

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:23.630
chimpanzees being closer in to us
 

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.070

genetically their natural lifespans are

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:27.080
genetically their natural lifespans are
 

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:32.200
genetically their natural lifespans are
approximately half of ours and that's

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:32.210
approximately half of ours and that's
 

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.010
approximately half of ours and that's
that's of some interest because the

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:35.020
that's of some interest because the
 

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.410
that's of some interest because the
chimpanzees are a bit smaller than us in

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:38.420
chimpanzees are a bit smaller than us in
 

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.900
chimpanzees are a bit smaller than us in
body mass and the gorillas are larger

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:40.910
body mass and the gorillas are larger
 

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:44.170

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.550
 
yeah let's make it to stay

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560
yeah let's make it to stay
 

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.180
yeah let's make it to stay
that we're not talking about the

live longer than mice often there's a
 

00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:43.280
live longer than mice often there's a

creatures live longer but you might try

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:46.980
creatures live longer but you might try
 

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.530
creatures live longer but you might try
to say from an evolutionary viewpoint

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:48.540
to say from an evolutionary viewpoint
 

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.810
to say from an evolutionary viewpoint
that it would serve creatures well to

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:50.820
that it would serve creatures well to
 

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.329
that it would serve creatures well to
live for a long time they can reap they

00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:53.339
live for a long time they can reap they
 

00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:54.889
live for a long time they can reap they
can reproduce more let's say if they

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:54.899
can reproduce more let's say if they
 

00:16:54.899 --> 00:16:56.569
can reproduce more let's say if they
live for longer and therefore pass on

00:16:56.569 --> 00:16:56.579
live for longer and therefore pass on
 

00:16:56.579 --> 00:16:58.940
live for longer and therefore pass on
their genes for even a longer period of

their genes for even a longer period of
 

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.769
their genes for even a longer period of
time but we know that there's a large

turns out there's two ways of looking at
 

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:13.970
turns out there's two ways of looking at

this one is to go down deep into the
 

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.240
this one is to go down deep into the
organisms and say and ask why are the

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:17.250
organisms and say and ask why are the
 

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.929

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.419
it's many decades 70 80 90 years but the
other way to look at it is that these

00:17:32.419 --> 00:17:32.429
other way to look at it is that these
 

00:17:32.429 --> 00:17:34.700
other way to look at it is that these

cellular repair mechanisms themselves
 

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.490
cellular repair mechanisms themselves
must be subject to evolution now they

must be subject to evolution now they
 

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.520
must be subject to evolution now they
can we know that these repair mechanisms

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:40.530
can we know that these repair mechanisms
 

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.830
can we know that these repair mechanisms
vary among creatures it's been shown

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:49.780
carbon fluxes in these earth cycles
 

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:54.000
carbon fluxes in these earth cycles
under our own control with taking over

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.010
under our own control with taking over
 

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:56.280
under our own control with taking over
10% of the planet using 10% of the

10% of the planet using 10% of the
 

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:58.590
10% of the planet using 10% of the
planet for for agriculture and another

planet for for agriculture and another
 

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.800
planet for for agriculture and another
maybe 10 to 20% for for grazing of

maybe 10 to 20% for for grazing of
 

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:05.040
maybe 10 to 20% for for grazing of
various kinds and the fisheries so with

our population we are we are we're
 

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:08.520
our population we are we are we're
bringing more of this death and life

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:08.530
bringing more of this death and life
 

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:11.730

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:15.840
contributions of our bodies dying is is
of course relatively small compared to

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:15.850
of course relatively small compared to
 

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:20.280
of course relatively small compared to
the all these larger pictures
