HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: So
first of all, can you

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.970
give me your short
introduction to what

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.650
you're doing, what are
the business doing,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.670
and then what is your
go global strategy?

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.219
From probably, Mor?

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.515
Yeah.

00:00:17.515 --> 00:00:19.540
MOR SHANI: I'm Mor,
from Jelly Button Games.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.340
I'm one of the
co-founders and the CEO.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.650
Our main business is
casual, free to play games.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.960
Our first hit is
"Pirate King," which

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.120
currently has around 50 million
of downloads till today.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.905
And we're still going global.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.290
This is more or less.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.440
You want to talk-- what
do you want to talk?

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.620
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Well,
how about go global stuff,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.820
as you're trying to go global?

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.604
Or we should talk later?

00:00:49.604 --> 00:00:50.770
MOR SHANI: Yeah, I think so.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.500
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
Let's talk later.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.257
OK, Massimo?

00:00:54.257 --> 00:00:55.590
MASSIMO CIOCIOLA: Hi, everybody.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.600
My name is Massimo, although
everybody calls me Max.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.100
Easier.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.900
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Oh really?

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.600
MASSIMO CIOCIOLA: Yeah.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.680
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
I didn't know that.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.099
MASSIMO CIOCIOLA: Much easier.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.570
I'm the co-founder
and CEO of Musixmatch.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.340
Musixmatch is the world's
largest database of lyrics.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.840
I'm not a singer, unfortunately.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.540
And we have, so far, more
than 50 million downloads

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.520
everywhere.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.299
And thanks for inviting me.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.590
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Thank you.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.150
Andres?

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.440
ANDRES BOU: I'm Andres.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.440
I'm CEO and co-founder
of Socialpoint.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.760
We are a gaming company
based in Barcelona.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.603
So we are most known because
of "Dragon City" and "Monster

00:01:37.603 --> 00:01:38.759
Legends."

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.550
And to give you some
numbers, "Dragon City"

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.950
has been downloaded more
than 150 million times.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.910
And we are quite global, also.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.390
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: All right.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.025
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:53.400
GILBERT WEDAM:
[INAUDIBLE] Hello?

00:01:54.957 --> 00:01:55.540
Is the mic on?

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.070
REGINA CHAMMA: No.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.153
GILBERT WEDAM: Is that OK?

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.199
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
[INAUDIBLE] Working.

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:03.615
GILBERT WEDAM: One, two-- one,
two-- one, two-- one-- one,

00:02:03.615 --> 00:02:04.115
two?

00:02:11.028 --> 00:02:12.430
Hello?

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.930
Hello.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.670
I'm Gil.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.090
I lead design at Citymapper.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.620
It's a transport app
specifically built

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.080
for the city.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.580
So we take all the
crazy data that's

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.080
out there, try to
make sense for it,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.830
and build and design
a product around it

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.800
basically for you to find
out how to get from A

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.990
to B. We're currently live in
30 cities and 10 countries.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.600
Yeah.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.610
REGINA CHAMMA: Hello,
my name is Regina.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.000
I lead Google Play BD for
Latin America, especially

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.370
Brazil and Mexico.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.489
And it's a pleasure to be here.

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.780
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: All right.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.100
So let's get
started discussions.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.031
But I would like to make more
like interactive the session

00:02:55.031 --> 00:02:55.530
here.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.010
So I will shoot one
questions to you guys,

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.200
then make them
more interactions.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.010
Then ask the audience if
you have any questions,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.310
then please jump in.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.890
All right.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.170
So first of all, I would
like to ask about here,

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.570
what is your global
strategy actually?

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.550
Then what is your challenge
in the global market?

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:25.770
If you go into there, then
what was your challenges?

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.631
OK, so Gil?

00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:30.880
GILBERT WEDAM: Basically,
as you can probably imagine,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.930
we're very-- like localization
is the key thing we

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.220
have to figure out.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.570
Our strategy has always
been to localize the product

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.570
very heavily.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.510
So whenever we launch a city,
we hand design all the transport

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.880
icons.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.700
We travel a lot to the cities.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.960
We have people taking care
of specifically one city.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:59.510
So also, culturally, it's
been always the humor,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.310
the tone of the app.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.690
Also, when we
localize strings, it's

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.590
very important to really
understand the local tone.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.590
We partly solve that by hiring
people that speak the language

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.600
and come from these
regions, so it's

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.019
kind of an in-house
sort of-- that's

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.339
when it gets the most natural.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:20.140
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
Like a native check?

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.019
GILBERT WEDAM: Sorry?

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.237
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Native
check in your company?

00:04:23.237 --> 00:04:24.070
GILBERT WEDAM: Yeah.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.470
Yeah.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.553
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Cool.

00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:30.050
MASSIMO CIOCIOLA:
OK, I'll go too.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.770
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Go ahead.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.880
MASSIMO CIOCIOLA:
For us, localization,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.890
it's everything, because when
we talk about music and lyrics,

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.190
we're talking
about a huge space.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:46.570
To provide you some numbers,
the number of unique music

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.210
tracks in the world,
unique-- so they are unique

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.340
just once in an album--
it's around 4 million.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:02.115
Out of that, 60% of them
are mainly English track.

00:05:02.115 --> 00:05:07.760
But then there's a huge, long
tail with Spanish, Chinese,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.060
Japanese, Indian, Portuguese,
Italian, German, French,

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.750
and whatever.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.280
So we have actually-- you
know we're a database--

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.400
we do cover-- we have to cover,
so for us, the localization

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.690
is a must.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.480
I mean, we do cover more
than 80 different languages,

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.490
in terms of content.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.240
So the challenge for
us is-- Musixmatch

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.870
is a crowd-sourced platform.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.400
So the more we
grow in a country,

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.840
the more-- you
mentioned Japan before.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.020
Japan, it's been incredibly
important for us,

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.690
because the more we
were growing there,

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.210
the more the Japanese users
were adding the content.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.100
So we give the
power to the users

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.180
to add the localized content.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.030
So what I want to
share is that, if you

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.630
run content inside your
app, whatever you do,

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.680
from lyrics, whatever, your
content must be localized,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.550
must be offered.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.060
Which doesn't mean, as you
say, just translate your app.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.600
You have the issue of
offering your local content.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.100
Brazilian, typically, they
like certain kind of music,

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.290
different from German people.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.930
And US, different
from Japanese people.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.340
So for us, it's really a must
to get the local content,

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.240
plus ensuring the local rights.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.310
Because we pay rights
holder in every single place

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.480
of the world, you know?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.330
But I must say that it's kind
of key challenge and strategy

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.160
for us.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:48.630
Without that, we couldn't really
be present in any country.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.820
Like, for us, being in Japan
without having Japanese lyrics,

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.770
it's kind of--

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.200
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: So first,
you publish the application,

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.520
then you don't localize
to Japanese, right?

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.500
MASSIMO CIOCIOLA: In
general, we don't--

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.999
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: I mean,
application-- store listing.

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:07.790
MASSIMO CIOCIOLA: I
mean, we don't localize

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.090
[INAUDIBLE] application.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.860
Also, back to out
localize the application.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.431
Our goal is we empower the
user to translate the app.

00:07:18.431 --> 00:07:19.430
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: OK.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.540
Yes, the contents.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.040
MASSIMO CIOCIOLA:
Yeah, the content.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.510
And also the app itself.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.430
When they complain, they
say, can you help us?

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.580
So that's been
extremely important too,

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:36.190
besides using the app's
translator tool that you offer.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.380
But we let them add the
local content, you know?

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.110
So I think that it's very
important to empower your user

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.370
and get suggestions
from your users.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:51.450
And then, we try to listen to
any of them by analyzing data.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.500
I think all of
you guys mentioned

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.160
a lot of things you can
do with Google Analytics.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.970
I think that's a
key resource for us,

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.770
analyzing continuously data
from any single country.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:04.270
I'm selling.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.520
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
I would like

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.825
to move on-- the game side.

00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:09.522
MOR SHANI: Yeah.

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:11.620
I will share a little
bit different aspect

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.660
that we are having.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.185
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: I have
questions for the game side.

00:08:15.185 --> 00:08:16.060
MOR SHANI: All right.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.570
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: I had a
talk about the culturalize--

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:25.720
or the going to market
was culturalized

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.360
or just localizations.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.080
Then I'd like to
ask Mor and Andres

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.115
about how do you
think about-- you

00:08:33.115 --> 00:08:38.340
like to go with original
APK in localized language?

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.159
Or separate APK to that market?

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:44.250
MOR SHANI: So first of
all, I think that everybody

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.310
wants to go global.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.750
It's all about the
efforts, focus,

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.120
and of course, market
potential and costs.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.260
CPIs are getting extremely high.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.180
So as an early developer, you
have to be really focused,

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.650
and you really have to put
a lot of attention in that.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:03.570
So I would say, when we
started "Pirate King," for us,

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.550
we had to think,
strategy-wise, how to reduce

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.866
the barrier of localization.

00:09:08.866 --> 00:09:12.080
Because it was a very early
stage company and game

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.510
developer, and we couldn't
afford a lot of money

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.220
and a lot of marketing,
of course, expenses

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.620
into going global.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.536
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: So
save the budget first.

00:09:22.536 --> 00:09:25.400
MOR SHANI: Have to, if
you're an early developer.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:30.150
So what we really believed
is focus on the product as

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.250
much as you can, and make it
seem as a beautiful experience

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.630
from the product sides.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.490
So I would recommend for
everybody who wants to see,

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.860
there is a beautiful
lecture of George Fan,

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.370
which is the creator
of "Plants vs Zombies."

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.620
It's a little bit 2010, but
it's a beautiful lecture

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.140
about how he convinced his mom
to play "Plants vs Zombies."

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.940
And we were really
inspired by PopCap

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.660
and a lot of beautiful
process they made there.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.380
And there, he speak
about a lot of how

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.360
to make this process of first
engagement and localization.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.400
He has many tricks and
very beautiful things.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.320
And even know to use more
than eight words, pop-ups.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.040
And we understood that, if
we're an early stage developer,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.900
we have to use as
much tricks as we can.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.070
We got really inspired
from this process.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.410
So in "Pirate King," we
embedded those processes.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.630
Later on, of course,
we built a strategy

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.110
with the Google Play
team and, of course,

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.680
with our marketing team.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.270
And gradually, we started in--
we're located in Tel Aviv,

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.710
Israel-- so we
started in Israel.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.040
And then, we started
to grow in Singapore,

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.180
in Malaysia, in Thailand, and
all around Southeast Asia,

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.400
without localizing or culture.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.100
People told us, you cannot
get into Thailand without

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.970
localizing or culturalizing.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.530
And we said, we believe that
the product is everything.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.830
And we believe that we can bring
this experience to our users.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.350
So in our tipping
point, like in our top,

00:10:54.350 --> 00:11:00.420
it was 450,000 of installs a
day, only from Southeast Asia.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.799
And 70% of that was Google.

00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:05.840
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: You
localized the languages?

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.920
MOR SHANI: Nothing.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.420
Nothing.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.060
We only localized the souce--

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.226
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Just
publish it in the English?

00:11:11.226 --> 00:11:12.390
MOR SHANI: Yes.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.940
And we a little bit
localize the stores.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.330
We used a lot of content
community strategy.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.740
We worked really close, of
course, with the Play team.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.600
Very focused on the strategy.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.610
And then combining it both,
it was very, very strong.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:31.690
So as an early
developer in return--

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:36.230
it's really important to be
very focused on what you can do,

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.240
comparing to the
market, to the efforts.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.880
And then you can combine
it to a beautiful strategy.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.300
And now that we're
going global-- now

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.570
that we can afford going
global-- you really have to,

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.460
again, focus on the
emerging markets.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.290
And of course, we're aiming
to Latin America, and the US,

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:56.950
and of course, Europe.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.093
So for us, this journey
was very strong.

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.176
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Cool.

00:12:00.176 --> 00:12:02.070
How about Andres?

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.910
ANDRES BOU: For us, we always
launch the games globally.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.579
So we check the boxes
of all the countries

00:12:07.579 --> 00:12:08.495
around the world, huh?

00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:08.930
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: OK.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.590
ANDRES BOU: And then, we launch
always with one single KPI,

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.814
just because it's easier
for us to manage it.

00:12:13.814 --> 00:12:15.230
And then, depending
on the results

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.050
that we see on the KPIs--
[INAUDIBLE], monetization,

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.300
all the KPIs-- is
when we start doing

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.680
special focus on some markets.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.550
So apart from the core
mechanics from the game,

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.470
we change many,
many other things.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.170
We change the Play Store
art, we change the title

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.770
of the game, we market.

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.930
So we do special marketing
actions for each market

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.380
quite different
from one to another.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:46.110
Obviously, we translate
with local partners.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:47.270
We change the icon.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:50.440
So we have different price
points for some markets.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.810
And also, we do some
live vlogs or some offers

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.481
that are different from
one market to another.

00:12:56.481 --> 00:12:58.740
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Do
you have the office outside

00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.735
of the Barcelona?

00:12:59.735 --> 00:13:00.540
ANDRES BOU: What?

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.140
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Do
you have an office outside

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:02.940
of the Barcelona?

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:07.770
ANDRES BOU: We are opening
an office in Tokyo.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.980
We don't have anyone
physically there,

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.760
but we have Socialpoint
Tokyo company there.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.900
But we are willing
to grow there.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.130
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: So
we have only five minutes.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:26.730
So do we have any questions
within the panelists?

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:34.765
If we don't have, then let's
move on to ask the audience.

00:13:34.765 --> 00:13:37.490
Do we have any
questions in each other?

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:38.880
No?

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.410
No.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:44.260
OK, let's move on
to ask the audience.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.745
Any question to the panelists?

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.622
You can ask any questions.

00:13:54.622 --> 00:13:55.480
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:55.690
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: OK.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.481
AUDIENCE: I've got a
question for you guys.

00:13:57.481 --> 00:14:01.865
j changing icons globally,
like for localized markets,

00:14:01.865 --> 00:14:07.930
do you guys ever worry about
keeping a consistent brand

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.320
for your developer company?

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.320
Is this something that
you guys have dealt with?

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.480
MALE SPEAKER: You mean
changing the brand?

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.340
If you change the
icon, it can obviously

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.325
change the perception
of the brand,

00:14:19.325 --> 00:14:21.360
if it's not tied to your brand.

00:14:23.775 --> 00:14:25.650
GILBERT WEDAM: Specifically,
for that reason,

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.460
we didn't touch the
icon, because it

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.510
is part of the brand.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:34.390
And what we use A/B testing
a lot for is the screenshots.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.260
And so we do a lot of
A/B testing on that.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.420
But the icon, I think,
at least in our case--

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.850
maybe for games, it's
a bit different--

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.370
but for being a utility
app, I think the icon

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.620
is too much part of the brand.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.600
But I do wish I could,
because I would be curious

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.860
if there were strong effects,
if we changed the icon.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.285
But haven't done it.

00:15:00.285 --> 00:15:05.110
MASSIMO CIOCIOLA: In my
case, I remember one example

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.050
that really scared me.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:15.630
We use screenshot of the app,
which recalls the album's art.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:19.220
So in that case, we
had Katy Perry images.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.960
Obviously, all these things
we pay the rights for.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.240
And she was in a bikini, but
it was not offending picture.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:34.390
We got tons of complaints
by Arabian users.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:39.640
And this was not anything we
had even planned, you know?

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.210
How could you plan?

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.380
How could you think you can
really offending people?

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.450
So at that point, we
started doing A/B tests

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:53.550
with all the screenshots, and
we saw these going much better.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.800
I think it's like when you go
and you come in a country you

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.835
don't know, there might
be something that,

00:15:58.835 --> 00:16:00.910
in terms, culturally different.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:04.720
And this depends country
by country, you know?

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.000
So you have to deep understand.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.110
But you should ask
your users, you know?

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.230
I mean, since you're growing so
fast, I would always ask users,

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.250
you know?

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.440
Get feedback from them.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.190
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
And then A/B testing.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:20.440
MASSIMO CIOCIOLA: A/B testing.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.120
Another thing's very
useful, I think,

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.820
which we should all be thankful
to Google is the beta testing.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.730
I mean, we have
like, 15,000 beta--

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:34.510
I say we have 15,000
employee for free,

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:39.170
people testing your app
immediately since you release,

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.550
and providing you feedback.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.140
That's kind of amazing.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.036
But not all apps are using that.

00:16:46.036 --> 00:16:50.400
ANDRES BOU: For us, we
have changed the icon.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.120
I mean, for example,
"Monster Legends,"

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.590
we have changed the
icon between-- for Japan

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.930
we have one specific icon,
or for Europe, or the US,

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.924
we have other icons.

00:17:00.924 --> 00:17:03.340
And also, we have changed the
icon inside the same region.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.730
So for example, now we launched
a new version of the game

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.420
that we have-- "Alliances."

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.829
And we changed the icon from
the previous one to a new one.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:14.839
But when we do these
kind of changes,

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:16.579
we are worried about the brand.

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:17.740
I mean, is a good point.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.319
So we try to maintain
the essence of the icon,

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:25.319
keeping the core of the
icon, and adding a loop,

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:28.500
saying to the users, hey, there
is something new in the game.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.557
So we take care of the brand,
making changes on the icon,

00:17:32.557 --> 00:17:33.140
but carefully.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.850
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: All right.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.917
One question here.

00:17:42.587 --> 00:17:43.420
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:43.920
Thanks.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.740
I'm Alexis from Republic Labs.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.540
A question, maybe
more for Andres.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.776
The price localization
part, how important

00:17:54.776 --> 00:17:56.025
is it, the price localization?

00:17:56.025 --> 00:17:57.983
I mean, for example, I'm
thinking of a country,

00:17:57.983 --> 00:18:00.850
like Latin America, where maybe
certain games have a hard time

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:02.600
monetizing.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:07.360
Do you see a really important
effect, not just on revenues,

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.450
but also maybe on retention?

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.170
And as part of that, if you
have a multiplayer game, which

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:15.980
is your case, do you see
maybe players communicating

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.080
and complaining, hey, I'm
paying this in the US,

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.038
and you're paying that?

00:18:19.038 --> 00:18:21.200
And how risky is that?

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.260
ANDRES BOU: We have not seen
that-- users complaining

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.970
from one region to another.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:31.450
So what we normally do, we--
I mean, for example, LATAM,

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:37.590
it's 20% of our DAU, and
it's 4% of our revenues.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:42.682
If you check the payments--
the type of payments

00:18:42.682 --> 00:18:44.140
that they have
there-- it's totally

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.730
different to what
we have in Europe

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.890
or what we have in the US.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:51.560
So we have done
changes on pricing.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.760
We have seen improvements
from 10% to 25%

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.860
in some regions
and some markets.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:03.860
So I would say it's
important to have the prices.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.990
I wouldn't do it
at the beginning.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:10.100
I would launch the game,
see which is the ARPPU,

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.800
the A-R-P-P-U, that
you are seeing,

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.996
and then do improvements to try
to boost revenues by 10%, 15%,

00:19:14.996 --> 00:19:17.226
20% of [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:17.226 --> 00:19:19.290
REGINA CHAMMA:
Just to add here, I

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.920
think-- we've been
actually doing some price

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.720
experiments in the region.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.280
And definitely, this
is something new

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.280
in the emerging markets.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.682
I'm not talking only for
Brazil and Latin America,

00:19:29.682 --> 00:19:30.890
but all the emerging markets.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.220
Google actually is
investing quite a lot.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.220
We are putting not only the
technology there, but really

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.172
people there.

00:19:37.172 --> 00:19:38.630
We are spending
consumer marketing.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.990
We are really educating these
users to buy digital goods.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.690
We are not in Japan,
that people are

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:47.010
used to buy digital
goods-- or US, or UK.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.970
These people are just learning
how to use smart phones

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:54.830
and engage with digital
goods, or games, or apps,

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.380
so we need actually
to educate that.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.119
We just launched local forms of
payments in Brazil and Mexico,

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:01.660
for instance.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.210
So until last year,
we didn't have--

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.179
only international credit cards
were accepted in the store.

00:20:07.179 --> 00:20:09.720
So this is something that-- it's
a big [INAUDIBLE] that we've

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.710
been doing, not only in Latin
America, but all the emerging

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:13.620
markets.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.550
And we're going to be pushing
that, educating the users.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:22.330
But I definitely believe
changing prices, specifically

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.860
for some markets, are important.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.810
It's very hard for you, because
there are a lot of markets, no?

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.340
So I would recommend,
maybe, prioritize.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.990
OK, what is my-- maybe
20% of the installments

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.240
are coming from that market.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.160
Is that a market there
that I have to explore?

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:47.520
And if yes, try to find out
what is the right pricing point.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.980
What is the user behavior of
that market, should really

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.317
be your strategy.

00:20:51.317 --> 00:20:52.900
But this is something
that we're going

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.790
to be investing quite a lot
in the next months and years.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.070
And if you think that
most of these emerging

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:04.470
markets-- like 80% isn't
right-- it's a big thing.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.720
We are really
working to make sure

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:12.080
that users understand that
they can consume in the store.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.664
I think that is our approach.

00:21:15.664 --> 00:21:17.630
ANDRES BOU: Also,
apart from pricing--

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.230
We have some more time?

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.934
Or not?

00:21:20.934 --> 00:21:22.184
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Go ahead.

00:21:22.184 --> 00:21:23.800
We need to finish that.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.150
But if you have any
comment, then you can--

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:28.270
ANDRES BOU: No, I
know Alexis, so I

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.870
can chat with him later on.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:32.620
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
Ask him, then, later.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.790
So all right.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:38.110
So thank you, for joining us.

00:21:40.601 --> 00:21:41.100
OK.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.090
Let's finish the
go global sessions.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:48.040
But if you have any questions,
then please reach out us,

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.670
then ask the questions.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:50.410
All right.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.780
Thank you.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:57.590
Thank you, and then give the
big applause to the panelists.

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:58.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.240
