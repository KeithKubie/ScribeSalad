00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.567
[car tires]

00:00:02.567 --> 00:00:05.233
When you found out
you'd been hired by GE,

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:06.367
what was your reaction?

00:00:06.367 --> 00:00:08.066
I didn't believe it at first.

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.934
It really didn't sink in until
I got the first paycheck.

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:13.066
And I thought, I'm
really in here.

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.600
And you'd walk across
the parking lot

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.200
and look all the
way down the avenue

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.800
at all these antique,
100-year-old buildings.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.567
And it really felt like you
were part of something then.

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:23.500
What Kevin Green
has been a part of

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.367
is an iconic company
that has built

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:29.667
the majority of North America's
locomotives for over a century.

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:31.767
Without these massive
machines pulling freight

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:35.233
around the country, the
explosion of American industry

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:38.133
would have stopped
in its tracks.

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.767
Kevin's married, no kids.

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:43.433
And he's been working as a
machinist at GE for 15 years

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:44.800
now.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.333
We'd always had ups and downs
in the locomotive business.

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.200
There was layoffs sometimes.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.867
But then, they would
call people back.

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:53.300
But this time, it really looks
like it's going downhill,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.667
and it's not going
to come back up.

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:56.867
[train whistle]

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.066
This one was
made in about '47.

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:07.233
And that little tin railroad
station was built here in Erie.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.400
Kevin's friend, Donnie
Rhodes, also works at the plant.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.767
After working all day
in the din of a factory,

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:17.967
the wheels on the rails here
kind of helps you unwind.

00:01:17.967 --> 00:01:19.433
But the threat of
more layoffs makes

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:21.734
it almost impossible to unwind.

00:01:21.734 --> 00:01:25.333
Last summer, their close friend
Denny died of a heart attack

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.600
after he got laid off from GE.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.800
And you have to think that
the stress of not knowing what

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.333
you're going to do, and
where the good paychecks are

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:36.266
going to come from, that had
to be a contributing factor.

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:38.667
I don't think they give
one whit about the worker.

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:40.767
I don't think they give one
whit about the community

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.166
that the workers are in.

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:45.333
I mean, it's just demoralizing.

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:47.133
I don't see any happy ending.

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.500
Well, what are
you going to do?

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.166
I'm going to go to
school and take up

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:52.800
a degree in
international business,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.400
because if you can't beat them,
you might as well join them.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.767
Things are more
complicated for Kevin.

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:02.000
I don't think I could
pass a test right now.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.433
My concentration is zilch.

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:07.333
He's been diagnosed with a
severe case of Lyme disease

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:09.700
that's been expensive to treat.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.467
I had no idea there
was anything in the world

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:14.066
besides dementia or
Alzheimer's or something

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:15.633
that could do this to a person.

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:20.033
So let's say, Kevin, you lose
your job, your Lyme disease

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:21.767
gets worse.

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:23.100
What are you going to do?

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.033
I don't know.

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:27.033
I do not know.

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:28.000
It's looming.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.300
You know it's common.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.400
You're going to get the
tap on the shoulder,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.133
but you don't know when.

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:34.000
That must be really stressful.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.100
It is.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.533
[car tires]

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:43.066
It is damn cold here, Scott.

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:44.767
Do you ever get used to this?

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.567
Actually, this is about as
warm as I dress in the winter.

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:48.200
Really?

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.767
Yeah, it's not bad.

00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:52.166
Scott Lawson is president of
the local union representing

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:53.500
GE workers like Kevin.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.133
The famous Dionr with an O.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:55.967
Dinor with an O?

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:57.367
Yes.

00:02:57.367 --> 00:02:59.100
This is the only area in
the world you'll see this.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.567
Yeah.

00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:03.934
In GE's heyday, they had
as many as 22,000 people

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:05.066
working inside those gates.

00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:07.433
And today, there's
less than 3,000.

00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:11.333
It's just a constant bleed of
employees out of this plant.

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:14.100
Some jobs have been
lost to automation, others

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.300
to globalization.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.500
But in recent
years, they've been

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.600
lost to the Lone Star State.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.066
Lured by huge tax breaks,
GE built a locomotive plant

00:03:22.066 --> 00:03:24.834
in Fort Worth that's nonunion.

00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:27.233
And workers there are paid less.

00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:29.500
We watched,
basically, good jobs

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.834
being ripped out
of Pennsylvania,

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:33.700
given to the state of Texas.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.467
And you're talking a
multibillion dollar

00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:39.133
corporation that really
doesn't need the tax breaks.

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:41.800
These decisions affect
the entire community.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.834
An estimated 1 in 11
jobs in Erie County

00:03:44.834 --> 00:03:46.233
depend on the plant.

00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:47.600
There's a lot of
fabrication shops

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.367
and electrical shops that
do a lot of work for us.

00:03:50.367 --> 00:03:51.867
So it has a huge
ripple effect.

00:03:51.867 --> 00:03:53.667
It's a massive ripple effect.

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:57.166
GE insists it's laying off
workers to stay competitive,

00:03:57.166 --> 00:03:59.133
especially as
countries like China

00:03:59.133 --> 00:04:00.867
take a bigger share
of the market.

00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:03.934
When you have a business
that's running at 25% profits,

00:04:03.934 --> 00:04:07.033
it's hard to tell the employees,
we need more money out

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:08.600
of your pocket,
because we're not

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.266
going to be able to pay the
dividend to the shareholders.

00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:12.600
And GE is not the only one.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.333
You have a lot of companies
that are this way.

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:16.066
It's not about competitiveness.

00:04:16.066 --> 00:04:17.500
It's about union busting

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.934
Scott believes the
decline of unions

00:04:19.934 --> 00:04:21.734
is a big part of the problem.

00:04:21.734 --> 00:04:25.533
50 years ago, a third of the
US workforce was unionized.

00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:27.900
We'll stand up and fight back.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.233
[cheering]

00:04:29.233 --> 00:04:31.533
It's down to 11% today.

00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:34.266
And the gulf between the
rich and everyone else

00:04:34.266 --> 00:04:36.333
is now wider than ever before.

00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:38.166
Now, let's see if we can't
get you out of that truck

00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:39.667
and back in the plant, buddy.

00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:42.333
But Scott's members
make 2 and 1/2 times more

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:44.900
than the average
salary here in Erie,

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.200
about $70,000 plus benefits.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.867
There is an argument
that global competition

00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:52.700
has put a lot of pressure
on these corporations--

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.700
Sure.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.433
--and that unions
got too powerful.

00:04:56.433 --> 00:04:59.133
They got too greedy,
and they got lazy.

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:02.000
What's your reaction
when people say,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.533
you guys make too much an hour?

00:05:03.533 --> 00:05:05.800
What do you do for a living?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.066
That's what I ask them.

00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:10.834
We handcraft a 460,000
pound locomotive.

00:05:10.834 --> 00:05:13.100
And there's a lot of pride
in building something

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.166
that you know is going to run
for 20 years pulling freight

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:19.166
across the United States.

00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:21.133
And when you lose
that sense of pride,

00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:22.900
sometimes you lose
a sense of purpose.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.066
And that's what we're seeing.

00:05:26.066 --> 00:05:28.667
A lot of people turn
to drugs and alcohol.

00:05:28.667 --> 00:05:31.967
And some just say,
I've had enough.

00:05:31.967 --> 00:05:32.834
And kill themselves.

00:05:32.834 --> 00:05:34.300
Sure.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.834
We've had quite a few suicides
just from our workers.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.467
It was 7:00 o'clock
on a Friday night.

00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:43.166
It was the middle of the shift.

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:44.800
And we were working.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.667
And the machine I was on
faced this fellow's machine.

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:51.233
I looked over where
he was working,

00:05:51.233 --> 00:05:54.033
and he was handing on the crane.

00:05:54.033 --> 00:05:56.166
He had a choker around his neck.

00:05:56.166 --> 00:05:57.233
His knees were bent.

00:05:57.233 --> 00:05:59.633
And he was not moving.

00:05:59.633 --> 00:06:02.734
And he was about as white as
your paper on the counter.

00:06:02.734 --> 00:06:06.367
And I couldn't believe
what I was looking at.

00:06:06.367 --> 00:06:11.300
In 2017, Erie's suicide
rate reached an all time high,

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.166
the average victim, a
47-year-old white male.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:18.533
But the problem isn't
unique to this city.

00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:21.367
A recent study revealed a
shocking spike in the death

00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:23.533
rate for middle-aged
white working class

00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:29.233
Americans, caused by alcoholism,
drug overdoses, and suicides.

00:06:29.233 --> 00:06:32.133
I think a lot of people
are feeling that despair,

00:06:32.133 --> 00:06:33.600
especially if you
had a lucrative job,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.200
and you're facing a
change where you're going

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.233
to go back to
living hand-to-mouth

00:06:37.233 --> 00:06:38.500
like you were before.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.000
They don't know what
the future holds.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.133
I don't know what
it holds, either.

00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:44.400
But I'm going to find out.
