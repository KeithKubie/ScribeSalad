one of the challenges I think that we

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129
one of the challenges I think that we
 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.649
one of the challenges I think that we
need to face head-on when we think about

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659
need to face head-on when we think about
 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.960
need to face head-on when we think about
how we come across to other people is

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970
how we come across to other people is
 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.930
how we come across to other people is
really understanding that that that

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940
really understanding that that that
 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.990
really understanding that that that
perception is tricky and that for your

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000
perception is tricky and that for your

understand you it's really kind of an
uphill battle they're operating on very

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570
uphill battle they're operating on very

little information trying to get the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460
little information trying to get the
 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.029
little information trying to get the
right accurate image of you but the good

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039
right accurate image of you but the good
 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.849
right accurate image of you but the good
news is that the kinds of mistakes that

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859
news is that the kinds of mistakes that
 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.009
news is that the kinds of mistakes that
perceivers make are very predictable

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019
perceivers make are very predictable
 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.439
perceivers make are very predictable
right it's not random we know a lot

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449
right it's not random we know a lot
 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.720
right it's not random we know a lot
about the kinds of signals a person

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730
about the kinds of signals a person
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.220
about the kinds of signals a person
sends and how they tend to be perceived

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230
sends and how they tend to be perceived
 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.709

by other people President Obama when he

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719
by other people President Obama when he
 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.810
by other people President Obama when he
was running for re-election had his

first debate with Mitt Romney and he
 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.959
first debate with Mitt Romney and he
went into it according to everything

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
went into it according to everything
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.459
went into it according to everything
that was said afterwards he had gone

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469
that was said afterwards he had gone
 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.200
that was said afterwards he had gone
into it really trying to seem

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210
into it really trying to seem
 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.779
into it really trying to seem
presidential and not wanting to rise to

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
presidential and not wanting to rise to
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.670
presidential and not wanting to rise to
the bait you know kind of trying to take

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680
the bait you know kind of trying to take
 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.110
the bait you know kind of trying to take
advantage of the fact that he was coming

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
advantage of the fact that he was coming
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.299
advantage of the fact that he was coming
in as an incumbent president and it

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309
in as an incumbent president and it
 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.819
in as an incumbent president and it
turned out that at the end of it people

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
turned out that at the end of it people
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.770
turned out that at the end of it people
who were in the audience even people who

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780
who were in the audience even people who
 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.959
who were in the audience even people who
are fans of President Obama thought that

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
are fans of President Obama thought that
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.939
are fans of President Obama thought that
he had come across as lethargic as

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
he had come across as lethargic as
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.920
he had come across as lethargic as
disengaged wondering if he had had

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
disengaged wondering if he had had
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.200
disengaged wondering if he had had
enough sleep that night and afterwards

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
enough sleep that night and afterwards
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.530
enough sleep that night and afterwards
he was really quite surprised when he

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540
he was really quite surprised when he
 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.820
he was really quite surprised when he
spoke to his aides to find out how

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830
spoke to his aides to find out how
 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.590
spoke to his aides to find out how
poorly he had done because he really

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600
poorly he had done because he really
 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.510
poorly he had done because he really
thought he was very successfully coming

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520
thought he was very successfully coming
 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.460
thought he was very successfully coming
across as above the fray and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470
across as above the fray and
 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.260
across as above the fray and
presidential when in fact he was

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270
presidential when in fact he was
 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.020
presidential when in fact he was
actually seeming sort of out of it and

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
actually seeming sort of out of it and
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.640
actually seeming sort of out of it and
so you can think if someone like

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650
so you can think if someone like
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.710
so you can think if someone like
President Obama who's really a gifted

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
President Obama who's really a gifted
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.679
President Obama who's really a gifted
orator and has a lot of experience

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689
orator and has a lot of experience
 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.990
orator and has a lot of experience
trying to come across to other people in

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
trying to come across to other people in
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.300
trying to come across to other people in
a particular way if he can be so wrong

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
a particular way if he can be so wrong
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.210
a particular way if he can be so wrong
about how he's coming across then then

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
about how he's coming across then then
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.039
about how he's coming across then then
it's obviously pretty easy for the rest

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049
it's obviously pretty easy for the rest
 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.289
it's obviously pretty easy for the rest
of us to make the same mistake we tend

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299
of us to make the same mistake we tend
 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.120
of us to make the same mistake we tend
to think that that other people are

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
to think that that other people are
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.580
to think that that other people are
really paying attention really trying to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
really paying attention really trying to
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.530
really paying attention really trying to
understand us when most of the time

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540
understand us when most of the time
 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.660
understand us when most of the time
they're happy to just get the gist of

they're happy to just get the gist of
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.600
they're happy to just get the gist of
you and the gist can be totally wrong

really the part that's very automatic it

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659
really the part that's very automatic it
 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.450
really the part that's very automatic it
happens completely below your awareness

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460
happens completely below your awareness
 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.060
happens completely below your awareness
and that's where in the perceiver is

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070
and that's where in the perceiver is
 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.399
and that's where in the perceiver is
really trying to figure out you know the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409
really trying to figure out you know the
 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.979
really trying to figure out you know the
basics of you are you a an anxious

into phase 2 we take a more nuanced view
 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.570
into phase 2 we take a more nuanced view
of who you are so then that's when

that's the phase where you start to do
 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.199
that's the phase where you start to do
things like take the context of

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209
things like take the context of
 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.210
things like take the context of
someone's behavior into account take

a more nuanced view of you or if they're
just unable to go into Phase two because

just unable to go into Phase two because
 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.710
just unable to go into Phase two because
they're so busy with all the other
