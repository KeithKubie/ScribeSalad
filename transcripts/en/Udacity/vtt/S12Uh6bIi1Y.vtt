00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.719
All transcription factors have an optimal DNA sequence that

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.939
they can bind strongly to. Let's use the example that

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.860
we just looked at. If we use this sequence,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.900
what this means is that, a transcription factor, if it's

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.610
present, will bind this sequence, and strongly. But because

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.310
this is chemistry, if we change 1 or 2 of

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.190
the letters here, then we're going to change the interaction that

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.810
the protein can have with sequence After all the protein

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.920
can still recognize other letters in the sequence. So we expect it to

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.890
still be able to bind, but maybe not as strongly. So if we

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.530
change the sequence to something like this what will happen is the protein

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.910
can still bind, but less strongly

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.610
and less frequently thus reducing overall transcription.
