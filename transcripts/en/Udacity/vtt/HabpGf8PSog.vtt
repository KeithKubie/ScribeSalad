00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.240
Your game is going to look
awesome on the big screen.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.570
But before we look towards the future,
let's start with a trip to the past.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.350
First you need to be

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.610
aware of something called overscan
when you're designing your game.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.430
Overscan refers to a problem with
many older, and some modern TV's.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.510
Basically, some older CRTs
had trouble centering images,

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.899
and there was some variability
in how different models did it.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.640
The solution was to center
an image as best they could and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.130
then slightly enlarge it to make sure
it would take up the whole screen.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.840
Unfortunately, this meant that the edges
of the image would sometimes be cut off.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.460
So here, for example,
our Android's feet might not be visible.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.240
Surprisingly, even modern flat
screen TVs suffer from this problem,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.280
although for different technical
reasons and to a lesser degree.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.600
Here's what to do.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.570
I recommend establishing a safe zone for
important content.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.770
Your best bet is to avoid placing
important screen elements within

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.440
about 5% from each edge of the display.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.060
Five percent is a rough guideline and

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.540
that's because the overscan amount
varies on different television.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.340
Here's how that might look
on a 1080 pixel screen.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.490
We could add a 96 pixel
margin on the left and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.060
right edges and a 54 pixel margin
on the top and bottom edges.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.960
This is just for illustration.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.386
Check out the instructor notes, for

00:01:08.386 --> 00:01:10.459
more details on the specific
margins you should add.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.950
If you're designing a TV app, then you
don't need to worry about over scan if

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.450
you're using lean back fragments.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.290
For example, the browse fragment you
see here automatically applies overscan

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.440
margins to your layouts.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.110
If you're building a game that will run
on both a mobile device and a TV, then

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.580
at run time, you might want to detect
what type of device you're running on so

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.249
you can adjust how
the screen's base is used.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.410
You can do this using
the UI Mode Manager.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.660
And there's more details on this in the
building TV app section of this course.
