00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.740
Simplify the expression 28a to
the fourth, b to the sixth,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.370
over 7a to the ninth b.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.380
So a good place to start here
is to just try to kind of

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.520
break this up into things that
we can simplify a lot easier.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.255
So the 28 and 7, we know that
28 is divisible by 7.

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:22.490
So let's say we break that apart
into 28 times-- 28 over

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.030
7-- times-- and then we can
break this one apart-- a to

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.380
the fourth over a
to the ninth.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.100
So times a to the fourth
over a to the ninth.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.470
I'm just rewriting what we did
here, but I'm writing it as a

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.020
product of three terms instead
of just one term over here.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.710
And then finally, you have this
last term over here, b to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.910
the sixth over b.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.680
So times b to the
sixth over b.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.430
And if you multiplied all this
out, you'd take the product of

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.170
the numerators, you'd
get that up there.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.200
You get the product of the
denominators, you'd get this

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.970
right there.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.130
The whole reason I did that is
because each of these terms

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.170
can be simplified
pretty easily.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.290
This 28 over 7, that's easy.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.550
28 divided by 7 is 4.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.770
Then we have the
a to the fourth

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.790
divided by a to the ninth.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.240
And when you have an exponent
in the denominator, you can

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.850
subtract it from the exponent
in the numerator.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.930
We have the same base,
a, that's why I

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.020
grouped it this way.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.080
So this is going to be equal to
a to the 4 minus 9 power.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.870
What's 4 minus 9?

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.510
It's negative 5.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.110
4a to the negative 5.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.890
4 minus 9.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.080
And the same thing here
with the b's.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.280
Times b.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.080
6 minus-- you have a 1 here.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.570
You don't see the 1,
but it's there.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.850
If you just have a b, that's
the same thing

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.420
as b to the 1 power.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.360
So b to the sixth divided by b
to the 1 power is b to the

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.240
sixth minus 1, or b to
the fifth power.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.060
And we're done.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.840
We've simplified
the expression.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.750
If you don't want a negative
exponent there, you could say,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.450
well, this is the same thing
as 4 times 1 over a to the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.190
fifth-- that's the same thing as
a to the negative 5; these

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.740
two things are the exact same
thing-- times b to the fifth.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.900
And then this, of course, would
be equal to 4 b to the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.500
fifth, a to the fifth.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.660
Or you could put 4 b to the
fifth over a to the fifth.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.850
All of these are legitimate
ways, but all of these are

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.350
simplified versions of our
original expression.
