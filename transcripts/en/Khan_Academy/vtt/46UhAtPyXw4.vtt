00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.483
- Vroom vroom, vroom vroom.

00:00:01.483 --> 00:00:03.142
Okay, Elmo's ready!

00:00:03.142 --> 00:00:04.421
- Oh wait, I'm almost ready.

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:06.120
Um, there.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.680
Okay.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.620
- Yeah, ready?

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.457
(both giggle)

00:00:08.457 --> 00:00:10.303
The Elmo-mobile.

00:00:10.303 --> 00:00:12.940
- And the Zoe-mobile!

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.040
- Three, two, one!

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.660
- Yeah baby! Boy, Elmo's ramp worked! Yeah (laughs).

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.080
- Well mine didn't work!

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.620
I need a do-over!

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.160
- Okay, do-over, do-over (laughs)

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.957
- All right, three, two, one, woo.

00:00:27.957 --> 00:00:29.469
What? Oh!

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:32.113
It, it didn't work again!

00:00:32.113 --> 00:00:33.582
- Well, you know that's okay, Zoe.

00:00:33.582 --> 00:00:36.454
Zoe can play with Elmo's ramp.

00:00:36.454 --> 00:00:38.369
Elmo's ramp works great!

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:40.252
- Well thanks, Elmo.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.240
Boy, I guess I'm just no good at building ramps!

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.260
- Sorry.

00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:48.201
- Hi Elmo, hi Zoe.

00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:50.123
- Oh, hi Mr Sal.

00:00:50.123 --> 00:00:51.574
- What's wrong Zoe?

00:00:51.574 --> 00:00:53.851
- Oh, my ramp doesn't work.

00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:56.541
I'm just gonna go play with Elmo's ramp.

00:00:56.541 --> 00:00:57.970
- Oh, hold on a second.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.971
Any great engineering project is gonna involve

00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:01.630
some trial and error.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.593
It's not that your ramp doesn't work,

00:01:03.593 --> 00:01:05.512
it's just that it doesn't work yet!

00:01:05.512 --> 00:01:07.135
That's the power of 'yet'.

00:01:07.135 --> 00:01:09.164
- Woo, oh, Mr. Sal?

00:01:09.164 --> 00:01:11.058
Is that like a super power?

00:01:11.058 --> 00:01:11.891
- Kind of Elmo.

00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:14.018
It's a super power that we all have.

00:01:14.018 --> 00:01:16.265
It's the idea that mistakes aren't bad,

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:17.616
and that we learn from them,

00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:18.908
so we keep trying.

00:01:18.908 --> 00:01:21.887
- But I tried my ramp twice already.

00:01:21.887 --> 00:01:24.419
- Well what did you try differently the second time?

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:26.062
- Nothing.

00:01:26.062 --> 00:01:27.175
- Well why don't we look closer

00:01:27.175 --> 00:01:28.794
and see if we can try a different approach?

00:01:28.794 --> 00:01:30.627
And even if that doesn't work, it's okay.

00:01:30.627 --> 00:01:31.599
We'll learn from it.

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:32.432
- Ooh!

00:01:32.432 --> 00:01:36.143
- Okay, well, the Zoe-mobile crashed right here.

00:01:36.143 --> 00:01:36.976
- [Elmo] Yeah?

00:01:36.976 --> 00:01:40.144
- So maybe I need to just fill this hole.

00:01:40.144 --> 00:01:41.164
- That's a good idea.

00:01:41.164 --> 00:01:44.304
- I think I have a block that'll do just the trick.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:45.520
Here, wait.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.745
- Ooh!

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:49.021
- There you go, Zoe, I like the way you're thinking.

00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:50.441
Like the great engineer that you are.

00:01:50.441 --> 00:01:51.517
- Ah, all right!

00:01:51.517 --> 00:01:52.467
Here, let me try.

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:53.300
- [Elmo] Okay.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.934
- Come here, Zoe-mobile.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.900
Here we go!

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.186
- Oh boy.

00:01:58.186 --> 00:01:59.288
- Oh, no!

00:01:59.288 --> 00:02:02.190
Oh, that's it, I'm just giving up.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.873
- No, no, no, no, no!

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:06.126
Not if you believe in the power of 'yet'.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:09.909
You know how your muscles get stronger when you exercise?

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.850
- Oh yeah, I'm super strong.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.683
Watch this.

00:02:12.683 --> 00:02:14.497
- Oh, Elmo too.

00:02:14.497 --> 00:02:15.330
- Exactly!

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.556
Making mistakes and coming up with solutions

00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:20.858
to solve your problems is exercise for your brain.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.540
- Whoa! It's brainercize!

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.774
- Right! When you believe you can do it and you keep trying,

00:02:27.774 --> 00:02:29.797
that's when your brain is growing and you're learning

00:02:29.797 --> 00:02:30.630
new things.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.463
- Wow!

00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:33.169
- It's called a growth mindset.

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.993
- Okay, well then, I'm gonna try again!

00:02:36.993 --> 00:02:38.141
- Okay Zoe!

00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:38.974
- Now let's see.

00:02:38.974 --> 00:02:42.495
That time the Zoe-mobile crashed right here.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.328
- Right.

00:02:43.328 --> 00:02:45.058
- So maybe if I get rid of this block.

00:02:45.058 --> 00:02:46.006
- Yeah, ooh.

00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:46.845
- Oh hey!

00:02:46.845 --> 00:02:48.979
Look at that nice straight line all the way down!

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:49.812
- Ah, uh huh!

00:02:49.812 --> 00:02:50.843
- I'll bet that'll do it!

00:02:50.843 --> 00:02:51.703
Here let me try.

00:02:51.703 --> 00:02:52.536
- Okay.

00:02:52.536 --> 00:02:54.138
- Come here Zoe-mobile.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.140
Here we go!

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.780
- Yay! Good job Zoe!

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.420
Oh boy, the Zoe-mobile went so fast!

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.120
- Yeah!

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.960
Hey, can Zoe make Elmo's ramp taller and faster too?

00:03:07.962 --> 00:03:09.457
- Yeah, let's do it together!

00:03:09.457 --> 00:03:11.162
- Yeah, okay!

00:03:11.162 --> 00:03:12.295
- Great job guys.

00:03:12.295 --> 00:03:14.778
I'm so proud that you kept trying,

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:16.588
and you weren't afraid to make mistakes.

00:03:16.588 --> 00:03:19.760
And because of it we all learned a ton.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.040
And that's the power of 'yet'.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.066
- Yeah! Come on Zoe, let's play.

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:24.899
- Alright!

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.180
- Okay so, maybe if there's like something here?
