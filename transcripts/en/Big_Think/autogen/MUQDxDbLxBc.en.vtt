00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
taller offspring are growing taller and
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.940
taller offspring are growing taller and
taller and that is almost certainly due

tall where food is abundant and there's

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
tall where food is abundant and there's
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.569

so you don't have kids if on the other

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680
so you don't have kids if on the other
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.740
so you don't have kids if on the other
hand you live where food is abundant

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750

fruits growing on trees as the saying
 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.870
fruits growing on trees as the saying
goes you can be taller and be just

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880
goes you can be taller and be just
 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.980
goes you can be taller and be just
ultimately a more a bigger animal in the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
ultimately a more a bigger animal in the
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.900
ultimately a more a bigger animal in the
same forest in the same jungle and just

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
same forest in the same jungle and just
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.100
same forest in the same jungle and just
be more successful so the answer is both

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110
be more successful so the answer is both
 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.059

you got eat

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069
you got eat

you with that if you don't eat breakfast

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
you with that if you don't eat breakfast
 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.920
you with that if you don't eat breakfast
you're just you're just not going to be

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930
you're just you're just not going to be
 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.889
you're just you're just not going to be
as successful in life
