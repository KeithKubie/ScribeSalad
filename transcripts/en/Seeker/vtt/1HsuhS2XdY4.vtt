00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:05.480
Oil spills are dirty, disgusting, damaging,
disasters, but don’t worry, because scientists

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.590
are going to start cleaning them up with FIRE.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.849
TORNADOS.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.289
Hey hotties, Jules here for DNews!

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.080
Fire is… kind of a strange phenomenon.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.630
It’s one of those things that human civilization
has learned to both deeply love and deeply

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.630
fear.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.150
It cooks food, it burns down cities, it creates
light, it burns down property, it sanitizes,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.699
it burns down people.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.100
But unlike water or air or land, fire is distinct
from the others in that it is an active chemical

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.230
reaction.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.040
Which is great, because we can change one
side of the reactive equation and change the

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.440
nature of the fire.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.910
First of all, when I say that fire is a chemical
reaction, I mean it in exactly the same way

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.980
that something like rust is a chemical reaction.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.980
In fact, on a broad enough scale, rust is
just as much much slower, but almost chemically

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.780
identical version of fire.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.180
See, because basically all fire is, is rapid
oxidation.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.280
Oxidation is when an atom or compound loses
electrons in a chemical reaction, which is

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.210
pretty easy to explain using the example of
rust.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.840
When something made of iron is exposed to
oxygen atoms in the presence of moisture,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.680
the iron “steals” electrons from the oxygen.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.860
Now the iron and oxygen have opposite charges,
and like Britney and Kevin, opposites attract,

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.010
converting the iron into a flaky, reddish
material called iron oxide, AKA “rust”.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.440
The oxidation of fire occurs when those same
oxygen atoms are in the presence of hydrogen,

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.370
carbon, and intense heat.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.630
But the chemical reaction is so incredibly
fast that it causes “combustion”, and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.000
all the energy generated by this chemical
process is released in the form of heat and

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.670
light.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.140
See, what you observe as fire is actually
only a small visible portion of the reaction

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.600
called a “flame”.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.210
Flames are mostly made up of reaction byproducts,
like carbon dioxide (which is carbon and oxygen),

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.860
water (hydrogen and oxygen), oxygen (oxygen
and oxygen).

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.440
Any smoke floating from the top of a yellow
flame is unburned fuel, also called “soot”.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.060
The more smoke, and the more yellow a flame,
the more impure it is, and that’s kind of

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.790
a big problem with fire.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.789
Combustion that produces a ton of byproducts
is dirty, uses a ton of fuel, and leaves a

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.930
mess when it’s done.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.550
That’s why cars run on gasoline, and not
twigs lit on fire and shoved into the twig-tank.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.970
Gasoline burns much cleaner, is more energy-efficient,
and leaves much less residue than a forest

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.970
fire.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.900
The cleaner and more efficient we can make
fire, the easier it is to work with, and the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.260
better it is for practical applications.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.910
One of the least practical versions of fire
is a FIRE TORNADO, which is a raging whirlwind

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.340
of unstoppable destructive energy, not unlike
Kanye West.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.190
But recently, engineers at the University
of Maryland found a way of turning a raging

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.240
fire tornado, into a small, pure blue, almost
perfect fire whirl.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.319
To do this, they filled a pan with water,
poured liquid fuel on top, lit it, and pulled

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.599
cold air through the mixture.

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.670
After some time, the two-foot-tall bright
yellow tornado condensed into a three-inch-tall

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.680
blue flame, producing almost no byproducts
at all, and using the fuel source with very

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.950
high efficiency.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.610
The engineers were looking for a new way to
deal with oil spills, but the applications

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.260
for such a useful flame are almost endless.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.620
Think of everything we use that relies on
combustion, starting with planes, trains,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.970
and automobiles, not to mention gigantic rocket
ships, tiny cigarette lighters, and industrial

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.970
factories.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.290
Being able to use less fuel and leave no byproducts
can save an endless amount of money, cut back

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.319
dramatically on pollution, and make fire more
controllable and above all: safer.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.800
That said, researchers have effectively no
real idea as to why they got this blue whirl

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.090
to occur or how long they can theoretically
sustain it.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.730
But when science finally harnesses the power
of the fire tornado, we’re going to see

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.390
a lot of changes in the way we burn.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.470
Obviously it would be great if we could clean
up oil spills with fire, but what about the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.680
pollution that comes out of your car?

00:03:43.680 --> 00:04:03.450

car companies can cheat emissions tests here.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.849
