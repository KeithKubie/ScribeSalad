00:00:00.381 --> 00:00:01.944
- [Voiceover] Let's say this is me

00:00:01.944 --> 00:00:04.302
and I am floating in space.

00:00:04.302 --> 00:00:06.415
My coordinate system,
my frame of reference,

00:00:06.415 --> 00:00:07.268
we've seen it before,

00:00:07.268 --> 00:00:09.401
we'll call it the S frame of reference.

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:12.198
Any point in spacetime,

00:00:12.198 --> 00:00:15.068
we give it an x and y coordinates.

00:00:15.068 --> 00:00:16.804
And let's say that we have my friend.

00:00:16.804 --> 00:00:21.193
We've involved her in
many other videos before.

00:00:21.193 --> 00:00:24.667
She is traveling with a relative velocity

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:27.450
to me of v.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.949
So v right over there.

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.149
Her frame of reference,

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.119
we call it the S prime frame of reference,

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:35.313
and you can denote any event

00:00:35.313 --> 00:00:37.224
in spacetime by the coordinates

00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:40.979
x prime and

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:43.520
ct prime.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.734
Now you could also do it
as t prime if you like,

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:47.480
but we've been doing it as ct prime

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.716
so that we have similar units.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.947
Now let's say that we have
a third character now.

00:00:52.947 --> 00:00:54.572
This is going to get interesting.

00:00:54.572 --> 00:00:57.416
Let's say this third
character is traveling

00:00:57.416 --> 00:01:01.053
with a velocity u in
my frame of reference.

00:01:01.053 --> 00:01:03.952
So u is equal to change in x

00:01:03.952 --> 00:01:07.666
over change in time.

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.571
If we know all of this information,

00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:11.683
let's see if we can come
up, we can formulate a way

00:01:11.683 --> 00:01:12.800
if we know what the change in x

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.193
and change in time is
and we know what v is,

00:01:16.193 --> 00:01:18.632
if we can figure out what
is this velocity going to be

00:01:18.632 --> 00:01:20.826
in the S prime frame of reference,

00:01:20.826 --> 00:01:23.466
in this purple friend's
frame of reference.

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:26.365
What we want to figure out is what is,

00:01:26.365 --> 00:01:28.539
let me do it in that purple color,

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.752
we wanna figure out what
is going to be the change

00:01:30.752 --> 00:01:35.384
in x prime over change in t prime.

00:01:35.384 --> 00:01:36.927
If we figure this out then we know

00:01:36.927 --> 00:01:39.669
what will this velocity
look like in the S prime

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:41.701
frame of reference.

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.505
Well let's just go back to
the Lorentz Transformations.

00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:47.107
Let's first think about what our...

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:48.365
Let's first think about

00:01:48.365 --> 00:01:52.273
what change in x prime is going to be.

00:01:52.273 --> 00:01:54.589
Well our change in x prime is going to be

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:58.895
the Lorentz factor times our change in x,

00:01:58.895 --> 00:02:03.895
change, this in white,
times our change in x

00:02:04.098 --> 00:02:06.902
minus beta

00:02:06.902 --> 00:02:11.900
times change in ct.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.476
Let me close those parentheses.

00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:17.726
Then we wanna divide that
by our change in time.

00:02:17.726 --> 00:02:21.180
We wanna divide it by our change in time.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.020
So change in time

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.194
or change in t prime I should say.

00:02:27.194 --> 00:02:29.013
Well let me just go back to
the Lorentz Transformation.

00:02:29.013 --> 00:02:30.978
Let me write it the way
that I'm used to writing it.

00:02:30.978 --> 00:02:34.333
I'm used to writing it as

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:39.067
change in ct prime, which
is the same thing as

00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:41.668
c times the change in t prime,

00:02:41.668 --> 00:02:46.356
is equal to the Lorentz factor

00:02:46.356 --> 00:02:49.261
times

00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:52.919
this is going to be change in ct

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:56.474
or I could write it as c change in t

00:02:56.474 --> 00:03:00.398
minus beta

00:03:00.398 --> 00:03:04.971
times change in x.

00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:08.256
Once again I could have
written this as change in ct

00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:10.633
or I could write this
as c times change in t

00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:13.132
because the c isn't changing.

00:03:13.132 --> 00:03:15.611
So we know that all ready.

00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:18.293
If we wanted to solve for
just change in t prime,

00:03:18.293 --> 00:03:20.893
we could just divide both sides by c.

00:03:20.893 --> 00:03:21.725
So let's do that.

00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:26.521
If we divide all of this by c,

00:03:26.821 --> 00:03:28.758
what do we get?

00:03:28.758 --> 00:03:31.026
This is a form, we've
seen this in other videos

00:03:31.026 --> 00:03:32.913
that you might recognize
and you might see this

00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:34.234
in some textbooks.

00:03:34.234 --> 00:03:38.805
Our change in t prime is
going to be equal to gamma

00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:41.954
times, well c times delta t divided by c

00:03:41.954 --> 00:03:46.209
is just going to be delta t.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.931
And then if you take, so
minus, beta divided by c.

00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:52.028
Well let's just remind ourselves

00:03:52.028 --> 00:03:55.360
that beta is equal to v over c.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.195
So beta divided by c is

00:03:58.195 --> 00:04:00.897
v over c squared.

00:04:00.897 --> 00:04:05.468
I could write this as
minus v over c squared

00:04:05.468 --> 00:04:09.851
change in x.

00:04:10.831 --> 00:04:13.398
Change in t prime, let's write that now.

00:04:13.398 --> 00:04:15.836
That's going to be equal to

00:04:15.836 --> 00:04:19.471
you have your gamma

00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:22.214
times change in time

00:04:22.214 --> 00:04:23.982
in my coordinate system.

00:04:23.982 --> 00:04:28.013
So not the t prime just change in t

00:04:28.013 --> 00:04:32.971
minus v over c squared change in x.

00:04:33.336 --> 00:04:35.328
Immediately there's at
least one simplification

00:04:35.328 --> 00:04:36.364
we can do.

00:04:36.364 --> 00:04:37.908
We can divide both the numerator

00:04:37.908 --> 00:04:40.560
and the denominator by gamma.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.490
I keep wanting to change...

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.989
So we can divide the numerator
and denominator by gamma

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:46.696
that simplifies it a little bit.

00:04:46.696 --> 00:04:51.443
We can write this as our change in x prime

00:04:51.673 --> 00:04:54.616
over change in t prime

00:04:54.616 --> 00:04:56.816
is equal to

00:04:56.816 --> 00:04:59.138
in the numerator we have change in x

00:04:59.138 --> 00:05:02.206
and actually let me just
write out what beta is.

00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:04.893
Beta, I'll do it over here,

00:05:04.893 --> 00:05:08.306
minus v over c that's what beta is

00:05:08.306 --> 00:05:09.951
And actually let me take the c out.

00:05:09.951 --> 00:05:13.487
Change in ct is the same
thing as c times change in t.

00:05:13.487 --> 00:05:17.490
So times c delta t.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.776
v divided by c times c
is just going to be v.

00:05:21.776 --> 00:05:23.322
Let me write it that way.

00:05:23.322 --> 00:05:24.971
This part, these cancel out.

00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:28.628
This is the same thing as
change in x minus v change in t.

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:31.085
Let me write it that way, simplfy it.

00:05:31.085 --> 00:05:35.616
Minus v change in t, that's our numerator.

00:05:35.616 --> 00:05:39.558
And then our denominator is change in t

00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:43.784
minus v over c squared change in x.

00:05:43.784 --> 00:05:45.815
It looks like we're getting close here.

00:05:45.815 --> 00:05:49.290
But we don't have the
change in x change in t.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.850
We have how much of a change in x

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.801
we have for a given change in t.

00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:55.650
So what we could do is we
could divide the numerator

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.262
and the denominator by delta t.

00:05:59.262 --> 00:06:02.289
We could multiply the
numerator by one over delta t.

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:04.544
And the denominator by one over delta t

00:06:04.544 --> 00:06:05.804
which is equivalent to dividing

00:06:05.804 --> 00:06:07.694
the numerator and the
denominator each by delta t.

00:06:07.694 --> 00:06:09.074
And why am I doing that?

00:06:09.074 --> 00:06:11.940
Well, if I do that this
first term right over here

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.027
is going to be delta x over delta t

00:06:15.027 --> 00:06:16.715
which we know.

00:06:16.715 --> 00:06:21.715
Then we have minus v, cuz
delta t divided by delta t

00:06:21.894 --> 00:06:23.460
is just going to be one.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.126
And then our denominator

00:06:25.126 --> 00:06:27.930
delta t divided by delta t is just one.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.450
Then we're gonna have minus v

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.990
over c squared

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.933
and then times delta x divided by delta t.

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:42.191
This is cool.

00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:44.142
We've just been able to
figure out what our velocity

00:06:44.142 --> 00:06:46.032
in the primed coordinate system,

00:06:46.032 --> 00:06:49.080
in the S prime frame of
reference is in terms of

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.350
the relative velocity between
the S prime frame of reference

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.014
and my frame of reference.

00:06:54.014 --> 00:06:57.976
Delta x delta t the velocity
in my frame of reference.

00:06:57.976 --> 00:06:59.886
And well we know all of
this other stuff too,

00:06:59.886 --> 00:07:01.918
this is just delta x
delta t and this is v.

00:07:01.918 --> 00:07:03.035
Or we can even write it like this.

00:07:03.035 --> 00:07:07.180
We said delta x over delta
t is going to be equal to u.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.281
So it's equal to u minus v

00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:13.281
over one minus,

00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:14.899
delta x over delta t is just u.

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:17.094
So this is just u here.

00:07:17.094 --> 00:07:20.126
It's u times v

00:07:20.126 --> 00:07:21.425
or v times u,

00:07:21.425 --> 00:07:25.184
all of that over c squared.

00:07:25.184 --> 00:07:28.313
This is a really, really,
really useful deriviation

00:07:28.313 --> 00:07:29.613
which we're going to apply some numbers to

00:07:29.613 --> 00:07:32.254
in the next video so we can appreciate

00:07:32.254 --> 00:07:35.227
kinda how fun this is on some level.
