HELEN ARNEY: (SINGING) There
are ways to waste your time

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.650
until departure.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.520
Like playing golf or reading
Jeffrey Archer.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.870
Some people spend some proper
afternoons on Wagner opera.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.550
But Friday by Rebecca Black
is three minutes

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.490
you won't get back.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.760
So I have tried to write a song
that set a record for how

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.020
long a song can possibly
go on.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.540
Are you ready, Matt?

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:54.073
It goes, 1,
[SINGING GOOGOL SONG]

00:00:54.073 --> 00:00:55.746
That's right, let's
do it again.

00:00:55.746 --> 00:00:56.942
Come on.

00:00:56.942 --> 00:00:58.268
[SINGING GOOGOL SONG]

00:00:58.268 --> 00:01:00.153
you can sing along,
if you like.

00:01:00.153 --> 00:01:02.620
[SINGING GOOGOL SONG]

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.010
although not if you're
in a library

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.000
or on public transport.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.080
[SINGING GOOGOL SONG]

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.290
We need to get a few
more of these done.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.050
How about we do three
harmonies.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.980
That way we'll get it
down a lot quicker.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.920
All right, here we go.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:29.460
[SINGING GOOGOL SONG]

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.710
MATT PARKER: Nearly, hang on.

00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:37.821
Hang on.

00:01:40.864 --> 00:01:42.114
Phew.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.230
HELEN ARNEY: (SINGING) Well
bang the drum and play the

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.660
victory bugle.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.400
What you did just there
is sing a Googol.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.650
One a hundred big fat zeros.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.390
But yourself a drink,
you hero.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.240
Well, why complete this
pointless task?

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.230
Well now, you're ready for
the advanced class.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.880
The next idea is more complex.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.090
It's the ultimate time
waster's test.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.430
We'll tried to sing
a Googolplex.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.070
It's going to take
a bit longer.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.530
1, [SINGING GOOGOLPLEX SONG]

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.150
come on, everyone.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.234
[SINGING GOOGOL SONG]

00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:47.186
Why are you not doing
it, Matt?

00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:49.138
[SINGING GOOGOLPLEX SONG]

00:02:49.138 --> 00:02:51.090
MATT PARKER: We're not
going to make it.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.390
HELEN ARNEY: Matt, I thought
you liked math.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.370
Seriously.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.124
Why are you carrying on?

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:58.630
MATT PARKER: Because look, we
managed just, eventually, to

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.070
get 100 zeroes.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.180
But a googol of zeroes-- there's
no way we're going to

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.860
get a googol of zeroes
on this board.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.220
In fact, even if every single
subscriber to Numberphile, if

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.860
they were all singing
along, which,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.270
believe me, they're not.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.315
But if the approximately half
a million subscribers, so

00:03:14.315 --> 00:03:19.000
that's 5 times 10 to the 5, if
they all joined in, and they

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.140
did 100 each, times 10 to the
2, then that's only going to

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.940
be 5 times 10 to the 7.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.820
We will have hit 5, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.910
That's half a million people.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:34.090
HELEN ARNEY: That's rubbish.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.926
MATT PARKER: It's accurate.

00:03:36.926 --> 00:03:39.850
HELEN ARNEY: All right, let's
try a few other things.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.030
Let's say that we're singing
about what 1.5 0's per second.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.170
And I think we can recruit
everyone alive

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.020
on Earth right now.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.800
All of you Numberphiles,
get hold of

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.810
everyone alive on Earth.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.750
It's about 7 billion
people, right?

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.400
MATT PARKER: Yeah.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.690
HELEN ARNEY: And how about we
have been singing since the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.275
dawn of time.

00:03:56.275 --> 00:03:58.060
How about we do that.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.070
So that's about [INAUDIBLE]
billion years.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.590
Can you do that in seconds
for me, Matt?

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.050
MATT PARKER: It's round about 3
times 10 to the 17 seconds.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.630
HELEN ARNEY: OK, that's good.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.050
That's getting a good
number up now.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.030
So now we want to do
some more 0's.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.500
So how about we do want my old
music teacher used to suggest.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.050
She used to say sing with
every cell in your body.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.200
So that's 75 trillion cells.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.670
So pop that in as well.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.470
That's it, good.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.630
All right, now that should be
getting somewhere near a

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.300
googolplex.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.070
That's what we're aiming for.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.490
That's what we're going
to be near.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.700
MATT PARKER: OK, if we had every
single human singing

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.710
with every single cell, that's
3 times 10 to the 41, which

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:43.646
means you're up to around about
10, 20, 30, 41, there.

00:04:43.646 --> 00:04:44.760
HELEN ARNEY: That is not bad.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.260
Seriously, that's like half.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.750
I mean, we're halfway there.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:48.800
If we carry on--

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.110
MATT PARKER: No.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.492
HELEN ARNEY: No, we just
need to do double.

00:04:50.492 --> 00:04:52.610
No look, Brady, do the ding.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.495
Ding, ding, ding--

00:04:54.495 --> 00:04:55.236
[DING]

00:04:55.236 --> 00:04:57.800
MATT PARKER: Exactly, right
we're not halfway there.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.132
You don't compare the
size of numbers by

00:05:01.132 --> 00:05:02.980
lining up the digits.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.280
It's not a [BLEEP]

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.910
sudoku.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.220
What was that ding?

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.632
What you do, right,
is you compare the

00:05:08.632 --> 00:05:10.240
actual relative sizes.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.650
So just to put into perspective,
if we had every

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.630
single human singing with every
single cell of their

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.740
body, and let's say a googol
of zeroes, which is what we

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.670
have to sing.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.910
Let's say that was the size of
the entire known universe.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.480
And I'm using the volume of the
known university, not the

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.820
mass, because I just haven't
got a [BLEEP]

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.120
clue what the mass is.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.110
But if the universe was a google
of zeroes, every single

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.300
human then sung with every
single cell since the dawn of

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:46.810
time, we will have sung the
proportional volume of that.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.800
It's pretty small.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.360
Volume-wise, it's
incredibly thin.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.340
HELEN ARNEY: Is that is.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.620
MATT PARKER: That's it.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.000
That's every single human,
every single

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.760
cell, dawn of time.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.363
And everything else
in existence

00:05:57.363 --> 00:05:58.960
is the entire googol.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.036
HELEN ARNEY: Well, that
is disappointing.

00:06:04.036 --> 00:06:05.286
MATT PARKER: It's accurate.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.600
HELEN ARNEY: Well, what I've
learned today is that (SING) I

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:19.840
can sing a googol, sing a
googol, but not a googolplex.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.650
Good?

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.900
Happy day?
