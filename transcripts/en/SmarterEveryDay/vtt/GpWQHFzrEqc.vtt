00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Everyday

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.260
I just interviewed the President of the United States of America

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.380
Which is really strange because I'm not a journalist

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.360
I'm not a politician. I'm a rocket engineer.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.660
Which means I'm going to come at this thing from a completely different angle than most people

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.180
The process of interviewing the President is strange because you learn things about him,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.120
and the White House of course, but you learn things about yourself.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.660
Four parts of this video:

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.600
The mechanics of how this happened; what my goals for the interview were;

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.460
the interview itself; and what I learned.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.700
My understanding is there was a long list of people being considered

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.160
and then at some point, I was interviewed as a potential candidate.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.400
I'm not a registered Republican or Democrat, but they asked me point blank who I voted for

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.920
and I didn't tell them

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.700
but the way I answered the question made it pretty clear to me

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.860
I was not going to be selected.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.080
But I was.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.320
It was a secret for 3 weeks, and then I went out to L.A. to shoot a promo for the interview.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.720
It was there that I met Adonde and Ingrid.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.720
They were super cool and really down to earth.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.840
When I got home, I asked the Internet what they thought I should ask the President

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.060
And I got all kinds of answers.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.020
I mean, good ones, bad ones. It was amazing.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.180
But think about it, I don't agree with the president on every single issue,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.760
so I have a huge opportunity here,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.920
I could sit down with the most powerful man in the world and tell him how I think he should run the country,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.600
or I could accept the fact that he might see things differently than I do

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.900
and try to have a meaningful, intelligent, respectful conversation.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.140
My goal was not to just have this intelligent, respectful conversation

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.420
with somebody I might disagree with on other topics

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.640
but to demonstrate that it could actually be fun!

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.220
To do this, I went to Washington to meet the President.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.360
The day before the interview we went to a studio

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.840
in Maryland, and we practiced with a guy named Fredrick.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.780
He's a stand-in hired by Google and he's a really cool guy.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.620
The next day, we went to the White House and we got to meet the President's dogs

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.760
which were really, really soft by the way.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.740
We did some dry runs to make sure we knew how to roll our sets around,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.960
and then each of us kind of went off and reviewed our questions one last time

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960
to make sure we knew what we were gonna say.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.060
We then waited for the President, and he walked in and we started the interview.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.520
The President had already been briefed on who the 3 of us were,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.680
and the fact the Swoozie was gonna give him a lightning round,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.460
then I was gonna watch a video with him,

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.740
and that Ingrid was gonna ask him about what's in his pockets.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.380
A lot of people wanna know, did I share my questions

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.040
with the White House, these are the actual cards, before the interview?

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.300
And the answer is 'no.'

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.280
This is how I know this:

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.460
I was looking into his eyes during the interview,

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.460
and it was clear, through nonverbal communication,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.340
that these things were hittin' him cold.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.540
That impressed me! When I figured that out,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.700
I was like, "Holy cow. A common citizen going to the White House,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.560
talking to the most powerful man in the world,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.360
on a live internet interview,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.560
that is an incredible amount of transparency."

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.020
And I don't care what you say about the man's politics,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.720
that impressed me, and I appreciated that.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.780
For many reasons, I wasn't nervous, I was actually

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.140
really excited about this.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.860
I decided to ask the first question on

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.680
how he gets smarter on topics he might not be the expert on.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.680
It was an interesting answer, because it's clear that he's

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.420
changed his methods over the course of his presidency.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.660
As he was answering this question, it was pretty clear to me that he was in interview mode:

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.660
His body language was a little rigid.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.280
Now keep in mind that at this point, the President still doesn't know what kind of interviewer I'm gonna be.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.980
For all he knows, I could be hostile.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.840
What happened next was a moment I will never forget

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.920
I knew before he did that we were on the same wavelength,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.620
and I really wanted to let him know that,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.520
after all, I had listened to him already for 10 hours via audiobook.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.520
If you watch the President's face,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.360
you can see the exact moment that we connect.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.720
Obama: And that I think is pretty consistent with,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.220
you know, how scientists approach problems generally.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.180
Destin: Now, I actually knew that about you because I've listened to your audiobooks,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.340
and, in "Dreams of My Father,"

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.080
it ended with the 2004 Democratic National Convention speech.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.860
Did you see it? Let's back it up and watch his body language.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.340
He's a little guarded, and then the connection.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.400
Isn't that cool?

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.920
It's the exact moment that this quit being an interview,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.860
and became a fun, intelligent conversation

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.060
between two individuals who want the best for each other.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.380
It was a really cool moment, and I won't forget it.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.740
My second question was about polarization.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.920
It's been clear to me that the country is more polarized now than it's been in a really long time,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.280
and in fact there's data to back this up.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.980
Whatever your views are, it's become really popular to yell

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.400
at the other side and blame them for all the county's problems.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.020
The president went into why he thinks this is happening.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.220
Obama: And the problem is, is that when we get to our politics,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.580
for a whole host of reasons,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.460
a lot of it having to do with the fact that, you know, our media is now splintered,

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.880
and so some people, they're just watching Fox News,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.880
some people are just reading the New York Times,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.100
so they're not, they don't even start with a common baseline of facts.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.460
They almost occupy two different realities in terms of how they see the world.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.920
Destin: In engineering control theory, there's something called a feedback loop.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.660
There's a positive feedback, and a negative feedback.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.040
If you remove negative feedback from any system, it almost always goes divergent and chaotic.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.780
This is not political science. This is math.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.860
When people on the left or the right only listen to the media that agrees with their way of thinking,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.620
that's a dangerous situation.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.980
If there's no negative feedback pulling you towards the center, you're gonna drift out closer to the extremes.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.040
I really appreciated what the President said here,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.360
because it's a responsibility of everybody on both sides of the political debate

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.520
to listen to both sides of the argument.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.020
If not, you're only going to be in an echo chamber, and you're only gonna listen to those voices

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.020
that amplify what you want to hear, and pretty soon there's nothing but yelling.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.420
My third question was about space, which is when I solicited the presidential fist bump,

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.040
then forgot to blow it up like a gentleman scholar.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.820
Anyway, you can tell by my face I was really excited about this question

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.100
and I'd love for you to go listen to the president's answer.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.560
I wanted to end on a fun note, so I asked him this really cool question from Reddit:

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.780
Destin: If there was an element named after you, Obamium,

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.680
You've never been asked this, I hope.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.500
Obama: I have never been asked this!

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.500
Destin: Yes!

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.400
So the question is:

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.740
Obama: This is a first.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.940
Destin: So what would you want the physical properties--

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.820
Obama: What would be the elements of... what would be the--

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.820
Destin: Obamium is the element.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.820
Obama: What would be the characteristics of Obamium?

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.900
Destin: That's right, that's right.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.980
Obama: That's interesting.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.740
Destin: I'm not gonna play his answers now, because I encourage you to go watch the full interview,

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.060
in it's entirety, on the White House's Youtube channel.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.600
Ok, time to talk about what I learned,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.980
The exercise of thinking through what you would ask the most powerful man in the world

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.980
is very different when you're sitting at home on the couch or talking to your buddies around the water cooler

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.060
than if you're actually planning on going and sitting down, and looking him in the eye

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.440
and asking him the questions.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.260
I found myself wanting to be more informed,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.700
more cordial, I wanted to be more forgiving,

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.300
Why is that? Why do we have a tendency to want to be disrespectful?

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.980
There's 2 things I learned in the presidential interview process about how to communicate with people

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.740
you might have a difference with.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.240
Number 1: If I'm typing to somebody or I'm chatting on the phone,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.360
I'm gonna pretend I'm sitting directly across from that person, looking them in the eye,

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.940
because I want to be respectful and gracious.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.800
And Number 2: If I can just listen, it's huge!

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.100
Think about it, if I listen, not just to formulate my next response so I sound smart to them,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.340
but if I truly listen to connect with them at the heart level,

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.320
my credibility and influence with that person goes through the roof!

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.060
Even if it's the most powerful person in the world, think about that.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.880
Be respectful, and listen.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.260
It's that simple.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.460
But it's really, really hard.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.660
Hey, thanks! This went from rockets in the backyard,

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.260
to interviewing the President... Which is kind of crazy!

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.660
Anyway, if this is your first episode of Smarter Every Day that you've ever watched

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.060
And somehow, you feel like this has earned your subscription, feel free to do that,

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.240
but only if it earns it!

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.720
Last thing, I want to thank the sponsor who has been with me from the low points

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.460
to now, which, I would say, is a high point, and that's Audible.com

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.460
Clearly that's how I prepared for this interview,

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.840
and I shot something while I was in the White House to tell you what I learned.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.400
Okay, I hope you enjoyed me in the White House, I know it was a blast!

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.600
