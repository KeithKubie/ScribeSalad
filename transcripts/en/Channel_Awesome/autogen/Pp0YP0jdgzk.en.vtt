the first I'm not gonna be able to

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:51.980
the first I'm not gonna be able to
 

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.710
the first I'm not gonna be able to
really judge this til probably years ago

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:53.720
really judge this til probably years ago
 

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.360
really judge this til probably years ago
and I feel like most people won't be

able to either like I'd say five years
 

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:58.900
able to either like I'd say five years
so now it's either gonna have the

00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:58.910
so now it's either gonna have the
 

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.130
so now it's either gonna have the
reputation it's like oh yeah so much

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:00.140
reputation it's like oh yeah so much
 

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.440
reputation it's like oh yeah so much
better than first or oh it's pretty good

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:02.450
better than first or oh it's pretty good
 

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:06.310
better than first or oh it's pretty good
like it was alright but cuz you just got

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320
like it was alright but cuz you just got
 

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.500
like it was alright but cuz you just got
to see more of them you got more of the

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:08.510
to see more of them you got more of the
 

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.480
to see more of them you got more of the
characters I mean that Bellis I think

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:10.490
characters I mean that Bellis I think
 

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:11.860
characters I mean that Bellis I think
the strongest part of the first film was

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:11.870
the strongest part of the first film was
 

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:13.240
the strongest part of the first film was
the characters and this one just gives

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:13.250
the characters and this one just gives
 

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:14.890
the characters and this one just gives
you so much more of them working off

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:14.900
you so much more of them working off
 

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.800
you so much more of them working off
each other and I did it good job yeah

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:32.860
driven that's set pretty much like
pretty much the first 10-15 minutes in

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:32.870
pretty much the first 10-15 minutes in
 

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.750
pretty much the first 10-15 minutes in
