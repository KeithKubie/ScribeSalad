1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.133
Yeah.

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.900
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
Is Bill Burn?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.</v>

3
00:00:04.901 --> 00:00:07.330
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:12.990
<v 2>Ah,</v>

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.890
<v 1>just checking in on you.
Yes,
I am.</v>

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.910
How are you?
What's going on?
How is your week going?

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.160
You realize it's July,
man.
The summer is just,
it's just with Gig away.

8
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.510
Do you know what fucking rained out here yesterday in July?

9
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.610
It's unbelievable.
It never rains out here.

10
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:38.610
It never rains in California.

11
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:41.250
But boy don't they warn you

12
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.750
it pours man.
It pulls.
It just,
it just was this thunder and,

13
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.480
and there was rain and it just poured down and I was like,
Gee,

14
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:53.970
willikers you know,

15
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.720
I had a couple of shirts dry and out on the fucking porch there because,
uh,

16
00:00:57.721 --> 00:00:58.021
you know,

17
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:02.430
you can do that out here because it never rains in February and that is it.

18
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:04.860
There's a little bit of June gloom and you're like,
Ooh,

19
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.900
is it no precipitation,
blue balls?
That's all it is.

20
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:13.910
And yesterday just was an absolute downpour.
And uh,

21
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.530
like 20 minutes later was over and everything was dried up and you would never

22
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:24.510
know what happened.
You know,
like a perfect robbery,
like a robbery gone.
Right.

23
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.940
Nobody gets hurt.
We get in,
we get up,
we get the jewels.
Okay.

24
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.780
Blonde.
Um,

25
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.300
<v 0>yeah.</v>

26
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.810
<v 1>Franco goes in with the others have been,
sorry,</v>

27
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.470
I just combined three different movies,
two different movies,

28
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.210
something like that.
I have no fucking idea.
All I know is a,

29
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.031
this is one of these days.

30
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:51.590
I forgot it was Thursday and I forgot I had to do a podcast and I have some
shit.

31
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.993
<v 0>Ted Do</v>

32
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.490
<v 1>some shit to do.
All right.
I am,
uh,</v>

33
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.760
going down to comic con today.
Can you believe that

34
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.490
Belper hater of all marvel and DC fucking movies?

35
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.800
I don't hate him.
I just stay.
I,
they do absolutely nothing for me.

36
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.843
<v 0>You know,</v>

37
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.860
<v 1>I like the hulk.
I'm an angry fuck.
Or I can relate to him,</v>

38
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.870
right?
I've inhaled a cigar.
I've turned green before.
You know,

39
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.650
I can't jump like that.
A kid.
I can't not crush cars the way he does,

40
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:37.100
but I get it.
I like the hulk.
I liked the way he talks to,

41
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.350
you know how fucking stupid,
he basically talks like Tarzan,

42
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.030
which really made no sense if he was raised by wolves or whatever the fuck was

43
00:02:47.031 --> 00:02:49.790
going on there.
How the fuck he learned how to speak English.

44
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.003
<v 0>You know what I mean?</v>

45
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.860
<v 1>I can't tell if he was unbelievably compromised in that relationship with Jane</v>

46
00:02:56.861 --> 00:02:58.960
or if it was a brilliant fucking thing cause he could just,

47
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.700
you didn't understand what she was saying.

48
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.283
<v 3>You know,</v>

49
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.160
<v 1>how long into that relationship do you think before he looked at that little</v>

50
00:03:08.161 --> 00:03:11.100
chimpanzee and just fucking rolled his eyes?
Like you fucking believe this shit.

51
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.000
Okay,
it's this,
this,

52
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.390
this woman would be dead out here without me at an edge and all she's doing is

53
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.880
bitch moaning and complaining.
All right,
well live at in nature.

54
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.870
We're perfectly safe.
Okay.
I'm providing,

55
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.760
we don't have to pay any taxes.

56
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.240
This is like not the way W we're in fucking in right now.
And they go,
Jay.
Yeah,

57
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.070
go,
go,
go take a bite on the apple.
You know,

58
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.370
that is one thing that I have learned.

59
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.140
<v 3>Okay.</v>

60
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.760
<v 1>As a 50 year old man.
I'll tell you right now guys,
if you're out with the ladies,</v>

61
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.250
okay.
Save Your fucking money.
Okay.

62
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.520
Do not spend money on women.

63
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.100
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.960
<v 1>Okay.
Do it cause you want to,</v>

65
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.830
but don't do it because you think it's going to make them happy.

66
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.810
It will in the moment.
But I swear to God I don't give a fuck.

67
00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:10.090
You could literally buy a woman the fucking space shuttle.
All right.

68
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.670
And put our initials on the side of it.
Okay.
And take her,
I,

69
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.730
I don't know where the fuck you do with the space shuttle.
All right.

70
00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:21.750
Whatever they take her to and from work.
I don't like sitting like this.

71
00:04:21.751 --> 00:04:24.330
My hair is like hanging down.

72
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.600
Well we can't take off Corazon holy honey,

73
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.270
whenever I just get me to work,
I swear to God you don't,

74
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.820
you'd literally be in the Doghouse within fucking 24 hours of doing that one

75
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.200
stupid comment.

76
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.713
<v 3>MMM.</v>

77
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.140
<v 1>I was actually joking with a buddy of mine the other day.
I was saying like,</v>

78
00:04:43.141 --> 00:04:46.380
you know,
sentiment,
if patching shit up with your wife was deductible,

79
00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:48.510
I wouldn't pay taxes for the past three years.

80
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.050
That's all I'm ever doing.
You know,

81
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.430
I feel like the boss's son who just keeps fucking up,

82
00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:01.710
but for some reason he doesn't get fired.
Do you know what I mean?

83
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.920
It's after like the 50th time you've done something wrong that we could just

84
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:08.000
like,
I,
I really don't understand how,
how did I,

85
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.300
how did I end up in this position?
Um,
but that's neither here nor there.

86
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.853
<v 3>Okay.</v>

87
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.160
<v 1>If you want to make up with your wife,
take her out for ice cream.
Okay.</v>

88
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.890
I'm telling you it's,
it's romantic.
It gives him a sugar rush.

89
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.151
All right.

90
00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:28.330
They feel like they're in some Tom Hanks movie and it really doesn't cost that

91
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:30.280
much money.
You know,

92
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.310
if you could just keep your cool while you fucking stand in line at the artisan

93
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.720
ice cream place that they want to go to before you go up there and you order a

94
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:43.180
mint chocolate chip and they tell you it's not in season.

95
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.690
Well if that happened to me in San Francisco and have that story,

96
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.553
it's not in season,

97
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.780
then I'm going to cross the street to the drug store and it came back with a

98
00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:54.030
pint of it.
You know,
I should've walked into their fucking ice cream place.
Hey,

99
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.520
hey,
hey,
hey.
I try.

100
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.270
Here's the deal.
If you,
if you want to get adventurous with ice cream,

101
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.060
follow people under 40.
All right.

102
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.490
Do you just want the old school simple shit?

103
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:14.840
You follow old people because eventually they'd go into the pharmacy,

104
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.460
right?
And that's where they have chocolate,
vanilla,
strawberry

105
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.410
patchwork,
chocolate chip.
How many flavors were there?

106
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.740
There was mint chocolate chip that was peppermint.
That was like,

107
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.560
that was fancy back then.
Not now.
It's like,

108
00:06:32.561 --> 00:06:36.460
I don't even know what the fuck it is.
They got candy bars in there.

109
00:06:36.461 --> 00:06:37.450
They got like a,

110
00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:42.451
they have sugar and salt with a shot of espresso and some sort of social justice

111
00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:47.830
warrior thing written in fucking a whip cream.
You know,

112
00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:52.360
I followed Joe Rogan is most of the free world does,
um,

113
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.060
on Instagram.
And I saw this whole thing about the okay sign.

114
00:06:57.061 --> 00:07:01.030
How funny is that?
According to Joe Rogan,
the okay sign

115
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.170
these people is a joke.
Tried to say that you can,

116
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.590
you can find white power in there like this,
which I don't know.

117
00:07:08.591 --> 00:07:12.670
I see three fingers in is in a zero.
I see zero to three.

118
00:07:12.671 --> 00:07:17.560
I see 30.
I see.
Uh,
uh,
I dunno,

119
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.730
it could make it shadow puppets may be a rooster.

120
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.240
I don't see where the white powers in there,
but they tried to say that.

121
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:24.320
You could see in there,

122
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.630
I guess the p would be your forearm up into the circle and then the,

123
00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:31.940
the three fingers will be the w,
Oh fuck,
I'm smart.

124
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.800
Or does that mean I'm racist,
racist,
racist.
So my names,

125
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.190
they started it as a joke and then dopes believed it.

126
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.640
And then actual,
even bigger dopes.

127
00:07:44.641 --> 00:07:49.641
White supremacists started using it and now it's actually going to get bad,

128
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.980
you know,
which is so fucking stupid.
Like why would you ban that?

129
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.820
You know what I mean?
That's like banning,
you know,

130
00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:04.180
let's say it was actually race.
Would you ban somebody?
Go and see Heil.

131
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.480
Why would you ban that?
Let people do it that then,

132
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:12.190
then you know who the Nazis are,
right?
If you don't let people do it,

133
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.480
then you're like,
all right,

134
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:18.700
is this guy a Nazi or does he know Jujitsu or was he just a fan of Telus?

135
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.260
Telly Savalas oh no,
wait a minute.
That's all freckles.

136
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.550
Hey showed up to tell some shit jokes,
right?
And then all of a sudden,

137
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:32.580
all the lines get blurred.
Okay,

138
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.650
you got to let Connie people have their signs.
You know,

139
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.970
how are you doing Seth?
I'm all carry.
You gotta let them do that.

140
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.700
And then you got to let morons,
you know,
fucking do this.
SIEG Heil and I,

141
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.410
Hitler's birthday on April 20th all right,

142
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.640
well the hippies of behind him smoking marijuana.
Hey Man,
like

143
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.410
Nazis,
the mellow man,
right?
You got to have all those people,

144
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.410
I think.
I mean,
you'd like to have not have others,
but I,

145
00:09:03.411 --> 00:09:07.200
I really don't think how like banning sides.
I've always thought that was,

146
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.070
that was like,
I guess wishful thinking

147
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.870
in my world.
If you ban racial gestures than people aren't racist anymore.

148
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.380
You don't need to fix what's between their ears.

149
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:27.270
You just need to fix just sticky.
Elations when we come back,

150
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.450
Dr Phil will cure a heroin addict within two commercial breaks.
Uh,

151
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.580
you ne to stop doing heroin and you need to put on some weight.

152
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:41.820
You're right,
Dr Phil,

153
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.290
let me shake your hand and subtly steal your wash so I can cop right behind your

154
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:51.240
fucking soundstage.
Did I say cop?
Yes,
I did.
That's how old I am.

155
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.880
Uh,
you know what's great about being a parent besides everything is all the fun

156
00:09:56.881 --> 00:09:59.280
fucking signs he gets stuck in your head.
You know,

157
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.500
as I'm talking to you guys about Neo Nazis in my head,
I'm singing pop,

158
00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:09.330
pop,
pop puppy dog pals,
poke poke,
poke.
But no,
no,

159
00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:13.440
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no bro,
Bro.
Bro,
bro,
bro,
Bro.

160
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.690
About pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
you know,

161
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.870
most awesome is my daughter sings along to it now.
She just goes pop,

162
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.720
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop.
And then anytime they,
they,

163
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.330
she just goes dog.

164
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.990
It's funny to parents.
Um,
yeah,
she's amazing.

165
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:39.050
Um,
I,
I get now why people have like eight kids.
I get it.

166
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.720
It's fucking amazing.
I mean,

167
00:10:41.721 --> 00:10:45.650
if he can just get past me and tired and then eventually hating you between the

168
00:10:45.651 --> 00:10:48.980
ages of about 11 and a,
I don't know,

169
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.130
depending on how much you actually did do wrong,

170
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.370
it might be the rest of your life,
but usually I think it lasts somewhere.

171
00:10:55.371 --> 00:10:58.070
A mid college

172
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.790
I would think.
I don't know.

173
00:11:01.791 --> 00:11:05.300
I've already thought about how I'm going to handle her teenage years.

174
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:11.960
I'm just going to listen.
I know,
I know.
I'm cramping your style,
man.

175
00:11:11.961 --> 00:11:16.430
But can you just go to lunch with your old man?
I swear to God.
Here's the deal.

176
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.810
I like,
I'll let you walk in first.
You know,

177
00:11:20.811 --> 00:11:23.180
just in case some of your friends are in there.
All right.

178
00:11:23.181 --> 00:11:24.890
And then if none of your friends are in there,

179
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.800
then I'll come in like the fucking elephant man.

180
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.670
And you all sit down and just have lunch with me.
And if any of friends show up,

181
00:11:31.671 --> 00:11:32.504
you know?

182
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.983
<v 4>Okay.</v>

183
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.770
<v 1>I don't know.
I mean,
I don't know what to do at that point.</v>

184
00:11:35.771 --> 00:11:39.910
I guess I would walk out,
you know,
how amazing is that?
Like a,

185
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:45.210
as this little perfect being that needs you on such a ridiculous level,

186
00:11:45.761 --> 00:11:49.540
it almost makes you cry within like 10 years.

187
00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.730
Like treats you like the fucking plague.
You know,

188
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.990
I'm kind of excited for it,

189
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.900
for the whole fucking journey because at the end of the day,
I am a loner,

190
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.120
so I think I'll be able to sub.
No,
I won't.

191
00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.160
What'd your own flesh and blood turns their back on you.
Um,
all right.

192
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:08.950
I think we need to do some advertising here.
Donut at some point.

193
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.700
None of them only 12 minutes in normally 12 minutes.
And you know what I did?

194
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:16.450
I tell you guys that I watched the a moto GP from Germany or seek,

195
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.220
um,
from Germany and I saw a

196
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:28.590
fucking Mark Marquez fucking rundown
Jorge Low Lorenzo.

197
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.760
Now I,
I just don't understand the whole fucking tire thing.

198
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.090
These fucking guys,
whenever they use the soft tire,

199
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.600
they're always leading in the beginning and then eventually the soft tires to

200
00:12:39.601 --> 00:12:43.350
fucking soft.
It starts to wear down and then they're fucked,

201
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.830
you know?
I mean,
at this point,

202
00:12:48.831 --> 00:12:51.830
the way mark mark has his winning.
Why don't you just go,
well,

203
00:12:51.831 --> 00:12:56.420
what is mark going to use today to give ourselves a fighting chance?

204
00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:00.800
Because as far as I know,
Jorge,
Lorenzo,
he fucking,
uh,

205
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:05.630
you won a championship three years ago.
Right?
Marquez is one for the last five.

206
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.830
Let me look this up.
Moto g p

207
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:16.520
Jambi almost.
Am I on the right Internet?
Okay,
here we go.

208
00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.480
Oh God.
They just let me know who.
Okay.
How about Valentino Rossi?
Huh?

209
00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.260
Always making the podium.
That's a weird thing in racing that I,

210
00:13:25.261 --> 00:13:29.780
I don't get how you get too old to do it.
I mean,

211
00:13:29.781 --> 00:13:33.170
as long as you're fucking,
especially race car drive,
as long as your foot works,

212
00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.380
can you press down on the gas?
I mean,

213
00:13:36.381 --> 00:13:39.530
the engine has to go 200 miles an hour.
You don't,
right.
I mean,

214
00:13:39.531 --> 00:13:43.790
you just kind of ride along.
All right.
But I guess your reflexes,

215
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.620
your reflex is get,
uh,
Oren is good.
And then,
um,

216
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:54.550
I dunno,
you just stopped winning.
It's crazy.
All right.
So basically,

217
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.511
first of all,

218
00:13:56.511 --> 00:14:01.511
shout out to Spain because since 2010 a Spaniard is one at every year except

219
00:14:02.691 --> 00:14:07.691
2011 when arguably the greatest motorcycle name of all time.

220
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:11.730
Casey stoner.
One more time.

221
00:14:11.731 --> 00:14:14.220
Casey stoner,
one in 2011.
All right,

222
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:19.700
Mark Marquez one it until 2017 2016 Jorge rental one in 2015 and then 2014 2013

223
00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:29.050
was mark.
Mark is Jorge.

224
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.030
You Lorenzo was 2012 Casey stoner,

225
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.770
please report to the principal's office.

226
00:14:34.771 --> 00:14:38.730
2011 and 2010 was Jorge Low Renzo.

227
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:43.790
And then the previous decade was the Valentino Rossi show where that genius won

228
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.610
it seven times in nine years.

229
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:54.390
Honorable Mention to Casey and 2007 and also the last American,

230
00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:00.710
the last Yank to win at 2006,
Nikki.
Hey,
and what's going on?

231
00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:05.440
Do you still ride the fucking motorcycles kit?
Dody was crazy.

232
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:10.250
He's doing fucking wheelies in the seventh grade and we also want in 2000 with

233
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:15.230
Kenny Roberts Jr
um,
Valentino Rossi won in 2001,

234
00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:18.830
2002,
2003 2004,
2005,

235
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.900
2008 and 2009 and he was riding Honda's in the beginning

236
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.280
2001,
two and three.
And then the unthinkable,

237
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.640
he switched to Yamaha and everybody thought it was an inferior product.

238
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.540
And not only did he fucking win with them,
he won four times with Yamaha.
Yamaha.

239
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.110
There you go.
There's some quick motorcycle history.
I don't know shit about it,

240
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:41.090
but somebody who watches a shit,

241
00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:45.410
please explain to me why you would ever run a race.
Right?

242
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:49.370
Or race on the fucking soft tire.
The super soft or whatever.

243
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.480
They always seem to blister or just they,
they shit the bed,

244
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:58.280
right when it counts.
It's like you lead the whole fucking race,
you know,

245
00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.310
and then all of a sudden with like 15 to 12 laps left,

246
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.560
all of a sudden somebody with a medium tires,

247
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.110
something like that just runs you down.

248
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:07.183
<v 0>You know,</v>

249
00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:15.400
<v 1>like the soft tire is sort of the,
uh,
the heartthrob of the tire industry.</v>

250
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
You know what I mean?
Well,
if you're basing your whole life on your looks,

251
00:16:19.001 --> 00:16:20.860
I mean you're,
you,
you know,
you're going to have,

252
00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:25.690
your career's going to be prompt probably shorter than a professional athletes

253
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.840
cause you're going to get old and somebody else younger is going to come along.

254
00:16:29.841 --> 00:16:34.170
But the medium,
I think the medium tires,
the way to go,

255
00:16:34.171 --> 00:16:37.350
it seems to be the way it go.
Way to go.
I have no fucking idea,

256
00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.180
but all I know is a,

257
00:16:39.181 --> 00:16:44.181
I have to figure out a way next year in April to get to that Goddamn Moto GP

258
00:16:44.311 --> 00:16:47.760
race.
But anyways,
I didn't mention a,
why are you going to comic con bill,

259
00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.510
why are you going to any apolis bill?
I'm going down the first one.

260
00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:55.230
I'm flying a helicopter down.
Uh,
it's the first time I've flown since May top,

261
00:16:55.231 --> 00:16:58.110
I remember how to do this shit.
Now I'm flying with an instructor.

262
00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.520
Everybody relax.

263
00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:05.100
So I'm flying down there and I am,
uh,
is moderating,

264
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.090
hosting.
Um,

265
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.120
I'm sitting down for an hour in front of a crowd of 6,000 people

266
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.750
and I am hosting,
uh,
what do you call it?

267
00:17:18.751 --> 00:17:19.650
The uh,

268
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:21.580
<v 0>okay.</v>

269
00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.290
<v 1>The cast of better call Saul.</v>

270
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.450
I'm getting to interview all of those people and I'm going to see Vince Gilligan

271
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:31.280
for the first time in a long time,
which is going to be great.

272
00:17:31.281 --> 00:17:35.270
I'm going to thank him for giving me an acting career.
And,
uh,

273
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.670
and then afterwards,
uh,

274
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.640
some of the casts of breaking bad's going to come out and then we're going to do

275
00:17:40.641 --> 00:17:44.570
an hour with them.
And um,
yeah,
I dunno.

276
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.830
I don't know why I,
this is one of these gigs where I was like,
yeah,

277
00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.860
I'd love to do that.
And then the second I,
you know,
the day comes and I'm like,

278
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.890
wait,
what am I out of my fucking,
what the fuck am I going to say?
But I,

279
00:17:57.891 --> 00:18:00.690
I know that everybody's got great stories,
so all I gotta do is just,

280
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.070
I just got to set people up.
I did this recently on another show

281
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:12.200
that escapes me.
I have no fucking idea what I am.
I short term memories for Shit.

282
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:17.090
I have no idea.
But anyways,
it's going to fly down to San Diego.

283
00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.060
I'm going to a host both of those things.

284
00:18:20.061 --> 00:18:22.460
Then I get to watch the premiere of better call Saul.

285
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.050
You know what's better than that?
Then I come back,
you know,

286
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.380
better call Saul was one of my favorite actors on television right now.
Joe To

287
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:37.070
Rosa Smoking,
Joe de Rosa.
Oh,
by the way,
by the way,
you know,

288
00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.750
very strong rumors,

289
00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:46.950
very strong rumors that Belper and showed Rosa are back together in talks about

290
00:18:49.091 --> 00:18:53.380
getting uninformed going again,
very strong rumors.

291
00:18:53.381 --> 00:18:56.270
Remember when guns and roses was getting back together and everybody is going to

292
00:18:56.271 --> 00:19:00.100
happen.
Is it going to happen?
You know,

293
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.140
but guess what?

294
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.920
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

295
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.640
<v 1>I'm sitting down with all fucking Joe to Rosa next week</v>

296
00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.990
to see if I can figure out a way to get to,

297
00:19:11.991 --> 00:19:16.991
to fit myself into his incredible busy schedule as an actor,

298
00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.960
yet to be nominated for an Emmy.
But we all know it's inevitable.

299
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.010
I sound like a breaking his balls,
but I think he's fucking great on that show.

300
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.550
And,
uh,
I can't wait for this season and,
um,

301
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.550
it is a beyond and honor that Vince asked me to do this.

302
00:19:34.551 --> 00:19:38.870
So I just hope I don't fuck it up to be honest with you.

303
00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.610
You know?
Um,

304
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:45.210
<v 7>and I also don't know how,
how do I get into this?
I mean,
can I,</v>

305
00:19:45.211 --> 00:19:50.211
can I talk about like how last season ended without getting stampeded by 6,000

306
00:19:51.331 --> 00:19:56.190
nerds going see spoiler in lyric Meehan.
All right,

307
00:19:56.191 --> 00:20:00.060
everybody.
Okay,

I got a little bit of a,

308
00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:06.890
<v 1>some advertising re here.
Um,
hey nia,

309
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.860
Ah,
Shit.
All right,
I gotta get in there.
Alright.
Butcher box,

310
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.570

311
00:20:19.571 --> 00:20:21.820
organic chicken and heritage bread,
pork.

312
00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:26.590
The incredible quality of butcher box means start with the commitment to raising

313
00:20:26.591 --> 00:20:30.700
animals humanely and free of antibiotics and hormones before you kill them.

314
00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.240
Each box comes with at least nine to 11 pounds of meat,

315
00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:39.040
which is enough for 24 individual size meals.
Unless you're a fat fuck,

316
00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.710
which probably you'll go through that in three days.

321
00:20:54.291 --> 00:20:55.790
That's when you're throwing down at the grill.

322
00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.630
That's when your eyes light up like a kid in the candy store.

I get to pick my own guts.
Antibiotic slash hormone free.

324
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:09.440
No,

325
00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:15.770
but your box believes in a healthier food system where everyone has access to

326
00:21:15.771 --> 00:21:19.280
meets the way nature intended,
the way you used to be able to do it.

327
00:21:19.281 --> 00:21:20.870
When you went hunting with the musket,

328
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.520
the only foreign object in that thing was the little pellet that you shut into

329
00:21:25.521 --> 00:21:26.354
its brain.

330
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.440
Nature intended free of antibiotics and hormones that you mainly raised on an

331
00:21:32.631 --> 00:21:37.490
open pasture before they kill them.

To think that while I was just on the Jim Jeffrey show and he had the nerve to

347
00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:34.900
say that America is not number one

348
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:38.680

Um,

355
00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:11.110
I did a show on a Tuesday and I have such a great time with him.
It's like a,

356
00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.280
you know,
he said this thing about me said,
he goes,
some people,

357
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.880
people ask me about bill burr.
I say he's going to make a great 80 year old.

358
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:25.840
But the great thing about Jim is he's a bit of a curmudgeon too,
you know,

359
00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:30.850
so we have to fucking curmudgeons from different hemispheres,

360
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:35.880
the northern and southern hemisphere and together we form a global force of

361
00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:41.590
grumpiness.
Um,
I should actually post the link to,

362
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:44.410
uh,
to that interview.
I had a great time on the show and,
and uh,

363
00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.100
I would like to do it more often.
They are,

364
00:23:46.101 --> 00:23:49.490
I set it Postmates as usual,

You need to eat,

366
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:55.820
but you can't stop what you're doing to deal with it.

367
00:23:55.821 --> 00:23:59.570
And the only fast things that deliver are not what you want.

Well,

394
00:25:38.361 --> 00:25:42.920

effort to everything that I do.

Huddle.

Do not the do they not work as well as they should?
Yeah.

You should see the size of the font that I'm reading here.

399
00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:02.540
Do you like spending less money on things than more money on things?

400
00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:05.330
Yes.
I love how easy these questions are.

401
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.820
The school is this easy?
I would have gone to Harvard.
Uh,

402
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:15.050
do you know what the Internet is?
Yes.
If yes,

403

Hubb Ellie humble

404
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:25.460

That sounds like a nickname of wife would give to her fat husband.

405
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.550
Oh,
it's my humble.
Uh,

406
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.490
talk about how when you started out in comedy,

407
00:26:31.491 --> 00:26:34.760
all the other comics teased you for your coke bottle.
Glasses.

408
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:40.130
Blind Billy.
Bad eyes they call you at not at your heart,
toward your soul.

409
00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:42.980
You seed with rage.
But deep down you knew they were right.

410
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:48.680
<v 7>What is this copy here?
I never had.
I've never had glasses.
Must say brutal.</v>

411
00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.850

412
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.320
Must not get mad at Hubble for trying to be cute.

416
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.480
Do the math.
That's barely a dollar a day.

417
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.670
How often do you throw out contact lenses?

418
00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.290
<v 1>I've never been in this world.</v>

419
00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:20.480
<v 7>Uh,

424
00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.210

I've never done this.

Uh,

Underscore Bill Burr,

That's humble Hubb,

430
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.540
Ellie,
context.com.
All right,
so I guess they have cheese

431
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:11.130
<v 1>contexts.
All right.
Yet you can put in your eyes.</v>

432
00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.050
Um,
I actually,
I need glasses,
man.
I do.
And uh,

433
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.350
I'm just afraid that if I wear glasses,
it's gonna make my eyes weaker.

434
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:23.700
It's kind of like,
you know,
given into using a cane,
except it's for your eyes.

435
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:27.180
I'm trying to tough it out.
I'm 50 years old and I still don't have glasses.

436
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.370
You know,
I'll tell you I can't

437
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:33.930
<v 7>see shit,
but I'm a good listener,
um,
of all,
man.
I'm a really good listener.</v>

438
00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.030
All right.
I gotta get in there and I got to go eat lunch.

439
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:41.310
<v 1>Oh,
sorry.
Breakfast with the,
with the family.
Um,</v>

440
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:46.110
I almost just said I love you guys.
I don't even know why.
Why would I say that?

441
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.470
This being a dad thing is really making me soft.
It's really,

442
00:28:49.471 --> 00:28:52.410
it's kind of scaring me here.
All right,
let's get back on track.

443
00:28:52.411 --> 00:28:57.120
Have a great weekend.
You [inaudible] and uh,
I'll check in on you on,
uh,

444
00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.690
on Monday.
I think.
Is there an f one race this weekend?

445
00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:05.610
There wasn't one this past weekend.
I think that coming back.
Oh,
I can't wait.

446
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.310
That last race was my favorite fucking race.

447
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.610
That I'd last two have been my favorite race.
And,
um,

448
00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:16.680
I'm going to go out on a limb and I'm going to say a ridiculously focused,

449
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.400
slightly angry
Lewis Hamilton.

450
00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:25.010
He's going to put on a fucking display.
That's what I'm,
that's,
that's my guess.

451
00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.800
All right.
You want to see something cool?
Checkout Lewis Hamilton's private jet.

452
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:30.700
<v 7>Oh,
ah,</v>

453
00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.820
<v 1>I can't imagine that.
You know what I mean?</v>

454
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:41.170
Just flying to every gig in that fucking thing.
Do you now?
Not Funny.

455
00:29:41.171 --> 00:29:45.930
I would be.
How would you show up with that grin on your face that you know,

456
00:29:45.931 --> 00:29:47.550
like when those,
when when the,

457
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:51.720
the dive and rescue teams find the fucking guy who drowned in the,

458
00:29:51.721 --> 00:29:54.860
in the fucking those cave divers,
they was,

459
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.870
had that goofy smile on their face because the last thing that happens is your

460
00:29:57.871 --> 00:29:59.430
body releases all that dopamine.

461
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.540
That's the look I would have on my face if I had a private jet.
You know,

462
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.330
by the way,
there is no way to fly private and make money.

463
00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:10.380
There's just no way to fucking do it unless you flew there and then did it

464
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:13.410
10,000 gigs in a row before you flew back.

465
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.270
I don't get how people fucking do it and people go,
Oh,

466
00:30:16.271 --> 00:30:18.420
you build it into the contract.
It's like fuck it.

467
00:30:18.421 --> 00:30:22.860
It's going to come out of your end.
It's going to come out of your rent.
I mean,

468
00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:26.160
I think if I was to fly from here to Utah,
costs like 50 grand.

469
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:30.660
It's fucking ridiculous.
That 50 it's fucking nuts.
All right.

470
00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:32.010
That's the podcast.

471
00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:36.450
Enjoy the music and listen to and enjoy another half hour of a Thursday

472
00:30:36.451 --> 00:30:39.900
afternoon podcasts from a Thursday afternoon.
Gone by.
All look good.

473
00:30:39.901 --> 00:30:44.040
Just came walking in all shirtless with their beer belly.

474
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.230
How you doing buddy?

475
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:52.470
Is it me or does she just keep getting better looking guys get better looking.

476
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:57.060
Can you say hi?
Can you say Mama,

477
00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:02.100

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.960
Can you say dog?
You say Kat.

479
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:10.660
Can you say car?

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.750

<v 1>You say,
whoa.
Whoa.</v>

482
00:31:15.851 --> 00:31:20.140
She flipped in both around the keys.
Key shoes.

483
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:24.160
Now she can almost say to civil war.
Can you say wallet

484
00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:32.020
is a water?
The water
that's like the same thing.

485
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.250
Yeah.
You got to pick like words that begin with the letter that she knows.

486
00:31:36.251 --> 00:31:38.350
I'm not trying to turn him into a gold digger baby.

487
00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.780
Say Baby.
Yeah.

488
00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.620
<v 9>Oh,
whoa.</v>

489
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:48.920
<v 1>Baby.
Laughing.</v>

490
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:55.460
<v 2>Crying.
Say crying.</v>

491
00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:00.890
<v 1>How are you doing that?
Uh,
angry.
Sleeping.</v>

492
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:08.270
All right,
that's the podcast.
God bless you.
I'll talk to you on my,
yeah,

493
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:12.410
that's right.
Check it on.
Yeah,
I'll see you on Monday.

494
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.903
<v 10>Oh,
just</v>

495
00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:23.910
[inaudible] the book.
We get passionate the whole and not the half of the book.

496
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:28.730
Cats in the aftermath of the
been

497
00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:44.490
[inaudible]
budget split.
See that?

498
00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:47.770
Buy The ticket or Kipp believe that through my day through gastric

499
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:52.311
[inaudible],
Brooklyn,

500
00:32:52.311 --> 00:32:55.160
New York City when they paint murals and Vicki and Kathy truck,

501
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.530
cause he's getting fabulous life looked pretty fucked up kid.

502
00:32:57.531 --> 00:32:58.790
He wants to still 50 cents.

503
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.290
3 cents is Dominic can't be covered within says my presence felt my name is

504
00:33:03.291 --> 00:33:04.950
quality from the eternal refreshing.

505
00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:08.480
They get absolutely as shown here from misconception.
Let me meditate.

506
00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.830
Sadie straight came to the conclusion that most of the chapters,
but wait,

507
00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.540
let me demonstrate.
Walk in the streets.
Just like battling.

508
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:16.700
Be careful with your body.
You must know karate.

509
00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:19.540
You think that goes back to him like a fit.

510
00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:21.050
You're ready to be efficient every year.

511
00:33:21.051 --> 00:33:23.870
Maybe you can see your name in the column.
I'll go fishing where we serve.

512
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.690
Plenty to read and they're talking about,
I knew either mountain and neighbors.

513
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.320
Mikey with the quiet was quiet.
It's like,
Hey,
what's going on?

514
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.760
It's still burns to Monday morning

515
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.910
<v 7>podcast,</v>

516
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:37.910
the July fucking 19th 2000 fucking 10 all right,

517
00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:41.820
I'm going to pissed off fucking mood because I'm not funny this week.

518
00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:45.430
This is the third fucking time I've started this Goddamn podcasts.

519
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:49.770
They had a race.
Two of them got 12 minutes into the first one and I just said,

520
00:33:49.771 --> 00:33:54.620
fuck it,
and I erased it and this one,
I got 24 fucking minutes in and I,

521
00:33:54.621 --> 00:33:55.451
I just,
I,

522
00:33:55.451 --> 00:34:00.150
I just erased it and rather than walking away and walking down the Goddamn

523
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.570
street and clear my fucking head,
I,
I,

524
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:07.560
I just hit stop and I hit a race and then I just start the fucking thing again

525
00:34:07.561 --> 00:34:11.880
thinking like,
oh,
maybe,
maybe this will work.
Let me do a do over.

526
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:17.740
You know,
I,
do you know what it is?
I'm on the fucking road.

527
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:21.370
I went to Montreal and now I'm in New York and I just,
I want to go home.

528
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:24.820
I've had it.
I don't want to sleep in any more of these fucking hotel rooms.

529
00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:28.330
I don't want to order any more fucking room service.
I'm in New York.

530
00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:33.620
Are you ordered a Goddamn fucking protein salad with a fucking [inaudible]

531
00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:38.170
salad?
Cause I thought they were Mozzarella,
Mozzarella sticks.

532
00:34:38.171 --> 00:34:42.310
However the fuck you goddamn sons of bitches from Italy say it

533
00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:47.710
fucking shows up.
So I ordered a salad and a fucking sal.

534
00:34:47.711 --> 00:34:51.120
Do you know what it cost me?
It cost me fucking almost 50 bucks with the tip

535
00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:57.000
because I'm staying in midtown midtown.
Therefore we can.

536
00:34:57.001 --> 00:35:00.690
We can rape you.
You want some fucking advice.
If you ever come to New York,

537
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:05.820
do not stay mid tab too.
God Damn fucking,
they deliver the fucking food.

538
00:35:05.821 --> 00:35:10.320
The guys weren't a Goddamn ski mask.
Fucking pantyhose over his fucking face.

539
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:15.130
It's unbelievable.
We send up there,
they always set up some fucking,

540
00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:19.000
you know guy who can't even speak fucking English,
right?
So you know,

541
00:35:19.001 --> 00:35:22.600
it's not his fault.
You know,
he didn't come up with the Goddamn menu.

542
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:24.530
Poor bastard.

543
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:29.210
He still has scurvy from floating over on his goddamn luggage coming up here.

544
00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:33.640
Fucking dazed given me the Goddamn,
I can't fucking believe it.

545
00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.640
You know?
And if you've never stayed in a fucking New York hotel room either,

546
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:42.390
this is how it works.
It costs $400 for the night and you're like,
wow,

547
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.220
this is going to be amazing though,
right?

548
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.400
And you open the fucking door and what happens?
You take a step and a half,

549
00:35:47.401 --> 00:35:50.810
you trip over the fucking bed,
you roll over the bed like that.

550
00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:55.770
Do Sean Starsky and Hutch Hutch go on right over the hood of his fucking Grand

551
00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:59.970
Torino.
And rather than coming up in a cool way with your Adidas dragons on,

552
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:02.490
you do a face plant right into the fucking wall.

553
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.630
And if half the second you're like,
oh,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

554
00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:09.630
There's a ray of light.
I actually have two side by side windows.

555
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.040
Let's check out the view.

556
00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.760
And all you see is a fucking the brick building next to you.

557
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:19.140
Do you know I can't even commit suicide out of this fucking window.

558
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:23.340
That's how close the building is next to me.
Hang on a second.
Yes,

559
00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:28.830
it's okay.
I'll come back later.
I'm doing the podcast.

560
00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.710
All right,
thank you.

561
00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:37.890
And like how I assume that she's a fan actually got a laugh out of her.
Um,

562
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:41.490
but she had an accent.
I just said I'm doing the podcast.

563
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.760
She probably thinks that some sort of new dance or that I'm fucking my wife and

564
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:49.290
it's some sort of new weird position.
I'd love to open the door,

565
00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:53.340
but we're doing the podcast.
Um,
anyways,

566
00:36:53.341 --> 00:36:55.460
let's get back to killing myself.
Um,

567
00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.190
if I were to jump out this building and trying to kill him,

568
00:36:59.191 --> 00:37:00.300
I wouldn't kill myself.

569
00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:03.990
What would actually happen was I would slide down between both buildings

570
00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:09.810
excruciatingly slow,
scraping them the fucking skin off of both as cheeks,

571
00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:11.430
the back of my head,
my nose,

572
00:37:11.431 --> 00:37:15.120
and the helmet of my Dick and the top of my feet.

573
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.570
I would have my feet pointed down like Greg Louganis,
you know,

574
00:37:18.571 --> 00:37:22.530
coming out of a fucking triple Lindy going right into the Olympic pool.

575
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:24.150
How does he do it?

576
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:30.000
How does he not fucking create a Goddamn splash?
You're,

577
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:34.290
that guy doesn't get enough credit that fucking Greg Louganis,
you know,

578
00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:38.520
all they talk about is how he whacked his head.
And he had his fucking,
you know,

579
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:43.640
he was HIV positive and it got on the diving board for the next Ukrainian dude

580
00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:44.700
who came up there.

581
00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.110
You know what about the fact that he could basically jump off the Eiffel Tower

582
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:54.060
and somehow against the laws of physics,
not have not have a splash.

583
00:37:54.061 --> 00:37:57.000
I would put that guy up there with the fucking Wayne Gretzky's,

584
00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:02.670
the Michael Jordans.
You know what?
I don't know enough about diving,

585
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:04.560
so I got to strike that.
But I,

586
00:38:04.561 --> 00:38:08.370
I did see some shit this weeks with someone was saying Koby Bryant had five

587
00:38:08.371 --> 00:38:12.930
fucking rings.
So if he gets one next year,
he gets number six,

588
00:38:12.931 --> 00:38:17.790
then you have to say that he's on par with Jordan as far as championships.
Yes,

589
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.050
we can all do math.

590
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.720
But as far as him ever eclipsing Michael Jordan,
he never will.

591
00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.000
And I'm gonna,
I'm gonna tell you this right now.

592
00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:31.320
Not only will he never eclipse Michael Jordan,

593
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:36.350
he's not even fucking close and know what all you Laker fans that thinking,

594
00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:41.350
but wait a minute,
fucker.
He's doing the same fucking moves.

595
00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:46.510
Yes he is.
Yes,
he is.
Physically,

596
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:51.220
he can do what Michael Jordan can do.
Yes,
he cared.

597
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:56.890
All right,
but this is the difference.
Michael Jordan created those fucking moves.

598
00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.370
All right?

599
00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:02.320
You can find a guitarist in your fucking neighborhood who can play Voodoo child.

600
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:06.670
Does that mean they're as good as Jimi Hendrix who wrote the fucking Song,

601
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:12.100
who is 20 years ahead of his fucking any other guitarist on the planet?

602
00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:18.070
Look,
as great as Stevie Ray Vaughan is,
I love that guy to death.
He can't touch.

603
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.340
He can't fucking touch Jimi Hendrix.
He can't.

604
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.470
Hendrix came up with that Shit and then fucking Stevie ray modernized it,

605
00:39:26.471 --> 00:39:29.260
but it was Jimmy Shit.
You know what I mean?

606
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:33.800
It's like a pilot take.

607
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:38.620
You learns how to fly and then tries to compare himself to Orville and Wilbur

608
00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.040
Wright.
Oh,

609
00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:44.170
though they fucking flew only across the field of flying across the whole

610
00:39:44.171 --> 00:39:45.004
country.

611
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:49.570
I'm 3000 miles better than the people who invented flying.

612
00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.400
All right now Coby Bryan has the,

613
00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:59.420
the I think has the athletic gifts of Michael Jordan and if you had the two of

614
00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:03.340
them play each other one on one at the height of their powers,

615
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.360
it would be the greatest one on one game ever.
All right.

616
00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:13.620
But as far as the forward thinking that the athletic genius,

617
00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.600
Colby Bryan is not an inventor,
he isn't,
he does have the drive,

618
00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:24.690
he's got all that other shit but he doesn't have the ability to take the game 20

619
00:40:24.791 --> 00:40:28.660
years into the future where he has no fucking pier.

620
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.290
There was no arguments when Jordan played,

621
00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:36.430
there was no arguments about who the best guy in the league was for the last 10

622
00:40:36.431 --> 00:40:38.440
years of his career.
There was a,
you know,

623
00:40:38.441 --> 00:40:42.280
early on before he established himself,
you know,
people,

624
00:40:42.281 --> 00:40:45.970
you know with throwing other names in there.
But after you know,

625
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.590
fucking 89 there was no question who the best player was.

626
00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:55.740
And by fucking 92 93 he was without a doubt the greatest basketball player of

627
00:40:56.801 --> 00:41:01.630
all time.
And he still is
Colby Bryant on the other hand,

628
00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:04.810
his entire career.
There's always been,
well,
what about this guy?

629
00:41:04.811 --> 00:41:09.240
What about that guy you know right now is he Kobe,

630
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:13.660
Lebron James?
You know,
I still give it to Colby.

631
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:18.040
Colby is still uh,
beyond Lebron James,

632
00:41:18.041 --> 00:41:21.580
but Lebron James is very close.
There was no one near Jordan.

633
00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:23.410
I can't even explain it to you.

634
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.860
It's like when you talk to those fucking Douche bags from the baby boom

635
00:41:26.861 --> 00:41:30.940
generation,
those selfish Kuntz who hang their hat on,

636
00:41:30.941 --> 00:41:34.590
they stopped the Vietnam War and then became corporate douche bags.

637
00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:39.680
Um,
that's a big generalization for you.
Like they always say like,

638
00:41:39.681 --> 00:41:41.330
no matter how much you get into the Beatles,

639
00:41:41.331 --> 00:41:46.100
you just can't wrap your head around what it was like when they put out an

640
00:41:46.101 --> 00:41:50.120
album,
how far ahead they were from everybody else.

641
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:54.140
It's the same thing with Richard Pryor because what happens is as the years go

642
00:41:54.141 --> 00:41:56.600
by,
everybody rips those,

643
00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:01.690
those geniuses off and everybody gets caught up to where the fuck they were.

644
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.190
And what usually happens is if you're young,

645
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:09.020
you're watching the contemporary people and then as you go back in time you go

646
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:13.250
back 30 years,
you go all the way back to prior and you see him do the black guy,

647
00:42:13.251 --> 00:42:17.990
white guy thing and so many people have ripped him off that that the genius of

648
00:42:17.991 --> 00:42:22.430
what he does is,
is a little tainted.
You know what I mean?

649
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.820
So that's like when people look at Colby and that and they go back and they look

650
00:42:25.821 --> 00:42:28.370
at Jordan,
they take for granted

651
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:34.990
what Kobe's doing now because it just seems it just like that's what basketball

652
00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:38.570
is now because Jordan showed,

653
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:44.600
showed them what was possible.
You understand what the fuck I'm saying here.

654
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:48.410
I'm sure Laker fans won't fucking,
they,
they'll,

655
00:42:48.411 --> 00:42:51.260
they'll argue it but they're fucking morons anyways.

656
00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.770
They're going to be like Jordan is just as good as Jordan.

657
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:57.140
You know the same way.

658
00:42:57.141 --> 00:43:02.141
They try to claim that they have fucking 16 championships or this other do.

659
00:43:02.711 --> 00:43:06.360
She wrote me this week who tried to say they have 18 this such,

660
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:10.310
there's just no way to respect a Laker fan.

661
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.930
I just cause some,
they just transplanted fucking dis.

662
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.330
There's so few people from Los Angeles.

663
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:20.630
And what happens is people move out there,
you know,

664
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:24.230
Hollywood fucking phoneys and then the Lakers,
you know,

665
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.180
they always have some fucking amazing team there are hell of,

666
00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:29.080
they're an awesome franchise.
I think they uh,

667
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:34.640
wait how many championships they got since 1980.
He won five.

668
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:36.620
Eight.
They nine.

669
00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:41.630
They are better than the Yankees since 1980 better than the Canadians.

670
00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.820
They are the franchise.
All right.

671
00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:49.850
This is all these fucking assholes go out there and they see Jack Nicholas at a

672
00:43:49.851 --> 00:43:51.950
fucking true fan.
Jack Nicholson.

673
00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.250
What the fuck is wrong with me every time I want to say Jack Nicholas,

674
00:43:55.251 --> 00:43:58.020
I say Nicholson and vice,
he Versie there.

675
00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.330
God help me if they're ever in the same fucking room,

676
00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:06.290
really built when the fuck would that happen.
Huh?

677
00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.950
When you do some corporate gig for some people who actually did something with

678
00:44:09.951 --> 00:44:13.820
their life and you go in there like a dancing monkey and then afterwards try to

679
00:44:13.821 --> 00:44:17.210
talk to them in the green room,
is there clearly blowing you off?

680
00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:23.270
Um,
um,
anyways,
the fuck am I talking about here?
Yeah.

681
00:44:23.271 --> 00:44:26.570
All those Douche bag Laker fans.
You know,
I talked to one the other day like,

682
00:44:26.571 --> 00:44:30.320
Oh dude,
I'm die hard.
I'm die hard.
And I found out he was from New York.

683
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:35.640
How the fuck do you go from being a Knicks fan to being a Lakers fan?

684
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:38.010
I'll tell you why.
You become a fucking phony.

685
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:42.120
How do you leave New York and moved to la?
How do he do that?
You know,

686
00:44:42.121 --> 00:44:46.080
unless you're in show business,
which was he?
I think he was,
I can't remember.

687
00:44:46.081 --> 00:44:49.140
I drank so much this fucking week.
All of everybody's just amalgam.

688
00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:52.770
Everybody's just a big,
I'm just amalgamating,
if that's even a word,

689
00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.330
into just one big face,

690
00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.290
just running their goddamn miles.

691
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:04.470
My own fucking lawyer is a Laker Fan.
Okay.

692
00:45:04.471 --> 00:45:09.240
And we had that argument about the 16 championships and he just would not answer

693
00:45:09.241 --> 00:45:09.920
my questions.

694
00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.430
I've got a real thrill out of it of being a lawyer in a fucking argument because

695
00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:17.850
I just kept hitting him with that argument.
You know,
I go,

696
00:45:17.851 --> 00:45:21.270
you go to the staples center,
all right.
Now,
you know,
first of all,

697
00:45:21.271 --> 00:45:26.030
if you're going to make a 16 championship tee shirt,
because the law,

698
00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:27.003
the the Laker,

699
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:31.920
the Laker franchise has 16 championships.

700
00:45:31.921 --> 00:45:34.730
That is undebatable.
Okay.

701
00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:39.740
But the Los Angeles Lakers have 11 the Minneapolis Lakers have five.

702
00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:44.970
So when you make those 16 championship fucking tee shirts,

703
00:45:44.971 --> 00:45:49.950
you gotta say Minneapolis Slash Los Angeles.
Okay.

704
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.440
Take the hint from the Laker franchise.

705
00:45:52.441 --> 00:45:56.010
When you go to the staples center and they don't have the Minneapolis banners up

706
00:45:56.011 --> 00:46:01.011
there because those banners belong to the franchise slash the fans of fucking

707
00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:06.720
Minnesota in Minneapolis the same way.

708
00:46:06.721 --> 00:46:11.550
And I've made this fucking goddamn example a zillion times and I'm going to keep

709
00:46:11.551 --> 00:46:14.730
making it because every fucking week,
some Goddamn Laker Fan,

710
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:17.670
this is the last week I'm going to do it because now people would send me those

711
00:46:17.671 --> 00:46:22.230
emails on purpose.
But like if the Lakers now move from Los Angeles to Las Vegas,

712
00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:27.350
they win it next year for the franchise is 17th Championship people in Los

713
00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.140
Angeles.
What would you do with somebody from Vegas came walking up to you?

714
00:46:31.141 --> 00:46:35.970
When went that 17 bitch.
We have 17 fucking NBA championships.

715
00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:40.710
We are the New York Yankees of fucking basketball.
Would that,

716
00:46:40.711 --> 00:46:45.120
would that make sense to you if you
saw Las Vegas Lakers?

717
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:49.740
17 championships and they will walk around,
thrust in their chests out

718
00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:56.880
the Boston Celtics have won 17 championships all in Boston.
Okay,

719
00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:02.070
that's it.
And a few people in La,
you're still confused.
Like I've said before,

720
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:03.840
just think how am count,

721
00:47:03.841 --> 00:47:08.280
how many times you've thrown a rock through the wind storefront window of an

722
00:47:08.281 --> 00:47:11.370
athlete's foot foot.
I can't even fucking talk this week.

723
00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:14.460
How many times do you burned down your city?

724
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:17.220
How many times you've burned down the La area?

725
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:20.280
That's how many championships you have.
All right?

726
00:47:20.281 --> 00:47:24.300
So stop padding your fucking resume.
Like all you cons do out there,

727
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:27.600
your Goddamn Pa,
and by the time you type up your resume,

728
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:31.850
you fucking directed the movie fucking phony.

729
00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:36.040
Who can't even show up to the game on time.
Um,
all right,

730
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.970
where are we going?
Hey,
where the fuck do we go from here?
All right,

731
00:47:39.971 --> 00:47:43.660
so how much time did that take up?
How much momentum?
All right.

732
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:45.400
That was a good 14 fucking minutes.

733
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:50.860
Let me shut off this overhead light may not have fucking piece of shit.

734
00:47:50.861 --> 00:47:55.540
Plastic foreign hundred bucks a night,
fucking pricks.
Um,

735
00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:59.740
anyways,
I am here in New York and,
uh,

736
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:04.780
I did the Montreal comedy festival this week.
Uh,
that was a big thrill,

737
00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:08.380
you know,
that's why I drank so fucking much this weekend.

738
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:13.090
I just ran into a bunch of comedians I haven't seen in a long,
long fucking time.

739
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:15.460
Um,
you know,

740
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:19.420
cause everybody I know fucking headlines now so we never get to work together

741
00:48:19.421 --> 00:48:19.930
anymore.

742
00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:24.930
So just we're drinking and telling stories and just laughing our fucking asses

743
00:48:26.471 --> 00:48:27.221
off and I'll tell you,

744
00:48:27.221 --> 00:48:32.221
it's a goddamn shame nobody filmed it because there's like nine zillion

745
00:48:32.441 --> 00:48:37.441
documentaries out there trying to capture the backstage stand up fucking thing.

746
00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:42.670
And uh,
I don't think they've ever done it.

747
00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.610
And the only way you could ever do it is if you'd have to do it like a reality

748
00:48:45.611 --> 00:48:48.070
show where you keep the cameras rolling

749
00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:51.700
24,
seven in that way,

750
00:48:51.701 --> 00:48:54.340
people gradually forget about them because that's what they have to do.

751
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.200
They have to forget that they're on camera.

752
00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:01.560
So you actually hear the fucking stories and the,

753
00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:06.880
uh,
I don't know the level you have to go to,
to make another comedian laugh.
Um,

754
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:08.710
this put it this way.

755
00:49:08.711 --> 00:49:13.330
This podcast is PG 13 compared to the shit that we talk about.
So anyways,

756
00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:17.560
that's what I was doing.
I was drinking booze.
I was having a great time up there.

757
00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:21.040
Um,
and I'm fucking wiped out.
But,
um,

758
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:25.780
I'm actually taping this right now on the 18th.
Sunday the 18th,

759
00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:31.270
and I'm doing the David Letterman program,
the late show tomorrow night.

760
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:36.290
I got my suit.
I got to get my shoes polished.
I got my fucking cufflinks,

761
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.630
you know,
nice fucking shirt.
And as always,

762
00:49:40.631 --> 00:49:44.320
I know people are gonna send me emails.
Dude,
why did you wear as sweat?

763
00:49:44.321 --> 00:49:48.790
Did you dress up
for the greatest fucking,
you know,

764
00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:53.740
talk show out there,
Bill?

765
00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.670
I don't understand it.
Everybody else on the show is dress really nicely.

766
00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:00.640
Why did you go on the show and dress really nicely?

767
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:05.770
Why didn't you go out there and dress like you were headlining the funny bone in

768
00:50:05.771 --> 00:50:10.420
fucking Dayton,
Ohio.
Why did you dress like you were in the Ed Sullivan Theater?

769
00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:14.710
Do you guys realize you young punks that that's the fucking same stage where the

770
00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:19.390
Beatles came out and broke in the United States.
And if you'll watch him,

771
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:22.120
they were wearing suits.
You're dumb fucks.

772
00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:26.380
Really don't understand that you show up to a Toga party.
If you wear a suit,

773
00:50:26.381 --> 00:50:30.560
you can give somebody then when in Rome cunts,
when in Rome.

774
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:35.750
Um,
so anyways,
this is going to be my fifth appearance and uh,
I'm really excited.

775
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:39.080
I got a nice tight set.
Um,

776
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:43.220
I am kind of making fun of mothers right out of the gate.
So,
uh,

777
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:45.230
as always,
you know,

778
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.440
there's always a bit of awkwardness before people realize that I look like a

779
00:50:48.441 --> 00:50:51.650
puppet and then I'm harmless and then I just write it,

780
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:55.760
write it right through.
And uh,

781
00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:59.270
and then what's going to happen is after the show,

782
00:50:59.271 --> 00:51:03.260
I'm going to have the fucking euphoria that I did it and I survived it.

783
00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:08.210
And then I'm going to go out and I'm going to stay out too late

784
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:12.920
and then my alarm clock is going to go off 20 minutes later and I'm going to be

785
00:51:12.921 --> 00:51:16.520
in the worst fucking move ever.
I better have a window seat.

786
00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:20.240
That's all I can tell you because if I get woken up,
if I get the aisle seat,

787
00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:25.100
you know I hate how people wake you up on a plane.

788
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:26.840
When a stranger wakes you up,

789
00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:32.120
is there anything more creepier than the touch of a stranger trying to not

790
00:51:32.121 --> 00:51:36.410
disturb you from your sleep?
That little two fingered,

791
00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:37.970
not quite a poke,

792
00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:42.620
not quite a caress that they do into your shoulder and then they speak in like

793
00:51:42.621 --> 00:51:46.430
half sentences.
They don't just,
they don't just,
you know,

794
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:51.290
you know what?
You know it'd be acceptable like a man demand,

795
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:55.130
like a back of the hand fucking on,

796
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:57.710
on the side of your leg.
As intimate as that sound.

797
00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:01.850
I'll give you the sound just like this.
Hey Man,
I got to get up.
Use the bathroom.

798
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:05.080
I just like that,
but for some reason,
because you,

799
00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:08.690
I don't know if it's because of nine 11,
I don't know what,
but people just,

800
00:52:08.691 --> 00:52:11.090
they the two finger and then they,

801
00:52:11.091 --> 00:52:14.090
and then they sort of whisper a half a sentence.

802
00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.540
They fuck you just feel this creepy fucking pedophile touch.

803
00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.070
It startles you.
The exact thing they don't want to do.
It's such a creepy touch.

804
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:23.180
It does startle you.

805
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:27.620
You fucking whip your head around over to them and then at some another man

806
00:52:27.621 --> 00:52:32.500
whispering I half a sentence.
Yeah.
I just had,
I,
I just wanted to,

807
00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:37.690
yeah.
Can I just,
can you just what you fucking asshole.

808
00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:39.980
Finish the goddamn sentence and stop fucking

809
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:44.480
finger rape in me.
Whatever the hell you just did there.

810
00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:50.000
That's the old shoulder finger rape at 30,000 feet.
Um,

811
00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:54.830
which is actually a new phrase acceptable in the Webster's dictionary.

812
00:52:54.831 --> 00:52:56.660
Can you believe that?
How many of you,

813
00:52:56.710 --> 00:53:00.020
I am so sick of them fucking bringing that up on talk shows.

814
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:05.030
Do you know that chilling is now an acceptable word in the dictionary?

815
00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:09.710
Well,
do you know that everybody's using it?
You fucking idiots.

816
00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:11.120
That's how they become words.

817
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:14.750
You can have words that everybody is using and you're not going to put them in

818
00:53:14.751 --> 00:53:19.520
the dictionary.
Why are people so fucking stuck up about that?
Ooh,

819
00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:23.180
good Chilean couldn't look woo.

820
00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:29.910
And like there's any class left fucking doing Vegas,

821
00:53:29.911 --> 00:53:34.710
people showing up in Hawaiian shorts with flip flops and you can't put Schilling

822
00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:39.700
in the God damn dictionary.
You know,
keep stopping these fucking plagues people.

823
00:53:39.701 --> 00:53:40.870
And that's what you're going to have.

824
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:44.500
You're going to have a weaker species of fucking human beings.

825
00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:46.623
All right?

826
00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:50.210
And they're gonna use fucking slang words and eventually you're going to have to

827
00:53:50.211 --> 00:53:52.130
stick them in the dictionary because you're going to want to come.

828
00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:53.840
You'd be able to communicate to the people.

829
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:57.710
You always have to be able to communicate to the people because if he can't

830
00:53:57.711 --> 00:54:00.650
communicate to them,
then you can't give them the fucking lie.

831
00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:03.200
You can't spend your own fucking story

832
00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:09.020
of why we're all scampering around down here as you sit in your fucking manner.

833
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:10.620
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah.</v>

834
00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:11.271
<v 7>You know,</v>

835
00:54:11.271 --> 00:54:16.180
I've been dying to do a bit about the kind of people I think should get the

836
00:54:16.181 --> 00:54:21.070
death penalty
and one of them is these fucking bankers.
I really believe,
man,

837
00:54:21.071 --> 00:54:25.210
if you shake up the economy like a goddamn and farm and you make fucking old

838
00:54:25.211 --> 00:54:28.720
people have to eat al Po for the last 18 years of their fucking life,

839
00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:33.130
and I might just talking about five or six of them.
I'm talking about an,

840
00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:37.340
you know,
a large percentage of an entire generation.

841
00:54:37.341 --> 00:54:38.990
These fucking banker cunts.

842
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:40.450
<v 3>Okay.</v>

843
00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:44.620
<v 7>Fucked over people.
Basically the generation that won World War II,</v>

844
00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:50.990
it's unbelievable.
Then even go to jail.
They don't even fucking go to jail.

845
00:54:54.070 --> 00:54:56.710
I Dunno.
I think they should give all old people fucking,

846
00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:00.550
they should just give them those paintball guns and then they should just tell

847
00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:04.450
them where the,
where the fucking rich people live,

848
00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:07.510
the bankers and they should just go on and just see every once in a while drive

849
00:55:07.511 --> 00:55:10.600
by and shoot him and they never get arrested.

850
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:14.020
That's what I think that they should do.
All right.
Once again,

851
00:55:14.021 --> 00:55:15.430
just like the last two podcasts.

852
00:55:15.431 --> 00:55:19.120
This thing's starting to Peter out right around 21 minutes.

853
00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:23.470
52 seconds.
Can I be funny up until 22 seconds,

854
00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:27.310
I got another four seconds to do it.
Three seconds.
That's not going to happen.

855
00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:30.280
Jesus.
This is the longest 50 minutes ever.

856
00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:33.880
Fucking goddamn George's popped out too.

857
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:37.600
I'll tell you guys then they said that I grinded my teeth at night.

858
00:55:37.601 --> 00:55:38.880
Like I didn't know that I could,

859
00:55:38.881 --> 00:55:43.090
didn't know that I was an absolute psycho and had angry dreams about murdering

860
00:55:43.091 --> 00:55:43.720
people.

861
00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:48.280
So they give me this fucking mouth guard and I put the mouth guard on it and now

862
00:55:48.281 --> 00:55:50.980
my jaw just dislocates every once in awhile.

863
00:55:51.590 --> 00:55:52.423
<v 3>Okay.</v>

864
00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:57.260
<v 7>And I so don't like paperwork and shit that I would never even consider sowing</v>

865
00:55:57.261 --> 00:56:01.880
them.
Oh my God,
this sucks.
And I've just figured out how to pop it back in again.

866
00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:06.050
Right now it's out of alignment.
Let me see if,
let me try to bite down.
Yeah.

867
00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:10.400
What the fuck?
I feel like I had a ball side of my fucking jaw.

868
00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:12.920
Any dentist out there can tell me why that happened.

869
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:18.940
I can't even,
you know,
you know why the first time it happened I came be leaving.

870
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:22.990
I'm going tell you this,
I can't tell you how,

871
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:27.310
first time I dislocated my job was,
uh,

872
00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:38.890
how do I tell it in a clean way?
I don't do sex jokes,
but,

873
00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:44.440
uh,
I was going down on a girl and I was trying to fucking jam my tongue in there

874
00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:49.570
and I think it pushed my lower back.
She was getting really into it,

875
00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.930
you know,
and I was younger so I didn't know how to make them come.

876
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:57.160
And she was getting close and I was so fucking exhausted.
I just went forward.

877
00:56:57.190 --> 00:57:01.120
I was in the red zone.
I was like,
we got a score here.
This fucking game is over.

878
00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.080
And then when,
you know,
I came up out of the fucking,

879
00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:09.580
what the fuck do you call it?
I don't know.
The concubines.

880
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:12.630
I know somewhere with this,
see that began there and I wasn't going to say cunt.

881
00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:15.910
I came up out of there,
uh,
you know what,

882
00:57:15.911 --> 00:57:20.530
that laminated face and a,
yeah,
I noticed it was difficult to bite down.

883
00:57:20.531 --> 00:57:21.790
And ever since then I had a problem.

884
00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:25.520
I think I just ruined my lawsuit cause if they listened to the podcast,

885
00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:30.800
actually he admits on the podcast on July 18th,

886
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:33.063
2010,

887
00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:39.520
then it was actually jamming his tongue into a vagina in Laughlin,

888
00:57:39.521 --> 00:57:40.354
Nevada.

889
00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:45.510
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

890
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:49.610
<v 7>There's no way to make that up.
It's fucking true.
Oh,</v>

891
00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:53.660
Jesus Christ is an aging.
Isn't it?

892
00:57:53.661 --> 00:57:58.170
Just funny how things like that happen.
Um,
anyways,

893
00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:00.050
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking thing to admit.

894
00:58:00.051 --> 00:58:02.720
You can tell him flailing when I started to fucking admit and that shit.

895
00:58:02.721 --> 00:58:06.870
24 minutes.
Here we go.
Let's plow ahead.

896
00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:10.510
I was watching ESPN today and um,

897
00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:13.920
and of course,
you know,
as always,

898
00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:20.090
you had four really intelligent people on a panel who are all involved in a

899
00:58:20.161 --> 00:58:23.340
debate that none of them knew was even remotely true,

900
00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:28.200
but they engaged in it anyways because it would piss off a guy like me and make

901
00:58:28.201 --> 00:58:29.460
me continue to watch.

902
00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:34.110
So then I then see the commercials so they can justify their advertising so that

903
00:58:34.111 --> 00:58:38.700
those four cock suckers can get paid.
I refuse to believe that Bob Ryan,

904
00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:41.970
John Saunders,
though they're not dumb guys than not,

905
00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:46.350
but if you listen to what they're arguing,
it's the stupidest shit ever.

906
00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:51.840
Basically,
because a tiger woods hasn't won a major this year.

907
00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:56.820
They're questioning whether he's ever basically going to be able to put it back

908
00:58:56.821 --> 00:58:57.654
together again.

909
00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:03.520
Completely ignoring the fact that he got busted for cheating almost 30 times on

910
00:59:03.921 --> 00:59:06.620
his wife in front of the entire country,

911
00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:12.160
and that he's going through a divorce right now that you know she wants $700

912
00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:17.330
million
and he's wants to give her 300 million.

913
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:21.470
They're in the process of negotiating that and also he's got,

914
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:25.130
he's going through a period in his life where he realized that he fucked up his

915
00:59:25.131 --> 00:59:29.690
whole marriage.
You know,
if you guys,
you know,
not forget,

916
00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:31.100
if you've been fucked up relationship,

917
00:59:31.101 --> 00:59:34.220
you haven't gone through relationship that ends and you got to go through your

918
00:59:34.221 --> 00:59:37.700
fucking town and everywhere you go,
you've got a memory of that person.

919
00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:41.420
You sit in there welling up in a Johnny rockets.

920
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:44.690
Would you like to get some French fries?
Yes.

921
00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:49.920
Your thought she loved French fries we used to share of um,

922
00:59:50.121 --> 00:59:51.170
all that shit.
So he,

923
00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:54.110
you don't think he's going through that on a worldwide basis,

924
00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:58.010
traveled the world with that woman and just be,
you know,

925
00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:02.360
when you fuck up to that level,
you always want to go back.
You know,

926
01:00:02.361 --> 01:00:04.820
you have to go through the regret before you can move on.

927
01:00:04.821 --> 01:00:08.510
So I'm sure he's sitting there at the British open as much as he's trying to

928
01:00:08.511 --> 01:00:10.490
block it out as much as he's a competitor,

929
01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.760
there's no way as a human being for you not to be sitting here going,
man,

930
01:00:13.761 --> 01:00:16.700
this time last year,
my life was so different,

931
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.260
even though I didn't win it last year when I came up on 18,

932
01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.660
but she didn't play last year because his knee was hurt or whatever.

933
01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:28.460
The last time he played it,
you know,
um,
or maybe he did,

934
01:00:28.461 --> 01:00:29.294
I don't fucking know.

935
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:32.660
He was coming up 18 and his wife was sitting there with their kid and he got the

936
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:36.530
hug and on the kiss and all that type of shit.
And it's not there.

937
01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:40.400
And he has to deal with that.
And this is a fucking guy that,
you know,

938
01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:44.450
he's a human being.
They're such idiots.

939
01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:48.620
The guy won a fucking tournament when his knee was blown out and he was

940
01:00:48.621 --> 01:00:52.070
screaming in pain after every goddamn shot and he's still fucking it.

941
01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:55.940
And they're going to question this guy with a reconstructed knee.

942
01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:02.540
You know,
the guys in his early thirties,
they've already written him off.

943
01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:07.340
Jack Nicholas won his final fucking,
uh,
master's at like 45,

944
01:01:07.341 --> 01:01:10.100
46 years of age.
It's this,
it's,

945
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:15.400
the whole debate was so fucking beneath guys like Bob Ryan,

946
01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:20.120
John Saunders,
who was that?
Who the guy was.
It was,
if you just sit there going,

947
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:22.100
you guys don't even believe this shit.

948
01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:26.540
You just trying to cause controversy because you have to fill up 24 fucking

949
01:01:26.541 --> 01:01:31.010
hours.
And that right there is why I don't watch those shows,
you know?

950
01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:31.881
But you know,

951
01:01:31.881 --> 01:01:34.160
unless I'm on the fucking road and I've got nothing else to do and then I

952
01:01:34.161 --> 01:01:39.110
completely fucking pisses me off.
Anyways,

953
01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:42.380
let's plow ahead here.
Um,

954
01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:48.560
here's a question I got this week,
um,
from a listener.
Um,
Bill,

955
01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:49.490
I have a question.

956
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:55.430
I had been dating a Filipina girl who is too short to be seen with in public.

957
01:01:57.350 --> 01:02:01.460
Geez.
I mean,
what,
what a what a way to start the story.

958
01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:04.760
I'm seeing a girl who I can't be seen with in public.
Okay.

959
01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:07.430
This relationship has legs.
Um,

960
01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:12.170
and the fact that I'm six foot three doesn't help at all.
I mean,

961
01:02:12.171 --> 01:02:15.260
she is really small for foot five.

962
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:20.550
This is one of the great sentences I've ever read.
Listen to this.

963
01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.590
Technically she's a midget.

964
01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:27.240
So you would think people would kind of leave us alone out of respect for her

965
01:02:27.241 --> 01:02:28.074
shortness.

966
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:36.030
Sir.
Do you realize that really short people or little people want to be called

967
01:02:36.031 --> 01:02:40.320
little people?
They Fund midget is offensive.
I learned that.

968
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.720
I didn't think it was,
I actually have that on my CD going.

969
01:02:42.721 --> 01:02:45.510
It was never a racial slur.
You know,

970
01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:49.080
midgets weren't dragged here from another country and forced to do labor.

971
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.260
You're a midget.
What's wrong with that?

972
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:57.320
And evidently a PT Barnum came up with it or something just to let you know,

973
01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:01.620
cause I didn't know midget was offensive either or I knew it was offensive,

974
01:03:01.621 --> 01:03:03.840
but I didn't understand why.
Uh,

975
01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:08.070
Mitch is like the name for a really tiny bug I guess.

976
01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:09.180
So that's what they were saying.

977
01:03:09.181 --> 01:03:11.970
They say when you like you were like is small as a little,

978
01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:15.540
but they were comparing it to a little fucking insect,
you know?

979
01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:20.430
And that goes to the elephant man think I am not an insect.
I am a human being.

980
01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:25.800
What's the do with mood shifts?
Um,
so technically she's a midget.

981
01:03:25.801 --> 01:03:28.890
So you would think people would kind of leave us alone out of respect for her

982
01:03:28.891 --> 01:03:29.730
shortness.

983
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:33.930
But people's people stare me down everywhere we go.

984
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:36.360
She's cute,
nice and sweet,

985
01:03:36.361 --> 01:03:39.960
but I feel uncomfortable being part of a side show all the time.

986
01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:43.950
Do you think it's acceptable for a tall man to date a tiny,

987
01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:48.990
a tiny women,
tiny woman is what you mean?
Do I think it's acceptable.

988
01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:53.790
Yeah,
it's totally acceptable.
Date with who you want to a date.

989
01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:54.481
What's not,

990
01:03:54.481 --> 01:03:58.200
what's not acceptable is dating someone you're not comfortable being seen with

991
01:03:58.201 --> 01:04:00.220
in public?
Um,

992
01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:05.330
I would work on not giving a fuck or I would get out of the relationship because

993
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:11.130
,
uh,
I don't know how she hasn't picked up on it already,

994
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:16.680
but,
uh,
if you're not comfortable with the person you're dating,
I mean,
I mean,

995
01:04:16.681 --> 01:04:20.580
I don't know if someone can walk down the street with me and be comfortable

996
01:04:20.581 --> 01:04:25.410
walking down the street with a fucking red headed freak.
Um,
I think that,

997
01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:29.880
uh,
you know,
you could get comfortable with her
and when you,

998
01:04:29.881 --> 01:04:32.610
when you walked down the street with it,
you don't have her like fucking,

999
01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:35.040
you know,
one of those,

1000
01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:40.620
you don't have a one of those kiddie things,
you know,

1001
01:04:40.621 --> 01:04:44.910
where she's sitting on you that your chest like a fucking primate.

1002
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:46.770
I guess we're all primates,
aren't we?
You know,

1003
01:04:46.771 --> 01:04:50.900
in monkeys when the fucking monkey just hangs on the other,
you know,

1004
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:54.420
wraps her arms around your back.
Yeah,
I'm being a Dick Right now.

1005
01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:58.920
You ever in a fanny pack?
See this,
I'm doing the exact fucking thing.
Well,

1006
01:04:58.921 --> 01:05:00.750
you got to understand that's what people are going to do.

1007
01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.360
You've got to understand if you're a different looking,

1008
01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:06.420
couple people are going to give you shit and you just got to get beyond it.

1009
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:11.820
You know,
that's all I can say.
I shouldn't have made those jokes.

1010
01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:14.280
Cause now you're probably thinking like,
see,
you're being a con too.

1011
01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:17.920
I'm not being a content being a guy who is not even remotely funny.

1012
01:05:17.921 --> 01:05:21.670
This fucker we trying to trudge through 15 fucking minutes,

1013
01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:26.680
50 minutes of a podcast.
All right?
So I have to make fun of everything.
So,
uh,

1014
01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:31.360
I dunno.
She's adorable.
She's nice.
If you think she's the one I would,

1015
01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:35.680
I would stay with her.
Um,
if you don't think she's the one,

1016
01:05:35.681 --> 01:05:40.060
get out of it immediately because even if she's not the one,

1017
01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:43.690
eventually you'll have feelings for,
and then when you break up with her,

1018
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:47.410
you know,
when you sat her on the coffee table and say,
look,

1019
01:05:47.411 --> 01:05:48.520
we have to have a talk.

1020
01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:56.380
I'm sorry dude,
I'm on any joke.
Any,
any port.
In a storm.

1021
01:05:56.410 --> 01:06:01.120
I got to fucking do it and she starts crying.
You know,
it's the worst.

1022
01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:03.730
That's why you know something.
I'll tell you right now.

1023
01:06:03.731 --> 01:06:08.050
This is why like I love how it's unacceptable to break up with somebody over the

1024
01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:08.650
phone.

1025
01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:13.650
You know who came up with that is women because they know how guilty they can

1026
01:06:14.441 --> 01:06:16.960
make us fucking feel when they start crying.

1027
01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:20.290
They want to make us feel is bad.

1028
01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.540
It's a total vindictive fucking mood.

1029
01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:26.410
There's nothing wrong with breaking up with somebody on the phone.

1030
01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:31.060
There's nothing wrong with like that dude on sex in the city who wrote it on a

1031
01:06:31.061 --> 01:06:35.470
post it and stuck it to the TV.
I have a girlfriend,

1032
01:06:35.471 --> 01:06:39.040
I have seen some episodes of that show.
Um,

1033
01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:43.840
although I never get to the whole one because I would always piss my girl off

1034
01:06:44.410 --> 01:06:48.700
cause anytime the hoary girl would make us anything she said in the show was

1035
01:06:48.701 --> 01:06:50.080
always sexually related.

1036
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:54.910
And I told you guys this before and any lines she said after she said it,

1037
01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:59.911
I would just go cause she's a whore and it would just piss my girl off to no one

1038
01:07:00.761 --> 01:07:04.810
until by the end of the show.
She was doing it too.
But anyways,
I digressed.

1039
01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:09.640
Let's fucking,
let's fucking just plow ahead.
There's nothing wrong

1040
01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:12.610
no matter what.
It's going to make them cry.

1041
01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.400
There's nothing wrong with breakups with someone through email.

1042
01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:17.980
There's nothing wrong with doing it with the post it.

1043
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:21.730
There's nothing wrong with doing it over the phone in a way.
There's actually,

1044
01:07:21.731 --> 01:07:23.710
it's a caring thing that they're doing.
It's like,

1045
01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:28.450
I care about you so much and it would hurt me so much to see how much I'm

1046
01:07:28.451 --> 01:07:31.960
hurting you that I can't even deal with watching how much I'm going to hurt you.

1047
01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.060
You know,
and you're out.

1048
01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:40.210
It's a vindictive thing that women want you eyeball to eyeball watch you stand

1049
01:07:40.211 --> 01:07:42.760
there and watch.
You crushed them by saying,

1050
01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:46.270
I don't want to be in a fucking relationship with you anymore.
You know,

1051
01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:48.880
it's fucking awful.
What I always do.
And you know,

1052
01:07:48.881 --> 01:07:51.340
back in the day when I used to have to break up with somebody,

1053
01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:54.760
I used to just think this.
All right,
dude,

1054
01:07:56.170 --> 01:08:00.880
it's,
it's two hours of your life.
The first leg of it.

1055
01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:04.540
It's like the Tour de France.
Okay.
We're just trying to get to the mountains.

1056
01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:08.920
All right?
The first two hour fucking leg.
All right?

1057
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:13.120
She's going to cry.
It's gonna suck.
We have to stick to your fucking guns.

1058
01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:16.370
All right?
Sit down.
Just say in this,

1059
01:08:16.371 --> 01:08:19.310
probably people out there right now who need to get out of a relationship and

1060
01:08:19.311 --> 01:08:22.310
you just don't know how to do it cause you're young.
All right?

1061
01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:26.360
It's not going to get better.
You can't make yourself love the person.

1062
01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:28.220
You just have to fucking get out of it.

1063
01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.000
And this goes for the broads out there too.
He just have to go,
look,

1064
01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:37.280
we need to talk.
All right?
I don't know what's going on,

1065
01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:42.230
but I'm just not happy anymore,

1066
01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:46.580
you know,
and you can use all the hacky stuff.
You're a great person,

1067
01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:51.950
but I'm just not,
I'm not feeling it.
I'm just not.

1068
01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:57.080
And
you know,
that's celebrities to it.
Look,

1069
01:08:57.081 --> 01:09:00.380
I'm already getting nervous.
His picture in the girl cry crying.
It's all there.

1070
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:04.490
You know,
you're,
it's not fair to you.
It's not fair to you.
It's

1071
01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:07.640
so,
what do you say?

1072
01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.690
We care at work and this is the thing they tried to fucking,

1073
01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:16.790
they try to save it and you just have to be like that dude in the first star

1074
01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:20.840
wars.
Stay on target.
Stay on target.
Right.

1075
01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.960
Woo.
Well,
you know,
I've,
I've been thinking things like that too.

1076
01:09:26.961 --> 01:09:30.110
I just think we don't see each other enough big,
you know,

1077
01:09:30.111 --> 01:09:32.490
and maybe that's what I've been avoiding.
You,

1078
01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.980
you can't say that can't be mean and just be like,
look,
no.
Um,
um,

1079
01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:41.180
is truly how I feel.
And

1080
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:45.440
yeah,
that's,
it's just,
it's just how I feel.

1081
01:09:45.441 --> 01:09:49.040
And then just let them emote and let them go.

1082
01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:53.420
You know,
it's like deep sea fishing.

1083
01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:58.220
When you get that line,
you seen the fucking thing takes off.
We got fight.

1084
01:09:58.740 --> 01:09:59.750
You gotta let it go.

1085
01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:05.120
You can't fucking clamp the thing down and then snap the line.

1086
01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.570
You know,
zen,
she's free.

1087
01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:12.170
She's going to come back around and attack the fucking boat,
like in jars.

1088
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:18.170
You got to let it go,
jump up out of the water,
flop around and get fucking tired,

1089
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:24.740
you know,
and,
and uh,
yeah,
and you just,

1090
01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:28.760
you just,
it's a two hour fucking thing.
Okay.

1091
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:31.190
And all you have to do is just say,
are you failing?

1092
01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:34.910
And then just let her fucking run and start fucking crying

1093
01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.560
and go through all the emotions she needs to,
to,
to get through.

1094
01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:42.260
And you just have to sit there and stick to your guns.

1095
01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:48.950
All right.
And then comes the hardest part

1096
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:54.500
is,
uh,
if you're in her apartment,
that's a great thing.

1097
01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:56.090
So you can fucking leave.

1098
01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.100
It's worse if you do it in your apartment because then you have to kick them
out.

1099
01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.700
So yeah,
that's how I feel.
And uh,

1100
01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:08.900
I need you to vacate the premises and readies as you say that you got to have

1101
01:11:08.901 --> 01:11:13.620
your friends step out dressed like a bouncer with one of those fucking cell ear

1102
01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:14.640
ear piece things.

1103
01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:17.180
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1104
01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:20.390
<v 7>Standing there like a bouncy you when they stand with their hands folded in</v>

1105
01:11:20.391 --> 01:11:23.600
front of him one hand holding the wrist of the other arm,
you know,

1106
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:27.230
now you got to do it over to her place and just say,

1107
01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:30.863
you know,

1108
01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:31.800
<v 3>yeah,
okay,</v>

1109
01:11:32.210 --> 01:11:34.720
<v 7>I'm not going to date anybody for a while or whatever the fuck you got to say.</v>

1110
01:11:34.721 --> 01:11:39.590
And I,
I just,
you know,
and if she says,

1111
01:11:39.591 --> 01:11:43.670
can I call you?
You just,
yeah,
you just say yes,
yes you can.

1112
01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:48.500
And then decide whether you really meant that or not later,
but uh,

1113
01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:50.683
<v 3>okay.</v>

1114
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:56.060
<v 7>Yeah,
and I dunno.
And then you got,
I don't know,
then you get,
you got to get,</v>

1115
01:11:56.100 --> 01:12:00.920
and then you've got to get away from him.
You got to get away from him.
Um,

1116
01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.620
because if you keep coming back,
it just starts the pain over again.

1117
01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:07.290
And then also,

1118
01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:09.080
<v 3>yeah,</v>

1119
01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:12.640
<v 7>on your level is you're going to have to try to get over them even though you</v>

1120
01:12:12.650 --> 01:12:15.230
are over him,
but still now you're going to be alone.

1121
01:12:15.231 --> 01:12:18.080
You can have that panic attack.
Well,
who am I going to be with?

1122
01:12:18.650 --> 01:12:22.550
What did I use to do when I was single?
How did I fill up all this fucking time?

1123
01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:27.650
Just ride it out.
Just know it's going to suck for six weeks.
All right.

1124
01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.530
Six weeks later you're out.
Football season starts,

1125
01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:37.490
you know the smell of fall comes through the fucking windows.
Yeah.

1126
01:12:38.770 --> 01:12:40.310
<v 3>You know?
Yeah.</v>

1127
01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:44.280
<v 7>Yeah.
Buddy fucking brings over maybe a couple of girls who were into sports.</v>

1128
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:46.530
You find another one.
Got To have a look at her.

1129
01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:48.653
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1130
01:12:49.410 --> 01:12:53.700
<v 7>And then you're on your,
on your fucking way.
It's spring again in the fall.</v>

1131
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:59.340
See it as a happy ending.
That's how you fucking do it.
Jesus Christ.

1132
01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.550
There was some advice for you how to fucking break up with somebody.

1133
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:06.030
Do you guys have any stories about like the worst way you were ever broken up

1134
01:13:06.031 --> 01:13:10.260
with or the best,
best way somebody ever broke up with you?

1135
01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:12.913
<v 3>You know,</v>

1136
01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:17.230
<v 7>I broke up with someone one time and then I bought her a hotdog</v>

1137
01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.200
and it was weird.
It was when I was a little bit older and I just had a really,

1138
01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:31.150
it was just totally fucking honest.
I just had an honest talk and I said,
look,

1139
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.560
we're both,
we're both couple psychos.
I mean,
haven't you noticed?

1140
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:41.000
I had you ever have that fucking relationship where everything,

1141
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:43.790
it just doesn't feel right and then you freak out,

1142
01:13:43.791 --> 01:13:46.370
you have an argument and then you've just fuck,

1143
01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:48.250
<v 3>okay.</v>

1144
01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:52.480
<v 7>And then it feels right again.
And then it slowly starts going off course again,</v>

1145
01:13:52.690 --> 01:13:55.720
and then you have a big argument and then you fuck again right after it.

1146
01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:57.840
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1147
01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.630
<v 7>I dunno,
I just finally hit me.
I was just like,
yeah,
well this is just,</v>

1148
01:14:00.631 --> 01:14:04.140
this relationship isn't working okay,
really isn't working.

1149
01:14:04.141 --> 01:14:07.860
And then what happens is,
is then we fuck,
and it's a lot of fun.

1150
01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.140
It's just,
it's just based on sex.

1151
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.140
We're having a really good time fucking before indicating,
okay,

1152
01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:19.180
if I could try to be a gentleman here,
that's basically what we're doing.

1153
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:23.580
But other than that,
we don't really enjoy each other's company.

1154
01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:28.393
You want a hot dog?

1155
01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:38.310
You know what it was was I did it early enough in the relationship where the

1156
01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:41.980
woman's still actually respected me and she actually complimented me.
I mean,

1157
01:14:41.981 --> 01:14:45.730
it was a little more involved than that.
MMM.

1158
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:48.750
But she actually called me.
She goes,
you know what?
That was a,

1159
01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:49.880
that was a pretty good breakup.

1160
01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:52.910
I gotta give it to you and then you walked me down to the train.

1161
01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:56.060
We wave goodbye as the train slowly went away.

1162
01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:00.820
It's like the end of like a fucking a film noir movie.
What else?

1163
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:04.070
Classic films.
He played it for her.
You can play it for me.

1164
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:06.583
Play it for me.

1165
01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:11.090
They're fucking black guy who doesn't get any lines cause it's the 1940s math.

1166
01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:12.763
I um,

1167
01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:16.940
I was actually the TV here in my walk in closet.

1168
01:15:17.530 --> 01:15:20.390
$400 a night fucking hotel.
Um,

1169
01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:25.100
I was actually watching that Turner movie classics,
man.
Jesus Christ.

1170
01:15:25.101 --> 01:15:29.510
When I get on that thing,
forget about it.
I was actually,
I watched,

1171
01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:33.290
you know,
like the road movie,
the Buddy road movie.
I didn't realize this.

1172
01:15:33.291 --> 01:15:36.920
The first is the guys who invented that genre of movie,

1173
01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:44.000
um,
was um,
what was it?
Bing Crosby and fucking Bob hope.

1174
01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:49.460
I had no idea.
And they will write as I had to go out last night to watch,
um,

1175
01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:50.900
to go run my set.

1176
01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:55.940
They had the third in their trilogy and I forget of the buddy movies.

1177
01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:00.050
I think they did more after that,
but I guess this was their best one.

1178
01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:04.550
And I can't remember the name of the movie,
but the,
basically

1179
01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:10.340
the premise of the movie was that they went to some fucking Arabian,

1180
01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:15.430
you know,
back then there was no Middle East.
Everything was just Arabian,

1181
01:16:15.431 --> 01:16:18.820
whatever the fuck that meant.
Or does that mean like Arabic country?

1182
01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:22.720
I don't fucking know.
But the whole thing was they had to get out of something.

1183
01:16:22.721 --> 01:16:26.770
So Bing Crosby cells,
uh,

1184
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:28.780
Bob Hope into slavery.

1185
01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:34.240
Like slavery was still funny back then.
I don't know what the fuck I'm saying.

1186
01:16:34.241 --> 01:16:36.530
All I know is I watched the thing and bright,

1187
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:41.550
the movie that I watched right before that was a movie called zero hour and it

1188
01:16:41.801 --> 01:16:46.390
absolutely blew me away.
I'm sitting there watching this movie.

1189
01:16:46.391 --> 01:16:47.980
I came in and the middle of this,

1190
01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:53.580
this flick and there's a guy talking about this guy who's got to try to land

1191
01:16:54.731 --> 01:16:57.700
this plane and the guy's name is Ted striker.

1192
01:16:58.830 --> 01:17:00.010
I'm going Ted striker.

1193
01:17:00.011 --> 01:17:04.450
That was the name of the guy in airplane and it's literally the same movie.

1194
01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:08.980
And I finally fucking realize that that was the movie that airplane was Paris

1195
01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:11.660
making a parody of,
um,

1196
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:16.640
was a movie called zero hour that came out in like the mid fifties for the life

1197
01:17:16.641 --> 01:17:19.160
of me.
I thought that they will make fun of,
you know,

1198
01:17:19.161 --> 01:17:23.180
those movie airport airports,
76 airports,
77,

1199
01:17:23.181 --> 01:17:25.010
those ones with like George Kennedy,

1200
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:28.790
I thought that they were making fun of those movies and they weren't,

1201
01:17:28.791 --> 01:17:33.470
they basically almost did a frame for frame remake of zero hour.

1202
01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:37.010
And um,
if you don't want to watch the movie,

1203
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:41.630
go on Youtube and watch airplane versus zero hour,

1204
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:45.890
you can't fucking believe
how similar.

1205
01:17:45.891 --> 01:17:49.310
I mean all these subtle things.
They brings the kid up to the cockpit.

1206
01:17:49.670 --> 01:17:52.970
A Billy ever been up in a cockpit before and he's like,
no,

1207
01:17:52.971 --> 01:17:56.330
this is my first time except in the real one.

1208
01:17:56.331 --> 01:18:00.530
The first one it drops off there but an airplane.
Then the guy says,
Billy,

1209
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.720
you ever seen a grown man naked?
They added all that shit.
So zero hour,

1210
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:09.120
check out that movie.
I'll give you the youtube videos for the week of my,

1211
01:18:09.121 --> 01:18:13.190
at least at 30 minutes,
44 minutes.
I somehow fucking did it again this week.

1212
01:18:13.191 --> 01:18:15.410
All right.
Youtube videos of the week.

1213
01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:20.890
Go check out a best have balls of steel to jackass show from,

1214
01:18:21.201 --> 01:18:25.070
I dunno,
over in England and uh,
these guys are fucking great.

1215
01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:29.630
They're fucking,
they're just hilarious.
And they keep going to this.

1216
01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:32.750
Mcdonald's gave me four big macs.

1217
01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:36.710
Gimme seven double cheeseburgers and some fucking daddy down.
It's,

1218
01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:38.060
I don't know a ditty donuts are,

1219
01:18:38.061 --> 01:18:40.880
but they just keep going in some fucking daddy down.
It's,

1220
01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:44.450
and it makes me laugh every time and I just butchered it.
I'm telling you,

1221
01:18:44.451 --> 01:18:49.190
it's funny.
And also for you animal fans out there.
Watch Eagle verse goat,

1222
01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:54.260
I guess in the wild.
This is how strong these eagles are.

1223
01:18:54.261 --> 01:18:58.730
They find little goats and they fly down to them that goes,

1224
01:18:59.390 --> 01:19:02.690
Eh,
fucking runaway.
The Eagles,
grab them,
pick them up,

1225
01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:07.100
just we'll grab one of their legs and they drag him off the cliff and just drop

1226
01:19:07.101 --> 01:19:08.060
them.
That's how they kill him.

1227
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:11.210
But they actually have the ability to fly a little bit with them.

1228
01:19:11.211 --> 01:19:12.170
That's how strong they are.

1229
01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:15.180
And they wait til they're high enough and then they just drop them and they

1230
01:19:15.570 --> 01:19:16.460
bounce down off the cliff,

1231
01:19:16.461 --> 01:19:21.461
like some sort of x Gamer who lost his footing and uh,

1232
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:26.690
the goat dies and then they fly down,
they fucking eat it.
And there you go.

1233
01:19:26.691 --> 01:19:29.690
And I think that that's going to be the podcast for this week.
Cause I,
uh,

1234
01:19:30.650 --> 01:19:35.330
I actually have to go a,
it's New York.
I got to go do some shit.
You know,

1235
01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:39.260
people don't go to New York,
just stay in the hotel rooms.

1236
01:19:39.261 --> 01:19:43.940
That's how we justify making them so fucking small
goddamn cons.
Hey,

1237
01:19:43.941 --> 01:19:46.850
let me,
uh,
let me hype some of the Shit that I actually have coming up.

1238
01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:53.000
Um,
here's something that actually fell out of the sky.

1239
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:56.720
I have a gig coming up in Chicago.
All right,

1240
01:19:57.350 --> 01:20:02.350

1243

July 23rd,

1244
01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:22.050
I'm working with Vince Vaughn and Kevin James.

1245
01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.270
It's part of that Vince Vaughn wild west tour.

1246
01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:28.170
We're doing the park West Theater in Chicago,
Illinois.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:58.710
from this show will go to,

1254
01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:01.530

01:21:55.561 --> 01:22:00.030
last week I did a little rant,
you know about the Lebron James,

1269
01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:02.670
you know,
being afraid of the big um,

1270
01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:08.060
big stage in New York and actually went down to the comedy store and uh,

1271
01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:12.360
ah fuck.
I always forget the pipe.
Th Th th th damn page.

1272
01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:17.580
The EMM podcast.com.
All right.
The MM podcast.com.

1273
01:22:17.581 --> 01:22:19.140
Go to that.
That's the official,

1274
01:22:19.530 --> 01:22:24.480
there's no other fan page for the Monday morning podcast,
the EMM,
podcast.com.

1275
01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:26.190
All the references I've made.

1276
01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:31.020
I know I made a reference to something fucking old a number of times in this

1277
01:22:31.021 --> 01:22:33.420
podcast.
He puts up all the references,

1278
01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:37.410
all the youtube videos will be there so you can just click on them as I'm

1279
01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:40.980
talking about him.
And um,
anyways,

1280
01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:43.590
we actually filmed,

1281
01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:47.610
I did a different rant along the same lines and they put it up on Barstool

1282
01:22:47.611 --> 01:22:51.600
sports.
It got a ton of fucking hits and

1283
01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:58.620
touch her and,
and Dave,
is that the name of the show?
I'm such a Douche.

1284
01:22:58.730 --> 01:23:01.680
I how did they fuck that up?
I just pan.

1285
01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:03.810
You don't want what it is cause I don't know how to read that.

1286
01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:05.890
Actually thought touch her was to share is I was like,

1287
01:23:05.891 --> 01:23:10.420
is it too sure the guys on BCN touch or enrich?

1288
01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.030
There we go.
My brain isn't fucking awake.

1289
01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:15.820
I didn't even have to look it up just for the fucking record when an APP,

1290
01:23:15.850 --> 01:23:16.300
you know what?

1291
01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:19.150
I just tried to thank those guys and I fucked up the name of this show.

1292
01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:20.560
Touch your enrich,

1293
01:23:20.970 --> 01:23:24.490
played it and then actually let me call in and hope and hype my show.

1294
01:23:24.491 --> 01:23:28.390
So I'm feeling like I'm really becoming Internet savvy because back in the day

1295
01:23:28.391 --> 01:23:32.980
I'd have to get on a plane for six fucking hours,
land,
get up two hours later,

1296
01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:34.480
go into their studio,

1297
01:23:34.481 --> 01:23:39.481
half asleep and half is funny as I usually am and try to hype my gigs.

1298
01:23:39.581 --> 01:23:44.110
I actually got a plug out a month beforehand or three weeks before,

1299
01:23:44.111 --> 01:23:48.910
two weeks.
I Dunno what the day is.
Touch her enrich.
Sorry about that guys.

1300
01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:52.510
What an asshole.
Um,
anyways,
that's the podcast for this week.

1301
01:23:52.511 --> 01:23:55.450
I hope you guys enjoyed it.
And,
um,

1302
01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:59.170
I wanted to know was it easier to download last week when I put it through

1303
01:23:59.171 --> 01:24:04.171
garage band because I was actually able to make it a smaller audio file that it

1304
01:24:06.011 --> 01:24:08.710
download quicker cause I think I'm going to try and do it again this week

1305
01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:13.010
because I know it uploaded a lot quicker.
Was that interesting?
You know what,

1306
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:16.870
I think that's very fitting that I said something that wasn't funny to end this

1307
01:24:16.871 --> 01:24:21.100
podcast because that's how it's felt.
I know I came out with a head of steam,

1308
01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:25.150
you know what I mean?
I came out guns a blazing,

1309
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:28.180
Kinda like a Peyton manning football season.

1310
01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.500
Just lighten everybody up and then right in the end when it really counts,

1311
01:24:32.501 --> 01:24:36.430
I shit the bed.
Wow.
Did I really have to trash him?

1312
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:40.450
I think I did.
All right.
You guys have a great week and a,

1313
01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:44.710
if you're in the Chicago area,
please come out to the show.
Um,
and that is it.

1314
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:45.583
Have a great week.
All

1315
01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:46.503
<v 10>right.</v>

1316
01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:06.100
[inaudible] to shift somebody in the wings to force you to click.

1317
01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.060
And some random [inaudible] said to me,
the entity within the industry,

1318
01:25:10.061 --> 01:25:14.260
without a history of fit into your picture,
me living my life,

1319
01:25:14.730 --> 01:25:16.750
expressing my liberty,
you gotta be done properly.

1320
01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:20.740
My name is in the middle of the quality.
People follow me and number Cassie here,

1321
01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.490
flow and assume I'm the real one with the liver.
It's like I'm sick.
