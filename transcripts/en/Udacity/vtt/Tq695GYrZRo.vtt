00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.029
As we saw in lesson one,

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:06.680
Android makes it really easy to create
UIs that stretch based on screen size.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.330
We call these fluid layouts
because they can stretch and

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.490
compress depending on
the amount of space they have.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.350
And you can build these using layouts
like linear layout, grid layout,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.630
frame layout, or relative layout.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.450
But fluid layouts only get you so far.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.650
Most of the time, on larger screens
you can end up with a lot more white

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.820
space than you originally planned for.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.810
These massive seas of white space
result in an unbalanced UI and

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.200
can make your app look less useful and
less beautiful.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.730
Now before we jump into
ways to improve this,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.000
let's dive a little bit further
into the problem at hand.
