00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.980
Density-independent pixels allow the
designer to create assets that appear

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.966
in an expected way,
no matter the resolution or

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.923
density of the target device.

00:00:09.923 --> 00:00:15.357
A density-independent pixel is equal
to one pixel at the baseline density,

00:00:15.357 --> 00:00:17.200
or 160 dpi.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.800
They're often abbreviated dip or
just dp.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.360
Don't confuse that with dpi
which stands for dots per inch.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.810
So, what about at 320 dpi?

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.349
This is often called 2x.

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.290
Now, at 320 dpi, 1 dp is equal to 2 px.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.368
So, working with density-independent
pixels helps you deal with crazy

00:00:39.368 --> 00:00:43.247
situations like this where you may
have two devices with the same pixel

00:00:43.247 --> 00:00:45.761
resolution but
differing amounts of space.

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:49.518
In this case, the tablet has a lot of
space and the phone has a lot less,

00:00:49.518 --> 00:00:52.290
but they have the same pixel resolution.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.790
We'll see how density-independent pixels
makes this much easier to work with.
