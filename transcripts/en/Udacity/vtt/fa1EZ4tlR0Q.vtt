00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.630
So the ABO gene codes for the ABO protein, and depending on what

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.970
type of alleles I have, determines my blood type, A, B, AB, or O.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.180
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And the cool thing about alleles is that they don't just apply to

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.900
coding regions of our genome, there are

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.530
also alleles for non-coding regions, and that's the

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.450
subject of our next lesson, where we'll

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.260
talk about one allele. In a non-coding region

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.650
of a gene that controls a very important trait near and dear to my heart.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.010
&gt;&gt; That's right. The ability to drink milk or not.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.030
&gt;&gt; Cheers.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.440
&gt;&gt; Cheers.
