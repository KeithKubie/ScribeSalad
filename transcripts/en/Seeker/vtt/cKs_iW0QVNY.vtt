I used to put my cat up to the mirror and it would just ignore itself. But some cats... they freak out!

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.500
So what's up with mirrors? Why do they make some animals go crazy?

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.519
Hey there, cool cats! Trace here for DNews.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.639
Thanks for watching.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.118
Mirrors show us what we look like but they are not perfect. Our right is our left, our left is our right. And if you're

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.729
trying to manipulate something using a mirror, it can get really confusing really fast. And you can see what happens when you show one to a

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.430
chimpanzee in this YouTube video captured by French wildlife experts Ann Marie and Xavier Hubert Furier.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.489
Usually when an animal sees its own reflection, it lashes out aggressively or withdraws in fear because it

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.779
thinks it's another animal. We know that the chimps don't understand what they're seeing as a reflection because in 1970 Gordon Gallup, Jr.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.500
created a self-awareness test called "The Mirror Test". If you secretly put a bit of dye or paint onto an animal's face and then it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.620
sees a reflection,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.000
self-aware animals will go right for the paint poking it, touching. Non self-aware animals won't. It's a simple enough test.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.080
That's been replicated many many times. The idea is marking the body is testing the "theory of mind" or ability to imagine

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.080
what others are thinking and feeling

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:19.469
separate from yourself.  The reason animals don't recognize themselves, say scientists, is because they don't have high levels of self-awareness.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.909
We can watch as human babies develop this self-awareness too. Young babies

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:24.780
love to look at mirrors.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.759
But they have no idea that other baby isn't a stranger until they're like 15 to 18 months old.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.800
And then if there's a mark on their face,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.140
they will touch a finger to it showing they understand it is their own reflection and not some other baby.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.240
Eventually chimps figure this out too,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.970
and will begin exploring the mirror. Looking at their tongue, flopping their arms around, and making odd body motions...

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.720
Animal psychologist Diana Rice calls this the "Groucho Stage".

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.419
But eventually once they understand what the reflection is, they'll use it to see parts of their body that are normally

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.100
invisible to them like their back. Scientists keep testing animals in this way and so far only bonobos, orangutans, dolphins, orcas, elephants, humans,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.600
magpies and possibly pigeons have passed the mirror test. Interestingly

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.119
gorillas don't, leopards don't, fish don't either. And most birds will simply just attack their own

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.449
reflexions. Gibbons and macaques gesture at their face indicating that they understand something weird is going on

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.749
but they don't fully recognize the truth. Dogs

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.260
spend a little while trying to attack or play with the other dog before giving up and ignoring their own reflection altogether. And cats have

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.380
never passed either. Sometimes it'd say the pass of a mirror test means the animal understands self-awareness.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.540
But that's problematic.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.089
Non-Western children don't pass the mirror test even by the age of 6. Studies with Kenyan children showed that they can become very

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.440
uncomfortable when put in front of the mirror indicating they understand self-awareness.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:53.600
But lead researcher Tania Brouch believes that they don't fully pass because their society values being part of a larger social group rather than individuality.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.249
Self-Awareness might be a continuum, and not a hard-and-fast line, say animal researchers. So next time you're asking your mirror "Mirror,

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.250
who is the fairest?", just make sure that you give animals a fair

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.920
shake too.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.080
It's important to note

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.899
not all animals value sight as much as we do.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.860
Elephants in the wild will pass the mirror test only about half of the time

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.469
even though we believe they're self-aware. This may be because they use sound, touch and scent for identification

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.419
over sight. One thing is for sure, however, any videos of animals and babies seeing a reflection...

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.479
they're just golden! If you wanted to start a website where you could collect all of these mirror test videos, you could go over to

Domain.com and pick up "mirror.video" or "mirror.zone", "mirror.science", "mirrorcentral.com" or even "mirrortest.net".
