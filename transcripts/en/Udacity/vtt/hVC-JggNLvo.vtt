00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If you got this correct, then your histogram will look pretty much like this thing over here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
There's a big peak in the middle and very short people and very long people

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
are much less likely than medium-sized people.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm covering up the ranges because I'd like to ask you a question here,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but I will tell you that the one command that had to enter

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
was histplot with height as an argument, and if you play with it, you'll realize

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
you have to match the uppercases of the height, but you can plug it into histplot

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
just the same way we used data before. Let me ask you a quiz.
