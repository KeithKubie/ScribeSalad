00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.987
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now we want to solve for x. We learned last lesson that when two things were

00:00:04.987 --> 00:00:10.382
multiplied together to equal zero, one of them needs to equal zero. So either we

00:00:10.382 --> 00:00:15.466
need to have a value of x that will make this binomial equal to zero or we need

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:20.646
to have a value of x that will make this binomial equal zero. Which two values

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:22.925
of x then, satisfy this equation?
