00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.650
Meaning literally, “right traffic day,”
Dagen Högertrafik, or “Dagen H” (H day),

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.730
was the day in 1967 that the country of Sweden
managed to successfully switch from driving

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.850
on the left-hand side of the road to the right.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.220
Not a spur of the moment decision, the Högertrafikomläggningen
(“The right hand traffic diversion”) had

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.740
been planned for years prior to implementation,
in recognition of the inherent problems that

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.449
arose by the fact that among the nations of
Continental Europe, Sweden was the only country

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.550
where people still drove on the left.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.280
(If you’re curious why, see: Why Some Countries
Drive on the Right and Some Countries Drive

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.130
on the Left.)

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.970
In addition, the architects of the plan tapped
into the widespread perception that having

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.420
the steering wheel on the left while also
driving there caused more head-on collisions.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.610
Regardless, switching to the right was not
a popular idea among Swedes, and when the

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.480
idea was first floated in 1955, only 17% of
the populace approved the change.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.100
However, realizing that in the late 1960s
nearly 10,000,000 cars would cross Swedish

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.100
borders one way or another, and knowing that
that number was predicted to double by the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.780
early 1970s, Swedish leaders decided to make
the switch.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.229
Voting for the Statens Högertrafikkommission
(HTK) in 1963, the Swedish Riksdag instituted

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.740
a commission that established a four-year
program to make the change and educate the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.689
populace.

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.380
Consulting psychiatrists on how to get public
buy-in for the plan, the government sponsored

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.560
campaigns that placed the Dagen H logo on
everything from underwear (including advertising

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.509
with scantily clad models wearing said underwear)
to milk cartons.

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.700
They even sponsored a song contest where the
Telstars had the winner with Håll dig till

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.429
höger, Svensson (“keep to the right, Svensson.”)

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.729
The switch necessitated the replacement or
retrofitting of nearly every traffic light,

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.869
bus (the doors were switched to the right-hand
side), bus stop (which had to be moved across

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.939
the street), road line and headlamp.

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.299
At the time a trend had begun to arise to
have headlamps direct their light to be slightly

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.700
brighter on one side to illuminate the bordering
ditch or sidewalk side of the road better.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.350
The rising popularity of this increased the
pressure to make the switch sooner than later

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.030
as those who had these headlamps made for
left-hand driving, but driving on right hand

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.815
roads, would reportedly blind oncoming drivers
(with the extra light now shining directly

00:02:15.815 --> 00:02:16.815
into oncoming traffic instead of the side
of the road) and vice-versa as cars crossed

00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:17.815
the borders.

00:02:17.815 --> 00:02:22.150
The final cost of Dagen H has been estimated
at around £40 million in 1967 money or about

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.310
£648 million today.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.680
During the preparations for the single-day
switch, the new traffic lights were wrapped

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.239
in black plastic to keep from confusing drivers
before the big day, and the road lines, which

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.990
were painted white instead of the traditional
Swedish yellow, were covered in black tape.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.990
(One imagines it was a banner year for a certain
tape manufacturer.)

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.270
In addition, prior to H day 12,000,000 notes
were distributed to citizens, and 130,000

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.390
tilted H signs were deployed along Sweden’s
roads, to remind drivers of the switch.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.420
On Sunday, September 3, 1967, for most of
the country, all non-essential traffic was

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.799
banned from 1 to 6 a.m.

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.209
In these places, at 4:50 a.m., all vehicles
that were allowed to drive had to completely

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.190
stop, and then carefully change to the right-hand
side of the road.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.989
At precisely 5:00 a.m., traffic was allowed
to resume, at which time Swedish drivers experienced

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.329
what Time magazine called “a brief but monumental
traffic jam,” that happily resolved relatively

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.329
quickly.

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.550
In some of its largest towns, including Stockholm
and Malmö, the ban on non-essential traffic

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.700
began as early as 10 p.m. the night before,
and lasted until 4 p.m. that Sunday, in order

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.540
to give workers time to re-do the intersections.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.000
In total, about 8,000 officials and 150,0000
volunteers were deployed that weekend, either

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.640
to convert traffic signals and lines, keep
the peace, or to assist pedestrians at dangerous

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.640
intersections.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.609
Anxious to try out the latest thing, hundreds
of thousands of drivers poured onto Swedish

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.680
streets that Sunday once their ban had been
lifted.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.140
Surprisingly, there were only 157 accidents,
with only 32 causing any personal injuries,

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.250
and just “a handful of these were serious.”

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.920
The following Monday’s rush hour traffic
went relatively smoothly all things considered,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:04.299
and the 125 reported traffic accidents were
fewer than the typical daily number of 130-198.

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.780
Many believe that the combination of the perceived
risk with a lack of familiarity made motorists

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.799
more careful than they’d normally be.

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.420
(For similar reasons, pedestrians are actually
about 28% less likely to be hurt while crossing

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.920
a street if they illegally jaywalk, rather
than cross at a crosswalk that doesn’t include

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.530
any additional signals like traffic lights.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.340
The British, who also drove on the left (and
still do), observed the switch intently, although

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.500
they remained unconvinced that a similar change
would be in their best interests.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.620
According to some estimates, moving to the
right side in Britain at the time would have

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.400
cost nearly seven times what it cost Sweden,
and, whether accurately or not, experts anticipated

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.879
even more switch-induced accidents would occur.

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:46.819
In addition, they noted that many countries,
including Ireland, Malta and Cyprus, had their

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:50.810
own traffic eccentricities that worked just
fine, even with tourists.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.770
For instance, the people of Timor drive on
the right in East Timor

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.139
Many early cars had the driver’s seat in
the center of the car rather than on one side

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.139
or the other.

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.900
Gradually, car manufactures began putting
the seat on one side or the other.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.240
Some chose to put it on the side closest to
the curb so that people could more easily

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.580
avoid scraping buildings, curbs, etc.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.530
Other car manufactures would put it on the
opposing traffic side to help reduce car to

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.330
car collisions, which would tend to be more
deadly.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.179
Many early American motorized vehicles actually
placed the steering wheel on the right hand

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:25.139
side of the car, even though America used
the keep-right rule.

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.120
This practice finally was put to an end largely
due to Henry Ford; he preferred the left side

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.550
steering wheel so Ford cars featured this.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.660
Due to their popularity, this effectively
squashed the right hand steering wheel cars

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.199
in America.

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.050
According to research done in 1969 by J.J.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.740
Leeming, keep-left countries have a much lower
collision rate than keep-right countries.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.349
It is thought the reason behind this is that
most people’s right eye is their dominant

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:52.349
eye.

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:56.349
Thus, the right eye in keep-left traffic is
the one closest to oncoming traffic and so

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:57.720
should reduce collisions.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.979
Another theory as to why this might be is
that most people are right handed, so when

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:06.229
driving a manual transmission car in a keep-left
country, most people’s dominant hand is

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:25.200
on the steering wheel; this could help in
a person’s ability to maneuver accurately.
