doing two hands this it makes me work
full so that's the same with the call

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559
full so that's the same with the call
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.799

it's called project tango and it's been

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809
it's called project tango and it's been
 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.510
it's called project tango and it's been
out for a little while but they made

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
out for a little while but they made
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.400
out for a little while but they made
some adjustments for the sake of IO and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410
some adjustments for the sake of IO and
 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.860
some adjustments for the sake of IO and
it's a tablet it looks like a regular

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
it's a tablet it looks like a regular
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.299
it's a tablet it looks like a regular
tablet but what it actually has the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309
tablet but what it actually has the
 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.149
tablet but what it actually has the
ability to do is to map 3d space in real

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
ability to do is to map 3d space in real
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.969
ability to do is to map 3d space in real
time so if you think of like VR

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
time so if you think of like VR
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.100
time so if you think of like VR
generally you put on a VR headset and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110
generally you put on a VR headset and
 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.170
generally you put on a VR headset and
you're in whatever universe they want to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
you're in whatever universe they want to
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.080
you're in whatever universe they want to
put you in this one is looking at the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
put you in this one is looking at the
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.179
put you in this one is looking at the
actual thing so interacting with objects

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189
actual thing so interacting with objects
 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.679
actual thing so interacting with objects
is something you can still do even

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689
is something you can still do even
 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.520
is something you can still do even
though you're looking at a digital

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530
though you're looking at a digital
 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.520
though you're looking at a digital
representation of it I'm saying sounds

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530
representation of it I'm saying sounds
 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.160
representation of it I'm saying sounds
sounds weird but like a couch is still a

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
sounds weird but like a couch is still a
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.810
sounds weird but like a couch is still a
couch so you could you could like almost

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
couch so you could you could like almost
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.160
couch so you could you could like almost
stylize let's say you put like an

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
stylize let's say you put like an
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.859
stylize let's say you put like an
alligator on the couch next to you for

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
alligator on the couch next to you for
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.130
alligator on the couch next to you for
example like a completely active

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140
example like a completely active
 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.210
example like a completely active
scenario that you can interact with

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
scenario that you can interact with
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.289
scenario that you can interact with
physically and on top of that they have

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299
physically and on top of that they have
 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.359
physically and on top of that they have
the other use case scenario that I think

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
the other use case scenario that I think
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.370
the other use case scenario that I think
they're talking about is like in mapping

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
they're talking about is like in mapping
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.170
they're talking about is like in mapping
projects mapping internal spaces and

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180
projects mapping internal spaces and
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.880
projects mapping internal spaces and
things like that but it's in a developer

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
things like that but it's in a developer
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.069
things like that but it's in a developer
mode right now so you can either hold it

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079
mode right now so you can either hold it
 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.530
mode right now so you can either hold it
up and do it like that normally and they

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540
up and do it like that normally and they
 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.999
up and do it like that normally and they
also build like a actual physical

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
also build like a actual physical
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.420
also build like a actual physical
headset for Toby wicked for green-screen

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430
headset for Toby wicked for green-screen
 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.920
headset for Toby wicked for green-screen
GPS where you could actually have GPS

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930
GPS where you could actually have GPS
 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.480
GPS where you could actually have GPS
and like oh so you're going in between

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490
and like oh so you're going in between
 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.719
and like oh so you're going in between
but the main one of the main

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729
but the main one of the main
 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.639
but the main one of the main
propositions is for robotics because

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649
propositions is for robotics because
 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.040
propositions is for robotics because
right now robots don't see very well and

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
right now robots don't see very well and
 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.990
right now robots don't see very well and
this would essentially give robots the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000
this would essentially give robots the
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.510
this would essentially give robots the
ability

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520
ability
 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.780
ability
to see time and space similar is this

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790
to see time and space similar is this
 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.820
to see time and space similar is this
whole thing flying everywhere oh right

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830
whole thing flying everywhere oh right
 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.580

through that right into the back hope it

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590
through that right into the back hope it
 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.620
through that right into the back hope it
is happy I'm I'm worried it's is gonna

don't know you talking about 280 per

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060
don't know you talking about 280 per
 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.360
don't know you talking about 280 per
second so it's just it just kind of blow

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370
