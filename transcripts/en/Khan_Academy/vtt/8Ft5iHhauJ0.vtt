00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.400
Let's now see if we can
divide into larger numbers.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.660
And just as a starting point,
in order to divide into larger

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.920
numbers, you at least need to
know your multiplication tables

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.950
from the 1-multiplication
tables all the way to, at

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.540
least, the 10-multiplication.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.080
So all the way up to 10 times
10, which you know is 100.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.270
And then, starting at 1 times 1
and going up to 2 times 3, all

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.320
the way up to 10 times 10.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.350
And, at least when I was
in school, we learned

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.340
through 12 times 12.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.100
But 10 times 10 will
probably do the trick.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.770
And that's really just
the starting point.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.550
Because to do multiplication
problems like this, for

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.150
example, or division
problems like this.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.640
Let's say I'm taking 25 and
I want to divide it by 5.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.980
So I could draw 25 objects and
then divide them into groups of

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.050
5 or divide them into 5 groups
and see how many elements

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.590
are in each group.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.900
But the quick way to do is
just to think about, well

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.930
5 times what is 25, right?

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.100
5 times question mark
is equal to 25.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.860
And if you know your
multiplication tables,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.070
especially your
5-multiplication tables,

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.280
you know that 5 times 5
is equal to 25.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.480
So something like this, you'll
immediately just be able to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.230
say, because of your knowledge
of multiplication, that 5

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.840
goes into 25 five times.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.320
And you'd write the
5 right there.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.580
Not over the 2, because you
still want to be careful

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.040
of the place notation.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.650
You want to write the
5 in the ones place.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.480
It goes into it 5 ones times,
or exactly five times.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.190
And the same thing.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.770
If I said 7 goes into 49.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.250
That's how many times?

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.910
Well you say, that's like
saying 7 times what-- you could

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.850
even, instead of a question
mark, you could put a blank

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.130
there --7 times what
is equal to 49?

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.760
And if you know your
multiplication tables, you know

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.090
that 7 times 7 is equal to 49.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.160
All the examples I've
done so far is a number

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.150
multiplied by itself.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.030
Let me do another example.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.840
Let me do 9 goes into
54 how many times?

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.840
Once again, you need to
know your multiplication

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.100
tables to do this.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.290
9 times what is equal to 54?

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.966
And sometimes, even if you
don't have it memorized, you

00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:14.720
could say 9 times 5 is 45.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.470
And 9 times 6 would be 9 more
than that, so that would be 54.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.380
So 9 goes into 54 six times.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.390
So just as a starting point,
you need to have your

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.930
multiplication tables from 1
times 1 all the way up the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.250
10 times 10 memorized.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.320
In order to be able to do at
least some of these more basic

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.700
problems relatively quickly.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.060
Now, with that out of the way,
let's try to do some problems

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.600
that's might not fit
completely cleanly into your

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.990
multiplication tables.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.190
So let's say I want to
divide-- I am looking

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.800
to divide 3 into 43.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.440
And, once again, this is larger
than 3 times 10 or 3 times 12.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.930
Actually, look.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.950
Well, let me do
another problem.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.260
Let me do 3 into 23.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.150
And, if you know your 3-times
tables, you realize that

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.060
there's 3 times nothing
is exactly 23.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.910
I'll do it right now.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.280
3 times 1 is 3.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.690
3 times 2 is 6.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.870
Let me just write them all out.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:24.690
3 times 3 is 9, 12, 15,
18, 21, 24, right?

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.700
There's no 23 in the
multiples of 3.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.700
So how do you do this
division problem?

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.880
Well what you do is you think
of what is the largest multiple

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.440
of 3 that does go into 23?

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.640
And that's 21.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.170
And 3 goes into 21
how many times?

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.150
Well you know that 3
times 7 is equal to 21.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.520
So you say, well 3 will
go into 23 seven times.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.570
But it doesn't go into
it cleanly because

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.850
7 times 3 is 21.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.750
So there's a
remainder left over.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.170
So if you take 23 minus 21,
you have a remainder of 2.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:08.010
So you could write that 23
divided by 3 is equal to 7

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.780
remainder-- maybe I'll just,
well, write the whole

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.010
word out --remainder 2.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.050
So it doesn't have to go
in completely cleanly.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.790
And, in the future, we'll learn
about decimals and fractions.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.470
But for now, you just say, well
it goes in cleanly 7 times,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.290
but that only gets us to 21.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.110
But then there's 2 left over.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.830
So you can even work with the
division problems where it's

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.940
not exactly a multiple of the
number that you're dividing

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.310
into the larger number.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.720
But let's do some practice
with even larger numbers.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.520
And I think you'll
see a pattern here.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.720
So let's do 4 going into--
I'm going to pick a pretty

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.800
large number here --344.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.340
And, immediately when you see
that you might say, hey Sal, I

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.850
know up to 4 times
10 or 4 times 12.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.850
4 times 12 is 48.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.340
This is a much larger number.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.690
This is way out of bounds
of what I know in my

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.420
4-multiplication tables.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.610
And what I'm going to show you
right now is a way of doing

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.910
this just knowing your
4-multiplication tables.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.920
So what you do is you
say 4 goes into this

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.800
3 how many times?

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.910
And you're actually saying
4 goes into this 3 how

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.430
many hundred times?

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.590
So this is-- Because
this is 300, right?

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.880
This is 344.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.180
But 4 goes into 3 no hundred
times, or 4 goes into-- I guess

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.810
the best way to think of
it --4 goes 3 0 times.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.470
So you can just move on.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.260
4 goes into 34.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.460
So now we're going
to focus on the 34.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.900
So 4 goes into 34
how many times?

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.900
And here we can use our
4-multiplication tables.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.950
4-- Let's see, 4 times
8 is equal to 32.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.210
4 times 9 is equal to 36.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.630
So 4 goes into 34-- 30-- 9
is too many times, right?

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.500
36 is larger than 34.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.740
So 4 goes into 34 eight times.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.000
There's going to be a
little bit left over.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.050
4 goes in the 34 eights times.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.860
So let's figure out
what's left over.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.000
And really we're saying 4 goes
into 340 how many ten times?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.800
We're actually saying 4 goes
into 340 eighty times.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.040
Because notice we wrote
this 8 in the tens place.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.020
But just for our ability to do
this problem quickly, you just

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.400
say 4 goes into 34 eight times,
but make sure you write the 8

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.770
in the tens place right there.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.100
8 times 4.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.970
We already know what that is.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.140
8 times 4 is 32.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.290
And then we figure
out the remainder.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.160
34 minus 32.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.400
Well, 4 minus 2 is 2.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.030
And then these 3's cancel out.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.300
So you're just left with a 2.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.120
But notice we're in the
tens column, right?

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.710
This whole column right here,
that's the tens column.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:55.120
So really what we said is 4
goes into 340 eighty times.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.350
80 times 4 is 320, right?

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.850
Because I wrote the 3 in
the hundreds column.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.000
And then there is-- and I don't
want to make this look like a--

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.320
I don't want to make this look
like a-- Let me clean

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.110
this up a little bit.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.010
I didn't want to make that line
there look like a-- when I was

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.510
dividing the columns
--to look like a 1.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.380
But then there's a remainder
of 2, but I wrote the

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.270
2 in the tens place.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.740
So it's actually a
remainder of 20.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.990
But let me bring down this 4.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.660
Because I didn't want to
just divide into 340.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.290
I divided into 344.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.290
So you bring down the 4.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.440
Let me switch colors.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.670
And then-- So another
way to think about it.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:31.250
We just said that 4 goes into
344 eighty times, right?

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.050
We wrote the 8 in
the tens place.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.550
And then 8 times 4 is 320.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.170
The remainder is now 24.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.800
So how many times
does 4 go into 24?

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.620
Well we know that.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.000
4 times 6 is equal to 24.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.090
So 4 goes into 24 six times.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.550
And we put that in
the ones place.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.480
6 times 4 is 24.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.560
And then we subtract.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.270
24 minus 24.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.490
That's-- We subtract at
that stage, either case.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.530
And we get 0.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.050
So there's no remainder.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:05.850
So 4 goes into 344 exactly
eighty-six times.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.180
So if your took 344 objects and
divided them into groups of

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.900
4, you would get 86 groups.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.950
Or if you divided them
into groups of 86, you

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:13.880
would get 4 groups.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.640
Let's do a couple
more problems.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.440
I think you're getting
the hang of it.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.180
Let me do 7-- I'll
do a simple one.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.790
7 goes into 91.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.710
So once again, well, this is
beyond 7 times 12, which

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.340
is 84, which you know from
our multiplication tables.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.650
So we use the same system we
did in the last problem.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.750
7 goes into 9 how many times?

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.220
7 goes into 9 one time.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.640
1 times 7 is 7.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.330
And you have 9 minus 7 is 2.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.190
And then you bring down the 1.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.770
21.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.590
And remember, this might seem
like magic, but what we really

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:58.530
said was 7 goes into 90 ten
times-- 10 because we wrote the

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.840
1 in the tens place --10
times 7 is 70, right?

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.000
You can almost put a
0 there if you like.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.410
And 90 with the remainder--
And 91 minus 70 is 21.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.640
So 7 goes into 91 ten
times remainder 21.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.780
And then you say 7 goes into
21-- Well you know that.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.590
7 times 3 is 21.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.170
So 7 goes into 21 three times.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.710
3 times 7 is 21.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.550
You subtract these
from each other.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.340
Remainder 0.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:32.000
So 91 divided by 7
is equal to 13.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.640
Let's do another one.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.940
And I won't take that little
break to explain the

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.860
places and all of that.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.800
I think you understand that.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.800
I want, at least, you to get
the process down really

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.580
really well in this video.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.990
So let's do 7-- I keep
using the number 7.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.510
Let me do a different number.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:56.560
Let me do 8 goes into
608 how many times?

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.440
So I go 8 goes into
6 how many times?

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.740
It goes into it 0 time.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.980
So let me keep moving.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.360
8 goes into 60 how many times?

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.820
Let me write down the 8.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.110
Let me draw a line here so
we don't get confused.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.340
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.760
I need some space
above the number.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.580
So 8 goes into 60
how many times?

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.590
We know that 8 times
7 is equal to 56.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.330
And that 8 times 8
is equal to 64.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.640
So 8 goes into-- 64 is too big.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.770
So it's not this one.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:30.000
So 8 goes into 60 seven times.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.540
And there's going to be
a little bit left over.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.600
So 8 goes into 60 seven times.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.790
Since we're doing the whole 60,
we put the 7 above the ones

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:41.030
place in the 60, which is the
tens place in the whole thing.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.970
7 times 8, we know, is 56.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.100
60 minus 56.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.030
That's 4.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.990
We could do that in our heads.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.270
Or if we wanted, we can borrow.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.510
That be a 10.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.380
That would be a 5.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.890
10 minus 6 is 4.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.130
Then you bring down this 8.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.750
8 goes into 48 how many times?

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.260
Well what's 8 times 6?

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.210
Well, 8 times 6 is exactly 48.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:13.170
So 8 times-- 8 goes
into 48 six times.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:17.180
6 times 8 is 48.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.180
And you subtract.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.500
We subtracted up here as well.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.020
48 minus 48 is 0.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.260
So, once again, we get
a remainder of 0.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.660
So hopefully, that gives you
the hang of how to do these

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.790
larger division problems.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.150
And all we really need to know
to be able to do these, to

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.780
tackle these, is our
multiplication tables up to

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.150
maybe 10 times 10
or 12 times 12.
