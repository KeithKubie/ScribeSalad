00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.060
So far we've learned what a
complex number is; we've even

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.060
learned how to graph it.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.170
And we learned how to add,
subtract, and multiply it.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.640
Where I left off in the last
video was, how do we divide

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.190
two complex numbers.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.110
So I said, let's say I have
one complex numbers, z1.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.550
And that equals a plus b i.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.970
i.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.150
And I want to
divide that by z2.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.980
Which is, c plus d i.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.510
So let me ask you a question.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.390
And I touched on this
in the last video.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.030
And let me do it in a
different color over here.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.800
We know that a plus b times
a minus b is equal to a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.090
squared minus b squared.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.400
And you can multiply it out,
in case you're not sure.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.760
Remember, it's just a times
a plus b times a minus

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.550
a times b, plus a times
a, and you'll get this.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.910
But you know how to
do this, anyway.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.010
There's a review of it,
if you need to do it.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.690
So, given that,
what is c plus d?

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.160
What happens if we do
something very similar

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.670
with a complex number?

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:20.450
If we say c plus d i
times c minus d i.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.730
Well, in this case a is c.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.210
And b is d i, right?

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.560
So this is just going to
be equal to c squared

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.290
minus d i squared.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.970
d i squared.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:44.210
And that equals c squared
minus d squared i squared.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.280
And that equals c squared
minus d squared.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.070
And i squared is
negative 1, right?

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.870
So this is going to be
multiplied by negative 1, so

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.160
it cancels out this negative.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.150
So you get c squared
plus d squared.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.510
That's interesting.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.350
When I multiply a complex
number times this other number,

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.270
which is very similar to it,
but it's kind of the imaginary

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.390
part, goes in the
other direction.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.520
When I multiply the two, I get
a completely real number.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.600
All of the i's disappear.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.520
And, in general, this number --
if we call this -- well, in our

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:28.350
example this was z2, so if we
say that z2 equals c plus d i,

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.670
the quantity c minus d i
is called its conjugate.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.330
And that's just good
terminology to know.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.560
And the sign for conjugate
is that line over the top.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.850
So the conjugate of
z2 is c minus d i.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.840
Or you could say, the
conjugate of c minus d i

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.610
is equal to c plus d i.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.830
Or you could say it
the other way around.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.030
The conjugate of c plus d i
is equal to c minus d i.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.260
And notice, we're just
switching the direction in

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.130
the imaginary -- along the
imaginary axis, when we take

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.520
the conjugate of something.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.710
With that said, let me
erase that and go back

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.700
to our original problem.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.010
Because the conjugate is
the tool we're going

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.050
to use to divide this.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.820
So we know when we multiply an
imaginary number times its

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.010
conjugate, we get
a real number.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.210
And we know, also, if we
multiply -- we can multiply

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.800
anything by 1, and we
get the same number.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.380
So let's multiply the numerator
and denominator of this

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.630
expression by the conjugate
of the denominator.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.630
So let me do that.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.705
So the conjugate of the
denominator is going

00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:46.560
to be c minus d i.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.260
So c minus d i
over c minus d i.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.800
So this was c plud d i, so
this is its conjugate.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.020
And so what do we get?

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.730
So in the numerator, we get a c
-- I don't want to run out of

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:09.890
space, I always do -- a c, so a
times c, minus a d i, minus a d

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.950
i -- these i's are looking
funny -- this is an i.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:23.080
Plus b c i; plus b c i.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.820
And then the last term, we
have a plus b minus b.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.450
So it's minus b d i squared.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.580
Minus b d i squared.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.150
All of that.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.890
And this is a plus
b times a minus b.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.250
So it's equal to a
squared minus b squared.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.690
So this is going to be equal to
-- and it this will become

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.425
second nature to you after a
while, but you might want

00:04:46.425 --> 00:04:48.110
to just multiply it out.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.470
This equals c squared
plus d squared.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.480
And don't take my word for it.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.300
Actually, algebraically,
multiply this out and just

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.330
realize you can only add real
parts to real parts and

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.820
imaginary parts to
imaginary parts.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.500
So let me simplify that.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.400
That equals -- let's
see, the real parts.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.390
This is real, a c.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.540
And this is minus
b d i squared.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.870
So the i squared is minus 1.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.480
So it switches the sign here,
so it becomes plus b d.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.050
And we can get rid of d i.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.050
So the real parts
are, a c plus b d.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.610
That's that, and that.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.920
And then the imaginary parts
are plus -- this one's

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:39.410
positive, so I'll put one first
-- b c minus a d i, all of that

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.680
over c squared plus d squared.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.770
And that still might not look
like a complex number to you.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.190
But then we can separate them
out and we could say well,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:56.530
that equals a c plus b d over
c squared plus d squared.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.630
And that's the real part.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:07.720
Plus b c minus a d over c
squared plus d squared.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.360
And that times i, and
that's the imaginary part.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.430
So you can't merge, when you're
adding and subtracting, the

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.920
real part to the
imaginary part.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.300
But you can most definitely
scale an imaginary

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.410
number by a real number.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.380
And that's essentially
what we're doing.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.240
We're multiplying 1
over c squared plus d

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.900
squared times this.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.820
So, division might seem a
little complicated when I

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.610
write it all in variables.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.080
But let me give you an example
and you will hopefully see that

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.570
it -- with real numbers, and
-- not real numbers, with

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.930
actual numbers, I should be
careful with what I say.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.680
Let's say I have 1 plus 2 i.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.436
And I want to divide that by, I
don't know, let's divide it by,

00:06:48.436 --> 00:06:51.200
I'm going to pick
a random number.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.530
2 plus 3i.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:55.440
And so what do we do?

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.350
We multiply it times the
conjugate of the denominator.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.730
2 minus 3i over --
over itself, right?

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.060
Because then we're not
changing the number.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.300
This is just 1, this
simplifies to 1.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.540
It equals -- the bottom,
we can multiply it out.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.080
But hopefully it's
second nature to you.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.090
It equals 4 plus 9, right?

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.830
Because that's just a
squared plus b squared.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.490
Right?

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.730
Well, I mean, it's a squared
minus b squared, but then the

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.100
i's, when you multiply, and it
becomes a negative number.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.010
Try it out if you
don't believe me.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.140
And then the top, we
get 1 times 2 is 2.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.500
1 times minus 3i is minus 3i.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:42.100
And you have 2i times
2, which is plus 4i.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.160
And then you have
2i times minus 3i.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.070
So that's minus 6.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.700
Minus 6i squared.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.950
Well, what does i
squared equal?

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.600
That equals negative 1.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.900
So negative 1 times negative 6.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.610
Get rid of the i squared and
this becomes a positive.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.900
So then, what are
our real parts?

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.990
Our real parts are 2 and 6.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:07.240
so 2 plus 6 is 8.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.510
And what are our
imaginary parts?

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.300
Minus 3i plus 4i.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.180
So that's just plus 1i, right?

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.430
Minus 3 plus 4 is positive 1.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.710
So it's just plus 1i.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.800
Over 13.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.170
Or we could write that as -- if
we wanted to write that in the

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:30.420
traditional complex form --
is 8/13 plus 1 over 13i.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.740
So when I divided one complex
number by another, I got

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.080
another complex number.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.280
And an interesting exercise
for you to do is, pick some

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.840
random complex numbers.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.490
Plot them out on complex plane,
and see what happens when you

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.570
multiply them, when you divide
them, when you add them,

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.680
when you subtract them.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.490
And when you scale them.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:49.910
Or when you take the conjugate.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.990
And that'll give you a better
intuition of what's going

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.310
on with these numbers.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:57.410
Anyway, I will see you
in the next video.
