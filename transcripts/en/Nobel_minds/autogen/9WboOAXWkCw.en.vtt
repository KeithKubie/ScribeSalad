hi my name is Tom and I'm 18 and I'm

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979
hi my name is Tom and I'm 18 and I'm
 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.649
hi my name is Tom and I'm 18 and I'm
studying further maths and i was

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659
studying further maths and i was
 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.720
studying further maths and i was
wondering with a discovery of the

wondering with a discovery of the
 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.179
wondering with a discovery of the
breakdown of matter antimatter symmetry

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189
breakdown of matter antimatter symmetry
 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.330
breakdown of matter antimatter symmetry

your study of the early universe hi Tom

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670
your study of the early universe hi Tom
 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.670
your study of the early universe hi Tom
your question about the breakdown of the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680
your question about the breakdown of the
 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.109
your question about the breakdown of the
symmetry between matter and antimatter

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119
symmetry between matter and antimatter
 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.730
symmetry between matter and antimatter
is one of the toughest questions of

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740
is one of the toughest questions of
 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.130
is one of the toughest questions of
modern science astronomers can tell you

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140
modern science astronomers can tell you
 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.960
modern science astronomers can tell you
that the universe does not have anti

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970
that the universe does not have anti
 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.269
that the universe does not have anti
galaxies we would know if there were

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279
galaxies we would know if there were
 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.769
galaxies we would know if there were
anti galaxies out there because they

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779
anti galaxies out there because they
 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.179
anti galaxies out there because they
would be boundaries between the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189
would be boundaries between the
 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.650
would be boundaries between the
antimatter regions and the ordinary

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
antimatter regions and the ordinary
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.410
antimatter regions and the ordinary
matter regions so we know from astronomy

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
matter regions so we know from astronomy
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.660
matter regions so we know from astronomy
that there is a somehow a fundamental

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670
that there is a somehow a fundamental
 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.150
that there is a somehow a fundamental
difference between matter and antimatter

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160
difference between matter and antimatter
 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.340
difference between matter and antimatter
nevertheless the particle scientists

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
nevertheless the particle scientists
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.660
nevertheless the particle scientists
have been studying this for a long time

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
have been studying this for a long time
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.760
have been studying this for a long time
and we can't really tell what is the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
and we can't really tell what is the
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.130
and we can't really tell what is the
difference between matter and antimatter

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140
difference between matter and antimatter
 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.810
difference between matter and antimatter
so they look like they're just exact

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820
so they look like they're just exact
 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.209
so they look like they're just exact
opposites and and they ought to behave

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219
opposites and and they ought to behave
 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.549
opposites and and they ought to behave
the same so the big mystery is why did

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
the same so the big mystery is why did
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.860
the same so the big mystery is why did
the universe in the Big Bang or whatever

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870
the universe in the Big Bang or whatever
 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.630
the universe in the Big Bang or whatever
started this whole expansion that we're

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640
started this whole expansion that we're
 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.599
started this whole expansion that we're
in why did it give us only matter so

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609
in why did it give us only matter so
 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.430
in why did it give us only matter so
we're looking for the fundamental reason

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440
we're looking for the fundamental reason
 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.770
we're looking for the fundamental reason
for asymmetry and we certainly hoping

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
for asymmetry and we certainly hoping
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.390
for asymmetry and we certainly hoping
that the Large Hadron Collider will help

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400
that the Large Hadron Collider will help
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.609
that the Large Hadron Collider will help
us understand that by revealing some

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
us understand that by revealing some
 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.679
us understand that by revealing some
small difference between particles and

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689
small difference between particles and
 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.110
small difference between particles and
their antiparticles
