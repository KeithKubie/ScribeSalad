00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.200
Some of what we want deep down in our primitive unconscious threatens to be pretty dark

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.549
We may want to do no work, to steal, to injure others, to give way to despair

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.000
Or to have sex in very taboo and damaging ways

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.920
yet most of us do very little of this. In fact we often pour our energies into

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.049
worthwhile projects and go out of our way to try to be good and helpful to those around us.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.540
That we're able to do this fascinated the founder of psychoanalysis,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.940
Sigmund Freud, who gave a special word to this ability to put our primitive,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.070
egoistic, destructive energies to good use. He called the process sublimation in German

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.800
Sublimierung

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.930
It was an idea that came to freud while he was reading a well-known and charming travel book, The Harz Journey, by the 19th century

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.799
Poet Heinrich Heine. In it Heine mentioned meeting a legendary German surgeon called Johann Friedrich Deffenbaugh,

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:06.118
who'd been extremely selfish and sadistic as a boy, loving to cut off the tails of stray dogs for sheer twisted pleasure.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:13.589
But then, as an adult, had matured into a profoundly selfless and brilliant surgeon, who'd made some pioneering

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.610
discoveries in the fields of

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.610
reconstructive and plastic surgery.

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:25.739
Freud felt that this evolution, from a person who had sadistically used a knife to wound, to one who had nobly used it to mend,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.209
could not have been a mere coincidence and proposed that what was at play

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.060
belong to a widespread pattern of behavior,

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.079
whereby an early harmful or shocking drive gives rise to precisely its opposite, with the strength of the negative

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.329
determining the power of the positive.

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.859
Freud felt that this desire for compensation lays at the heart of many of the greatest achievements in the arts, politics and science.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.809
So, a great police detective might at an unconscious level, be defending themselves

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.049
against certain of their own illegal wishes, and a politician committed to the plight of the poor might be

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.898
sublimating an early experience of raging greed.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.599
In an essay on Leonardo da Vinci

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:15.419
Freud presented the claim that da Vinci had been an extremely sexually active child, who had then

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.669
sublimated his sexuality into scientific research and art. As Freud put it

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.229
a forbidden desire for sexual pleasure, in this case for his mother, and then other boys

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.349
had turned in da Vinci into a hugely honorable and powerful general urge to know

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.529
The theory of sublimation is so hopeful because there's so much about what we all want that proves impossible

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.929
while there would be infinite reasons for anger and sterile nihilism, Freud notes our capacity to seek compensation and

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.370
alternative fulfillments.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.769
Repeatedly in his work, Freud stressed a fact, which though it sounds absurdly obvious,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.450
we nevertheless usually fail to give enough weight to -  that all of us started out as babies. In that state

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.909
we wanted only immediate pleasure and satisfaction.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:10.888
Our drives in their initial forms, which are things that couldn't work out for us and that had to be painfully surrendered,

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.089
we believe that if we didn't get all we wanted at once it would be a catastrophe

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.939
And we would die. This kind of thinking explains the shrieking and wailing of infants in a tantrum.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.789
We thought the world revolved just around us

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.470
and we couldn't be generous to others, and yet most of us turned into healthy adults

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.639
by managing to substitute our original narcissistic aims for more ethical and fruitful alternatives.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.790
Freud added soberly that we're never quite done with sublimation. We continue to be frustrated in what we really want, most often around sex,

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:51.478
continually we encounter people we'd love to sleep with but mustn't and yet rather than this energy going nowhere

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.018
we have an ability to use our frustration to power other things

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.419
creative endeavors, scientific breakthroughs, care for the vulnerable. In Freud's eyes

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.639
disappointment is inevitable. Our longings will systematically outrun reality,

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.749
but sublimation remains the one hugely helpful option for us:

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.499
under it's guidance, envy can turn into effort, wounded egoism into a capacity for gratitude and appreciation,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.420
sexual rejection into a film or a novel. As

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:28.080
Freud saw it, psychoanalysis is the field designed to help us discover how we can use our disappointments more productively,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.480
how we can grow up to be not embittered or shut down, but paradoxically,

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.480
energized by some of our greatest underlying sorrows.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.560
The good life isn't one where we get exactly what we want,

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.099
it's one where we find fulfilling second bests and where we have the inner freedom to redirect our

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:54.420
disappointments with maximal imagination, a life where we've learned, as Freud tried to show us, to sublimate well.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.900
