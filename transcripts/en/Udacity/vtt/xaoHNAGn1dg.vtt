00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.912
So, market size doesn’t need to be a four-page

00:00:01.912 --> 00:00:03.913
business school analysis. So if you went to

00:00:03.913 --> 00:00:06.129
business school, feel free to do the analysis.

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:08.780
But it really is at first a back of the envelope

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.193
calculation. Is this business worth doing?

00:00:12.193 --> 00:00:14.144
So we just kind of have you constantly

00:00:14.144 --> 00:00:16.129
checking about three things. And let’s take

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.695
a look at the Jersey Square team and think

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:20.995
about how they approach this. If you

00:00:20.995 --> 00:00:22.760
remember we asked you to talk about the

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.860
total available market or total addressable

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.389
market, which really is a fancy word to say

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:30.337
how big is the universe of everybody

00:00:30.337 --> 00:00:32.723
potentially who could use the product. And

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:34.820
in this case they say well, even in the United

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.906
States there are 150 Americans who watch

00:00:36.906 --> 00:00:39.337
the five major team sports in some capacity.

00:00:39.337 --> 00:00:42.373
Okay, well, can we sell to 150 million people?

00:00:42.373 --> 00:00:46.091
Not really, because the next thing we want to

00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:48.256
look at is, what we call the served available

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:50.375
market. How many can I reach with my sales channel?

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:52.295
So, let’s see how the Jersey Square team

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:54.229
looked at the served available market.

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:56.268
They said in the New York Metro area,

00:00:56.268 --> 00:00:58.518
there were 11 million people who watch

00:00:58.518 --> 00:01:02.134
the five major sports teams in some capacity.

00:01:02.134 --> 00:01:04.382
What they really should have done is, said

00:01:04.382 --> 00:01:06.349
that, but then said how many of them have

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:08.850
a web browser and how many of them will

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.583
we actually be able to reach within some

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:14.550
period of time and with some semblance of

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.297
cash. And the next thing they were looking

00:01:17.297 --> 00:01:19.585
at was their target market. Who will be

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:21.799
their most likely buyers?

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.403
And they did some research at Yankee

00:01:23.403 --> 00:01:27.250
Stadium and said 11% or 12% of the served

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.600
available market showed strong interest and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.934
they said well that means just in the New

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:34.565
York area 1.3 million people should be

00:01:34.565 --> 00:01:37.149
interested in a subscription or rental. Really,

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.033
again if they were doing analysis for real,

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:41.115
they should have said, but how many of

00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:42.759
them can we reach with a web browser

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.724
and then how many of them can we actually

00:01:44.724 --> 00:01:47.366
get with our acquisition and activation

00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:49.214
campaign. And what falls out of this,

00:01:49.214 --> 00:01:51.166
if you actually take it to the next level,

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:54.182
is what’s a reasonable assumption of

00:01:54.182 --> 00:01:56.200
year 1, 2 and 3 revenue? Just back of

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.035
the envelope.

00:01:57.035 --> 00:01:59.564
Okay. So these are the people, gee, subscription

00:01:59.564 --> 00:02:02.467
and half pay rental, let’s do some math. My

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:04.751
first year’s revenue should be $300 million.

00:02:04.751 --> 00:02:07.441
No, I think I am being a little too optimistic.

00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:08.828
At least you will start with a series of

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:10.336
calculation that you could bounce off

00:02:10.336 --> 00:02:13.085
advisors and friends and cofounders and

00:02:13.085 --> 00:02:14.985
say, you know, are we even in the

00:02:14.985 --> 00:02:17.384
ballpark of making an interesting business.

00:02:17.384 --> 00:02:18.949
One of the things to keep in mind is that

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.937
no startup has ever exceeded their optimistic

00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:23.893
estimates of market size. So if your numbers

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:26.625
are coming in too low on potential customers,

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:28.625
I wouldn’t give up, I would just be going

00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:31.175
back and looking at the customer segments

00:02:31.175 --> 00:02:33.160
you are targeting and understand whether

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.341
you want to build the business or have a hobby.
