00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.940
The pocket-size computers we call smartphones
are probably the single greatest invention

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.400
of my life, but are they going to make me
dumber????

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:14.730
… Hang on, I'll google it and find out.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.160
phone addicts [[greet and welcome]]
We use our cell phones for everything.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.390
They’re increasingly becoming extensions
of our brains; they're a place to store information

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.589
you don't want to have to remember.

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.050
In 2002, the Nobel Prize for Economics went
to a Psychologist for a paper describing the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.559
two kinds of thinkers in this world, analytical
and intuitive; and now a new study from Computers

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.120
in Human Behavior says our tendency to rely
on our smartphones might be screwing over

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.899
the intuitive thinkers among us…

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.129
Intuitive thinkers rely on gut feelings or
intuition to make a decision; while analytical

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.410
thinkers, analyze the problem, second-guess
themselves and THINK through the decision

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.410
first.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.700
According to this new study, intuitive thinkers
tend to use search engines rather than their

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.800
own brainpower, they look up information they
already KNOW to avoid thinking about it, even

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.800
briefly.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.321
For example: when asked what actor was in
that one movie, intuitive thinkers would either

00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:14.510
immediately search for it, analytical would
search their memories for what they know.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.910
There are advantages to both types of thinking…
but this new research says the intuitive people

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.040
using their search functions more might be
less intelligent!

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.370
They tested 660 participants and gave them
intuitive and analytical tasks to complete,

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.080
and allowed them to use their cell phones.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.690
Heavy smartphone use was associated with lowered
intelligence, in their results.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.990
They called them lazy thinkers.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.220
Lazy thinking, cognitive easing or being a
cognitive miser, is incredibly common.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.690
It essentially describes our disinterest in
the effort of thinking.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.380
We want to believe we the great human is constantly
churning through information, but we're animals,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.720
and thinking burns energy.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.820
Too save that energy, we take mental shortcuts
and offload information,.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.430
It's an evolutionary way to conserve resources.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.890
THINKING IS HARD.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.510
This is known, human brains only have so much
power, and thinking takes a lot of it, popular

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.549
websites design themselves to be intuitive,
to reduce the "cognitive load," allowing you

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.280
to enjoy their content and spend more time.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.560
The problem is, our brains are plastic -- or
moldable.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.340
As we learn things, our brain changes.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.780
We create new neural pathways and reshape
our thinking processes.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.379
As we age, our neuroplasticity gets worse.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.830
Ideally, we'd fill our lives with varied and
colorful experiences -- not just like vacations

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.519
and social activities, but building, learning,
working, running, and playing too!

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.650
These make our brain better, and create a
better foundation for aging.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.260
Processing all this information elsewhere,
on the other hand, might have adverse consequences

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.260
for aging.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.020
Think about what that could mean...

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.400
NO, ACTUALLY THINK!

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.840
I'm not going to tell you…

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.180
(ugh) FINE.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.999
Think Alzheimer's or other brain degradation
disorders, forgetfulness and the inability

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:59.030
to recall information.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.940
That's bad.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.060
Whether our brains are getting worse because
of the Internet or Video Games is as old as

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.510
the technology themselves, and it's same debate
for television and radio; but our tendency

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.739
to avoid THINKING is a different facet.

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.709
It's like cheating on every test in school.

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.469
If you got all the answers from someone else,
what could you DO when you graduated?

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:22.819
Other than go get answers from someone else?

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.150
It's compelling to think about!

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.969
Do you think cell phones are affecting our
thinking?

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:29.489
Would you rather search than think?

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:53.870
Try NOT searching for things and let me know
how 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:07.979
it goes.
