00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:16.590
&gt;&gt;From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.100
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.400
&gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.980
I FEEL LIKE I'M THE LIBRARY
OF CONGRESS'S TOKEN NERD

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.380
TO DO ALL THESE WELCOMES WHEN IT
COMES TO OUR SUPERHERO EVENTS.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.830
GOOD EVENING, ON BEHALF OF
THE LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.490
CLARLA HAYDEN, I
AM ROSWELL ENCINA,

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.530
THE CHIEF COMMUNICATIONS
OFFICER AND WELCOME

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.830
TO THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.950
WE'RE HERE TO CELEBRATE
A VERY SPECIAL BIRTHDAY.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.460
THIS MAY, WE ARE CELEBRATING
THE 80th ANNIVERSARY OF THE MAN

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.280
OF STEEL HIMSELF, SUPERMAN.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.560
YEAH. YOU CAN CLAP.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.320
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.290
IN 80 YEARS, HE HAS RESCUED
LOIS LANE COUNTLESS OF TIMES,

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.820
SAVED THE UNIVERSE, BRAINIAC

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.240
AND DOOMSDAY MORE
THAN I CAN REMEMBER.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.720
HAS DIED, RETURNED
AND HAS BEEN BORN.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.910
HE'S PART OF THE AMERICAN
FABRIC AS MUCH AS APPLE PIE

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.120
AND BASEBALL, JUST
LOOK AT THE SET.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.900
WE'VE OUTDID OURSELVES TONIGHT.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.170
I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME MY
PARENTS BOUGHT ME MY FIRST BATCH

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.580
OF DC COMIC BOOKS.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.330
IT INCLUDED THE BATMAN FAMILY,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.760
AND ACTION COMICS
FEATURING SUPERMAN.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.090
AS A KID AS MOST OF YOU KNOW
YOU WERE EITHER A DC READER

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.860
OR A MARVEL READER.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.220
SUPERMAN, BATMAN, WONDER WOMAN,
AQUA MAN, GREEN LAN EARN,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.600
I COULD GO ON AND ON BUT AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED, MY LOYALTY WAS

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.380
WITH ANYONE SUPERMAN
WAS FRIENDS WITH.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.750
I REMEMBER WATCHING RERUNS OF
OLD EPISODES OF THE ADVENTURES

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.430
OF SUPERMAN STARTING
GEORGE REEVES.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.730
I PRACTICALLY MEMBER
RIDES EVERY EPISODE

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.860
OF THE CARTOON ANIMATED
SERIES SUPER FRIENDS

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.570
SO WHEN THE FIRST EVER SUPERHERO
BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE SUPERMAN

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.000
STARRING CHRISTOPHER REEVE WAS
OUT, I WAS FLYING HIGH JUST

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.470
LIKE THE MAN OF STEEL HIMSELF.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.120
SINCE THEN I THINK I'VE SEEN
EVERY VERSION OF SUPERMAN

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.000
ON THE SMALL AND BIG SCREEN,
FROM SMALLVILLE TO SUPERGIRL,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.230
FROM CHRISTOPHER
REEVE TO HENRY CAVILL.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.150
IT'S SAFE TO SAY I
GREW UP WITH SUPERMAN

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.220
AND CLEARLY DRANK THE
DC COMICS COOL AID.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.090
WORKING HERE HAS BROUGHT ME TO
A NEW LEVEL OF MY SIP NERDINESS.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.240
THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS HAS ONE

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.010
OF THE LARGEST COMIC
BOOK COLLECTIONS

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.090
IN THE WORLD, IN THE WORLD.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.600
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.990
AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE
PREVIEW ON YOUR WAY OUT,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.640
OUTSIDE THE AUDITORIUM
HEAR, YOU'LL SEE A LITTLE

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.470
OF THE LIBRARY'S COLLECTION
INCLUDING SOME SUPERMAN COMIC

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.160
BOOKS THAT DATE BACK TO THE 40s.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.180
I KNOW YOU'LL HAVE
FUN WITH THAT.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.190
AND YES, THE LIBRARY HAS THE
FIRST DRAFT OF THE DECLARATION

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.270
OF INDEPENDENCE, LINCOLN'S
DRAFT INAUGURAL ADDRESS.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.030
A LOCK OF BEETHOVEN'S HAIR AND
ALEXANDER HAMILTON'S PAPERS

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.340
BUT ON MY FIRST THING HERE
THE ONLY THING I WANTED

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.140
TO SEE WAS THE FIRST
EDITION OF BATMAN,

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.300
SUPERMAN AND WONDER WOMAN.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.820

THE COLLECTION MORE ACCESSIBLE

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.120

THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT
AS A NATIVE WASHINGTONIAN

MY DAD'S IN THE AUDIENCE,
AS WELL.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.190
ESPECIALLY FOR THE CHARACTER
WE'LL TALK ABOUT SUPERMAN,

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.170
WHO GOES BY MANY
NAMES, THE MAN OF STEEL,

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.790
KALEL, CLARK JOSEPH KENT.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.120
HE GOES BY A LOT OF THINGS
BUT THIS IS THE CHARACTER,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.590
THIS CURRENT ERA WE'RE SEEING

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.710
WHERE COMIC BOOK CULTURE
HAS TAKEN OVER SO MUCH

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.770
OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY,

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.740
WE FIND IT IN LIVE
ACTION TELEVISION, MOVIES,

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.390
ANIMATION, YOU NAME IT.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.850
THAT ALL GETS A START
BECAUSE OF THE CREATION

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.050
OF THIS CHARACTER WE'RE
GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.770
VERY HONORED TO BE HERE BESIDE
PAUL LEVITZ, FORMER EDITOR --

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.550
I'M SORRY, FORMER PRESIDENT
AND PUBLISHER OF DC COMICS

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.230
AND DAN JURGENS, A
WRITER AND ARTIST

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.850
WHO PROBABLY IS MOST KNOWN

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.400
FOR BEING THE MAN
THAT KILLED SUPERMAN.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.700
I REMEMBER --

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.000
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.120
FONDLY BEING 12 YEARS OLD
AND READING THAT ISSUE,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.960
THAT LAST PANEL, WHERE
LOIS IS HOLDING HIM

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.720
AND SHE BASICALLY
RELIES ON HIS ARM.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.440
IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.500
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.800
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE
YOU GUYS HERE.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.100
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.510
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.070
&gt;&gt; PAUL, I WANT TO
START WITH YOU.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.710
DO YOU THINK IT SAYS SOMETHING
ABOUT THE CONTINUED RELEVANCE

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.770
OF SUPERMAN THAT
A SERIES CREATED

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.500
SO LONG AGO IS NOT ONLY STILL
AROUND, BUT HAS MANAGED TO REACH

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.070
IN THE COMIC BOOK
INDUSTRY IN TERMS

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.990
OF PUBLISHING A VERY
ICONIC 1000th ISSUE?

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.440
&gt;&gt; THERE'S VERY LITTLE THAT
WAS CULTURALLY RELEVANT

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.680
IN 1938 THAT'S STILL
CULTURALLY RELEVANT TODAY.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.930
THERE A FEW THINGS WE
LOOK BACK ON AS SORT

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.270
OF WONDERFUL ARTIFACTS
OF THE TIME.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.870
JUDY GARLAND WIZARD OF OZ MOVIES
IS ABOUT A MINUTE AFTER THAT,

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.590
BUT HERE'S SOMETHING
THAT WAS CREATED THEN

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:24.930
THAT IS STILL A LIVING, GROWING,
CHANGING PART OF THE CULTURE.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.960
DAN'S WRITING IT AGAIN,
NEW MOVIES ARE BEING MADE,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.760
NEW TELEVISION SERIES,
KRYPTON STARTED A WEEK AGO,

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.020
LOOKING AT A DIFFERENT ASPECT
OF THE CHARACTER'S LIFE.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.590
THAT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY
THING IN A CULTURE

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.320
THAT HAS THE ATTENTION
SPAN OF A MAYFLY.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.620
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.640
AND WE'VE SEEN THROUGH
THOSE 80 YEARS

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.720
THAT WHERE BEING
DISTRACTED CONSTANTLY

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.430
BY THE NEW, THE EXCITING.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.250
YOU HAVE SO MANY
THOUSANDS OF OPPORTUNITIES

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.840
TO FIND NEW THINGS WHETHER
IT'S NEW TELEVISION SHOWS,

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:10.960
NEW COMIC SERIES, NEW LITTLE
SELF-PUBLISHED BOOKS THAT TURN

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:17.610
INTO 50 SHADES OF GREY, TO
HAVE SOMETHING BE CONSISTENTLY

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.780
IMPORTANT TO THE
CULTURE THROUGH ALL

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:25.580
THAT TIME IS JUST ANT
ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE PHENOMENON.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:30.040
&gt;&gt; DAN, WHAT'S IT LIKE
FOR YOU TO BE A PART

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.090
OF THE ACTION COMICS LEGACY NOW?

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.240
A LOT OF US I KNOW FROM MY YOUTH
I REMEMBER YOU AND YOUR TIME

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.930
ON THE SUPERMAN TITLE,

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:39.410
BUT YOU'RE CURRENTLY
WRITING ACTION COMICS.

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.510
YOUR RUN WILL COME TO AN END

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.060
WITH THE STAND ALONE
STORY IN ISSUE 1,000.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.170
YOU'VE BEEN LEADING THE
MARCH TO THE 1000th ISSUE.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:53.010
BACK WHEN YOU WERE DOING
SUPERMAN IN THE 90s, THE DEATH

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.890
AND RETURN OF SUPERMAN,
THAT'S AROUND THE TIME

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.250
WHERE ACTION WAS HOVERING
AROUND 700 ISSUES.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:02.150
COULD YOU HAVE IMAGINED
BACK THEN IN THE EARLY '90s

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.020
THAT YOU'D BE HERE IN 2018?

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.990
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, THERE'S NO WAY.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.790
SO MUCH OF IT IS WHEN
YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH TRYING

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.840
TO PRODUCE STORY, YOU ARE
TRYING TO PRODUCE STORY

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.790
AND IT'S JUST TRYING TO FASHION
A GOOD STORY TO GET IT DONE,

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:23.790
TO SEE IT GET TO THE POINT WHERE
IT'S PRINTED AND ON THE STAND

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.470
AND AS A WRITER OFTEN YOU
BUILD STORY IN TERMS OF ART,

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:31.310
SO YOU'RE PLANNING 5, 8,
10 OR 12 ISSUES AHEAD.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.980
AT LEAST I'M NOT AND I
DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO IS

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.530
WHO IS THINKING 20 YEARS
DOWN THE ROAD OR 30,

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:44.360
AND THE COMIC BOOK NUMBERING
SYSTEM IT JUST SEAMS SO FAR OFF.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.090
IT'S LIKE NO, WE NEVER TALKED

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.560
ABOUT ACTION 1,000 NOR DID I
THINK WE EVER REALLY GAVE IT

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.790
ANY THOUGHT.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.870
&gt;&gt; I'LL SAY I VERY NERDILY
GAVE IT SOME THOUGHT.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:57.130
I ACTUALLY REMEMBER BUYING
ACTION COMIC 700 AND TRYING

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.390
TO CALCULATE AND ENDED
UP BEING A WRITER

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.690
SO MATH WASN'T A STRONG POINT.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.590
I REMEMBER TRYING TO THINK WOW,
WHAT YEAR WILL 1,000 COME OUT.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:05.890
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU CLOSE?

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.190
DID YOU HAVE IT?

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.970
&gt;&gt; I WAS OFF BY A LITTLE BIT.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.300
&gt;&gt; AS TOO FORMER
PUBLISHER AND PRESIDENT

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:17.580
OF DC COMICS WHAT DO
YOU SAY TO THE NOTION

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.300
THAT SUPERMAN IS
TOO HARD OF A STORY?

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.380
IS THE KEY TO A GOOD STORY
A VILLAIN AS POWERFUL

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.350
AS DOOMSDAY OR DARK SIDE?

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:31.120
OR IS PART OF WHAT MAKES PEOPLE
COME BACK IS THE FACT HE HAS A

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.360
HUMAN SIDE, HAVING
GROWN UP IN KANSAS,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.100
BEING DOWN TO EARTH
DESPITE BEING SO POWERFUL?

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.800
&gt;&gt; TO TO ME THE STRONGEST PART

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.310
OF SUPERMAN HAS BEEN
THE EMOTIONAL PART

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:47.790
AND HIS REPRESENTATION
AS AN ICONIC MORAL FIGURE

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:53.320
THAT THIS IS SOMEONE WHO
HAS THESE INCREDIBLE GIFTS

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.970
AND IS USING THEM
FOR THE RIGHT CAUSES.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:01.590
SOME YEARS AGO WE HAD A GROUP OF
ARAB EDITORIAL CARTOONISTS COME

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:05.330
TO VISIT DC, MOSTLY THEY WANT
TO SEE THE M.A.D. MAGAZINE GUYS

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:10.810
AND SAY, THEY DON'T PUT
YOU IN JAIL FOR DOING THIS?

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:14.050
BUT THEY MADE THE
POINT, THEY SAID,

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.420
ISN'T THE SUPERHERO
IDEA A REFLECTION

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.340
OF THE AMERICAN BELIEF
THAT MIGHT MAKES RIGHT?

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.880
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT
IT FOR A MOMENT OR TWO

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.360
AND I SAID I CAN SEE WHERE YOU
SEE THAT IN THE SUPER HEAR ROWS

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.850
BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE CASE.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.480
I THINK WHAT THE
SUPERHEROS AND CERTAINLY

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.060
IN PARTICULAR SUPERMAN SAYS
TO US IS THAT WE'RE ALL BORN

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:41.330
WITH CERTAIN GIFTS AND IT'S WHAT
WE DO WITH THEM, HOW WE CHOOSE

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.290
TO USE THEM THAT DETERMINES
HOW THE WORLD GROWS,

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.710
HOW THE WORLD CHANGES,
AND WHO WE ARE.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.570
I THINK THOSE ARE
THE GREAT STORIES.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.950
YOU SEE SUPERMAN USING
HIS POWER IN A WAY

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.850
THAT CHANGES AN INDIVIDUAL
PERSON'S LIFE.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:12:00.610
&gt;&gt; DAN, I SAVED A VERY SERIOUS
QUESTION FOR YOU, THE TRUNKS.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.500
&gt;&gt; I KNEW THAT WAS COMING.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.250
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:09.630
&gt;&gt; AS SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT ONLY
WRITTEN BUT ILLUSTRATED SUPERMAN

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:15.900
AS WELL, NOW, I REMEMBER
NEW 52, THE TRUNKS GO AWAY.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.910
IT WAS KIND OF ALIGNED

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:22.130
WITH HENRY CATTLE'S
DEBUT AS THE MAN OF SPIT.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:25.570
THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE YOU MAY
HAVE YOUNG KIDS DISCOVERING THIS

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.430
CHARACTER FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND IF THEY WANT TO JUMP

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.450
TO THE COMICS YOU WANT IT TO
LOOK AS SIMILAR AS POSSIBLE

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.600
BUT IT WAS A CONTROVERSIAL
DECISION.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.530
ONE OF THE BIG GUEST THINGS
CELEBRATED WITH ACTION 1,000,

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.070
BOTH THIS 80th ANNIVERSARY
EDITION

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.820
AND YOUR PERIODICAL EDITION IS
THE FACT THE TRUNKS ARE BACK.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.110
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS
DRAWN SUPERMAN,

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:46.700
AND YOU'VE BEEN DRAWING
HIM TRUNKLESS

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.220
IN ACTION LEADING
UP TO THIS POINT.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.530
&gt;&gt; CAREFUL HOW YOU PHRASE THAT.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.830
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:57.020
I MEAN, COME ON.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.890
&gt;&gt; DID YOU EVER HAVE
MUSCLE MEMORY MOMENTS

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.250
WHEN YOU WERE DRAWING HIM FULLY
CLOTHED WITHOUT THE TRUNKS?

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.550
&gt;&gt; ALL THE TIME.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.590
IF YOU WERE TO SEE THE
UNDERDRAWING THAT WAS THERE,

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.970
BECAUSE THE WAY I WORK IS
FIRST I SKETCH THINGS OUT.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.270
THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.050
THEY WERE ALWAYS THERE, AND IT'S

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:16.520
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE MATE SAY
IT'S BECAUSE I DREW SO MUCH

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.170
OF SUPERMAN WHEN HE HAS THEM.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:23.180
OTHERS SAY IT FITS WELL, THE
APPEARANCE OF THE CHARACTER.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.280
I'VE ALWAYS SAID A
COUPLE OF THINGS.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.710
ONE, WE ALWAYS SAW THE
TRUNKS AS PART OF THE UNIFORM

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.140
AS THOUGH IT WAS ALL ONE PIECE

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.340
AND NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING
HE PUT ON THE OUTSIDE

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:39.170
BUT THE OTHER PART IS I THINK
IT'S THE YELLOW BELT AND EVEN

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.990
WHEN THEY WENT WITHOUT
THE TRUNKS WE PLAYED

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.820
AROUND WITH A YELLOW S SHIELD
FOR A BELT BUCKLE OR A WAY

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.320
TO GET A LITTLE YELLOW
IN THE MID RANGE

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.490
BECAUSE THAT HELPED HIGHLIGHT

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.960
THAT BRILLIANT TRIANGULAR
SHE SAID WITH THE S IN IT

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.440
AND ULTIMATELY I THINK THAT'S
WHY THE TRUNKS ARE NEEDED IS

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.470
MORE BECAUSE OF THE YELLOW BELT

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.100
BECAUSE THAT PULLS THE WHOLE
UNIFORM TOGETHER FOR ME.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.400
&gt;&gt; PAUL, WHAT ARE YOUR
THOUGHT ON THE TRUNKS?

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.090
WOULD YOU HAVE GONE
WITH THAT DECISION?

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:13.280
&gt;&gt; I'M A PRO-TRUNKS
GUY IN ALL OF THIS.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.580
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.690
PLEASE DULY NOTE TRUNKS DID NOT
DISAPPEAR UNTIL AFTER I WAS AWAY

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.430
FROM THE EXECUTIVE DESK

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.040
AND IF WE GO OFF THE
MIC LATER I CAN TELL YOU

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.970
WHO GOT THE TRUNKS OFF,
AND IT'S NOT WHO YOU THINK.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.270
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.570
&gt;&gt; AND THE TRUNKS ARE BACK.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:32.870
IT IS HASHTAG THE
TRUNKS ARE BACK, RIGHT?

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.760
&gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO, IT'S
TRENDING FOR SURE.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.140
PAUL, IN THIS EDITION

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:42.100
THAT YOU'VE EDITED THE 80th
ANNIVERSARY EDITION YOU WORKED

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.590
WITH MAR IF WOLFMAN ON
THIS ININDIVIDUALIBLE STORY

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:50.940
OF UNPUBLISHED STORY,
THE CREATORS OF SUPERMAN.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.530
COULD YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT IT WAS
LIKE, FIRST FINDING OUT ABOUT

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.640
THAT AND THEN WORKING WITH IT?

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.570
&gt;&gt; WELL, THE GUYS AT DC ASKED ME

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.980
TO PUT TOGETHER THIS
CELEBRATORY HARD COVER,

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.510
AND GAVE ME SOME TOOLS TO WORK

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.240
WITH THAT THEY DON'T USUALLY
OFFER EDITORS OF REPRINT TITLES

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:15.050
SO I WAS ABLE TO REACH OUT
TO A NUMBER OF UNUSUAL PEOPLE

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.720
TO ADD THEIR COMMENTS AND THEIR
THOUGHTS, WHICH WAS GREAT FUN.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.840
THERE'S A PIECE IN HERE
BY LAURA SIEGEL LARSON,

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.000
JERRY SIEGEL'S DAUGHTER, TALKING
ABOUT HER DAD AND HIS MEMORIES

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.820
OF CREATION OF SUPERMAN AND
HIS ATTITUDES TOWARDS IT

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.360
THAT WAS A REALLY
WONDERFUL THING FOR ME,

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.650
BECAUSE IT'S NO SECRET THERE
WERE MANY YEARS OF LEGAL BATTLES

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:39.770
BETWEEN SIEGEL AND SCHUSTER AND
AND DC THAT HAVE GOTTEN RESOLVED

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:43.990
AT THIS POINT AND REALLY
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE LAURA

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:48.210
IN HERE WAS A WAY OF
CLOSURE IN SOME FASHION.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:52.660
JULES PHIFER, WHO'S REALLY
AN AMERICAN TREASURE,

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:57.720
ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO'S WON
A PULITZER, AN OSCAR, AN OBIE,

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.300
I THINK EVERYTHING
BUT THE LOTTERY.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.260
AND HE'S ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE
HIS MEMORIES OF ACTION ONE,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.130
AS A KID WHO BOUGHT THEM,

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.720
AND WENT ON TO BE THIS GREAT
CARTOONIST IN HIS OWN RIGHT.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.250
BUT AS I WAS ASSEMBLING
THE BOOK, I REMEMBERED

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:19.300
THAT MARV WOLFMAN, WHO'S A DEAR
FRIEND OF MANY, MANY YEARS,

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.370
HAD SALVAGED A SIEGEL AND
SCHUSTER STORY THAT DC WAS GOING

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.890
TO THROW OUT UNPUBLISHED
WHEN HE WAS A KID.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:30.450
IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN YOU
CAME UP TO DC OFFICES,

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.560
ORIGINAL ART WASN'T PERCEIVED
TO BE WORTH ANYTHING.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.860
I'M SORRY, DAN.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.160
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.460
THOUGH THIS IS BEFORE
ANY OF IT WAS YOURS.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.760
&gt;&gt; I KNOW, YEAH.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.400
&gt;&gt; AND THEY WOULD, YOU KNOW,
LIKE IT WAS TRICK OR TREAT.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.950
HERE LITTLE BOY, YOU
CAME UP FOR A TOUR.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.760
WOULD YOU LIKE A PAGE OF ART?

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.820
THE ARTISTS THEMSELVES
COULDN'T GET THE ARTWORK BACK

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.610
BECAUSE IT WAS PRESUMED THEY
WOULD SOMEHOW GO SELL IT

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.850
TO SOMEBODY ELSE
TO BE PUBLISHED.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.590
I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.600
BUT IF YOU WERE A KID
TOURING YOU COULD GET IT,

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.340
AND MARV ON ONE OCCASION
SALVAGED THIS STORY THAT WAS

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.840
ABOUT TO BE DESTROYED AND
HE'D HAD IT IN HIS HOUSE,

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.020
AND I SPOKE TO HIM AND SAID:

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.590
SO THE STORY YOU'VE HAD
HIDDEN AWAY ALL THESE YEARS,

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:15.320
WOULD YOU MIND HAVING
IT PUBLISHED?

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.710
DO YOU THINK THAT WILL
DECREASE THE VALUE OF IT,

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.380
OR INCREASE THE VALUE OF IT?

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.370
DO YOU WANT TO CHECK THAT
WITH AN ART DEALER BEFORE WE

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:24.680
GO AHEAD?

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.700
AND HE SAID: NO, NO, I'M
HAPPY TO HAVE IT PUBLISHED,

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.130
HAPPY TO TELL THE STORY
OF HOW I SAVED SUPERMAN,

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.610
IS HOW HE PHRASED IT
IN HIS TEXT PIECE HERE.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:37.940
IT'S NOT AN EXTRAORDINARY
STORY IN BEING, LIKE,

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.660
THE GREAT CLASSIC
SUPERMAN STORY.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.700
THERE'S A REASON THEY WEREN'T
ABOUT TO PUBLISH IT THAT DAY.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.000
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.050
BUT IT'S A MAGNIFICENT
ARTIFACT TO BE ABLE TO SEE SORT

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:53.650
OF THE WORK IN PROGRESS, AND
IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO THE END

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:57.240
OF JERRY'S WRITING OF SUPERMAN,
PRETTY CLOSE TO THE END

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.380
OF WHEN THE SCHUSTER STUDIO
WAS CREATING THE MATERIAL

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.570
AND YOU REALLY SEE WHAT
THE PROCESS WAS LIKE,

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.110
AND WE REPRODUCED THAT
IN BLACK AND WHITE,

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:09.910
SO IT DOESN'T HAVE THE
ADVANTAGES AND THE MASKING

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:13.490
OF COLOR ON TOP OF IT SO IT
FEELS MORE LIKE AN ARTIFACT.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:19.310
&gt;&gt; DAN, YOUR RUN ON ACTION
COMICS COMES TO AN END

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:20.900
WITH THE 1000th ISSUE.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.860
THAT WILL BE OUT IN APRIL.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.160
&gt;&gt; FOR NOW.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.540
I'VE COME BACK BEFORE.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.990
&gt;&gt; WAS RETURNING TO
SUPERMAN IN THIS NEW ERA

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:33.370
OF COMICS WHAT YOU
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:36.130
HOW DID YOU FEEL WRAPPING

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.710
UP THIS CURRENT STORY
LINE IN ACTION COMICS?

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.590
AND MOST OF US KNOW HERE,

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.940
BRIAN MICHAEL BENNETT WILL
BE TAKING OVER WITH 1001.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.710
ARE YOU EXCITED FOR THAT?

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.010
&gt;&gt; YEAH, DEFINITELY.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.800
I'VE TALKED TO BRIAN A LITTLE
BIT ABOUT WHAT HE HAS IN STORY

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.420
AND I THINK IT'S
GOING TO BE GOOD.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.760
I LOOK FORWARD TO
IT AS A READER.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.890
AS FOR WINDING IT UP, I THINK
TO COME BACK TO IT A COUPLE

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.930
OF YEARS AGO AND BE ABLE
TO WRITE IT AS A BOOK

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.480
THAT WAS COMING OUT TWICE
A MONTH WAS A LOT OF FUN,

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.780
BECAUSE AT THAT POINT
YOU CAN PLAY

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.950
AROUND WITH STORYTELLING
TECHNIQUE A LITTLE BIT.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.750
NORMALLY WHAT YOU HAVE TO
DO IS PUT AN ISSUE OUT THERE

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.060
AND ANTICIPATE SOMEONE
REMEMBERING WHAT YOU WERE

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.010
TALKING ABOUT 30 DAYS LATER.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:21.030
AND WHEN YOU HAD A BOOK
THAT CAME OUT TWICE A MONTH,

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.450
YOU COULD PLAY AROUND WITH
SOME IDEAS A LITTLE MORE

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.300
AND YOU COULD DIG A LITTLE
DEEPER IN SOME THINGS,

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.700
JUST KNOWING THAT THE READERS
WOULD HAVE A MORE FRESH MEMORY

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.000
OF WHAT YOU JUST DID.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.490
SO IT WAS NICE TO BE
ABLE TO DO IT THAT WAY.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.170
&gt;&gt; TALKING ABOUT
SUPERMAN THIS WHOLE TIME.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.750
LET'S TALK ABOUT CLARK
KENT FOR A SECOND.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.120
THERE'S THIS NOTION THAT
POPS UP EVERY NOW AND THEN

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.810
THAT CLARK KENT IS JUST
WHO SUPERMAN PRETENDS TO BE

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.490
WHEN HE WANTS TO
NOT BE BOTHERED.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.940
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT THE
OPINION OF YOUR HARD CORE FAN,

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.370
WE ALL KNOW THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:54.990
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.620
&gt;&gt; IN THE COMICS, HE'S CLARK
FROM THE MOMENT HE LANDS

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.850
IN KANSAS IN THE SHIP.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.000
WHEN CRAFTING STORIES FOR
SUPERMAN, THIS IS A QUESTION

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.940
FOR BOTH OF YOU, IS IT IMPORTANT
TO REMEMBER THE MAN HE WAS,

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.840
CLARK KENT, WHO WAS AROUND
LONG BEFORE ANYONE EVER STARTED

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.630
CALLING HIM SUPERMAN?

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:12.930
&gt;&gt; I THINK SO.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.660
I MEAN, I HAVE ALWAYS
SEEN THAT AS THE CORE

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:21.080
OF WHO SUPERMAN REALLY IS, THAT
-- THIS GETS INTO THE WHOLE IDEA

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.420
OF PEOPLE SOMETIMES ASK:
WAS HE SUPERMAN FIRST?

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.720
OR WAS HE CLARK KENT FIRST?

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.590
I'M NOT SURE YOU
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE TWO.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:33.460
HE IS CLARK KENT, AND IN A
LOT OF WAYS, WHAT HE DOES

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:38.970
AS CLARK KENT, OR IT'S THE SAME
FOR LOIS LANE, IS THEY'RE TRYING

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.450
TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER
PLACE IN WHAT THEY DO

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.750
THROUGH THEIR JOBS,
THROUGH THEIR CAREERS.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.250
AND I THINK THERE'S A REASON
HE CHOSE THAT FOR A CAREER.

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:49.190
AND BY THE SAME WAY OF THINKING,

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:50.850
I THINK THEN BEING
SUPERMAN IS SORT

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:54.340
OF AN EXTENSION OF THAT INTENT.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:57.580
SO IT'S NO DIFFERENT
IN SOME WAYS

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:01.450
THAN IF YOUR NEXT-DOOR
NEIGHBOR WAS A POLICE OFFICER

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:02.770
OR FIREFIGHTER.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.230
THEY'RE NOT TWO DIFFERENT
PEOPLE.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.170
IT IS, THIS IS WHAT I
DO WHEN I'M AT HOME,

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.520
AND THIS IS WHAT I DO WHEN
I GO DO THIS OTHER THING.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.480
THAT'S HOW I'VE ALWAYS SEEN IT.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.320
&gt;&gt; AND I THINK THE OTHER PIECE
WHERE CLARK IS IMPORTANT IS

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.680
IN SOME WAYS CLARK IS
REPRESENTATIVE OF US.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.930
WE HAVE THE INSECURITIES
OF BEING CLARK,

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:27.520
AND WE WISH THAT OUR LOVED ONES
WOULD USE THEIR VISION TO SEE

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.660
THROUGH THOSE INSECURITIES
TO OUR GOOD QUALITIES.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.450
I THINK THAT'S REALLY
A FUNDAMENTAL PART

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.380
OF THE SUPERMAN MYTH.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:40.930
JERRY VERY MUCH PUT HIMSELF
INTO THE CHARACTER THAT WAY

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:43.490
AND HE CAPTURED SOMETHING
IN ALL OF US.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.290
WE ALL HAVE THOSE KIND
OF INSECURE MOMENTS.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:48.110
&gt;&gt; WHENEVER I THINK ABOUT THAT,

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:51.910
I THINK ABOUT THIS
ISSUE RIGHT HERE OF MAN

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:56.330
OF STEEL FANTASTIC MINI SERIES
WRITTEN AND DRAWN BY JOHN BERN.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.980
I REMEMBER THERE WAS A SCENE IN
THERE WHERE ONE OF HIS PARENTS,

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:04.770
I CAN'T REMEMBER IF IT WAS MA OR
PA, BUT THEY SAID TO SUPERMAN,

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.180
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE YOU'RE
NOT WEARING A MASK,

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.600
PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO THINK
YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.430
SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT
THE FACT THAT, YES,

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.730
EVEN WHEN YOU PUT
THE GLASSES ON,

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:16.110
YOU STILL LOOK EXACTLY THE
SAME, BECAUSE NO ONE IS GOING

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:17.820
TO BE THINKING SUPERMAN
IS TRYING TO HIDE

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:21.590
BECAUSE HIS FACE IS NOT COVERED.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:28.430
I THOUGHT THAT WAS GREAT
SUPERMAN HAS A SON NOW

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:32.440
WITH LOIS LANE, JONATHAN KENT,
WHO IS CURRENTLY SUPER-BOY.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.520
CHARACTERS LIKE SUPERMAN

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.400
FOR A LONG TIME CHILDREN WERE
NEVER REALLY IN THE EQUATION

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.830
WHEN IT COMES TO CONTINUITY.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.180
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON
SUPERMAN BEING A FATHER, YES,

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.630
I DO KNOW BATMAN HAS A KID NOW.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:50.790
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON
SUPERMAN BEING A FATHER

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:54.300
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN PART
OF TELLING JONATHAN'S STORY?

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.460
AND AS SOMEONE WHO
IS FROM AN ERA

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.760
WHERE THAT MIGHT
NOT HAVE BEEN TRIED,

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.800
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:07.710
&gt;&gt; AS THE YEARS GO ON, THE
CONTINUITIES GET MORE COMPLEX

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:11.730
AND THERE'S MORE ROOM TO DO
DIFFERENT KINDS OF STORIES.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.750
THE SUPERMAN OF MY
TIME HADN'T GOTTEN

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.670
TO THE POINT OF HAVING KIDS.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:22.410
THERE WERE LOTS OF
IMAGINARY STORIES THAT I READ

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.120
WHEN I WAS A CHILD THAT
IMAGINED WHAT IT WOULD BE

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.390
LIKE WHEN SUPERMAN
MIGHT HAVE CHILDREN.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:33.150
IT WAS REALLY FUN WHEN
I WAS 7, 8, 9 YEARS OLD,

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.270
SO I CAN CERTAINLY IMAGINE

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:40.920
THAT THE STORIES TODAY ARE
FUN FOR PEOPLE TO READ.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.440
IT'S NOT MY MOMENT.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:48.900
WE GET FROZEN IN THE CHARACTERS,
AS WE LOVE THEM BEST,

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:53.430
AND WHEN I WANT THE
CHARACTER AS I LOVED HIM BEST,

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:56.770
I GO BACK TO THE STUFF I WAS
READING WHEN I WAS 10 OR 12.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.750
DOESN'T MAKE IT BETTER
THAN WHAT'S BEING DONE NOW.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.850
JUST IT REMINDS ME OF WHAT CANDY
STORE I WAS IN WHEN I FOUND

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:10.180
THAT ISSUE, OR WHERE I WAS
AT CAMP AND REACTING TO IT.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:15.200
I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE
POWER OF THE COMIC BOOK FORM.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.770
SO I'M GOING TO STICK TO SORT
OF MY MEMORIES AS THE HEART

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.980
AND SOUL OF IT, AND NOT PASS
JUDGMENT FOR GOOD OR FOR ILL

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.990
ON WHAT'S BEING DONE
FOR A LATER GENERATION.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:34.160
&gt;&gt; YEARS AGO, WHEN CLARK AND
LOIS FINALLY GOT ENGAGED,

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.440
AND THEN GOT MARRIED, WE
TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT:

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.400
WOULD WE EVER DO STORIES
WHERE THEY BECOME PARENTS?

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.540
AND WE SAID: WELL, IT TOOK
THEM 50 YEARS TO GET MARRIED,

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.520
SO 50 YEARS FROM
NOW, WE'LL GET TO IT.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.820
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.290
I THINK WITH THIS ONE, THE
IDEA WAS THAT IT ALLOWS US

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:54.560
TO TELL A LITTLE BIT OF A
DIFFERENT KIND OF A STORY

00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:01.180
WITH SUPERMAN, THAT IF SUPERMAN
IS OUT THERE SERVING IN TERMS

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:06.500
OF A BEACON OF HOPE AND
INSPIRATION, AND SUDDENLY TRYING

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:11.410
TO GUIDE THOSE AROUND HIM,
WOULD IT BE FUN TO DO STORIES

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:13.960
WHERE WE SEE HIM TRYING
TO DO THAT AS A PARENT?

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.930
IS THERE SOME KIND
OF DUALITY THERE?

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.680
BECAUSE IDEALLY AS A
PARENT, YOU'RE TRYING

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.140
TO DO THE EXACT SAME
THING, RIGHT?

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.110
YOU'RE TRYING TO SET AN
EXAMPLE, SET A STANDARD,

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.000
AND HOPE THAT PEOPLE FOLLOW YOU.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.210
SO I KNOW WHEN WE FIRST
TALKED ABOUT IT, I SAID,

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:29.450
IN A WAY THIS CAN KIND OF
REPRESENT SOME OF THAT.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.020
IT CAN KIND OF REPRESENT
SOMETHING OF THE FUTURE

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.790
AND I THINK THERE ARE NEW
STORIES TO TELL WITH IT.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:36.740
SO THAT'S WHY WE
WENT AND HAD IT DONE.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.060
I HAD GREAT FUN WITH IT.

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.360
I THINK IT'S WORKED WELL.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.200
&gt;&gt; YOU ENJOY WRITING
WITH JONATHAN?

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.220
&gt;&gt; I ENJOY WRITING FOR JONATHAN

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.780
BECAUSE I THINK TWO
THINGS HAPPEN.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:48.530
THERE WAS A FEEL THAT SUPERMAN
WOULD INSTANTLY FEEL OLD

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:49.950
AND STODGY.

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:51.250
THERE'S ALWAYS THIS FEAR

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.400
ABOUT SUPERMAN FEELING
OLD AND STODGY ANYWAY.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.260
SO I SAID LET'S EMBRACE IT
AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT,

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.000
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME
HAVING THAT FUN SENSE

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.740
OF YOUTH WHICH I THINK IS JON.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.380
IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT
VERSION OF SUPER BOY IN A WAY.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.810
IT'S A SUPER BOY FOR THE NOW.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:11.500
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT,
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:17.370
OF ACTION 1,000, THE CELEBRATORY
COMMEMORATIVE EDITION YOU PUT

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.710
TOGETHER, AND ALSO
THE PERIODICAL

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:22.120
WHICH YOU'VE BEEN WRITING
THE LAST FEW YEARS.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.020
COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO?

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.980
AND WHAT IT WAS LIKE WORKING
ON THEM FOR BOTH OF YOU?

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:32.930
&gt;&gt; SURE. I THINK DAN HAD
THE MORE CLASSIC OPPORTUNITY

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:45.970
IN THE SENSE THAT HE WAS
GETTING TO DO ACTION 1,000.

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:48.130
WHEN THAT ISSUE COMES
OUT IT HAS HIS NAME ON IT

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:50.910
AND THAT'S SERIOUSLY COOL.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:57.040
WHAT I GOT TO DO WAS
TO BE A HISTORIAN.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.530
BE SOMEONE WHO COULD
USE KNOWLEDGE

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:04.840
OF HOW THE CHARACTER HAD
EVOLVED, USE KNOWLEDGE

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.880
OF WHO THE PEOPLE WERE WHO WOULD
HAVE INTERESTING THINGS TO SAY

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.580
ABOUT THE CHARACTER,
AND BRING THEM TOGETHER

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.210
FOR THAT CELEBRATION.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:18.220
I GOT TO THROW THE PARTY TO
CELEBRATE WHAT HE WAS DOING.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.350
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A GREAT PARTY.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:22.650
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:25.090
WE GOT SOME PRETTY COOL
PEOPLE AT THE PARTY

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:28.840
AND THEY LOOKED BACK AND
THEY PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER,

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.080
AND WE EXAMINED THE
DIFFERENT ERAS

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.200
AND REPRESENTED THE
DIFFERENT THINGS IN CONTEXT

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:38.220
AND IT'S TERRIFIC TO BE ABLE
TO DO THAT KIND OF CELEBRATION.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:45.170
I'M UTTERLY JEALOUS OF ACTUALLY
GETTING TO DO THE STORY ITSELF,

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:49.110
BUT IT'S GREAT JUST TO BE
ABLE TO THROW THE PARTY.

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.920
&gt;&gt; AND, DAN, FOR YOU,
WITH THE 1000th ISSUE,

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.520
YOURS WRAPS IT SELF
UP WITH ISSUE 999.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:01.160
BUT GETTING TO THAT 1000th ISSUE
WHICH HAS MANY CONTRIBUTORS.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.810
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO YOURSELF?

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:06.670
OKAY, I HAVE ONE LITTLE
PIECE OF THIS HISTORIC COMIC.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.610
SOMETHING THAT'S
NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE,

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.190
A COMIC REACHING 1,000 ISSUES.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:13.670
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO YOURSELF
YOU WANTED TO PUT IN YOUR STORY?

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:17.900
&gt;&gt; I THINK I WANTED TO FIND A
WAY TO SAY "THANK YOU" IN A WAY.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:22.420
WAY BACK WHEN, WHEN MAY
KIDS WERE REALLY LITTLE,

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.420
I TAUGHT THEM TO SAY SOMETHING
WHICH BASICALLY WENT THIS WAY,

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.250
WHAT IS SUPERMAN'S
GREATEST POWER?

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:29.220
I'D GET THEM TO SAY:
HE PAYS THE MORTGAGE.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.520
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:35.260
SO I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT
HAVING HAD AN ASSOCIATION

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:39.630
WITH A CHARACTER LIKE SUPERMAN
THAT LONG, THAT I STARTED

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.340
TO THINK ALONG THE
LINES OF, YOU KNOW,

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.000
HOW DO YOU SAY "THANK YOU"?

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.100
AND IN MY STORY, IT'S
REALLY WHAT METROPOLIS DOES,

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.270
IS THEIR WAY OF THANKING
SUPERMAN.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.320
YOU CAN'T GO OUT AND
BUY HIM A NEW CAR

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.340
OR GIVE HIM A CARIBBEAN
VACATION.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.820
IT'S -- I WANTED TO WRITE
SOMETHING FROM THE HEART

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.640
AND EXPRESS THAT THROUGH
THE CITIZENS OF METROPOLIS

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.810
AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING FOR,

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:08.860
BECAUSE ACTION 1000 IS AN ICONIC
ISSUE AND THE STORIES I'VE READ

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.330
IN IT ARE TREMENDOUS
AND IT'S BEEN FUN

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:13.630
TO SEE IT COME TOGETHER.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:15.990
I THINK IT REALLY IS
A VERY SPECIAL BOOK.

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.160
&gt;&gt; WHAT DOES THE NUMBER
1,000 MEAN TO BOTH OF YOU?

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.890
WE'RE IN A REALLY DIFFERENT
ERA IN THE COMIC BOOK INDUSTRY

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:25.270
WHERE THINGS KEEP REFRESHING
AND NUMBER-ONE ISSUE,

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:27.580
THAT'S THE BIG THING NOW TO
HAVE A NEW NUMBER-ONE ISSUE,

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:28.880
TO START OVER.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:33.070
I REMEMBER ONCE TALKING
TO TODD McFARLAND, WHO,

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:37.500
A FORMER DC MARVEL
ARTIST CREATOR OF SPAWN,

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.310
HE ONCE TOLD ME HE NEVER THOUGHT

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.480
THAT HIS SPAWN COMIC
WOULD BE ONE

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.490
OF THE HEYEST NUMBERED
COMICS IN THE INDUSTRY,

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:46.180
JUST BECAUSE OF THE WAY
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:50.880
WHEN WHEN NEW 52 CAME OUT
AND DC WENT TO NEW NUMBERING.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.650
DOES THE NUMBER 1,000 BECAUSE
IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:56.820
IN COMICS, DOES IT HAVE
A SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE?

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.100
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU GUYS?

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.340
&gt;&gt; I WAS A COMIC BOOK COLLECTOR
BEFORE I WAS A COMIC BOOK

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:07.340
PROFESSIONAL, AND TO BE
ABLE TO HAVE A 100 ISSUE RUN

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:11.140
OF ANYTHING WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY
THING IN THOSE DAYS.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:17.070
THERE WERE VERY FEW COMICS,
A DOZEN, TWO DOZEN, MAYBE,

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:19.890
THAT HAD HAD RUNS WHERE YOU
COULD HAVE 100-ISSUE RUN

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:21.780
THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY COLLECT.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:26.080
THE IDEA OF SOMETHING YOU COULD
HAVE 1,000 ISSUES IN A ROW OF,

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.640
JUST IS UTTERLY UNIMAGINABLE
TO THAT INNER KID IN ME.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:35.710
AND I THINK IT'S
INCREDIBLY EXCITING.

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:38.140
&gt;&gt; I'D ALSO ADD THAT
WHEN I WAS A KID,

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.390
AND I'D BE AT A GENERAL
NEWS STAND --

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:43.890
THIS IS BEFORE COMIC SHOPS, SO
IT'S JUST GENERAL NEWSSTAND --

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:48.990
AND I COULD HOLD UP AN
ISSUE OF SPIDERMAN 63

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:54.080
AND BATMAN I DON'T KNOW 215,
SAY, I JUST FIGURED ANYTHING

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.000
THAT MADE IT TO 200
ISSUES MUST BE BETTER.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.120
I THOUGHT THE HIGHER
NUMBER MEANT MORE QUALITY,

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.430
I REALLY DID.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:03.100
SO 1,000 MUST BE PRETTY GOOD.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.530
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:08.890
&gt;&gt; DAN, I HATE TO KEEP BRINGING
THIS BACK TO DEATH OF SUPERMAN

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.310
BUT THAT'S A HUGE REASON WHY I'M
HERE ON THIS STAGE RIGHT NOW IS

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:15.500
BECAUSE IT'S HOW MUCH THAT
STORY LINE IMPACTED ME IN TERMS

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.970
OF NOT JUST BEING A KID
WHO WENT TO 7 ELEVEN

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:21.670
AND GRABBED THE COPPIC TO
DRAW STUFF BUT ACTUALLY WANTED

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:23.950
TO READ A CONTINUING STORY.

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:28.370
IF YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED ME,
THERE'S ONE COMIC BOOK MOMENT

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:31.780
THAT WOULD PROBABLY NEVER BE
ADAPTED TO LIVE ACTION FILM,

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.590
I WOULD SAY IT WAS
KILLING SUPERMAN.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:38.430
BUT WE ACTUALLY GOT TO SEE IT
HAPPEN, AND WHETHER YOU LIKED IT

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:41.550
OR NOT BATMAN VERSUS
SUPERMAN, DAWN OF JUSTICE.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:46.770
NOW, I REMEMBER, BECAUSE
I LIKE TO PRIDE MYSELF

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.280
ON THINKING I CAN FIGURE
OUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.080
IN A MOVIE BECAUSE
I READ THE BOOKS.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.540
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.460
BUT EVEN WHEN THEY SHOWED
DOOMSDAY IN THE TRAILER,

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.270
I SAID OH, THAT'S COOL,

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:00.870
BUT THEY'RE NOT GONNA
KILL HIM, AND THEY DID IT.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:04.540
THINK TO YOURSELF AND SAY:
WOW, I WASN'T EXPECTING

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:08.230
THAT TO EVER BE ADAPTED
INTO A MOVIE?

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.290
&gt;&gt; I THINK IN THE BACK OF
MY HEAD, BECAUSE RIGHT AWAY,

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:15.310
THERE WERE -- THERE WAS
BOTH A NOVELIZATION.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.900
THEY ALSO DID AUDIO BOOKS OF IT

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.510
THAT I THOUGHT WE WOULD
EVENTUALLY GET THERE,

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:21.860
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT HAD
COME UP EARLIER ANYWAY

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.480
WITH THE TIM BURTON FILM.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.270
THEN THEY DID IT AS AN ANIMATED
MOVIE SO I THOUGHT YEAH,

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:30.970
WE MATE JUST GET THERE AT
SOME POINT SO WHAT WAS --

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:35.360
IT WAS COOL TO SEE IT DONE
BUT I THINK WHAT REALLY HIT ME

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.980
AS I WAS SITTING IN THE
MOVIE WAS THIS NOTION

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:42.120
THAT NOT ONLY DID THEY USE
DOOMSDAY OR THE STORY MATERIAL,

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:46.400
OR THE STORY IDEA, BUT THEY
ACTUALLY TRIED TO REPLICATE SOME

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.940
OF THE STUFF THAT I
HAD DRAWN ON FILM.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.090
AND THAT WAS A VERY
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE,

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:52.870
BECAUSE THAT I HADN'T
REALLY SEEN BEFORE.

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:57.280
AND TO SEE THEM TRY AND
REPRODUCE SOMETHING ON FILM

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.930
THAT I HAD DRAWN, ALMOST

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:01.770
LIKE VERBATIM A LITTLE
BIT, THAT WAS A THRILL.

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:03.250
&gt;&gt; THAT'S GOT TO BE COOL.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:04.820
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.610
&gt;&gt; FOR THE RECORD THE ONLY
THING I WAS UPSET ABOUT IS

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:12.840
THAT HE DIDN'T COME
BACK IN THE BLACK SUIT.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.140
&gt;&gt; ME, TOO.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.010
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE HENRY TWEETED OUT
THE IMAGE OF THE BLACK SUIT.

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:20.700
IT'S LIKE OH, THEY'RE
GOING TO DO BLACK --

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.120
&gt;&gt; I'M WITH YOU.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.420
I'M YOU.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.720
&gt;&gt; SORRY.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.020
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.320
&gt;&gt; WAIT FOR THE REMAKE.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.620
&gt;&gt; THERE WE GO.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.920
CAN YOU GUYS TELL US
ABOUT YOUR FIRST --

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.220
CAN YOU REMEMBER YOUR FIRST
EXPERIENCE WITH THIS CHARACTER,

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.520
WHEN YOU FIRST DISCOVERED HIM?

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.730
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT WAS WATCHING
THE GEORGE REEVES SHOWS

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:39.590
ON THE LITTLE BLACK
AND WHITE TV AT HOME.

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:43.110
THE COMIC COMES INTO MY
LIFE, LIKE MOST COMICS,

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:48.130
IN BOXES THAT OLDER KIDS ON
THE BLOCK HAD OF THEIR COMICS,

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:51.790
AND I'D SEE ALL THE DIFFERENT
CHARACTERS, BUT THE FIRST COMIC

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:57.130
THAT WAS MINE WAS ACTION 300,
WHICH A BABYSITTER BROUGHT

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:00.020
TO SHUT ME UP ONE NIGHT WHEN
I WAS ABOUT 5 YEARS OLD,

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.420
AND IT HAD A SUBSCRIPTION AD

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.130
WHERE FOR A DOLLAR YOU COULD
GET A SUBSCRIPTION FOR A YEAR.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:06.680
AND I SOMEHOW CONNED MY PARENTS

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.110
INTO SENDING IN THE
DOLLAR FOR IT.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.400
AND I WAS A SUBSCRIBER TO ACTION

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.950
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS
AFTER THAT.

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:14.620
&gt;&gt; TALK ABOUT A DOLLAR
WELL SPENT.

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.920
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.360
&gt;&gt; IT SORT OF PAID
OFF ULTIMATELY.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.660
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:20.960
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.410
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST TIME I EVER
BOUGHT WAS A SUPERMAN COMIC,

00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:25.900
IT WAS SUPERMAN 89.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.100
IT HAD SUPERMAN ON THE
LEFT SIDE OF THE COVER

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.410
AND CRYPTOWAS BARKING AT
HIM AND WEARING THE CAPE.

00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:33.380
HE DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPE ON.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:35.390
SUPERMAN IS SAYING OR THINKING,

00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:37.960
BECAUSE THEY DID THOUGHT
BALLOONS IN THOSE DAYS,

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.770
SAID EVEN MY DOG CRYPTO
DOESN'T RECOGNIZE ME

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:44.950
WHICH IF YOU'RE A KID,
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BUY THAT.

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:46.250
LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.290
SO MY FIRST COMIC
WAS A SUPERMAN COMIC.

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:50.990
&gt;&gt; FOR THE RECORD MY FIRST WAS

00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:53.200
WHEN HE REVEALED HIS
IDENTITY TO LOIS.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.500
WHICH WAS IN ACTION COMICS.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.480
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS A POINT OF SOME
DISCUSSION, BECAUSE WHEN

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.100
THAT STORY WAS ORIGINALLY
PLANNED, AND WE HAD A GROUP

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:05.520
OF WRITERS IN THE ROOM THAT
TALKED ABOUT IT AND SET IT UP,

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.830
THAT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.300
THEY WERE GOING TO GET
ENGAGED AND THEN IN THE MIDDLE

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:14.290
OF PUTTING THE STORY TOGETHER,
A COUPLE OF THE GUYS CALLED ME

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:17.030
UP ALONG WITH OUR EDITOR
AT THE TIME, MIKE CARLIN

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:20.870
AND SAID WE JUST REALIZED, IF
SUPERMAN PROPOSES TO LOIS LANE

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:24.290
AND SHE SAYS YES
AND HE DOESN'T ADMIT

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:28.090
THAT CLARK KENT ADMIT HE'S
SUPERMAN HE'S LYING TO HER

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:31.020
AND THAT WOULD BE WRONG SO WE
TALKED ABOUT IT AT THE TIME

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:34.760
AND THAT'S HOW WE KIND OF
RECONFIGURED THAT SCENE,

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:39.200
SO IT DID PLAY OUT THAT WAY.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.270
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF
TIME, ARE WE GOING TO LEAVE TIME

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.520
FOR Q &amp; A WITH THE AUDIENCE?

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:49.440
OKAY. OKAY, THERE YOU GO, SIR,

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:55.410
AND THEN I'LL GET
YOU IN THE BACK.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:58.190
THE MIC IS COMING.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:03.420
THAT'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.720
[ OFF MICROPHONE ]

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.020
&gt;&gt; SO WHEN I WAS
READING COMICS AS A KID,

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.360
I THOUGHT THEY WERE
GEARED FOR KIDS.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.220
I THOUGHT THEY WERE
GEARED FOR THE 7-YEAR-OLD.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.090
THESE COMICS THESE
DAYS DON'T SEEM

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.330
TO BE GEARED FOR THAT AUDIENCE.

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:21.390
HOW DO YOU KEEP KIDS IN IT
TO GET MORE PEOPLE TURNING

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:24.940
INTO THE INDUSTRY, AS READERS?

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:33.690
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS A GIGANTIC
BUSINESS QUESTION IN THE 1980s

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:40.230
WHEN THE COMIC SHOP BECAME
THE NEW HOME OF THE FIELD

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:43.630
WHEN THE NEWS STAND WAS
DRYING UP, BECAUSE PREPARE

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:48.510
TO THE 1980s, IN AMERICA,
IF YOU WERE A KID,

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.830
COMICS WERE THE FIRST
THING YOU BOUGHT OTHER

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:53.040
THAN MAYBE CHEWING GUM.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:37:01.850
AND YOU PROGRESSED FROM READING
DISNEY OR LOONY TUNES ON UP

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:03.800
TO GETTING THE SUPER HEROES

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.650
AND THEN YOU DISCOVERED
THE OPPOSITE SEX OR SPORTS

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:11.610
OR SOMETHING, AND YOU GAVE
IT UP AND YOU MOVED ON.

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:16.170
THE MODEL CHANGED, AND FOR A FEW
YEARS THERE WE WERE PETRIFIED

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.480
THAT WE'RE NEVER GOING
TO HAVE NEW KIDS,

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.700
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE
NEWSSTANDS TO RECRUIT THEM WITH.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.050
TURNED OUT THAT, IN FACT,
YOU CAN RECRUIT PEOPLE

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:30.750
TO START READING COMICS AT
A LATER AGE, AND STARTING

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:34.720
IN THE LATE '80s AND VERY
HEAVILY THROUGH THE '90s,

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.980
WE BEGAN TO SEE WAVES OF
KIDS COMING INTO THE MEDIUM

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:42.180
IN HIGH SCHOOL AND IN COLLEGE
YEARS, WITH THE MATERIAL

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.710
THAT WE WERE DOING
FOR OLDER PEOPLE.

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:48.000
IN THE LAST 10 YEARS, THERE'S
BEEN A WONDERFUL RESURGENCE

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.330
IN COMICS FOR KIDS.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:52.170
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL
GRAPHIC NOVEL

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:56.830
OF THE LAST FEW YEARS IS
THE WORK OF RENA TELGEMEYER,

00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:02.710
WHICH CLEARLY REACHES PROBABLY
AT ITS HEART 8 TO 10-YEAR-OLDS

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:06.920
AND GOES OUT AT PRINT
RUNS LARGER THAN, SADLY,

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.220
ANY ISSUE OF SUPERMAN.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:12.960
AND THOSE ARE KIDS WHO ARE
COMING INTO COMICS THROUGH THAT.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.260
NOT ALL OF THEM WILL
BE INTERESTED

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.960
IN SUPERMAN AFTERWARDS.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.450
BUT SOME OF THEM WILL BE.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:19.230
SOME OF THEM WILL
MOVE THROUGH IT.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.330
AND I'M REALLY COMFORTABLE
AT THIS POINT

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:25.260
THAT WE'RE RECRUITING A LOT OF
NEW PEOPLE OF ALL AGES TO COME

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.650
INTO THE COMICS, AND
THEY'RE JUST COMING

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:31.010
IN THROUGH VERY DIVERSE
PATHS, NOT THE SAME EXACT PATH

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:32.310

IT'S A DIFFERENT TIME.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:37.390
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS I SEE
THAT HAS DEFINITELY INCREASED

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:43.400
OVER THE YEARS IS, IT'S VERY
OFTEN I'LL HEAR SOMEONE YOUR AGE

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:47.230
WILL SAY THIS IS
MY FAVORITE COMIC.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:50.520
SOMEONE WILL PUT DOWN
A TRADE PAPERBACK

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.790
AND SAY THIS WAS MY
FIRST COMIC AND ONE

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:57.090
OF THE BARRIERS I THINK WAS
ALWAYS THERE WAS THIS IDEA THEY

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:58.660
COULDN'T NECESSARILY GET

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.990
THAT 7 YEAR-OLD COULDN'T GET
THE ENTIRE STORY IN AN ISSUE

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.700
BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE PART
3 OF A 6 PART STORY.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.700
NOW WHEN THEY PUT DOWN THE TRADE
PAPERBACK THEY HAVE THE WHOLE

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.100
STORY AND THAT'S WHAT
I SEE MORE AND MORE.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.770
THEY'RE GIVING ME A BOOK.

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:17.530
&gt;&gt; DC ALSO HAS A GREAT GATEWAY
AND THE TEEN TITANS GIRL CARTOON

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:22.610
WHICH IS A PHENOMENAL WAY TO GET
KIDS INTERESTED IN CHARACTERS.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:23.940
NEXT QUESTION?

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.240
RIGHT HERE?

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.540
&gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:30.250
THERE WE GO.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:43.750
JUST WANT TO START OFF BY
SAYING THANK YOU TO YOU BOTH

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.370
FOR TAKING THE TIME TO DO THIS.

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:49.880
I THINK IT'S A VERY COOL
AND I'M SURE EVERYONE

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.180
IN THE AUDIENCE APPRECIATES
YOU TOOK THE TIME TO DO IT.

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.350
SO THANK YOU TO YOU BOTH.

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:57.820
THE QUESTION I HAVE IS
ACTUALLY ABOUT LEX LUTHOR

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:01.200
AND IT TIES BACK INTO AN
EARLIER QUESTION BROUGHT

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.360
UP ABOUT THE THOUGHT PROCESS
THAT SUPERMAN IS TOO POWERFUL,

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.550
THAT HE'S BORING BECAUSE
THERE'S NO THREAT TO HIM BUT,

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:11.670
AND ESPECIALLY WHEN
I MAKE THE COMPARISON

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:15.660
TO THE MODERN DAY INTERPRETATION
OF LEX VERSUS THE FILMS,

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:20.080
WHEN I'M READING OF LEX IN
THE MODERN DAY COMIC BOOKS,

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.010
HE'S ONE OF THE BEST THAT
HUMANITY HAS TO OFFER

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:26.220
IN THE INTELLECT,
THE PROWESS, THE WILL

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.810
AND THAT'S WHY SUPERMAN
TAKES HIM SO SERIOUSLY

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:30.170
BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZES THAT

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:34.230
AND HE KNOWS THIS GUY IS
COMMITTED TO TAKING HIM DOWN.

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:36.420
BUT THEN WHEN I LOOK AT
THE FILM, EVEN GOING BACK

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:40.410
TO SUPERMAN THE MOVIE,
THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF KIND

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:43.060
OF OVER THE TOPNESS,
AND HAMMINESS

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.350
THAT THE LEX LUTHOR
CHARACTER IS PRO TRAYED

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:49.600
AND IT'S HARD THEIRTIVELY TO
PORTRAY THEM TO THE AUDIENCE

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.260
AND THINK THAT'S A CHARACTER
SUPERMAN WILL TAKE SERIOUSLY

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.560
AS A THREAT.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:58.100
UNLIKE THE JOKER WHERE
HIS OVER THE TOPNESS PLAYS

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:03.710
INTO THE PSYCHOTIC NATURE AND
MAKES IT MORE THREATENING,

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:05.300
I THINK THAT DOESN'T
NECESSARILY PLAY

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.250
WITH THE CHARACTER
LEX LUTHOR IN REGARDS

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:09.570
TO HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH SUPERMAN.

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:11.850
SO I'M JUST WONDERING
WHY YOU THINK

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:16.310
THAT ELEMENT KEEPS MAKING
ITS WAY INTO THE FILM,

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:18.200
THEN NOT NECESSARILY
TAKING THE CUES

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.540
FROM THE MODERN DAY
INTERPRETATION OF LEX LUTHOR?

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:26.620
&gt;&gt; I THINK IN SOME WAYS, YOU
KNOW, LEX MIGHT HAVE BEEN CHOSEN

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:30.090
FOR THE FILM AND PORTRAYED THOSE
WAYS BECAUSE HE WAS FAMILIAR,

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:33.870
BUT TO BACKTRACK A LITTLE BIT
ON YOUR QUESTION, WHICH IS,

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:38.650
IS IT HARD TO WRITE FOR SUPERMAN
BECAUSE OF THE POWER LEVEL?

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:40.260
AND ESPECIALLY WITH
REGARDS TO LEX LUTHOR,

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:44.700
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE
THAT LEVEL OF POWER?

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:48.380
I THINK YOU WRITE A GOOD
STORY BY TESTING CHARACTER

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.640
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU FIND
OUT WITH A SUPERMAN STORY

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.920
AND I DON'T FIND THAT
HARD TO WRITE FOR.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.000
YOU TEST SUPERMAN'S CHARACTER
SOMEHOW AND IF YOU TAKE SOMEONE

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.450
LIKE LEKS LUTHOR, WHO IS
SO DEVIOUS AND INTELLIGENT

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:04.270
AND CRAFTY THERE SHOULD
BE MANY WAYS FOR HIM

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:06.420
TO TEST SUPERMAN SOMEHOW.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:09.800
EVEN IF HE STANDS
INSIDE LEX'S OFFICE

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:13.680
WHERE HE COULD USE HIS X-RAY
VISION TO LOOK AT ANY DATA

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.460
OR LISTEN TO ANY CONVERSATION
THAT NONE OF THAT APPEARS

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.200
IN THE OFFICE BECAUSE
LEX IS TOO SMART

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.030
SO THERE ARE ALWAYS GOOD WAYS
TO DO THAT KIND OF A STORY

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:26.020
AND I THINK THE FACT THAT
LEX DOESN'T HAVE SUPER-POWERS

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.650
WHEN PITTED AGAINST SUPERMAN
IS PART OF WHAT MAKES

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:30.890
THAT DYNAMIC SO INTERESTING.

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:33.340
&gt;&gt; I RECALL THAT ONE OF
THE I THINK MAYBE THE BEST

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.400
EXPLANATIONS I EVER SAW WAS I
THINK IT WAS A JUSTICE LEAGUE

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:40.130
COMIC, BUT A CHARACTER
WITH ACTION SUPERMAN,

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:41.950
WHY ARE YOU SO WORRIED
ABOUT HIM?

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:45.590
HE SAYS, I CAN'T SEE
WHAT HE'S THINKING

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:47.450
AND HE'S ALWAYS THINKING.

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:51.540
SO I JUST, THE SERIOUSNESS
OF THAT CHARACTER NOT COMING

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:55.080
THROUGH IN THE FILMS, I WONDER
WHY THAT HASN'T HAPPENED.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:43:00.490
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S ALSO, THE GUYS
ASKED ME TO DO A LITTLE SUPERMAN

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:03.410
AND LEX STORY THAT'S
INCLUDED IN THE HARDCOVER,

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:04.790
WHICH I HAD THE PLEASURE

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:07.240
OF HAVING WORKING
WITH KNEEL ADAMS ON.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.730
IT'S AMAZING -- NEIL ADAMS ON.

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:11.030
IT'S AMAZING.

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:17.800
AND THE STORY CENTERS AROUND
THE IDEA THAT BECAUSE LEX IS

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:23.280
SUCH A REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT
IS STRONG IN THE HUMAN RACE,

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.650
AS WELL AS WHAT WENT WRONG,

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.140
SUPERMAN DOESN'T
WANT TO DEFEAT HIM.

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:30.500
HE WANTS TO WIN HIM
OVER ON SOME LEVEL.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.210
AND IT'S JUST A LITTLE STORY
OF SUPERMAN GOING TO PLAY CHESS

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:37.080
WITH LEX LUTHOR,
BECAUSE HE KEEPS HOPING

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.670
THAT IF HE JUST SITS DOWN
AND SHOWS LEX THE RIGHT WAY

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:43.390
TO THINK, THAT THERE WILL BE
SOME WAY TO GET THROUGH TO HIM,

00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:49.270
CONVINCE HIM THAT SUPERMAN IS
NOT A BAD THING FOR THE WORLD,

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:53.250
BUT ALSO HAVE LEX BE A GOOD PART
OF THE WORLD, AND LIKE SUPERMAN,

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.920
MAKE THE CHOICE TO USE
HIS PERSONAL GIFTS,

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.340
HIS PERSONAL ABILITIES,
FOR THE RIGHT CAUSES.

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.640
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:09.410
&gt;&gt; DOESN'T NECESSARILY WORK
OUT AS SUPERMAN INTENDED.

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:10.710
&gt;&gt; EXCUSE ME.

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:12.010
THANKS A LOT.

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:14.470
I REALLY CAN'T SAY HOW
MUCH I'VE ENJOYED BOTH

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:16.280
OF YOUR WORK OVER THE YEARS.

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.180
AND IN PARTICULAR, MR. LEVITZ,
THE GREAT DARKNESS SAGA.

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.480
I'M GEEING OUT.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.910
I WAS IN COLLEGE AT THE TIME.

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:25.380
IT WAS SOMETHING TO BE ABLE TO
TAKE 20 MINUTES AND GET A BREAK

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.390
FROM COLLEGE TO GO INTO A
WHOLE OTHER DIFFERENT WORLD.

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:33.600
THAT SAID, I GUESS IN A FEW
DAYS IS THE 60th ANNIVERSARY

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.580
OF THE LEGION OF SUPERHEROS
AND I'M JUST CURIOUS,

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.670
ONE OF THE WAYS I'VE ALWAYS
ENJOYED SUPERMAN IS THE

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:42.620
INTERACTION WITH OTHER
CHARACTERS AND I DON'T KNOW

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:48.550
IF EITHER OF YOU HAVE SOMETHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE ABOUT THAT.

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:49.850
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S ALWAYS FUN.

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:53.780
PART OF IT IS THAT
WHENEVER WE PUT CHARACTERS

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:58.390
LIKE THAT TOGETHER, WE FIND
OUT WHAT MAKES THEM GIVEN

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:00.720
FROM ONE ANOTHER AND IT'S ALWAYS
FUN TO SEE THAT CHARACTER MIX.

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.020
AND SOME OF THEM CAN
BE QUITE SPECIAL.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:07.750
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN
THE SUPERMAN-BATMAN DYNAMIC.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:11.310
MORE RECENTLY THE
SUPERMAN-WONDER WOMAN DYNAMIC.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:12.830
CERTAINLY WITH THE LEGION,

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:17.710
WHERE SUPERBOY WAS FLAT-OUT
INSPIRATION FOR THEM TO EXIST,

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:22.320
THAT'S SORT OF LIKE THE ULTIMATE
COMBINATION OF CHARACTERS THERE.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.190
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE FIRST STUFF
WE GOT TO DO TOGETHER.

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:26.490
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:29.340
&gt;&gt; TOWARDS THE BEGINNING OF
YOUR CAREER AS AN ARTIST, RIGHT?

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:31.410
&gt;&gt; MM-HMM, YEP.

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:34.650
&gt;&gt; I AGREE COMPLETELY
WITH WHAT DAN SAID.

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:38.500
THE OTHER THING I THINK
THAT'S KEY ON THAT IS

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.700
WHEN YOU PUT SUPERMAN
AMONG THE OTHER HEROES,

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.270
YOU REALLY SEE HIS
ICONIC NATURE,

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:50.050
BECAUSE HE'S FUNDAMENTALLY
DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THEM.

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:53.610
THERE ARE MANY OTHER HEROES
THAT HAVE INCREDIBLE POWERS,

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:58.860
BUT IN THIS MYTHOLOGY,
HE'S THE PRIMAL FIGURE,

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:02.930
AND YOU SEE PEOPLE REACTING TO
HIM THAT WAY, AND IT'S KIND OF,

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:06.340
IF THOMAS JEFFERSON SHOWED UP
HERE AND WANTED TO GO DIGGING

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:08.630
THROUGH SOME OF THE
BOOKS IN THE LIBRARY,

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:10.810
IT WOULD BE A VERY
DIFFERENT REACTION

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:13.780
THAN THE MOST IMPRESSIVE
POLITICIAN

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:17.290
THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY FIND
IN WASHINGTON TODAY SHOWING UP

00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:18.940
AND WANTING TO DO THAT RESEARCH.

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:21.240
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:26.990
&gt;&gt; I THANK YOU BOTH.

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:29.030
THIS HAS BEEN A REALLY
AWESOME EVENT.

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:32.740
I LOVE SUPERMAN A LOT
AND IT'S AWESOME TO TALK

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:34.170
ABOUT THE MAN OF STEEL.

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:37.520
I ACTUALLY WANT TO
DIG A LITTLE DEEPER

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:41.170
INTO THE BATMAN-SUPERMAN
RELATIONSHIP SPECIFICALLY.

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:42.470
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:45.770
OF DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS
BASED ON, YOU KNOW,

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:49.050
YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING WHERE
THEY'RE FLAT-OUT ENEMIES.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:50.630
YOU CAN FIND THINGS
WHERE THEY'RE FRENEMIES,

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:52.850
YOU CAN FIND THINGS WHERE
THEY'RE THE BEST OF FRIENDS,

00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:56.020
THERE'S A TRUST BUT
VERIFY RELATIONSHIP

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:57.320
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM.

00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:00.760
I'M INTERESTED, HOW DO YOU
BOTH VIEW THAT RELATIONSHIP?

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.520
SHOULD THERE BE SOME ANTAGONISM,
SHOULD THERE BE SOME TENSION?

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:08.290
OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S
ALMOST LIKE A RELIC AND SHOULD

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:11.620
THAT BE DISPOSED OF TO TELL
NEW STORIES ABOUT BATMAN

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:14.200
AND SUPERMAN IN THAT
RELATIONSHIP?

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:18.830
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NEVER APPROACHED IT

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:20.500
AS THOUGH THEY'RE
THE BEST OF BUDDIES.

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:25.640
I THINK THERE IS AN INCREDIBLE
AMOUNT OF MUTUAL RESPECT

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.070
ON BOTH SIDES, BUT
FUNDAMENTALLY,

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:31.110
I THINK THEY OPERATE
IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:34.450
AND BECAUSE THEY OPERATE
IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS,

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:38.980
IT'S NOT AS THOUGH SUPERMAN
CATEGORICALLY APPROVES.

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:41.600
DOESN'T MEAN HE DISAPPROVES.

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:42.900
BUT I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS --

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.180
I THINK IT'S BETTER WHEN
THERE'S SOME TENSION THERE.

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:48.260
YOU KNOW, BATMAN IS A
CREATURE OF THE NIGHT.

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.870
SUPERMAN IS OF THE SUN.

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:52.170
BATMAN WEARS THE MASK.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:53.470
SUPERMAN DOES NOT.

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:56.740
ALL THAT STUFF, IT'S
THERE AS A DIFFERENCE,

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.300
BUT THOSE DIFFERENCES
MEAN SOMETHING,

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:02.930
AND I ALWAYS THINK IT'S BEEN
A LITTLE FORCED JUST TO SAY

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:04.850
BECAUSE THEY WERE IN A
TITLE FOR SO LONG THAT WAS

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:06.770
IN THE WORLD'S FINEST
COMICS THAT THEY HAVE

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:08.590
TO BE THE BEST OF BUDDIES.

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:10.740
THEY SEEM TOO DIFFERENT
THAN THAT TO ME.

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.410
AND YEAH, OPPOSITES ATTRACT

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:16.200
BUT I STILL THINK THEY'RE TOO
DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.810
&gt;&gt; I AGREE WITH WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, DAN.

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:21.200
I JUST DON'T THINK THEY'D BE
COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OTHER.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.500
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.560
&gt;&gt; THERE'S GOT TO BE A PART
OF BATMAN THAT LOOKS AND SAYS:

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:30.410
JESUS, IF I HAD THOSE POWERS,
I WOULD JUST DESTROY EVERY GUN

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:32.280
IN GOTHAM CITY IN ONE NIGHT.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:36.270
I'D RUN FROM BUILDING TO
BUILDING TO BUILDING DOING THIS.

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:39.070
THE THINGS I WOULD BE ABLE
TO ACCOMPLISH WITH IT.

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:42.540
AND SUPERMAN AT THE
SAME TIME WOULD LOOK

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:48.940
AT THE METHODOLOGY
BATMAN USES, THE EMPHASIS

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:52.910
ON FEAR, AND BE TURNED OFF.

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:55.330
IT WOULD BE SOMETHING HE'D
JUST BE TOTALLY UNCOMFORTABLE

00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:59.630
WITH ON SOME VERY BASIC LEVEL.

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:04.770
IT'S CHALLENGING WRITING
ANYTHING LIKE JUSTICE LEAGUE,

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:08.170
BECAUSE YOU BRING TOGETHER
CHARACTERS WHO HAVE

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:10.760
SUCH FUNDAMENTALLY
DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW.

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:13.120
ON ONE LEVEL, IT'S GREAT BECAUSE
YOU REALLY AS DAN WAS SAYING,

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:18.570
YOU GET TO SHOW THE
CONFLICT POINTS BETWEEN THEM

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.910
THAT HEIGHTEN THE RELATIONSHIPS.

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:22.390
AND WE RECOGNIZE IT AS PEOPLE.

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:26.480
IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN THE
RELATIONSHIPS WE SEE IN MEMBERS

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.690
OF A SPORTS TEAM WHO ARE BROUGHT
TOGETHER FOR THE SAME GOAL,

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:31.250
BUT ONE OF THEM'S A SHOW-OFF

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:34.340
AND THE OTHER ONE IS A
GREAT TEAM PLAYER AND ONE

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.690
OF THEM'S ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT
WHAT THE NEXT PLAY MIGHT BE

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:40.190
AND TALKING TO THE COACH
AND OUTTHINKING THEM.

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:44.840
SO IT'S VERY HUMAN
AND RECOGNIZABLE.

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:49.530
BUT IT'S VERY CHALLENGING TO
PUT THAT TOGETHER AND SAY:

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:50.830
WOULD THEY STAY TOGETHER?

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:53.390
WOULD THEY PLAY NICELY TOGETHER?

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:59.590
&gt;&gt; HEY, PROFESSOR.

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:00.910
HOW ARE YOU?

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:03.100
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.770
IT'S ANDREW DAVIS.

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:06.080
&gt;&gt; HELLO THERE.

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:09.190
&gt;&gt; SO MY QUESTION IS
PIGGYBACKING OFF THE BATMAN

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:12.840
QUESTION THAT WAS JUST
ASKED, SO NIGHTFALL CAME OUT

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:17.560
AND SUPERMAN CAME OUT
RELATIVELY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER.

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:21.150
HOW WERE YOU TWO FEELING WHEN
THOSE TWO BOOKS CAME OUT?

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:24.360
AND WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH
YOUR HEAD ON THEM COMPETING

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:28.930
WITH EACH OTHER, OR NOT
COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER?

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:34.540
&gt;&gt; MY THOUGHT WAS, OH, MY GOD,
WE'RE SELLING SO MANY COMICS.

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:35.840
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.140
&gt;&gt; THOSE WERE GOOD DAYS.

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:42.410
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS A PERIOD THERE
OF ABOUT 6 MONTHS OR A YEAR

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:46.070
WHERE WE WERE HAVING WEEKLY
MEETINGS TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:48.110
TO KEEP SOME OF THESE
THINGS IN PRINT,

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:51.230
BECAUSE IT WAS JUST
MOVING THROUGH SO QUICKLY.

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:55.520
AND IT WAS A PHENOMENAL MOMENT.

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:58.860
YOU KNOW, THE SUCCESS
OF DEATH OF SUPERMAN,

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:01.710
WHICH WAS REALLY THE
EXTRAORDINARY THING,

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:05.550
NIGHTFALL WAS SUCCESSFUL, BUT
NOWHERE NEAR IN THE SAME LEAGUE,

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:09.110
WAS NOT ANYTHING WE
WERE ANTICIPATING.

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:10.910
WE'D KILLED SUPERMAN BEFORE.

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:12.460
WE'D KILLED HIM A
COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.760
WE KILLED HIM DIFFERENT TIMES.

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.220
THEY WERE NICE STORIES.

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.360
YOU CAN ARGUE THAT THE
JERRY SIEGEL VERSION

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.940
OF KILLING SUPERMAN
IN THE '60s WAS ONE

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:24.450
OF THE BEST SUPERMAN STORIES
OF THE 1960s, BUT ULTIMATELY

00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:28.200
IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF
THINGS NOBODY CARED.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:34.510
THE RUN THAT DAN WORKED ON WITH
MIKE CARLIN AND THE WHOLE REST

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:37.490
OF THE TEAM, WHETHER IT
WAS BECAUSE IT FIRST HIT --

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:41.330
THE NEWS OF IT FIRST HIT ON A
SLOW NEWS DAY OR THE ZEITGEIST

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:46.200
OF THE WORLD HAD CHANGED, A
BUNCH OF THINGS CAME TOGETHER,

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:50.780
AND WE WERE JUST STANDING THERE
WITH A BASKET CATCHING MANNA

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.080
FROM HEAVEN FOR A WHILE.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:57.750
THIS WAS A VERY EARLY
DAYS OF DOING ANY KIND

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:01.960
OF GRAPHIC NOVEL FORMAT
TRADE PAPERBACK OR ANYTHING,

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:07.190
AND WE WANTED TO DO
A ONE-VOLUME EDITION

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:09.470
OF THE FIRST DEATH STORY.

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:13.060
WE HAD SOLD SO MANY
COPIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL,

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:17.810
SO MANY PRINTINGS, I
REMEMBER VERY VIVIDLY,

00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:20.410
THE GUYS WHO HANDLED THE NEWS
STAND SIDE OF OUR BUSINESS,

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:24.670
THE MASS MARKET DISTRIBUTION,
COMING IN AND THEY WANTED COPIES

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:28.290
OF THIS ONE-VOLUME TRADE
PAPERBACK WE WERE DOING.

00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:29.770
WELL, THAT WAS A
RETURNABLE BUSINESS,

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:32.080
SO THE MORE COPIES
YOU PRINTED FOR IT,

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.090
THE MORE RISK YOU WERE TAKING.

00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:35.830
AND THE NORMAL PRINT
RUN THAT YOU WOULD DO

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:38.250
FOR SENDING SOMETHING TO
THE NEWSSTAND IN COMICS

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:45.020
AT THAT POINT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
50,000 OR 100,000 COPIES,

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:46.730
AT MOST, OF SOMETHING.

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:50.070
AND USUALLY IT WAS A COMIC
BOOK THAT WAS A PROBABLY

00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:54.080
AT THAT TIME A DOLLAR
COMIC OR A 75-CENT COMIC,

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.220
SO THE COST TO PRINT
WASN'T VERY MUCH.

00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:00.290
IT WASN'T AN ENORMOUS
RISK TO PUT IT OUT THERE.

00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:03.520
WE SAID ALL RIGHT, LOOK AND SEE
HOW MANY YOU THINK WE CAN MOVE

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.820
THROUGH THE NEWSSTANDS.

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:07.850
THEY CAME BACK AND SAID:
OKAY, WE NEED 650,000.

00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:12.080
AND THIS WAS $3.95 I THINK
FOR THE FIRST VERSION.

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.580
&gt;&gt; $4.95. AND RIGHT BEFORE
CHRISTMAS TOO, RIGHT?

00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:17.710
&gt;&gt; SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:20.850
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WAS REALLY
A MIRACLE IS THE SPEED

00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:22.680
WITH WHICH YOU PULLED
IT TOGETHER.

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:25.540
&gt;&gt; NORMALLY SPEAKING, YOU'D
EXPECT IF YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:28.920
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO SELL
HALF OF THE COPIES YOU SHIPPED,

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:31.460
MAYBE 1/3 OF THE COPIES AND
THE REST WOULD COME BACK

00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:32.760
AND BE DEAD TREES.

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:37.470
AND -- BUT YOU ALSO MIGHT
GET ALL OF THEM BACK

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:40.900
AND WE HADN'T SENT OUT
600,000 OF ANYTHING

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:46.450
TO THE NEWSSTAND FOR, GOD,
20 YEARS AT THAT POINT.

00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:50.570
BUT WE HAD MADE ENOUGH MONEY
OFF THE PERIODICAL COPIES

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:54.080
THAT WE SAID: OKAY, WE CAN
AFFORD TO GAMBLE THIS THIS YEAR

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.850
AND WE PRINTED THE 650,000,

00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:58.730
OR WHATEVER IT WAS,
AND WE SENT IT OUT.

00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:00.330
AND THEY ALL SOLD.

00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:04.100
IT WAS AN AMAZING YEAR.

00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:05.690
&gt;&gt; GOT TIME FOR ONE
MORE QUESTION.

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:11.380
IT'S GOT TO BE REALLY GOOD.

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:12.680
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:19.690
&gt;&gt; DO YOU GET TO PICK DOOMSDAY
WHO GOT THE DEATH TO SUPERMAN?

00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:22.100
OR DID DC PICK?

00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:25.530
&gt;&gt; HELP ME OUT.

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:26.830
WHAT ABOUT PICKING
THE DEATH OF SUPERMAN?

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:28.130
DID WE...

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:29.430
&gt;&gt; DID YOU GET TO PICK DOOMSDAY?

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:32.290
OR DID DC PICK DOOMSDAY?

00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:35.260
&gt;&gt; WELL, WE DECIDED TO DO
THE DEATH OF SUPERMAN, RIGHT?

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:38.790
AND ACTUALLY, I HAD
TWO STORIES WRITTEN --

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:41.800
OR TWO IDEAS WRITTEN
ON A YELLOW LEGAL PAD.

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.910
ONE WAS DEATH OF SUPERMAN.

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:47.320
AND THE OTHER ONE WAS
MONSTER TRASHES METROPOLIS.

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:50.410
ON ANOTHER SHEET RIGHT UNDER
THAT ONE I HAD A SKETCH

00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:53.830
OF A MONSTER WITH SOME BONES
SORT OF STICKING OUT OF HIM.

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:55.740
THIS WAS ON A YELLOW LEGAL PAD.

00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:59.220
WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT A STORY
CALLED THE DEATH OF SUPERMAN.

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.400
WE WERE SEVERAL WRITERS
AND ARTISTS

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.280
AND OUR EDITORIAL TEAM
ALL IN THE ROOM TOGETHER,

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:08.330
AND WE STARTED TO FOCUS ON IT
AND THOUGHT THAT WOULD WORK OUT.

00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:10.740
BUT WE STILL DIDN'T HAVE
A NAME FOR THE MONSTER

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:14.290
OR ANYTHING ELSE, AND OUR EDITOR
WROTE: DOOMSDAY FOR SUPERMAN

00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:15.990
AT THE TOP OF THE BOARD.

00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:18.500
AND WE THEN SAID: WAIT!

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:21.590
BECAUSE BACK THEN
EVERYBODY HAD CRAZY NAMES.

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:24.070
IT WAS BLOOD THIS AND BLOOD
THAT IN A LOT OF WAYS.

00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:27.440
AND I THINK IT WAS ME BUT
I'M NOT 100% SURE SAID:

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:29.110
IS THERE ANYBODY
CALLED DOOMSDAY?

00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:31.840
AND WE ALL START, DOOMSDAY?

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:35.790
NO, THERE'S NOT SO THAT'S
HOW HE GOT THE NAME DOOMSDAY

00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:39.150
AND I HAD A LITTLE SKETCH RIGHT
THERE, SO WE SORT OF PICKED IT

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:40.460
BUT THEN BECAUSE
WE HAD AN EDITOR

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:42.850
IN THE ROOM, DC WENT FOR IT.

00:55:42.850 --> 00:55:44.150
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:45.450

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:49.960
&gt;&gt; WAS THAT HARRY?

00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:51.400
&gt;&gt; NO, THAT CAME LATER.

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:55.390
THAT WAS A MEETING
OR TWO LATER I THINK.

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:58.140
&gt;&gt; THE TWO OF YOU WERE NICE
ENOUGH, TO AWACHTLY HAVE ONE

00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:02.210
OF THE FIRST COPIES
OF THE CELEBRATION

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:04.580
OF 80 YEARS ACTION COMICS.

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:07.880
THIS ISN'T THE PERIODICAL,
THIS IS ACTUALLY THE COLLECTION

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:10.140
THAT PAUL EDITED AND PUT
TOGETHER, BECAUSE REMEMBER,

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:11.440
THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS
COMING OUT.

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.030
