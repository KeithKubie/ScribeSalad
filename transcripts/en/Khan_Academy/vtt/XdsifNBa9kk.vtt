00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.790
 

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.280
The data for three points
on a smooth function f

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.297
is given in the table.

00:00:04.297 --> 00:00:05.880
So let's actually
graph these, just so

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.980
that we can visualize
it a little bit.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.590
So our vertical axis,
let's just call that y,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.480
is equal to f of x.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.310
And then we have
our horizontal axis.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.630
We have our horizontal
axis, this is our x-axis.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.570
And we're going to
skip some space here,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.460
just because we immediately go
to very high values of f of x.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.110
And I'll even skip
some space here,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.830
since we already go up to
6.5 all the way up to 7.5.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.639
So let me just show that I'm
skipping some space here.

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:33.680
And we're going to start.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.620
Let's say this is
108, 108, 109, 110.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.160
And let's say that this right
over here is 6.5, that is 7,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.890
and then that is 7.5.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.890
And we can plot these points.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.950
6.5 comma 108.25, that'll
put us right over there.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.930
7 comma 109.45, that puts
us right around there.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:10.970
And then 7.5, 110.15 puts
us right around here.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.556
And these are just three
points on a smooth function f.

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:15.430
So we can visualize what
that smooth function

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.310
f might look like.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.540
It might look
something like this.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.380
So maybe it looks
something like this.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.494
So our smooth function
f might look something--

00:01:27.494 --> 00:01:29.160
who knows what it
looks like after this.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.370
So that's, this
right over here is,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.580
this is the graph of
y is equal to f of x,

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.330
Now let's try to
answer their questions.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.970
What is the average
rate of change

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.450
of f with respect to x as x
goes from 6.5 to 7, 7 to 7.5,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.160
and 6.5 to 7.5?

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.720
So let's do them one at time.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:59.230
6.5 to 7, our change in x here,
our change in x is 7 minus 6.5,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.100
which is equal to 0.5.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.330
And our change in y here
is equal to-- let's see.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.710
We end up at 109.45 minus
108.25, which is 1.2.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.780
So our average rate of
change over this interval

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.790
is our change in y over
our change in x, or 1.2

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.912
divided by 0.5.

00:02:23.912 --> 00:02:24.870
Let me write this down.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.610
Our change in y over our change
in x is equal to 1.2 over 0.5,

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.740
which is equal to 2.4.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.770
So this is equal to 2.4.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.850
Now let's do the next interval.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.000
Our change in x, once
again, is 7.5 minus 6.5.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.160
Change in x is still 0.5.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.940
That's hard to read, let me
write that a little bit neater.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.280
So our change in x is
still 0.5, 7 to 7.5.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.120
And our change in y, let's see.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.090
We end up at 110.15.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.810
We started at 109.45.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.320
So our change is 0.7.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.750
So it's 0.7.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.830
So our change in y over
our change in x is equal

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.030
to 0.7/0.5, which
is equal to 1.4.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.075
And so you can see that
the slope of the secant

00:03:22.075 --> 00:03:23.450
line-- this
essentially the slope

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.420
of the secant line
between these two points.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.610
So this one, this
one right over here--

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.540
let me try my best to draw it.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.730
This one right over here.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.630
You can see it's steeper
than the second one,

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.450
than this secant
line right over here,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.284
than this secant line
right over there.

00:03:40.284 --> 00:03:42.700
And now let's find the slope--
the average rate of change.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.180
I should say, or the
slope of the secant.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.790
The average rate of change
over this interval, which

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.831
is the same thing as the
slope of the secant line

00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:49.980
between that point
and that point.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.022
So let's think
about our delta x.

00:03:54.022 --> 00:03:55.230
And maybe I'll do it up here.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.250
So our delta x, we're
going from 6.5 to 7.5.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.120
So our delta x is equal to
1 and what is our delta y?

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.550
So our delta y, our change
in y, is equal to, let's see.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.240
We end up at 110.15.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.450
We started at 108.25.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:22.150
110.15 minus 108.25,
we increase by 1.9.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.560
So our change in y over change
in x is equal to 1.9 over 1,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.040
which is equal to 1.9.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.770
Fair enough.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.150
And that's the slope of this
secant line between this point

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.520
and this point right over here.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.534
Slope of the secant line.

00:04:38.534 --> 00:04:39.950
It would look
something like that.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.234
You see that it's slightly less
steep than the magenta secant,

00:04:43.234 --> 00:04:45.400
and it's slightly more steep
than the orange secant.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.670
It's kind of in between the two.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.980
Now they ask us
this final question.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.060
Use the average rate of
change of f on the larger

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.760
interval from here to here--
which we already figured out,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.270
that's 1.9-- as an approximation
for the slope of the line

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.980
tangent to f at x equals 7.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.310
So we're trying to approximate
the slope of the line

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.310
tangent to f at f equals 7.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.726
So the line tangent might
look something like this.

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.100
And we see, at
least visually, it

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.410
looks like that little
blue line we drew.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.702
This one right over here does
look like it's-- at least

00:05:15.702 --> 00:05:18.034
the way I've drawn it-- it
looks like it's a pretty good

00:05:18.034 --> 00:05:19.760
approximation for
the slope up there.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.930
So we'll use this as the
slope, as an approximation

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.840
for the slope of the tangent
line to f at x equals 7.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:36.740
They say, write an equation for
the line tangent f at 709.45

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.827
using point slope form.

00:05:37.827 --> 00:05:39.410
So it's going to be
a line where we're

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.090
going to use this as an
approximation for slope.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.930
And it's going to
contain this line.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:45.600
It's tangent.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.112
It touches to the
curve at this point.

00:05:48.112 --> 00:05:49.945
And so point slope form,
just as a reminder,

00:05:49.945 --> 00:05:54.040
it's just another way of saying
that every point on this line,

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.400
every point on
this line, x comma

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.660
y-- If we were to find
the change in x and change

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.180
in y relative to this
point right over here,

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.840
it's always going to
have a constant slope.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.320
So one way you could say is
if you take an arbitrary point

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.510
x, y on this line, you
could say your change in y.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:21.960
So y minus 109.45
over your change

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.160
in x, so we know that
the 0.7 is there.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:36.290
Or the 0.7 is-- when x is
equal to 7, f of x is 109.45.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.530
So we're referencing
the same point.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.900
When our change in x is x
minus 7, our change in y

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.630
is y minus 109.45.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.020
And this is always going
to be constant for any x, y

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.980
that I pick on this line there.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.970
And we're using this
as an approximation

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.230
for what that's going to be.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.795
That's going to be equal to 1.9.

00:06:54.795 --> 00:06:56.670
So if you want to put
it in point slope form,

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.850
you just multiply both
sides times x minus 7.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:10.460
And you get y minus 109.45 is
equal to 1.9 times x minus 7.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.620
And we are done.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.200
That is an approximation.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.570
We've approximated the slope.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.111
And if this was the
slope, this would

00:07:16.111 --> 00:07:20.360
be the equation of the tangent
line in point slope form.
