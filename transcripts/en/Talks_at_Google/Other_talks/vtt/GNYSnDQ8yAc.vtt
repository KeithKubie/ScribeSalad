VAN RIPER: Welcome,
everyone in the room here,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.721
and those of you that are
watching on Livestream,

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:06.610
or watching the recording
later, also welcome.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.770
I'm Van Riper.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.850
I run the gPause
program here at Google,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.440
which is-- mission is to support
communities of mindful living

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.470
at every Google office.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.900
Yes, it's a fun job.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.490
Today we have Lane Michel here.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.480
And he's going to introduce
the research tools and concrete

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.280
practices that increase
well-being, mental clarity,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.550
performance, and
emotional stability

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.410
when our heart and mind
work better together.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.930
As a coach and
consultant, he has

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.870
helped many people and
companies reach deep

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.410
into their truth to make
positive, sustained changes.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.330
Lane is the founder
of VeraHeart,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.310
living his heart adventure
as an engineer, executive,

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.480
entrepreneur, inspirational
guide, writer,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.760
and HeartMath certified trainer.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.042
Please join me in
welcoming Lane Michel.

00:00:53.042 --> 00:00:54.000
LANE MICHEL: Thank you.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.840
Thank you.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.810
Really an honor to
be with you guys,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.710
and be connected in helping out
with the gPause group as well,

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.960
which is pretty phenomenal.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.450
When I started VeraHeart
a couple of years ago,

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.600
it was really with the
idea that this was the time

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.010
to advance mindfulness and
what I was calling heartfulness

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.160
in business, but in our
personal lives as well.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.220
And that led to
building or searching

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.330
for best materials
for empowerment

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.800
for supporting choice
and for supporting

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.180
being more in our own energy.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.380
And extending that
to organizations,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.560
so that organizations
could become energized.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.210
And VeraHeart's tagline is about
developing energized people

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.580
and companies.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.390
And this whole idea of opening
up the energy that we have,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.090
unleashing new potential, is a
very exciting time right now.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.740
The part I want to share
with you in this segment

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.780
is about human
energy, our system,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.330
and how some biofeedback
tools, the research and science

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.260
behind those, is
helping to improve

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.530
how we can access
more of our energy,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.900
build more of our energy.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.800
And frankly, achieve
more as well,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.370
both personally and as
organizations come together

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.130
using these practices as a team.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.120
So that's where we're going to
focus on those elements today.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.230
First of all, so hashtags.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.170
I go out and search for anything
to do with energy and people.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.590
And what do you
imagine that I find?

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.220
It's oil, petroleum, it's solar.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.380
The idea of we as a
human energy system

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.430
is just about nonexistent still
out in all the social media.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.790
So let's launch it.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.800
Let's get it going.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.430
So #HumanEnergy.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.740
We're going to start drawing
all this stuff together.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.670
Everything gPause is about.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.400
We're going to pull
together the ideas

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.630
that we are energy systems.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.370
And I'm going to touch on a
couple of important aspects

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.910
with us as human
energy systems related

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.510
to this topic of being able
to move with mindfulness

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.480
and heartfulness and
increase our energy.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.160
Necessarily, we've got
to touch on emotions.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.780
You go, uh, emotions.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.910
I don't want to go there.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.930
And the reality is that
I speak from experience,

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.930
not wanting to be there.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.855
Having been an engineer,
and I had a great career

00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:36.730
with Hewlett-Packard.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.580
Went into consulting.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.300
You can imagine high tech and
then management consulting.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.550
There's not a lot that deal
with emotions in there.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.490
In fact, if anything,
keep it out of the way.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.760
Don't go there.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.520
The reality is that
along the process,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.960
I've learned the
role of emotions.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.140
I've learned how those
relate to energy systems.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.830
So I'm going to share some
important points with that too.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.890
And then we're going to get into
what science research has shown

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.640
as really what we believe is
the most valuable tool for being

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.360
able to manage
your energy system,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.010
intelligently
manage your energy.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.160
Direct it and be
able to build more.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.459
So we're going to touch
on heart rate variability.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.450
That is the key metric, the
key biofeedback determinant.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.580
And we're going to demonstrate
heart rate variability used

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.990
to be able to raise energy
and deliver coherence

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.150
and resilience.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.201
Now, those may not be different
words than you've heard.

00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:34.700
They won't.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.710
But how they're
used and how they're

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.190
going to be used as
we all go forward

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.070
in managing our human energy
is very, very important.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.770
So I'm going to
help define those,

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.750
and then we're going to put
those into practice as well.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.550
So human energy.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.600
Let's start with the
idea that, first of all,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.520
we are energy systems.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.420
Now, there certainly
is human power,

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.570
which is our kinetic abilities.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.680
We can move things.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.880
We move.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.330
There is our metabolism and the
energy in our system, the power

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.320
that we have in
our system itself.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.234
We actually produce electricity.

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:19.900
And there's actually
interesting science

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.250
going on right now a la
"Matrix" that maybe we

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.910
could be our own battery.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.410
A little scary
where that might go,

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.620
having "Matrix" as the movie
still prevalent in everybody's

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.440
minds.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.200
But we do produce electricity.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.050
Maybe only four watts, but
maybe there's way to harness

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.040
more of that.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.800
And the reality in what we think
of as the energy and the power

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.750
that we typically understand
that we have, it's depleted,

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.330
it's used, it's inefficient.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.000
We have more heat in
the production of energy

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.530
that is heat loss.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.490
And so loss of energy.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.110
Most of the time, when we talk
to people about human energy,

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.630
it's about the loss and the
inefficiency of our system

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.070
and losing energy.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.530
And the reality is
that we're going

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.920
to turn that upside
down here, because what

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.620
we have to recognize is
that as humans, we expend

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.820
and renew energy all day long.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:29.230
And in that process,
two important aspects

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.530
that you may not know about
that science discovered.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.880
One is that we have the
ability to produce energy

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.260
from our heart.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.450
And we have a heart field,
an electromagnetic field

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.400
of our heart.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.740
This is a computer
generated model

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.500
representing the heart
field that has been

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.250
measured with magnetometers.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.130
That heart field extends
three feet out from your body.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.450
So what I want you to do it
just reach your arms out.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.280
Go ahead.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.990
Intrude on your neighbors.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.200
Now, that's a little bit less
than your heart field that's

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.240
generating right now.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.000
How is that as everybody
arms were over each other?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.090
Well, the reality is
all of your heart fields

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.280
are intermingling as well.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.940
And we're going to come
back to that point.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.550
Your heart, as an electrical
device, as your heart beats,

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.170
it is creating an
electromagnetic field.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.630
And that is this
three foot field.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.960
And there are other devices
that measure it much, much wider

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.664
as well.

00:07:32.664 --> 00:07:34.580
But let's stick with
that where the science is

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.630
behind this magnetic field,
this electromagnetic field

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.810
that we have of the heart.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.320
And the idea that
your heart continues

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.430
to beat in producing that field.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.800
And we're not talking about
auras, or more esoteric

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.740
or eastern belief in this.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.560
We're talking about real,
measurable electromagnetic

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.710
field that you have, we all
have, as long as we're alive.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.900
The other thing is to think
about this energy that's

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.940
being produced in this
electromagnetic field

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.800
that you have, it's
a carrier wave.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.820
It is a carrier of what
you are experiencing

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.350
through your heart.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.630
And what I'm telling you is
that your intentions, thoughts,

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.470
and your emotions are
carried as messages

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.240
in your electromagnetic field.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.460
What do I mean by that?

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:33.950
Have you walked into a room and
felt kind of dread, or like,

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.600
uh, this is icky, or
not this meeting again.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.841
Well, that could
be other reasons.

00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:41.799
But have you had that
experience where you just

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:44.039
don't want to be in that spot?

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.590
Well, what's happening
is you as a sensor

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:51.170
in this electromagnetic field,
you are receiving information.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.440
But you're also transmitting
information as well.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.400
If you have been
in a place where

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.190
it was feeling down like
that, and somebody walks in

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.910
and they shift the energy in the
room, or you walk into a room

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.660
and the energy feels very
different and you're lifted,

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.610
what's happened there?

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:15.170
It is this whole interchange
of this electromagnetic field,

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.390
the heart fields,
that is at play here.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:22.160
It's a real and tangible
sense that you have.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.280
It's a tool you have as well.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.070
It's part of your human energy.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.950
And science calls that, by the
way, a coherent field effect

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.910
that is real and measurable.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.160
The more that we
all synchronize--

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.300
and we're going
to do some work--

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.080
the more we all synchronize
and our heart fields

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.260
become coherent, that
coherent field effect creates

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.630
that environment that is
a positive and uplifting

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:47.400
environment.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.000
A lot of mindfulness
practice in the meditation

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.360
or the breathing, the work
of mindfulness itself,

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.110
is even feeding-- it is feeding
this coherent field effect.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.260
So we're going to
build on that as well.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:05.200
So electromagnetic field
three feet from you.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.360
The other thing with the
human energy to touch on

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.080
is that, I mentioned,
you're a battery.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.080
You really are.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.470
We're all batteries.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.990
What do batteries do?

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.640
They charge and discharge.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.780
In the case of the battery,
what we're talking about here

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:25.080
is renewing and
depleting all day long.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.810
So what are some of the things
that we are renewing with?

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.010
Well, the biggest one
we're supposed to renew

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.910
and regenerate is with sleep.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:37.400
Our sleep cycle is the
biggest regenerator

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.550
that we have of
our human energy.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:46.070
If we're not getting sleep,
and we sustain sleeplessness,

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.327
you never get ahead
of-- have enough energy.

00:10:48.327 --> 00:10:49.910
And you get towards
the end of the day

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:54.490
and you just don't have
enough left, right?

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:58.580
So another generator,
though, is the practices

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.470
that we can do that,
through our heart

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.670
and through our
psychophysiology,

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.080
are able to produce
and lift energy,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:13.660
to draw more energy in as a
part of our human energy system.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:21.860
And so that kind of work is
facilitated through the devices

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.730
that we're going to
demonstrate today.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.650
The practices that
we can do that

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:31.840
allow us to harness breath as
the number one tool for being

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.400
able to produce our energy.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:41.680
So as a battery, think
about these two questions.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.710
Each day, right now, you
can think about how are you

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.340
charging your battery?

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.730
Are you getting enough sleep?

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:54.250
Well, maybe not.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.610
Are you having broken sleep?

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.260
If you start with sleep
and sleeplessness,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.520
sleepless disorders are a
big reason for our discharge

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.540
and our inability to bring
up that battery-- bring up

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.940
our human energy
and our potential.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.570
Are you doing things that
allow you to take a break?

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.170
Are you getting into nature?

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.800
Are you finding the
ways that you are

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.670
able to charge your battery?

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.800
There's something
that we're going

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.450
to talk about here about
appreciation and compassion

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.850
and care.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:33.250
Accessing that turns out to be
a big lift of energy as well.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.730
What about depleting
or draining?

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.170
What's going on that depletes
or drains your battery?

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:43.680
If you allow the first two
or three thoughts to come in,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.980
I would pretty much guess
that something emotional

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.080
is in that list.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.990
Something has happened that
is draining your battery.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.630
But it can come from
any of four domains.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.220
It can come from
the physical domain.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.250
Maybe you just really
exhausted your body.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.300
You did a major workout
but didn't allow yourself

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.030
the time to rebuild.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:12.700
Maybe you've got
accumulated things

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.040
that are going in your
physiology that don't allow you

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.100
to efficiently, in
your systems, be

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.660
able to generate more energy.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.730
The emotional domain
over there turns out

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.520
to be the most
important in terms

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.840
of being able to build
energy, or stop the discharge

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.680
or release of energy.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.130
Mentally, this is something
we all in high tech

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:40.590
have got a real challenge.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.400
We are continually processing.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.486
I tell people all the
time, I have an A, B, C,

00:13:45.486 --> 00:13:49.460
and a D processor, and the C
and D never stop, for sure.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.172
I try to hold the A processor
in the front, which is

00:13:52.172 --> 00:13:53.380
problem solving all the time.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.550
But the reality is,
all four are working

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.010
in that hyper-mental state.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:01.640
I could be exhausting
my energy in that place.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.960
And then even in
terms of spiritually.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.560
Are we operating within some
place that is in our values?

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.640
I go to a lot of
places where we're

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.130
going to work on the
culture of the company.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.830
And the people's values and
the values of the company

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:16.460
don't match.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.590
And in this domain
over here, people

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:22.010
feel exhausted just
walking in the door.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.000
So you can look at all
four of these domains

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.181
for how you're charging and how
you are depleting your energy.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.490
Which brings us
over to emotions.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.260
Now, here's something.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.440
Heart-mind connection.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.300
Let's explore that
just a little bit.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.950
Emotions are key to energy.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.750
I've said that before.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.680
There's something
that happens that when

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:51.290
you experience an emotion,
either deceiving or renewing.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:56.820
Depleting emotion might be
anger, frustration, anxiety.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.890
When you experience one of those
negative emotions or depleting

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:05.640
emotions, it launches a 1,400
biochemical, hormonal set

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.560
of changes in your body that
have as much as a 12-hour tail

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.394
to them.

00:15:10.394 --> 00:15:11.310
Now, think about that.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:17.630
That cascade of biochemical
and hormonal reactions is real.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.300
It's measurable.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.480
And it has an effect
on both your psyche

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.160
and your physiology both.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.710
It sustains for a long
period of time as well.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:35.540
In the renewing side,
so happiness aspects,

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:40.150
joy, appreciation,
they also, by the way,

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.120
have an equivalent
1,400 biochemical

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.170
and hormonal cascade
effect in your body that

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.860
also can have a 12-hour tail.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.170
What's going on
the depleting side

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:54.510
is the release of, in
particular, cortisol and all

00:15:54.510 --> 00:16:01.130
the effects that cortisol,
that kind of drug in our system

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:05.430
that just takes us down and
hard to get out of a cycle.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:09.610
Or on the renewing side
is the release of DHEA.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:14.380
And DHEA is that
joy kind of hormone.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.340
It's the one that
we want to feel.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.240
It's bliss.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.050
The reality is
that our bodies are

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:25.450
trying, as human energy systems,
trying to balance those.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.610
And it's through our
autonomic nervous system

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.480
that that balancing
effect is going

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.850
on continuously all day long
through the sympathetic,

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.850
hitting the gas, and
the parasympathetic,

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:39.080
hitting the brake,
part of our system.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.970
We're wired to have this
continual back and forth

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:46.760
to be able to balance our
system and balance our bodies.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.660
Our heart sits right in the
middle of that whole process.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:56.690
Our heart is where emotions
are being encoded and affecting

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.030
our energy and what
we do all day long.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:03.760
That autonomic nervous
system regulates about 90%

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.450
of your energy and the
functions that related to that,

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.380
so it's breathing,
heart beat, digestion,

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.210
immune, hormonal responses.

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:18.760
They're all affected in our
autonomic nervous system.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.770
So the emotions part
gets very interesting,

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.370
because with our
emotions, did you

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:28.890
know you have 40,000
neurons in your heart?

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.990
How many people knew that?

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.930
OK, a few.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:37.290
And just to be complete, by
the way, you have 86 billion

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:41.480
in your brain, and you have
about 100 million in your gut.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.320
And those are all
interconnected.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.217
Now, the 40,000 neurons in
your heart, very interesting.

00:17:48.217 --> 00:17:50.050
These have been known
about for a long time,

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:55.570
but only it was about 20 years
ago began to be explored more.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:57.950
And the organization that
VeraHeart is aligned with,

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:02.240
the Institute of HeartMath,
is the leading researchers

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.150
and practitioners.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.550
A lot of what we're covering
here and the devices

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:09.680
that we're going to use are
from Institute of HeartMath,

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.590
where they've explored
what's going on

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.800
with the heart-mind connection.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.260
What's going on
with these neurons.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.530
For instance, here's a little
known fact, but very important.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.640
There's a cluster of these
neurons in your heart

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.910
that when you hold a feeling
of appreciation, care,

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.230
or compassion for
just about 10 seconds,

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.360
you hold that, you feel
it in your heart, that

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.670
sends a message to the
frontal cortex of your brain.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:45.010
And it launches a very specific
hormonal and biochemical set

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:49.330
of changes in your body
that carry joy and carry

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.680
appreciation, carry it
throughout your system.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.890
You're in control of
that through being

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:57.170
able to hold that
kind of attention

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:59.460
with appreciation,
care, or compassion.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.780
Again, research
proven, peer reviewed,

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.200
published research that
is out there that's

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:10.760
talking about this heart-mind
connection with emotions.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:16.440
Our emotions are really
centered through communication

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.030
with the heart to the brain,
and through the channel

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.270
of the brain, the
medulla and the amygdala.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:25.560
And then up into the cortex.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.280
The reality is when you
measure the communications that

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.600
are happening through the vagus
nerve, through this connection

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.320
here, the heart is
communicating way more

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.654
with the brain than the
brain with the heart.

00:19:37.654 --> 00:19:38.570
Let me say that again.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.560
The heart is continually
communicating

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.850
more with the brain than
the brain with the heart.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.077
A significant disparity in that.

00:19:46.077 --> 00:19:48.160
The heart is trying to
send messages all the time.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.050
The heart is sending
those same messages

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.460
in an electromagnetic field.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:56.470
And by being able to
do spectral analysis

00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:00.630
of our electromagnetic-- your
heart field, science now,

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:04.420
researchers can predict
with 75% accuracy what

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.500
emotions you're experiencing.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.120
That's pretty phenomenal
to be 75% accurate

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.040
using spectral analysis of
your electromagnetic field

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.020
on emotions.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.160
Your emotions are
centered around

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.470
this heart-mind connection.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.460
And that's what's taken
VeraHeart, my company, and us

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.170
into focusing more
on, so what really

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.850
is going on with the heart
in these communications that

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.220
are continually happening?

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.410
What the heart is signaling.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:39.400
There's other research
that really astounded me.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.140
What researchers love to
do is to hook up people

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.340
to computers, of course, right?

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.720
Brain activity,
heart monitoring,

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.800
skin conductance, so on.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.040
And in this particular
study, there

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.640
was a very significant
breakthrough done

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.120
with Institute of HeartMath.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.110
They would serve up
either a horrific image

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:03.490
or a beautiful, joyful
image, randomly selected

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.640
by the computer.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.460
And the participants that
went through that study,

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.340
they had control.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.930
They had the clicker to decide
when the image would come up.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.450
Peer reviewed study itself.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:18.300
And here's what the
astounding thing for me.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:23.900
Before the computer randomly
selected whichever image,

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.090
the heart knew with
a greater accuracy

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.680
whether it was the
horrific or the beautiful,

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.580
and sent a message to the brain.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:36.320
That's before the image was
selected by the computer.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.870
And then the image
comes, sensory,

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:41.960
we get the visual sense.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.010
The brain then gets the
message and then sends

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.000
a whole lot of messages
out through the body.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.890
What is going on there?

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:53.560
That is a huge, huge
piece of science

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.850
that is just now
being dug into deeper.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:59.420
Our heart knows something more.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.040
Our heart is sensing
things in this field.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.690
Our heart is connected
to our brain,

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:07.790
trying to help our brain
be prepared for what

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:09.540
we are going to experience.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.070
Be prepared for
lifting our energy.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:14.570
Remember, the heart is connected
to our autonomic nervous

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:15.970
system, obviously.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.420
And it is sending signals
through the system,

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:23.010
causing this release of
chemical and hormonal changes

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:23.880
in our body.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.650
Your heart is way
more active in what

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:31.050
is going on with your
energy than you're aware.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:35.560
And this now is--
the good news is

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.140
that we have the ability to
manage that, intelligently

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.000
manage.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.650
And that's where we get
into heart rate variability.

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:47.780
So heart rate variability
gives us a measurable window.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.220
It gives us the tool.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.390
And what it is simply
is when we look

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:58.330
at the amount of time
between heartbeats,

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:01.840
and then we compare those,
that's heart rate variability.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.120
It's a simple measure.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.210
Now, I love simple models
and simple measures.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.660
Maybe it's because I can't
figure out the complex ones.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:11.030
Or maybe I'm just too
tired of complexity.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:14.010
But this is simple.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:18.345
It also is very quickly
becoming much, much more

00:23:18.345 --> 00:23:21.360
a reliable predictor of
many, many different things

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:26.680
in health care and the
health care research fields.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:32.050
That's fundamentally what heart
rate variability is all about.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:36.090
As the heart is sending messages
to the brain, what's happening

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:41.260
is that the variance between
heartbeats is shifting.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.680
That's a part of emotions,
thoughts coming back.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.500
This is continual interchange
and adjustment in our systems

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.120
to try to find balance.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.300
Or if the heart's
sensing something

00:23:54.300 --> 00:24:00.030
to get ready to react
to, then what happens?

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:01.420
Heart beats faster, right?

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.190
Variability.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:07.390
Shifts to be able to-- and
reflecting this increase--

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.830
a decrease in the amount
of time in between,

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.810
but the increased heart rate.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:15.290
And just the opposite
occurs as well.

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:19.790
So emotions are
changing our physiology.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.090
We talked about that.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:26.860
Well, depleting emotions create
an incoherent heart rhythm.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.660
A greater degree of
shifts in the variability

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.420
of heart rhythm.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:37.040
And renewing emotions,
those that lift our energy,

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.650
create a more harmonious
or coherent pattern

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:45.320
in the shifts of our
heart rate variability.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.910
And the physiology
too, by the way.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:52.630
As you breathe in, that
increases your heartbeat.

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.070
And as you exhale,
you get a decrease.

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:57.670
That's one effect of
increase and decrease,

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.220
but not the total effect.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:08.030
So what we have is a tool to
be able to look at heart rate

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:08.530
variability.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:11.290
Now what I want to do is
demonstrate heart rate

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:12.960
variability in action.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.370
So I need a volunteer.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:19.400
Someone who wants to come up
and experience the biofeedback

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.496
device that we have.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:25.850
OK.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.350
Come on up.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:30.760
You raised your hat.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.230
It's like an auction.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.740
You know.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.380
You had an auction paddle
that you lifted up.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.630
Thanks for coming up.

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.360
LANE MICHEL: Oh,
did I miss someone?

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.680
OK, we'll make time.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.970
Yeah, right there is good.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:45.470
All right.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:51.130
We're just going to hook that
right up to your earlobe there.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:59.660
Now, what we're actually
using is a biofeedback tool

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.770
and a piece of software
from Institute of HeartMath.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:04.900
It's called emWave.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.160
This is the emWave Pro version.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.900
So that you can
all see it and we

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.510
can demonstrate what's
going on with it,

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:14.600
the sensor is an optical sensor.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.690
It's actually detecting pulse.

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:17.680
What's your name?

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.060
AUDIENCE: Chris.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:18.851
LANE MICHEL: Chris.

00:26:18.851 --> 00:26:21.730
It's detecting Chris's pulse.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.760
And you see-- Chris
won't see, because Chris

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.510
can't turn around.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:28.960
But it's showing us that
there's a good read,

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.820
so we've got good data.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.190
This is reliable data
to be able to look

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.120
at how this device can provide
feedback or measure heart

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.460
rate variability.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.550
So as this device
is working, one

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:46.710
assumes it's just literally
trying to help encode.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:48.560
It helps encode
this variability.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:52.150
So those beat to beat
changes that are happening.

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:56.050
And as Chris is
experiencing standing here

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:59.440
with all of you staring at
Chris, who obviously loves

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.270
this, it's like his
body is reacting,

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.640
his heart is reacting.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.992
Are you reacting, do you think?

00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:07.950
AUDIENCE: A little bit.

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.680
LANE MICHEL: You don't
look like you're reacting.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.830
On the surface, you look
kind of calm there, Chris.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.970
So let me tell you
about these devices.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:21.120
First of all, this
is the emWave Pro.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.260
There's actually a
device which is emWave2.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.350
This is a standalone device
that does the exact same kind

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.470
of measures.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.540
You get software
very close to this

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.710
that you load onto your
system, Mac or Windows.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.560
And you can take this anywhere.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.430
And what it does is help--
it's an entrainment device,

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.210
a biofeedback device
that helps you

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:47.340
to find a natural way of being
able to have the kind of heart

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.850
rate variability that's going to
build coherence and resilience.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:55.170
And I'm going to start using
those terms as we go forward.

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:59.330
So with these tools-- oh,
I'm sorry. [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:02.790
There's also another device.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.330
There's an app.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.360
The current app as iOS.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.124
Why do they always start
with iOS instead of Droid?

00:28:09.124 --> 00:28:09.790
I mean, come on.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.640
Let's create a shift here.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.070
The Droid version comes out at
the end of the year, I'm told.

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:20.090
Fundamentally, this app,
this is the iOS version,

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:22.880
has the ability to
do the same thing

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.610
as that standalone device,
entrainment, biofeedback,

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:30.780
being able to use
heart rate variability.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:31.420
OK.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:35.260
So we're all going
to get a chance

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:40.210
to use the most fundamental
part of improving

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:41.220
heart rate variability.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.670
And this is called
heart focused breathing.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:49.540
And so I invite you all to do
this with Chris and myself.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.950
So in your seat, find just
a comfortable position

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:53.570
in your seat.

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:54.495
Are you comfortable, Chris?

00:28:54.495 --> 00:28:54.900
AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:55.650
LANE MICHEL: OK.

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.920
You've looked comfortable
all along, but not really.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.420
Right?

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.730
I have data proving otherwise.

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:01.790
OK.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:06.970
So in that comfortable place,
pay attention to your heart

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.000
now.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.230
If you want to, you can put
your hand over your heart.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.580
Begin breathing through your
heart, through your chest area.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.500
Breathe a little deeper
and slower than normal.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:23.690
Five seconds in and
five seconds out.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:34.677
Again, five seconds in
and five seconds out.

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:47.070
Five seconds in and
five seconds out.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:50.050
Continue that breathing.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:54.670
And as you're breathing a little
slower and deeper than usual,

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:58.930
just allow your mind to give
you a feeling of appreciation,

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.200
care, compassion for
someone or something.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.530
Whatever comes in.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:05.017
Allow it to come in and
just hold that in your heart

00:30:05.017 --> 00:30:05.850
as you're breathing.

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:15.480
Continue the five seconds
in and five seconds out.

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:33.362
We'll do one more cycle of five
seconds in and five seconds

00:30:33.362 --> 00:30:33.862
out.

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.870
OK.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.630
So I'll stop the data recording.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.057
Chris, thank you.

00:30:43.057 --> 00:30:44.140
We're going to let you go.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.131
This way you get to
see your data too.

00:30:48.131 --> 00:30:48.630
OK.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:51.225
Well, first of all, Chris,
you're going to live.

00:30:51.225 --> 00:30:53.510
That's the good news.

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:56.870
All kidding aside, turns out
that heart rate variability

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:59.410
is one of the emerging
best predictors

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:02.290
of all cause mortality.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:05.030
That is a very
fancy way of saying

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:10.580
if you want to know if you're
building longevity or not,

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.320
this is a good
indicator of that.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.510
In fact, heart
rate variability is

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:17.010
now, through the
research being done,

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:21.370
is able to predict someone's
age within about four years.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:25.660
And that is because that what
happens is when we're younger,

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:30.530
we have greater variability,
greater amplitude in this wave.

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:34.040
And that reduces over the years.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.150
And so given no other
changes, science

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:40.870
can predict your age
within about four years.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:43.420
But the good news is
you can fool science

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.051
by working with
these kinds of tools.

00:31:45.051 --> 00:31:46.050
So here's what happened.

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:48.410
We hooked up Chris.

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:52.207
Chris is actually-- Chris,
are you in the gPause group?

00:31:52.207 --> 00:31:52.790
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:53.310
LANE MICHEL: OK.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.060
So you might have been
using some of that,

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.350
or you might just have
all the benefits of gPause

00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:01.780
already going that's not too
bad of a range of rhythm that's

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:02.280
going.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:08.140
Right here is where we started
the heart focused breathing.

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:11.710
And what do you notice
about the change in there?

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:14.390
I look at it and say,
well, first of all, there's

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:18.300
a more even kind of
wave that's going on.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:19.950
There's greater amplitude.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:22.610
And it's clustered
together as well.

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:27.570
And you have about a 15
point spread over here.

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.080
What you want to have
is something that

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.120
looks kind of like a sine wave.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.310
That's showing a level of
coherence in heart rate

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:37.460
variability.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.770
And then the more
amplitude, that's

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:42.750
indicating more resilience.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:47.200
That's indicating more
youth, is one way people

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.630
like it described.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:49.900
OK, good.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.090
How are we doing time-wise?

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:57.950
I think we're doing OK
to bring up one more.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.810
Did you want to come up?

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.400
Now that you've seen it?

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.960
Come on, why not?

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.130
We've got time.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.720
AUDIENCE: What does
the red indicate?

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:10.380
LANE MICHEL: That
is a drop of data.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.950
And then the pickup of data
indicates that it's still

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:20.950
a valuable set of data.

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:21.670
What's your name?

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:22.420
AUDIENCE: Tiffany.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.295
LANE MICHEL: Tiffany.

00:33:23.295 --> 00:33:25.227
Welcome Tiffany.

00:33:25.227 --> 00:33:26.060
I should have asked.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.200
OK to hook you up?

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.460
AUDIENCE: Is this live?

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.470
LANE MICHEL: It is now.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:32.970
OK.

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:35.650
So what we're
going to do is just

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:37.900
get Tiffany started out now.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:43.870
Tiffany has a little advantage
in that Chris kind of was

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:46.180
the real Guinea
pig and didn't have

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:50.380
the benefit of all the other
pieces that we went through.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.140
So you have a little
bit more responsibility

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.170
to generate a sine wave.

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:58.520
No pressure, Tiffany, at all.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.440
Have you been up in
front of groups before?

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:05.200
LANE MICHEL: See, this is like
interesting how-- so you're

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.060
kind of in an even place?

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.266
You don't feel
stressed or anything?

00:34:09.266 --> 00:34:10.730
AUDIENCE: Not particularly.

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:12.666
More and more.

00:34:12.666 --> 00:34:13.790
LANE MICHEL: More and more?

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:16.190
The more I talk?

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:17.409
OK.

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:19.560
So what we're going
to do is as a group,

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.469
we're going to do the heart
focused breathing again.

00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:25.659
And we'll step into that.

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:30.169
Go ahead and pay attention
to the area of your heart.

00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:31.710
You can put your
hand over your heart

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.800
if you want to, feeling
your chest rise and fall.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.860
Begin breathing through your
heart or your chest area,

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.170
just a little slower
and deeper than usual.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:44.203
Five seconds in and five seconds
out is a very good pattern.

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:01.260
Five seconds out, breathing out.

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.600
And five seconds in.

00:35:05.725 --> 00:35:06.990
Five seconds out.

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:17.750
Now, as you're continuing this
five seconds in and out rhythm,

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:21.510
allow your mind to give you a
feeling of appreciation, care,

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:23.392
and compassion for
someone or something.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.366
Hold that in your heart.

00:35:32.215 --> 00:35:33.006
Continue breathing.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:50.000
We'll do one more cycle, five
seconds in, five seconds out.

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:58.660
Great.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:03.480
Now come back to center
in your chair, eyes open.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.965
Oh, let me shut
you off here first.

00:36:05.965 --> 00:36:07.340
Wouldn't want you
to get a shock.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.600
No, there's no shock.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.866
Thank you, Tiffany.

00:36:10.866 --> 00:36:14.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:17.975
So we can look at
Tiffany's data.

00:36:17.975 --> 00:36:20.040
I could adjust the
scale, but don't need to.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.490
We started out, and
she was pre-practiced.

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:23.860
Already knew what was coming.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.820
But this was kind
of just sitting

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.150
in the chair for
just about a minute.

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:32.240
And then we started the
heart focused breathing.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:36.600
And you very quickly went
right into a sinus rhythm.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.880
Just a very nice
sine wave and flow.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.790
You have an amplitude.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.810
This-- we could pull
up the data but it

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:46.130
won't be much below here--
of somewhere around 10

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:48.610
to 15 points.

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:52.480
So Chris had you a little
bit beat there in resilience.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.220
Not that there has
to be a competition,

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.420
but you have a new goal.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:00.600
OK, well, thank you for both
for being our Guinea pigs

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.950
and demonstrating the tool.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:05.115
This data that
comes from the tool

00:37:05.115 --> 00:37:11.540
is the same data that used in
the devices that I showed you.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:15.420
And it allows you to be able
to train yourself and get

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:19.490
the benefits of what's happening
with heart rate variability.

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:24.970
So in recap, this is actually
the same kind of process.

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:29.140
Somebody sitting up in a chair.

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:32.600
And at the point the data
ends here, come around here,

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.430
they begin heart
focused breathing

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:37.350
and that additional
part that I added

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:39.370
in which is called
a heart lock-in,

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:42.570
in Institute of HeartMath terms.

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.920
What's happening
in this top scale,

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.800
was for Chris and a
little bit for Tiffany,

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.240
is a more erratic, more
incoherent type of pattern

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.850
in the biofeedback tool.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:57.790
And that's indicating that--
that jerky pattern is generated

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:01.670
indicating that their autonomic
nervous system is doing

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:04.940
a lot of adjustments, between
the release of cortisol

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:09.240
or DHEA, the messages
with emotions experienced.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.530
Maybe sitting in
front of an audience.

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:13.550
It might be a phone
call that you're on,

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:15.880
or a phone call that
you have to make.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.750
Anything that
could-- or an in-law.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:22.240
Something would
cause you to have

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.130
this kind of erratic pattern.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:26.595
Why is Danielle laughing?

00:38:26.595 --> 00:38:27.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.700
We'll talk later.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:33.990
So this erratic pattern
here impairs performance.

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:36.850
In fact, it greatly
impairs performance.

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:41.680
It is a huge indicator
of confusion,

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.980
of depleting energy, in
particular that we talked about

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:51.000
before, it's an indicator
of even impaired judgment.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.650
Communication won't be as clear.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:56.710
A whole lot of factors
have been tested, measured,

00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:01.800
and they indicate a lot of
times why teens have problems

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.760
in working together too.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:08.250
As opposed to establishing
this kind of more sine wave

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:11.850
pattern, where we can
reach optimal performance.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:14.700
And the thing that VeraHeart,
we're doing right now is we're

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.930
teaming up with some-- our
coaches and consultants teaming

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:23.200
up with others to begin
working with companies, teams

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.830
and companies, to shift
them out of there into this.

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:29.880
And measure the
difference in achievement

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.900
in terms of what
their goals are.

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.170
And also happiness
at work, being

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:37.110
able to be more
fulfilled at work,

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.610
express their values, and so on.

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:40.800
A lot of different factors.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.270
So that's what we're
doing with heart rate

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:45.950
variability with our people.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:48.810
This is the devices that
I held up and shared.

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:50.980
They're available through
VeraHeart or directly

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:54.200
from Institute of HeartMath.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.590
$129 to $199 are the prices.

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:58.950
They're very affordable devices.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:01.870
These devices have
been out-- the emWave

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.930
has been over 10 years.

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:07.560
And it's gone through
a generation of change.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.710
The iOS version of this Inner
Balance and the Droid versions

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.500
coming out are newer.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.570
But they fundamentally
are using the same proven,

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:20.110
tested algorithms,
same kind of tools

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:25.440
to be able to continue to build
more coherence and resilience.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.670
So let's talk about
those now, because I've

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:30.170
been hinting around to
them for a little bit.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:32.270
Coherence.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:35.360
Full disclosure-- that's
my sine wave up there.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.990
That's my run from
about a week ago.

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:41.890
I'm trying to get
more resilience,

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:44.870
but coherence, that's
looking pretty good.

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:48.630
Now, also in full disclosure,
six months ago when

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:51.560
I began work, it didn't
look like that at all.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.390
It looked like that
frustration kind of curve.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:57.860
Very mental kind of,
very even emotional.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.800
I have to admit, emotional type
of effects that were there.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:05.060
But now I'm able to jump into
that kind of coherent place.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.530
So what is coherence?

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:11.320
It is defined as that optimal
state in which heart, mind,

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:16.120
and emotions are
aligned and in sync.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.350
In effect, through the
autonomic nervous system,

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:21.610
through the messages from
the heart to the brain,

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:25.020
and then the effects
that come from that.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.740
There's greater synchronization.

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:32.190
And the heart and emotions, much
more involved in that process.

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:34.360
Our immune, hormonal,
nervous systems

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:38.100
function in this
energetic coordination.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.770
That's the definition
of coherence.

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:44.120
What it means is that we are
more efficiently and more

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:48.010
intelligently managing
our human energy.

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:52.080
So this is the magic
coherence is our ability

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.100
to manage human energy.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.700
And it's represented
in that sine wave look,

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:02.470
as opposed to the jagged,
incoherent type of rhythm.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:04.320
OK?

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.560
Then there's resilience.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.680
Resilience-- now with this
knowledge of heart rate

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:14.160
variability, the tools
that you can use as well,

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.440
resilience is the ability
to build your capacity

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:22.120
for human energy, holding,
regenerating, and then using

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.660
your human energy.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.480
Say that again,
Resilience is the ability

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.700
to build your capacity
for human energy.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.700
So it's to prepare
for, recover from,

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:39.250
and adapt in the face of
stress, challenge, adversity.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:41.500
The resilience is that
measure that-- when

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.520
you're about to
go into something

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.880
that's going to be stressful,
don't just walk right in.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.030
You take just a pause.

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:51.760
Just a few seconds, even,
can make a big difference.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.940
But a few minutes can make
a whole world of difference.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.190
You can visualize going
into a resilient pattern,

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:02.530
moving from this erratic
anticipation of what's

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:05.250
going to happen,
anticipation in the emotions

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:08.110
means you're releasing
a flood of chemicals

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:09.970
that are depleting
you before you even

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:12.860
go into your situation.

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.440
You activate the
heart-mind connection,

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.875
become more resilient,
more coherent as well,

00:43:18.875 --> 00:43:21.000
and you're going to be
better prepared for whatever

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:21.760
you're going into.

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:31.160
So heart rate variability then,
it is providing all these--

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.600
I'll let you read
those benefits.

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:37.550
But fundamentally, these come
out of published, peer reviewed

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:38.322
research.

00:43:38.322 --> 00:43:41.930
Now, if you go to Google
Scholar and look at HeartMath

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:44.910
is the lead research
group for 20 years

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:47.340
in heart-mind connection.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.850
The number of citations from
other groups and them is huge.

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:54.420
There are 263 published
pieces of works

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:58.440
from Institute of HeartMath
that are heavily cited.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.550
These are results out of a
lot of these published works.

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:03.660
The science that's
been conducted behind

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.070
and the practices
that have come out

00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:08.360
of the Institute of HeartMath.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:12.010
And the work we do to
extend those practices to be

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:14.750
able to share with
you and with others.

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:21.210
There's a paper-- Rollin
McCraty is the head of research

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:22.580
for Institute of HeartMath.

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:26.950
He has a fantastic paper
that summarizes this,

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:30.540
and that I've talked about,
but a whole lot more.

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:35.550
And it's consistent heart-based,
positive emotion techniques

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:40.770
that they're looking at,
show greater self-management,

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.270
your ability to manage
your energy system,

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:46.920
and better regulation of
your physiology, even.

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:50.090
So in my book,
that means that we

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:55.890
become more resilient, more
healthy, more able to harness

00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:59.670
and access our energy in
a shorter amount of time.

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:03.120
So that paper is called
"Heart-Brain Neurodynamics."

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.230
It was published in 2015.

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:07.330
So recently done,
published piece.

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:09.940
And if you go to Google
Scholar under HeartMath,

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:12.240
you'll find that
published there.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.310
What it really comes down
to, heart rate variability,

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:21.490
if you just take five to 10
minutes, five times a week,

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:26.660
practicing that same breathing
that I just shared with you,

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.180
you will have the effect
of moving into more

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:31.840
coherence and more resilience.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:36.890
It's even that little bit
makes a huge, huge shift.

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:37.810
Now extend it.

00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:39.380
If you start your
day-- so what I did

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:42.096
was as I began working
with these tools,

00:45:42.096 --> 00:45:44.470
and I've been heavily working
with them for about a year,

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:48.610
and then six months ago, I
shifted my whole morning.

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:50.810
Now, my morning was this.

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:51.750
I got up.

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:53.670
What'd I do?

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:57.460
My phone, and began
looking at the news,

00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.450
my email, social media.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:01.760
Got a company to run.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.170
I need to know what the pulse
is in the morning, right?

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:07.610
So at 6:00 AM, I'm
already feeding myself

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:12.920
with admittedly a whole
stream of negative news,

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.800
a whole bunch of challenges
that come in on e-mail.

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:17.910
And some good things too.

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:20.630
But now I'm being
rocked both ways.

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:23.560
And I realized that that
wasn't very mindful.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.760
And it certainly
wasn't heartful.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.660
I shifted my entire routine.

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:33.820
Now the first half hour starts--
OK, big admission here-- yoga.

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:35.170
Yoga is my way of life now.

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:40.070
I mean, I really have
found the benefits of yoga.

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:42.950
That yoga that starts
out for five minutes,

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:46.090
I go into my own mantra,
my own meditation work.

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:50.120
I use this same tool here
with the HeartMath tool.

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.950
And within 30 minutes,
I've either established

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:58.750
or reestablished that coherent
rhythm and greater resilience.

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:02.400
When I've reached that level,
I'm ready to get my day going.

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.120
I'm a completely
different person.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.320
And that six months
of work, I mean,

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:11.340
it was a month of
establishing new habits,

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.200
and then maintaining
that for another month.

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.900
And it is just my habit.

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:16.140
You could do that.

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:19.920
It has a huge effect
and a huge impact.

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.730
But you can start.

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:24.440
So the HeartMath part of this?

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.460
10 minutes of my morning.

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:30.020
And I do that seven days a week.

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:33.611
That's how I got that curve,
by the way, that data run.

00:47:33.611 --> 00:47:34.110
OK.

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:40.100
So where mindfulness
meets heartful.

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:43.290
I've mentioned a
couple times pause.

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:46.640
With VeraHeart, one of the
things we're- we've threatened

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.655
to start a movement
of pause for choice.

00:47:48.655 --> 00:47:50.030
And I think we're
going to do it.

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:51.470
We got the domain name.

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:53.630
You heard it here right
now-- pauseforchoice.com.

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:56.380
We'll get it live
within a week or two.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.340
The whole idea is this.

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:01.670
I'm convinced if this
world inserted a pause

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:06.160
before speaking or
acting in any way,

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.180
and that pause can be a few
seconds to a few minutes,

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.920
we'd have a completely
different world.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.620
It allows us to
have the heart send

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.890
a message to the
brain to wake up,

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:18.970
become more aware
of mindfulness,

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:21.410
and pull ourselves
in our center.

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:25.670
And full awareness, full
attention, and intention.

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:29.400
And then we go about whatever
we have to deal with.

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.390
That golden pause
shifts everything.

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:35.170
We teach that to
everybody we work with.

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:37.090
First thing and foremost, pause.

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:40.490
And the pause begins with
even just one breath.

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:44.140
It allows you to access so
much more wisdom, so much more

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:46.920
of your energy,
your human energy.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.650
#HumanEnergy.

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:51.380
Seriously, folks,
within two weeks

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:53.510
I want that hashtag
like climbing way up,

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:56.420
because it's nowhere right now.

00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:01.550
I had our team launch like a
bunch of hashtag human energies

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:03.380
today because I
wanted to use it here.

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:04.920
And it's nowhere.

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.800
So if it goes
somewhere, thank you.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.470
You all did it.

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:10.490
And it will.

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:12.190
So pause, number one.

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:13.240
Appreciate.

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.070
So when I mentioned
let your mind

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:18.690
serve up a feeling of
appreciation, care,

00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:24.570
or compassion, that is accessing
this appreciation second step.

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:26.520
Now, here's the key.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:29.390
If you can radiate
that-- and so I used

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:33.910
radiate-- three feet,
electromagnetic field, right?

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:37.290
You've got that appreciation,
care, compassion, radiate it.

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:38.524
Send it in your field.

00:49:38.524 --> 00:49:40.440
Let it go more than three
feet, what the heck?

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.820
Have a joyful time with it.

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:46.380
That is mindfulness
meeting heartfulness.

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:47.900
Third, listen.

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:51.800
You have so much intuition,
intelligence, and wisdom

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:52.880
that you have access to.

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:57.260
And those who are in
mindfulness practices know that.

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:58.060
They access more.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:01.420
Now, bring the heart and
more with some of these tools

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:02.310
as well.

00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:04.220
And you go deeper.

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:07.700
And your senses begin to expand.

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.960
We live a lot of
life de-sensitized.

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.400
There's so much coming
at us all the time.

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:16.360
Let's reopen our senses,
and do that in a way that

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.560
allows us to be heartful.

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.730
Fourth is to connect.

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:23.670
And a good way to think in
this electromagnetic field

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:27.150
is HeartMath has a great way.

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:30.530
They say, what are you
putting in the field today?

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:32.530
So are you generating
positive thoughts?

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:34.540
Are you generating
things that help others?

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:37.420
Are you putting
love in the field?

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:39.480
Are you experiencing
thoughts of love

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.870
or are you expressing love?

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:42.310
Is that coming
out in your field?

00:50:42.310 --> 00:50:45.350
Care, compassion, things
that uplift people.

00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:49.050
You have the responsibility
for your electromagnetic field.

00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:50.690
What are you going to put in it?

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:52.620
What are you transmitting?

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.650
And fourth is solutions.

00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:57.760
We are-- listen,
it's about results.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.270
It's about achievement.

00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:02.170
We are in a world that respects
achievement and results,

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:03.430
and it should.

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:06.270
We're not doing this
just for joy and kicks.

00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:07.950
We're doing this
because we've got

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:12.070
a world that's going so
fast and accelerating more.

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:13.706
Moore's law is
not going to stop.

00:51:13.706 --> 00:51:15.330
I don't care how many
people predict it

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:17.610
over how many decades,
it doesn't stop.

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:18.300
It won't stop.

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:19.500
It's going to keep going.

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:22.340
We're going to have things
continue to accelerate,

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:24.430
not just with technology
and information,

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:30.800
but in the area of this new
space, our senses, our ability

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.360
to sense more, our ability
to be more in touch

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:37.160
with others through our field.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:41.860
And so solutions can
come in personal health,

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:46.070
but also in smarter decisions
and more results that

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:47.840
get more done.

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.900
So heart focused breathing.

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:52.980
Remember that when
we do training,

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:54.970
that is the base tool.

00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:56.285
The one that I shared with you.

00:51:56.285 --> 00:51:59.580
You can continue using
that, and expand on it

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:00.750
with the appreciation.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:05.950
But that is the most fundamental
tool and it creates the pause.

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:09.010
So recapping, I
kind of like this.

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:13.260
Scientific research has
finally collided with,

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:15.200
you can call it
spiritual practices.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:20.700
Gregg Braden actually
created that kind of idea

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:22.630
that we've brought
these two together.

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:24.340
And he's right.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:27.440
Our brain was believed
to be the master organ.

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.870
And it's not the master organ.

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:32.830
It's part of a system, a
distributed system that masters

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:33.810
who we are.

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:36.170
Our heart drives
our #HumanEnergy.

00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:42.040
And that recognition
of the role of emotions

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:46.070
is the key determinant of your
energy depleting or renewing.

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:47.930
Once you have that
in consciousness,

00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:51.580
you're already going to start
increasing your human energy,

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:54.530
increasing your personal energy.

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:57.000
The heart field is present.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:57.570
It's real.

00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:58.670
It's measurable.

00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:02.170
You're transmitting and
receiving all day long.

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:05.950
And our human energy
capacity can grow.

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:07.590
We can be more resilient.

00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:09.350
We can be more coherent.

00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:13.440
We are in control of being
able to increase that.

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.840
Published research
that's out there,

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:19.380
I encourage you to go
look into HearthMath.org.

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:23.490
Go to Google Scholar, look
at the citations here.

00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:27.460
This peer reviewed
work is fundamentally

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:31.405
starting to take hold and
launch and move forward.

00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:36.100
So thank you very much.

00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:39.520
I think we have a few
minutes for questions.

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.520
OK.

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:43.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:45.124 --> 00:53:45.999
VAN RIPER: Questions.

00:53:51.272 --> 00:53:52.938
LANE MICHEL: You can
make up a question.

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:04.925
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
about this heart field.

00:54:04.925 --> 00:54:06.300
I know that electric
fields don't

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:07.490
stop at a particular place.

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:08.580
You talked three feet.

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:12.756
What is the heart field.

00:54:12.756 --> 00:54:17.420
Is it electromagnetic field
coming out of the-- is it

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:21.880
electromagnetic
field of neurons?

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:27.234
I'm sorry, what do you see in
it when you actually measure it?

00:54:27.234 --> 00:54:28.650
I understand what
you're measuring

00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:32.180
with the pulse on the ear,
but I don't understand what

00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:33.400
you mean by the heart field.

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:35.750
LANE MICHEL: It's a
magnetometer in this case.

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:37.900
In hospitals, I believe
SQUIDs are used.

00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:42.980
But what's happening is your
heart, the way it pumps,

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.700
is through electrical signals.

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:50.550
To pump and have that
rhythm that it's got.

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:54.610
Anything that's an
electrical on and off

00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:56.900
creates a magnetic field.

00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.750
And so what you
really are generating

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:03.780
is the signals for
your heart are creating

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:06.210
that magnetic field itself.

00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:07.880
Think of it, it's
not really on-off,

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.350
but that's the way I
communicate it sometimes.

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:12.446
That boom-boom,
boom-boom, boom-boom.

00:55:12.446 --> 00:55:14.746
That creates a measurable
electronic field.

00:55:14.746 --> 00:55:16.370
Now, the other thing
that's interesting

00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:19.580
is your brain has
electrical activity too.

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:24.560
Anybody have any idea how
big the electromagnetic field

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:27.100
of the brain is?

00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:30.090
One to two inches.

00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:33.780
That's an astounding
difference in power,

00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:35.040
energy that's going on.

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:40.670
So that is a real measurable
electromagnetic field

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:46.090
from that pulse that
creates your heartbeat.

00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:46.990
OK?

00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:48.902
Did that answer your
question all the way?

00:55:48.902 --> 00:55:55.700
AUDIENCE: Well, I understand how
there is electromagnetic field

00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:58.320
created whenever you have
an alternating current

00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:58.950
in something.

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:02.800
And in a previous job,
I worked with people

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.550
who were using SQUID technology,
superconducting something

00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:11.230
or others, to measure
brain magneto dynamics,

00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:13.970
or something of the brain.

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:16.430
What I don't quite
understand is--

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:18.740
or another thing I'm a
little uncertain about

00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:24.040
is how you say that different
people's heart fields interact.

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.420
What is the receiving
part of that?

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.630
I understand how it's generated.

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:30.280
What do you mean by receiving?

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:31.050
LANE MICHEL: Yeah.

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:35.280
Well, the receiving side-- the
only way I can answer that.

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.180
I'm not a neuroscience
neuro-- actually,

00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:41.110
I have neurocardiologists
now who do this work.

00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:44.080
They're measuring
the receiving side

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:49.100
of others' emotions or other
fields as they interact.

00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:52.660
And so that can create
a coherent field

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.670
effect that's measurable.

00:56:54.670 --> 00:57:01.280
That there's an increase
in a particular coherence

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.290
of heart rhythms.

00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:06.020
So here's an example of measure.

00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:08.840
I'm Four people,
three of which do

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.097
that heart focused breathing.

00:57:10.097 --> 00:57:12.430
They've learned the techniques
to get a coherent rhythm.

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:15.790
The fourth person, no
experience, not even told.

00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:18.280
They're blind to
what's going on.

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:19.360
All get together.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.780
They're just at
the table together.

00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:25.041
All four are hooked up.

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:27.290
Some number of minutes, I
think it was six minutes in.

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:28.998
I don't remember
exactly, but some amount

00:57:28.998 --> 00:57:33.130
of time that they run, the three
are cued to start doing heart

00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:33.880
focused breathing.

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:35.440
Same thing you did.

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.290
They establish coherent field.

00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:39.860
With a very, very
short amount of time,

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:42.940
the fourth person goes
into coherence as well.

00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:44.530
And they're not
doing any breathing.

00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:47.196
They're not doing any of these--
they don't know the techniques.

00:57:47.196 --> 00:57:48.700
They're unconscious to it.

00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:52.270
They're receiving
from the others.

00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:56.100
And that's the best I can answer
in terms of the science that's

00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:57.957
going on behind it.

00:57:57.957 --> 00:57:58.790
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:57:58.790 --> 00:58:00.870
VAN RIPER: We have time for
maybe one more question.

00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:02.161
LANE MICHEL: One more question.

00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:07.950
VAN RIPER: Or not.

00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:09.100
Well, if you're-- oh.

00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:10.640
LANE MICHEL: One there.

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:13.520
AUDIENCE: So I've never
believed in people

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.040
being able to see
people's auras.

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.800
But now that you've
been saying that,

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:20.970
do you think it's possible that
people can see others auras?

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:23.050
LANE MICHEL: Well, that's
a question completely

00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:24.960
different from what
I was addressing,

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.550
but that answer is yes.

00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:27.180
I do believe.

00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:29.960
And I think there's other
things that are going on.

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:32.840
There's other intuitive
senses, other tools

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.610
that we have that
are-- they're not

00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:37.460
part of what I was
covering, but yes, I

00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:38.840
do believe that is the case.

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:43.570
And I think that's a whole
area that's opening up more.

00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:44.800
Which is just fascinating.

00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.760
Because when we talk about the
bigger topic of energy, I mean,

00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:53.290
listen, we're all just energy.

00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:56.590
Matter is just the
placement of, the potential

00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:57.560
of energy at any time.

00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:58.920
We know that from quantum side.

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:02.309
So yeah, I believe a lot more
is going to be discovered.

00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:03.350
AUDIENCE: That's awesome.

00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:03.970
Thank you.

00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:04.720
LANE MICHEL: Yeah.

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.230
We have a lot of
good fun with that.

00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:08.870
VAN RIPER: So unfortunately, we
have to wrap up today's talk.

00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:10.690
But Lane is staying
here for lunch.

00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:12.231
We're going to be
going to big table,

00:59:12.231 --> 00:59:15.680
so if anyone has a question they
were too shy to bring up here,

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.920
they can bring it
to lunch with us.

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.790
So thank you for
coming out, everyone.

00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:20.630
And thank you, Lane.

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:21.921
LANE MICHEL: Thank you so much.

00:59:21.921 --> 00:59:23.971
[APPLAUSE]
