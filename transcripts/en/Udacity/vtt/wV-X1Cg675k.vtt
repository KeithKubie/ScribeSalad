00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.120
Inside my editMenuItem function,

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.775
I see that in my render_template,
I'm passing in three variables that my

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:08.710
editmenuitem.html file is
going to have access to.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.270
The restaurant_id, the menu_id, and

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.880
i, which is going to represent
the item we want to edit.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.450
So to edit a new menu item,

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.160
I'm going to create a form, just like
I did when I created a new menu item.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.150
Inside the form I'm going to
call my edit menu item function

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.060
with the appropriate parameters.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.990
Here I'll prompt for the name of the new
menu item and create an input field.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.310
Using the placeholder attribute of HTML
I can have that field already filled out

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.670
with the name of the item
I'm going to edit.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.390
I'll then add a button called Edit.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.552
And here I create another link to
cancel just in case I realize I

00:00:39.552 --> 00:00:41.770
actually don't want to
edit my menu item.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.450
When I save and run, I see that I can
now change the name of my menu items.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.040
