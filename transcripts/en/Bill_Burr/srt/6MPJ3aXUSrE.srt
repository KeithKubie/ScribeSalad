00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,020
Just checking in on you. Listen to
this shit. I just got back from,

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,750
uh, where the hell was
I? Phoenix, Arizona.

5
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:24,340
Home of the sons home of the
coyotes home with a fucking, uh,

6
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:27,940
I dunno. Grapefruit League net. Grapefruit
League one instructional league.

7
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:30,490
I don't, what the fuck is homer?

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,130
The Diamondbacks home
with the fucking condos.

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,390
Okay.

10
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,750
All right. I just got back from
there. Okay. I'm coming home.

11
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:46,700
I'm taking a cab because I'm old. I
don't do fucking Uber. I don't do Lyft.

12
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:49,580
I don't do any of that bullshit.
All right.

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,880
I'm fucking calling somebody and they just
pull up in their car. I just, I'm not,

14
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,130
I noticed I don't do it right.
I fucking take cabs.

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,490
So I pull up to my house
and this is fucking

16
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,610
whatever state truck there for.
These fucking guys are in my yard.

17
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,160
The gates open and one of the guys got
a ladder up to the side of my house,

18
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,270
so I just walk in. I'm like, uh,
yeah. Hey, what are you guys doing?

19
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,490
And he goes up, God, somebody finally
somebody's home, and I'm like,

20
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:25,330
what do you mean my wife didn't let you
in? He was like, no, there was no answer.

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,410
And I'm like, then what are you doing
here? And he goes, well, you know,

22
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:31,960
I keep coming by. There's nobody here.
I got to check the meter. You know?

23
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,570
They'd said,
you put a new electrical box.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,500
You know you guys didn't have a home.
I mean, what was I supposed to do?

25
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,940
I was like, I don't know. Not coming
to my fucking yard. What do you,

26
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:45,700
what was I supposed to do? Every time I
go to the bank, the bank's closed. I mean,

27
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:49,570
what was I supposed to do? Come back
when they're fucking, they're yet can't.

28
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,570
He just kept saying,
what was I supposed to do?

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,360
You trust passing you
asshole the F up fucking.

30
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,370
He just kept saying what any
I've, you know something. I
actually kept my cool up.

31
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,210
I just calmly said, I don't know,
not coming to my yard. I go off my,

32
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,160
if I keep one of my neighbor's
house and he's not there,

33
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:12,700
that doesn't mean give me a right
to go in there. And he goes, well,

34
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,430
I've got to go over. I got to get
to the pole. I mean, you know,

35
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:18,780
when they changed the box,
the only put temporary whatever,

36
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,100
fucking things on there.
I gotta put the right things on there.

37
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:25,980
I don't have your phone number. I'm like,
well, whose fault is that? Some I fault.

38
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:29,160
Nobody asked me. You guys never called
me, or I guess she couldn't call me,

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,740
but you should have gotten from the,
from the electrician. He goes, yeah,

40
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:36,500
the electrician did give it to me.
Why go? There you go. So the guy,

41
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,960
the guy is grabbing a ladder,

42
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:40,140
he takes it down and he's fucking
walking out and go, you know what do you,

43
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:44,710
what do you need to do here? He goes,
no, no. You know, go get out of here.

44
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:47,320
It's just like, dude, you,
I'm going to fucking pout now.

45
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,630
You know what I'm saying is right
fucking walking.

46
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,570
You just open the gate. You just
fucking walk in. Unbelievable.

47
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,720
I like the guy. The other guy immediately
was fucking, you know, he's looking down.

48
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:06,060
He knew he was feeling you lose. The guy
was wrong. The guy was basically like,

49
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,890
this is like the third time I come over
here, nobody ever answers the door.

50
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:13,420
I'm getting sick of this and he just
fucking, it'll climbed over the wall.

51
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:14,650
I don't know what the gate's locked.

52
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:16,720
I don't know how they did
it mean you had a ladder?

53
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:18,610
I guess he just fucking
went right up and over it.

54
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,440
I mean, what was I supposed to do? One
fuck. You mean what we are supposed to do?

55
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,350
That's the dumbest fucking thing
I've ever heard. So then I go,

56
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:35,060
what do you need to do?
He told me when he did do I call,

57
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,450
how are you want to go down and
do it? Get the fight. I mean,

58
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,590
he still did way too
much. Don't, I don't know.

59
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,400
It was the weirdest fucking response
ever. Well, you know, I, I what,

60
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,030
what was I supposed to do? So, but
I was actually happy that I, I mean,

61
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,720
I lost my shit on it now thinking about
it on the podcast way more than I did in

62
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:56,850
the moment.
And um,

63
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,440
yeah,

64
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,930
you know, I said to the guy said, I'm
not trying to be difficult, but you know,

65
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:05,910
that's what you're doing here is it's
not right. And you know, it's not,

66
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:08,640
I shouldn't say I should said that.
And you know it's not right.

67
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,630
You got inpatient and he
just said to hell with it,

68
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:15,120
I'm just going to do this anyways
and you're trespassing. You know,

69
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,210
you trespassing. I don't care that you
worked for the state. That doesn't,

70
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,260
you know, I guess, you know, if,

71
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:24,140
if my fucking house was on fire
or the the poll or some shit,

72
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,210
there was a live wire hanging from it,
then yeah,

73
00:04:26,211 --> 00:04:28,190
I guess you have the
authority to go up and over.

74
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,690
I don't think you can do that just because
you're fucking tired of knocking on

75
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:36,840
the door. Nobody answers. Anyway, sorry.

76
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,720
So I just got back from Phoenix,
Arizona.

77
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:44,190
I had the best fucking time when I was
out there, ate a bunch of great food,

78
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,590
but all basically I kind of
ate mainly down near um, um,

79
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,420
wherever, wherever the fucking
Phoenix Suns play the, uh,

80
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,960
traveling Riverside resort arena,
whatever the hell they call it. Um,

81
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,030
had a couple of really cool,
um, meals when I was down there.

82
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,600
Went to this really good pizza joint.
Um, good for the southwest pizza.

83
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,320
You don't mean let's not
get crazy right. And, uh,

84
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,860
got a good burrito down there.
I didn't work out at all.

85
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,700
I was driving over to see my dog.
I was starving.

86
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,730
I got a fucking whopper with cheese and
fucking burger king and all freckles is

87
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:27,180
a, that's it. I'm done.
I'm, I'm officially,

88
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,080
I'm on the wagon for the first time in a
year, like really hardcore on the wagon.

89
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,310
Like I'm fucking done.
There's no drink in,

90
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,380
in site other than water for
me. Um, I don't know. I was,

91
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,170
I was, uh, I don't know what happened to
me the last two times I went on the road.

92
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:47,370
I just spent under a fucking
a lot of stress, you know,
not sleeping with the kid.

93
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,910
And then I got to put this
new hour together and uh,

94
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,370
my fucking shoulder is still messed up,

95
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:58,250
although I finally turned the corner
with it. And, um, but you know,

96
00:05:58,251 --> 00:05:59,061
so I just,
you know,

97
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:02,030
I just haven't been able to work out the
way I want to and I swear to God, dude,

98
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:05,660
I am starting to get dad bought and
I have to stop this immediately.

99
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,460
I am too goddamn vein,
you know,

100
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,350
you know when you just
look bad in a tee shirt,

101
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,420
I have a pothead body right now
and I do not fucking like it. Oh,

102
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,760
I forgot to tell you still have to
deal with that guy. Hey, you know,

103
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:23,020
what the fuck was I supposed to do?

104
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,710
I come into my house and there's this
strange odor, like, what is that?

105
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,280
Is that some hippie candle?
What's going on?

106
00:06:30,281 --> 00:06:34,990
And I come downstairs and Nia tells me
that a fucking pipe or some shit bursts

107
00:06:34,991 --> 00:06:38,860
the night before and all this water came
out. I go, you gotta be shitting me.

108
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,650
You gotta be shitting me
and I go, okay. Did you,

109
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,680
did you go to the front of the house
like I showed you and turned off all the

110
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:48,484
water?

111
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,513
Okay.

112
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,600
No, I turned it off under the
sink. I'm like, Oh God, okay.

113
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,850
I'm smelling water.

114
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,490
And then I look at my bedroom ceiling
and there's a brown stain just ever so

115
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:10,200
small and this little fucking crack.
And I was just like, oh my God. Dot.

116
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:13,590
Again, please tell me not
against. So I run upstairs.

117
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,840
I shut off the main fucking thing.

118
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,313
You know,

119
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,210
this is thing about these feminists,

120
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:22,220
they don't want to do fucking
housework anymore, but they,

121
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:23,810
they're not going to
do the guy shit either.

122
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:27,440
Like no one had to shut the
fucking water off. It's like,

123
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,940
so what exactly are you going to do?

124
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:30,720
Okay,

125
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,070
fucking watch Mary Tyler Moore
reruns. So it's, I'm sorry, whatever.

126
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,240
I'm flying up, run upstairs at flying
out the fucking door. I shut it off.

127
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,500
And then I,
you know,

128
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,980
now I got my stupid can iPhone flashlight,
you know,

129
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:49,820
because the fucking guys outside checking
the box of cut off the electricity,

130
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,960
the water's off.

131
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:55,760
Now this is just basically a glorified
fucking log cabin and I'm going through

132
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:59,320
the crawl spaces and all this shit and
I'm trying to find out where this water

133
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:03,440
is coming from as it collected.
Is the ceiling going to collapse?

134
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,510
What is going on? And um, fortunately
I think, I think we're all right.

135
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,210
Um, and it was also fresh water.
So I don't think you guys like,

136
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:17,420
you don't have to deal with mold, which
I don't know if that makes sense to me.

137
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,290
I mean, it doesn't also it on what
the fuck's in the inside the pipe.

138
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,124
I have no idea.

139
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,520
I'm sure there's going to be a bunch of
people tweeting at me make scaring the

140
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:30,020
shit out of me. So that's basically what
I came home too. But the plumber came by,

141
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:32,030
change the fucking thing
that needed to be changed.

142
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,050
Hopefully everything's going to
be all right. But I once again,

143
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,003
you know,

144
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,500
everybody in your house,
I'm telling you right now,

145
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,200
needs to know how to shut
off the fucking water.

146
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,033
Everybody.

147
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,441
In fact,

148
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:51,770
that's the first thing I'm going to
teach my daughter once she starts walking

149
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:52,604
around,

150
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,733
you know what I mean?

151
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,100
What'd she understands?
The concept of

152
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,380
water and what it can do to your house.
All right.

153
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,270
And I'm just going to be like,
look, the next time a fucking book,

154
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,260
I sweat the next, I'm going
to, I'm getting rid of this
house. I'm done with it.

155
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,630
Fuck this house.
I've had it.

156
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,610
I've just had it with his fucking
house, you know, smell, goddamn faults.

157
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:18,880
What happened? You buy a 100 year old
fucking house that has a lot of character.

158
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,553
You know,

159
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,590
I'm going to sell this fucking house and
I am going to buy some brand new home

160
00:09:26,591 --> 00:09:30,280
depot doubt. No character
whatsoever. I mean,

161
00:09:30,281 --> 00:09:32,890
I want it to look like a fucking
food court. I don't give a shit.

162
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,420
As long as everything's brand new in it.
No,

163
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,620
don't mind like the people
won't put it together. Right?

164
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:41,230
And I'll still have the problems,
but um,

165
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,560
I was literally when I was
in the crawl space, right?

166
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,750
It's all these fucking cobwebs and
all that. I just, it just, it was it.

167
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,370
I officially fell out of love with this
house and I was like, you know what?

168
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,540
Fuck this house. You know why?
You know what? You went house,

169
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,590
you fucking when you brought me down.
Cool Hand Luke,

170
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,200
you finally fucking did it. What
should dirt doing? A boss man's hole.

171
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,730
That's what this house has been doing me
the entire fucking time I've lived here.

172
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,850
I Dunno boss.
We got to get it outta there.

173
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,610
What's your dirt doing? A boss
man's yard. I don't know boss.

174
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,153
Yeah.

175
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,480
Ah Fuck. Anyways, homeownership,

176
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,920
you know they always show all
of the young couple on TV,

177
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:42,090
fucking smiling and all that shit.
They had a fucking show me my fucking

178
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,940
whopper with cheese. Fucking body
crawling around a goddamn crawl space.

179
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,100
Of course. What are going to
walk around and crawl space bill.

180
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,883
Okay,

181
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,500
so then I fucking thank
God. It's all right.

182
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:59,770
So then I leave, I go down to take care
of all the bills and all of this shit.

183
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,640
So why the podcasts late is
late. And I'm like, alright,

184
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,710
I gotta I gotta pick up
a salad or something.

185
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,150
I got to start on the right
foot here. And, uh, you know,

186
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,340
typical La Thing, oh, this is the place I
want to be. Um, that's a restaurant that,

187
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,810
you know, 40 people can eat at
and there's four parking spots,

188
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,700
two of which,
you know,

189
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,210
are taken by the cook in the manager and
the other two are taken by the fucking

190
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,740
waitstaff. So as always,
there's no fucking place to
park. And I turned the corner.

191
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,270
Lo and behold, there's
a fucking spot. And, um,

192
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,500
I went down and turned around like a
gentleman and of course someone else said,

193
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:41,770
fuck that. And they made the three point
turn into the goddamn parking spot,

194
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,690
took my fucking pocket spot.

195
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:45,590
Yeah.

196
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,540
And uh, that, and then I, then that was
it. That was enough. All my meditation,

197
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,500
everything went out the fucking
window. And, uh, you know,

198
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,980
so I had my first fucking
meltdown in awhile and in weeks,

199
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,820
my first meltdown in weeks.
And then I basically,

200
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,500
I went from yelling at the guy who
fucking took my, took my parking spot.

201
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:10,060
It was my parking spot, right? He
got there first. I saw it first,

202
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:13,150
but he fucking made a better move. And
he gave boxed me up like, you know,

203
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,073
you've got the rebound.

204
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,790
I went from yelling at bout him in the
car to myself to yelling even louder

205
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:25,660
about the electrician to yelling even
louder about shutting the fucking water

206
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,900
off. The second day is
of God damn problem. Um,

207
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,940
and then I found a
parking spot and I got out

208
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,270
and I think I was yelling so loudly like
somebody walking by was looking at me

209
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:44,610
all fucking weird and I dunno, whatever.
I had a little bit of a setback. But uh,

210
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,910
anybody out there if you'd like to buy
a house with a lot of character, oh,

211
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:51,550
does this out. This house is
a character. I'll tell you,

212
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,440
it'll have you scratching your head.
Um,

213
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:57,230
okay,

214
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,150
maybe I'll sell this idea
and talk to me about this.

215
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:02,450
Maybe I'll sell this fucking house
and we'll just do the, do the, uh,

216
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:08,210
moving to one of those soldiers.
Fucking high rises. You know,

217
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,550
you know those things that people do,

218
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,860
the empty nesters do when they just
don't want to deal with the fucking house

219
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:14,540
anymore, which I never
understood. It's like,

220
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,400
why the fuck would you want
to be live in your house?

221
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,660
All the kids are out of there. You know,
you now, you've got all these spaces.

222
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:23,280
It's going to be great now. Right
now I know why. Now I know what.

223
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:24,780
Yeah.

224
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,680
Oh, do I know why? Cause
this shit's going to happen.

225
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,460
Yeah. I, I completely fucking get it now.

226
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,160
Like I don't give a fuck about a view.
I don't give a fuck about, you know,

227
00:13:38,161 --> 00:13:40,530
old school shit.
I don't give a fuck about anything.

228
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,910
All I give a fuck about is if
something breaks, it's not on me. How,

229
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:47,960
where can I live like that?
I might go back to renting

230
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:56,040
this house is just, it's just a fucking,
it's a motherfucker. I'm never again,

231
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,881
I'm telling you right now,

232
00:13:56,881 --> 00:14:00,300
don't have a buy a fucking old
house unless you're handy. You know,

233
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:04,110
or unless you just like making your
life fucking difficult. I'm telling you,

234
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,310
this is the classic. This is what mean
versus you were laughing about all week.

235
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,360
I was, how he makes his life easy
and I make my life difficult.

236
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:16,740
He buys a fucking house, the last fucking
guy, three dead, the whole thing. He gets,

237
00:14:16,741 --> 00:14:19,740
he turnkey.
I need to be more Versie.

238
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,060
I gotta I gotta I gotta I gotta
fucking do that my next fucking place.

239
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,620
I don't give a shit what it is. I'll buy
a fucking Winnebago brand new though.

240
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,870
Just live in that right where bill,

241
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,570
you just don't fucking parking spots
out here. I Dunno. I'm sorry. Anyways,

242
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,820
so I'm going to be Billy elliptical head,

243
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,620
Billy fucking no booze bag and we've
eaten salads and all this fucking shit.

244
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:47,620
And uh, you know, I got
to get this under control,

245
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,380
disgusted with myself,
you know,

246
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,870
it's time to walk into the fucking
bathroom mirror and just trashed myself,

247
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,630
you know, take the shirt off.
Let's see what it is. You know,

248
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,990
it looked like Tom Brady.
I just first way,

249
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,830
and you know when he was a college student
just eating Cheetos and he was like a

250
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:08,120
third string quarterback or some shit.
Well, when I don't look like his face,

251
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,020
I look like his stomach.

252
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,370
Just no muscle tone whatsoever. I'm
exaggerating, but it made, I don't know.

253
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,380
It's not a, it's not what I want.
It's not what I want to see.

254
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,303
You know what I mean?

255
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,870
Yeah.

256
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,310
It's Christ.
It's like my belly is to the point.

257
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:30,110
It's going to be like when
I stand in the shower,

258
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:34,790
my knees aren't going to get it wet.
Um, feed are totally dry, you know? Um,

259
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,030
but that, you know something, I'm not that
bad, but that's the road I'm heading on.

260
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:41,930
And I was sitting on the plane today
watching all these fucking people who just

261
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,830
destroy their bodies, just getting on the
plane, just getting on a fucking plane.

262
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,040
They're like winded from walking
down that movable hallway,

263
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,250
whatever you call that. It's not the
tarmac. When they, what do they call that?

264
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,540
The jet way

265
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,540
people could you put your coats under the
seat in the overhead compartment so we

266
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,550
can expedite the boarding process.

267
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,050
We still have a lot of peoples standing.
I'm on the jet way.

268
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:11,980
We want to have it on time departure.
Um,

269
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,040
and I'm just sitting there
watching all of these fucking,

270
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,673
you know,

271
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,920
just fat Fox walking by.
This gotta be something amazing though

272
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,570
about living that way.

273
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:27,550
Okay,

274
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,140
well you, Oh, you just always just,

275
00:16:29,141 --> 00:16:33,790
you're always eating exactly what
you want to eat, you know? Hey Mike,

276
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,500
you want a devil dog?
Yeah.

277
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,800
Do you want to get a breed
off? Sure. Absolutely.

278
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,230
What do you feel like having
a cheeseburger, French
fries and a chocolate malt.

279
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:50,310
Okay.

280
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,570
You know,
it's like you basically,

281
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:54,600
you're eating like a fucking eight
year old whose parents aren't home your

282
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:58,320
entire life. You don't, you know, when
your parents took off, that was it.

283
00:16:59,070 --> 00:16:59,920
You went to the enemy,

284
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,510
you're eating a fucking elements cake
or some donuts or those store bought

285
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:06,630
fucking donuts.
Those ones where it was like,

286
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:10,770
it was like four plane for powdered
cinnamon. Do they still make those things?

287
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,090
We had those things all the time.
I used to eat, I got dammit,

288
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,080
I ate absolute shit when I was growing up.
Then you went outside,

289
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,030
you ran around and just burned it off.

290
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,503
Okay.

291
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,970
You didn't have a fucking blew out.

292
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:30,971
Your rotator cuff is a fucking seven
eight year old you injury free brand new

293
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:34,400
fucking car. You know what? My Body's
like, my body's like this house.

294
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,890
It's just fucking old as shit.

295
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:38,830
Yeah,

296
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,350
I can't wait.

297
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,910
You know how they can like grow an ear
and I'd fucking petri dish now I swear to

298
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,340
God I, I, you know they
got to do that. Like

299
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,600
it's going to happen man.

300
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:52,020
When they see they can bro all the
organs and they can grow all your fucking

301
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:55,320
body parts up over again. I'm telling
you right now it's going to be like,

302
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,240
you body's going to be like
a a I will, you know it,

303
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,310
but they probably still would look old.
But yeah,

304
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,360
it looks like one of those
Resto Mod. Thanks. You know,

305
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,830
or it's brand new one Denise. But on
top it looks at, you know, like a 1960,

306
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:12,340
whatever.
Is any of this fucking make it sense?

307
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,370
I mean, what was I supposed to do? I mean,

308
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:17,800
I knocked on your door three
times and there was nobody here,

309
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:20,110
so I just figured I'd walk
into your fucking yard,

310
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:24,890
put a ladder up next to your house,
Jesus Christ.

311
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,640
You know what I mean? Can you imagine if
somebody did that at Ted Nugent's house?

312
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,450
How many fucking bows and
arrows would that guy have?

313
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:37,230
And it's stupid construction hat.
What do you got the hard hat on for?

314
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,850
This is like, like that's going to
help. Like when you fall off the ladder,

315
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:43,160
that thing doesn't fall off with you.

316
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,990
Maybe that's why he did it. He had his
hat so fucking tidy wasn't even thinking.

317
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,033
Um,

318
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:51,810
yeah.

319
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,910
Anyways, so I was on the road and last
night, um, I missed the Celtics speed,

320
00:18:54,911 --> 00:18:59,020
the Golden State Warriors. Holy
Shit. I got that game tape.

321
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,933
They've got to watch that.

322
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,270
And the Bruins beat the fuck out of
the Detroit red with a beat him up.

323
00:19:04,271 --> 00:19:09,220
But they scored six goals, man. Um, I
should try. We read, we see, you know,

324
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,000
one of the original six. They, I mean,
they, they, they play in hockey town.

325
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:17,140
Everybody, there's a town out there
where you play hockey. There's a town,

326
00:19:17,141 --> 00:19:22,090
I know where the hipsters go call
bedrock. Well worn out twitch, twitch.

327
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,680
Let me read some.
Um,

328
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,000
okay.

329
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,560
How many goaltenders by the way,
did Z,

330
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,550
cause I've watched the highlights it
with every one of them was a bad goal or

331
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:33,770
your defense just gave it away.
You know,

332
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,450
my condolences to the, uh, all
the players on the Redwings today.

333
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,290
I can't imagine how fucking
horrific your practices. All right.

334
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,430
Uh, the black Tux or you know,
I saw when I was in Phoenix,

335
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:48,380
I saw Reggie fucking mouth.

336
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,280
Fucking amazing.

337
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,750
You walked right by me and I just
watched a waiting for an elevator.

338
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,960
I just kept thinking like
that guy lit up the garden

339
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,670
turn around as spike Lee and made
the choke sign. And they just look,

340
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:09,240
he's just standing there,
wait for an elevator. Totally
relaxed. Totally cheating.

341
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,310
Doesn't need to talk shit.
Right?

342
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:16,530
He's the shit that's Reggie fucking Miller
hits a three steals the inbound pass

343
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:22,780
runs behind the three wasn't good
enough to get them for two fucking hits,

344
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:26,560
another three point turns around
and looks at fucking spike Lee.

345
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:30,960
Does the church in the
garden. I mean that's, yeah,

346
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,720
it's fucking,
do you ever have to,

347
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:36,750
do any of you ever got an outdoor
accomplish anything else after that?

348
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,480
If I ever did some shit like
that, um, for God's sakes,

349
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,220
if I ever did some shit like that,
you know what? I gotta take this,

350
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:52,990
hang on a second. All right. I'm back.
I swear to God, it never fucking ends.

351
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,320
It never fucking ends, you
know, you know, it's it. Gee,

352
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,680
I just wish you could just for one day,
save one day of being a kid.

353
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:03,761
You know what I mean?

354
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:08,761
Just to go back for 24 fucking hours and
not have to deal with this fucking shit

355
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,420
of being an adult.

356
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,630
Okay,

357
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,100
good fucking Lord.

358
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,000
You want that fucking phone call was
about about some sort of fucking tax

359
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:20,130
abatement for some bullshit.

360
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:22,230
I don't even know what the
fuck they're talking about.

361
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,490
To go onto the website and it
can fuck you. I don't want to,

362
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,060
it's an abatement. You'll get money
back. You know what? Just fuck.

363
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:33,450
How about you just keep it.
If you just keep it,

364
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,220
can I just not fucking waste
those precious seconds?
One the they fucking get.

365
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,690
What if a tree falls on me tomorrow?

366
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,730
This is one of my last
fucking days and I went to

367
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:52,030
www.fuckingabatement.to whatever
the fuck. I just don't care. Sorry.

368
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:55,570
I am in such a country mood.
I had such a great fucking three days.

369
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,570
You know what it is coming home and
there's somebody on a fucking ladder you

370
00:21:58,571 --> 00:22:02,560
don't even know. Just walked into your
goddamn house or you're, you're, you're,

371
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,410
you're on your, your and your proper
tie and then a pipe burst and you know,

372
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,191
in the powers that be,

373
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:12,190
don't go fucking shut off the goddamn
water and you've got a brown spot.

374
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:17,050
You know when your ceiling, you
know, makes you a little salty.

375
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,510
What I'm saying? I was talking about
Reggie Miller, right? I was just saying,

376
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:26,590
if I fucking, if I did, what the fuck
that guy did, I would, I would have that

377
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,130
playing on a loop on my
phone, right. The video.

378
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,250
And I would just walk around holding
it up as I walked towards other human

379
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:41,030
beings. That'd be it. You
know, it's incredible.

380
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:44,300
What the fuck that guy did standing
there waiting for an elevator. All right.

381
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:48,950
Let me read a little bit of a, what do
we got here for a little advertising yet?

382
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,660

00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,510
They had did the highest paid of the four
sports, I believe at this point. And it,

427
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,520
you wouldn't know it by
looking at the tattoos,

428
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,890
Jesus Christ with the area codes and
the Ho the fucking highway signs.

429
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,103
You know,

430
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,490
I guess those could be cool if you
actually took the time to like,

431
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:52,820
I don't know where they get them done.
They, they're, they look horrible.

432
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,640
Um, I didn't have anything
funny to say about it.

433
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,030
I'm just always watching NBA
hoop and they just, they're all,

434
00:25:59,031 --> 00:26:00,740
everybody's scribbled all over

435
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,040
and you can't make out
anything of what anything is.

436
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,790
It's just a bunch of fucking shit.

437
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,710
Like an NBA guy. We'll get a fucking
tattoo of his baby's face on his neck.

438
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,040
Then you got to look at that for the
rest of his fucking career opened.

439
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:24,750
He's like that guy in the globe trotter
does that also were fucking headband

440
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,370
around his neck. You remember that guy?
Whatever his fucking name was. Anyways,

441
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,340
blue apron, everyone, blue apron.

442
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:36,260
Not all ingredients are created equal,
fresh, high quality ingredients.

443
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,160
Make a real difference. So it's important
to know where your food comes from.

444
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,350
I would not want to know where that
fucking whopper with cheese came from.

445
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,610
Talk about your personal experience with
Blue Apron. I've never fucking used it,

446
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:51,900
but I've got to use it now. Maybe
that's how I'll get in shape. You know?

447
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:56,400
I'll be like Oprah. I
love, yeah. You know,

448
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:59,100
do one of those things and maybe I can
have a giant fucking house that doesn't

449
00:26:59,101 --> 00:26:59,934
fall apart.

450
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,530
You know what I lie like potato chips.

451
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,480
Yeah.

452
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,750
Can anybody pinpoint the year
she officially went insane?

453
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,123
Yeah.

454
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,640
She's just been famous too.
Fucking long.

455
00:27:18,641 --> 00:27:21,250
I think it just makes you go crazy after.
Well,

456
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,340
everybody's always excited to meet you.

457
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,860
They're always giving you a fucking award.

458
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,340
There's no way to keep your feet on
the ground and then you just think

459
00:27:30,341 --> 00:27:34,420
everything you're saying is interesting
or exciting to the fucking point.

460
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:35,950
You'll just scream something like,

461
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,120
I love bread

462
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:46,090
sitting in a giant fucking yard.
Every time I see her, I'm just like,

463
00:27:46,091 --> 00:27:49,560
what is she doing? Jesus Christ. Oprah.

464
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,360
Just go to a fucking hot dog
stand. You know? Stand in line.

465
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:58,030
What you fucking turned and eat the thing.
Just do that every once in awhile.

466
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,330
This fucking
who likes carcase?

467
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,470
You got all those fucking
her cult of women.

468
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,830
It just hang on our every word.

469
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,370
Just hoping maybe this
complete stranger on TV.

470
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:20,170
She's the one that's gonna make me happy.
I mean that's,

471
00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:22,670
that's the saddest part of
watching one of those Oprah shows.

472
00:28:22,671 --> 00:28:23,720
I even know she does it anymore.

473
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:25,400
I'm just gonna pretend the
show still on the fucking,

474
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,040
there was all those women
that sat in the crowd,

475
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,130
the fucking look of hope on their face.

476
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,183
You know,

477
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,230
I always wanted to see,
you know,

478
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:39,410
what they should have had next door was
the sea of men that all those fucking

479
00:28:39,411 --> 00:28:42,050
poor women were married to.
You know,

480
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,630
that fucking motley crew of insensitive,

481
00:28:44,631 --> 00:28:47,720
constant never told them they were
pretty or whatever the fuck they needed,

482
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,550
whatever they needed,
they weren't getting there,

483
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,340
that they would go down
to the studio audience.

484
00:28:52,341 --> 00:28:54,560
It just fucking sit
there with that fucking

485
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,490
okay.

486
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,320
Like you ever watched one of those shows
with is like 10 whores and they're all

487
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,740
fucking fight over some nerdy guy
and that look of hope they have,

488
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,340
if they're going to get the fucking,
you know, get handed a slipper,

489
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,960
which means they're going to
be there for another week,

490
00:29:08,961 --> 00:29:10,490
whatever the fuck you need,
whenever it is they do,

491
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,830
they all had that look on their face.

492
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,440
MMM.

493
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,300
Do you know what? As much as I'm
making fun of Oprah, I also like Brent,

494
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,980
but no matter how fresh it is,
no matter how much I like it,

495
00:29:21,981 --> 00:29:26,600
if someone was standing in a big
yard yelling that it would make me

496
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:28,940
uncomfortable and it would
take away from the experience.

497
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:30,983
You know,

498
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,760
it's gotta be weird to be
part of her fucking staff.

499
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,990
Just every once in a while I'll just
hear yelling random things. Costume.

500
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,703
Yeah.

501
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:49,620
Okay.

502
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,780
I bet Steadman knows that
a block that out, Huh?

503
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:53,660
Okay.

504
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,230
That's what she has those
giant fucking houses.

505
00:29:55,231 --> 00:29:58,170
She probably likes to sound the echo.
You know,

506
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,670
she's like Rosebud level
famous citizen Kane. Um,

507
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:08,760
what the fuck was I to all blue apron,
everybody for less than $10 per month?

508
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:13,680
No per person per meal.

So what you do is you just scream
your shit, thrown it against the wall.

517

Some of the shit that came out
of my mouth, I'm a god. Somalia,

518
00:30:48,331 --> 00:30:51,630
I made a reference to Whitney Houston
drowning in a bathtub like that.

519
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,060
That's how desperate I am for
fucking material right now.

551
00:32:46,071 --> 00:32:49,700
I'm obviously going to read it after
you've read that. Then read this.

552
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,590
blinds.com

553
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,910

guarantee if you meet a mistake,

557
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:16,760
if you make a mistake, I should never
do this on a travel day. You know,

558
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,490
once they said a hundred
percent satisfaction guarantee,

559
00:33:19,491 --> 00:33:23,480
I immediately started thinking of fast
times at Ridgemont high, you know,

560
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:28,670
instead of not 100% satisfied and I
don't want to, I want to read Front Brad,

anything up with your order, they'll

00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:53,060
There's a crying child putting all this
shit together in a third world country,

568
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:56,630
but you don't need to think about that.
You just close those blinds.

569
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,390
He closed those blinds and
you never hear him crying.

570
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:04,460
What a whatever your level of confidence
in the following instructions, what,

571
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:08,720
whatever your level of confidence in
following instructions or even using a

okay then. Then you want to
turn it the other way? Yeah.

582
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,280
Turn it the other way and then yes,
they'll close. Are they closing?

583
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,810
You are seeing less of the outside. Okay.
Okay. Do you have any more questions?

smelling Sushi, but let me tell you,

599
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,710
none of those are as funny as
CSO streaming libraries stand up.

600
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:00,390
Television and original content,
especially not the Sushi.

601
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,110
Why do they try to write these funny?
Why would you do that?

602
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,720

enjoy this nuts little musical clip
here. Oh Hey. By the way, you know what?

640
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,650
I heard that,
uh,

641
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,880
that sneaker shit that I was saying
actually ended up on some big sneaker

642
00:38:48,881 --> 00:38:53,170
websites, so I must be getting
fucking trashed on that one. You know,

643
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,360
I had no idea that, you know, I
knew people were into sneakers.

644
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:58,750
I didn't realize I went and
told him that much. You know,

645
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,450
I actually bought a new pair of sneakers
this week when I was out in Phoenix.

646
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:05,590
I got the classic fucking shell
toes. That's what I got. You know,

647
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,950
cause a lot of peoples were suggesting
that I wore those fucking, you know,

648
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,260
you know those giant lecture Chunky
fucking sneakers that people with feet

649
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:18,220
problem use. You know, I don't wear
those. Although I do have the Steve Jobs,

650
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:20,170
new balance.
You know,

651
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,490
if you look at the Daytona 500 picture,
I believe I'm wearing them there.

652
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:27,640
I did have a nice pair of sneakers but
I was not going to wear them to the

653
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:32,140
Daytona 500. So maybe I have a little
sneaker head and make it right. Maybe,

654
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,600
I don't know.
I wear the shittiest pair of sneakers.

655
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:38,680
I had to go down and that fucking track
with all the Goddamn oil and shit all

656
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:40,690
over the place. Um, once again,

657
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:44,380
I want to thank everybody that
came out to stand up live.

658
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:48,490
Everybody at Stan applied.
It had such a great time and uh,

659
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:53,200
I dunno, Paul Versey crushed it
and all week. And uh, I just had a,

660
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,030
I had a great time,
so thank you very much.

All right. Have a great weekend.

665

You constant. I'll, I'll
talk to you on Monday.

666
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:19,430
Is the Monday morning podcast
20 past nine on Monday morning.

667
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:26,401
A cloudy day out here in La as it is
the rainy season and a actually had some

668
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:31,300
guests over here, so this is going
to be quiet, kind of a quiet podcast.

669
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,780
Um, cause I also have to do to the, uh,

670
00:40:34,781 --> 00:40:38,920
I have some friends in town from out of
town, so we have to do all the La Shit.

671
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,650
Uh,
and I gotta be honest with you,

672
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:44,800
I'm trying to think what the La should
is because I'm still new out here,

673
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:49,210
you know, and I lived in New York.
I knew what that meant. You know,

674
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,510
that meant they wanted to go to the
top of the empire state building.

675
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:57,640
They wanted to go to the
Statue of Liberty, uh,

676
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,130
Times Square.
Basically.

677
00:41:00,131 --> 00:41:03,670
They wanted to go every place
that a new Yorker never goes.

678
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:09,450
And uh, so what my mission always
was whenever I had, um, you know,

679
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:14,460
friends coming down to visit New York
City was I immediately tried to convince

680
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:19,420
them that all the things that they wanted
to see, they didn't really want to see.

681
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,830
And um,
I like to think I was doing them a favor.

682
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,690
But uh, you know, part of it
was selfish cause you know,

683
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,600
I'm not fucking getting on a boat to
climb up into a statue that's looking out

684
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:36,230
into the ocean. You know
what I mean? It's like,

685
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,340
you know, I dunno. That's
what we wanted to talk about.
Underrated. Overrated. Okay.

686
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:43,190
Overrated climbing up into
the statue of Liberty.

687
00:41:43,191 --> 00:41:46,550
If he can even still do
it with the whole nine, 11

688
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,880
America or whatever that we live in now.

689
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,920
I don't even know if you're
allowed to fucking do it anymore.

690
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,930
I'm sure they'll let you if they like,
you know,

691
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,700
if you let them fingerprint you and
scan your fucking retinas. But um,

692
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:04,670
anyways, um, I don't, I always feel like
when you go to a city, like personally, I,

693
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:08,660
you know, I want to do a few
touristy things, but, uh,

694
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:11,810
I want to hang out with the locals
because they always know the good bars and

695
00:42:11,811 --> 00:42:16,520
the restaurants and that type of shit.
And so that's what I used to try to,

696
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:19,850
you know, convince people
like, but it's hard sometimes.

697
00:42:19,851 --> 00:42:21,080
Sometimes you just got to give in.

698
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:26,110
Like when my parents came down and they
wanted to eat at Mickey Mantle's on 57th

699
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:31,340
street, 59th Street, and uh, you know,

700
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,220
you just can't stop people from
doing shit like that. You know.

701
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:38,810
Isn't this a great burger?
No, no it isn't. It's a great,

702
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:43,610
is a touristy burger and it's fucking
$18 more than it needs to be because when

703
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:46,370
you look out the window,
you can see central park.

704
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,010
What is wrong with you Mickey Mantle?
Yeah, that's great. Let's then,

705
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,220
let's go get a hotdog at Wade Boggs.

706
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:57,500
The fuck does Mickey Mantle know
about making a burger? Okay.

707
00:42:57,501 --> 00:43:02,270
If you want to go Busan and Mouse, oh,
that's a low blow fucking dead legend.

708
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,070
What the fuck is wrong with me? I
apologize. The Yankee fans over that one.

709
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,970
I shouldn't end sports fans in general.
You know,

710
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,090
Mickey Mantle never did steroids. Diddy,
granted they didn't exist back then.

711
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,040
And uh,
I got to tell you some,

712
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:19,220
it's too bad he didn't and it's too bad
they didn't exist back then because we

713
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:23,000
would've got to watch
that guy, uh, you know,

714
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:27,260
have the body of a 22 year
old until he was 42. And uh,

715
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:31,220
I got to tell you something
man. Um, after, you know,

716
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,390
just watching some of these
guys get busted and you know,

717
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:39,500
getting busted for being on juice, uh,
you know, they always have that question,

718
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,910
you know, should people who do steroids
be allowed into the hall of fame?

719
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,770
And uh, I think after the rock
thing, I'm finally thinking,

720
00:43:48,771 --> 00:43:50,180
no,
they shouldn't.

721
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:54,830
And just for the simple fact that,

722
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,340
like I just said, it's like,
it doesn't help you get better.

723
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:03,560
It just keeps your body in mint
condition until you like 40,

724
00:44:03,561 --> 00:44:08,050
42 in, all of these guys would get busted
the second they get off them there,

725
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,310
they're numbers go
right through the floor.

726
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,940
And I don't think it has anything to
do with this skill. It's just like a,

727
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,510
you do roids it's like you
become one of the expert.

728
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:20,450
I'm not really big on those
action movies and shit,

729
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,830
but you know those movies where you know,

730
00:44:21,831 --> 00:44:26,831
somebody gets super human
healing abilities and somebody
slices into his arm and

731
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:29,150
it made immediately heals up.

732
00:44:29,151 --> 00:44:32,370
It's like you're literally doing
the real life version of that.

733
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,373
And uh,

734
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,330
I don't think it's fair to guys like Ken
Griffey Jr there really isn't like, uh,

735
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,930
that guy quietly hits 600 fucking
home runs and I, you know,

736
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:48,480
kind of stop noticing 10 years ago when
all these fucking gorillas will coming

737
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:52,920
up to the plate. I don't
know, I've said this before,

738
00:44:52,921 --> 00:44:54,960
maybe they should have a special wing,
you know,

739
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:58,770
the roid rage wing of the hall of fame.
I have no idea, but I got to admit,

740
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,240
I think we're all hypocritical,

741
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:03,720
forgiven those guys shit because
no one gave a fuck about baseball.

742
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:06,090
And then all of a sudden when
McGuire and Sosa came around,

743
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,130
I was one of the best years
of baseball ever. And uh,

744
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:15,230
everybody made a ton of fucking money
and everybody had a great time and now

745
00:45:15,721 --> 00:45:20,130
we're all acting like our feelings got
hurt because we got to watch people hit

746
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:24,990
600 foot home runs, you
know, then make any sense.

747
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:29,700
I'm half a fucking sleep out
here. Um, here's something that I,

748
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,580
uh, I actually read a quote
from one of these magazines,

749
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,570
I guess evidently a Clint
Eastwood was hyping that movie.

750
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:41,130
Gran Gran Torino. I don't know
if you guys have seen that movie.

751
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:45,590
I'm sure you've seen the ads for it.
Where he basically is, I get up late Lon,

752
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:50,600
you fucking person of another race and
I'm a white man and I represented my car

753
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:56,970
represents back when America
was good in the early seventies.

754
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:03,180
Um, I guess when he was, uh, doing
the interview for that movie, uh,

755
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:06,750
he called I guess the current generation,
the pussy generation.

756
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,980
And at first it made me laugh
and I'm thinking like, yeah,

757
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:15,240
Clint Eastwood obviously has earned
the right to call people pussies.

758
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:20,700
And I'm thinking, wait a
minute, Cleese was, is an actor.

759
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:23,671
Okay.

760
00:46:23,671 --> 00:46:28,671
Who plays tough guys who never
loses a fight really any,

761
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,830
even if he does lose a fight in a movie,
it's a fake fight.

762
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:38,120
So at the risk of making my second sack
religious comment first trash in the

763
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,880
Great Mickey Mantle, uh, now I'm
going to go out to Clint Eastwood.

764
00:46:41,881 --> 00:46:44,920
Unlike where his Clint Eastwood,
I want,

765
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,530
this is my question
for you guys this week.

766
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:51,531
Where's cleanness would got off like
where's he earned the right that he's this

767
00:46:52,921 --> 00:46:56,700
tough guy
cause like he plays a tough guy.

768
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:00,630
I've known understand that
with like actors. Like I
remember like after nine, 11,

769
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:01,980
like,
um,

770
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:06,600
for some reason they wheeled out Tom Hanks
and like that was supposed to make me

771
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:08,430
feel relaxed as an American.

772
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:12,450
And I remember during that time I was
doing a joke on stage going and talking

773
00:47:12,451 --> 00:47:17,040
about Tom Hanks saying he's done so many
army movies. He thinks he's a veteran.

774
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,950
You know what I mean?
It's not like you did army movies,

775
00:47:19,951 --> 00:47:23,610
but he played an astronaut.
He was in saving private Ryan.

776
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:28,130
You know what I mean? And like all
of a sudden, like he becomes like a,

777
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:32,470
all these guys, like I said,
you know, here's, here's one
for you. I've got fucking,

778
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:33,730
you know,
friends out here.

779
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:37,930
Some were doing the touristy shit out
here in La and I take them down to Mann's

780
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:41,170
Chinese theater or grooming or
whatever the fuck they call it now.

781
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:45,730
And they got those, uh, they
got the hand prints in the feet,

782
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:50,110
prints in the footprints
there in the, uh, the cement.

783
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,160
And I found John Wayne,
I swear to God,

784
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:57,330
John Wayne had the smallest
fucking feet I've ever seen it.

785
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:01,510
I couldn't believe it. This is the
Duke John Wayne. This is the guy.

786
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:04,810
Everyone was one.
Just thought if even breathed on you,

787
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:08,860
he fucking knock you in the next week.
This guy had like,

788
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:12,130
I think he went to fucking lady
gap to buy his cowboy boots.

789
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:16,480
She's like so fucking
the smallest fucking things.

790
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,380
He could've fit both his
boots and his cowboy hat.

791
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:21,850
That's how small his fucking feeder.

792
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:25,350
If you ever go to La and you
go to Mann's Chinese Stereo,

793
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,660
it's on the right hand side.
He had tiny little ass feet,

794
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:33,940
you know, actors are fucking
annoying, you know what I mean?

795
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:38,950
So then they put on fucking leather
jackets and they play these bad asses and

796
00:48:38,951 --> 00:48:41,200
it's just like, dude, you're
fucking, you're an actor.

797
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,670
Have you had any real fights, Clint? Huh?

798
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:50,380
Somebody of a fucking rear engine and
the drive through at Burger King and you

799
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:54,970
got out and you settled the score maybe.
Yes. I don't know what, but you know,

800
00:48:56,750 --> 00:49:00,780
I don't know. I'm fucking
just fucking annoyed me. And,

801
00:49:00,781 --> 00:49:02,050
and moving on from that,

802
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,890
somebody actually sent me an email
that kind of ties into this, right?

803
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:09,190
I'm not saying clinics and a tough guy.
The guy's fucking ridiculous.

804
00:49:09,191 --> 00:49:12,700
He's 80 years old, he's still
lifting weights, you know,

805
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:16,660
the way his eyes are squinted.
He definitely seems like
a bad ass, but you know,

806
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,980
I want to see his fight card. I want
to see his arrest record. You know,

807
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:24,970
maybe he was a juvenile delinquent
before he came up. I Dunno,

808
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:27,160
I haven't Wikipedia them yet.

809
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,490
I have no idea. But this is
just, you know, there's just an,

810
00:49:33,491 --> 00:49:36,640
I don't even know why I'm defending
this generation of people because I'm 40

811
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:37,151
years old.

812
00:49:37,151 --> 00:49:41,740
So technically the only generation that
pop culture gives a fuck about is the

813
00:49:41,741 --> 00:49:45,730
young kids, you know, which is
basically, I don't know what,

814
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,260
whatever it starts to is basically
once you're over the age of 24,

815
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,490
nobody gives a fuck about you anymore as
far as like a what music you listen to.

816
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,320
Um, anyways, so this, this
woman wrote me this, uh,

817
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,230
she wrote me this email and it said,
uh,

818
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:06,250
when it let me get down to the blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, all this type of stuff.

819
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,170
Same really nice stuff to me,
which um,

820
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:11,080
I'm going to blow through here even
though I totally appreciate it.

821
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,350
And she was commenting on the guy last
week, you know, the guy last week,

822
00:50:14,351 --> 00:50:17,490
I was reading the story where, uh,
he was hanging out with this girl,

823
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,000
most beautiful girl he's ever seen,

824
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:23,260
but she's dumb as a brick and there's a
fucking pothead and he can't figure out

825
00:50:23,261 --> 00:50:27,590
how to close the deal with her. Um, so
this is what she said. She said, Oh,

826
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:31,970
and about the guy who asked
about what he should do with the,

827
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:37,090
with the pretty pothead girl asked him
if he tried to get physical with her.

828
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:39,051
Um,

829
00:50:39,051 --> 00:50:42,500
wouldn't he know whether or not she was
interested in a physical relationship if

830
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:46,910
he had made a move on her, which is a
great point because maybe he didn't.

831
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:52,270
And she said he's probably one of those
hesitant guys that want the check to

832
00:50:53,001 --> 00:50:56,480
make the first move.
So typical of today.

833
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,540
So I guess that's kind of backend.

834
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:03,680
Clint Eastwood saying that this
is like the pussy generation.

835
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:08,900
Um, I don't want to be a dick here, but
I think a lot of that has to do with, uh,

836
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:14,510
the oversaturation of a
date rape movies. And, uh,

837
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:16,040
these 100%

838
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:22,430
chick tone shows like
fucking Oprah and I'll,

839
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,210
I mean, they got, you're so
fucking, I don't know. I don't
know what it is they got.

840
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:31,590
Everybody's so convinced that women
aren't the same lying sacks of shit that

841
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:37,220
guys are with just different genitalia
that I think a lot of guys are

842
00:51:37,221 --> 00:51:41,730
approaching, um, stupid pothead checks.

843
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:46,100
Like they're these princesses that
need to be rescued. In other words,

844
00:51:46,101 --> 00:51:48,230
what I'm saying is he's you
just fucking bender over.

845
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:52,700
He should just stick her bag of weed
on the floor in front of our ankles and

846
00:51:52,701 --> 00:51:54,140
when she bends down to get it,

847
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,540
he should handle this business. All
right. That was ignorant. There you go.

848
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:04,040
That's the first a straight up fucking
ignorant statement of the week. Um,

849
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:07,370
let's get on with it here. This is
the out of the Monday morning podcast.

850
00:52:07,371 --> 00:52:09,370
If you're wondering what this babbling is,
um,

851
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:13,190
I do one of these every single week.
Like fucking cal Ripkin.

852
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,290
I'm the cal Ripken a fucking podcast.

853
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:18,110
I can't remember the last time I missed
one. Even when I fucking miss one,

854
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:20,690
I call up and I apologize,
you know,

855
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:25,250
does that count if cal Ripkin Mr Baseball
game in the middle of his streak and

856
00:52:25,251 --> 00:52:28,730
he just kind of called in the Orioles
and said yes. Sorry about that. Yeah.

857
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:30,920
But he called up,
he called up before the sixth inning,

858
00:52:30,921 --> 00:52:34,310
so that counts as him showing up.
Anyways, I do one of these every week.

859
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:37,010
People send me a,
they send me questions,

860
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:40,230
they send me their list of
underrated overrated. Um,

861
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,200
sometimes they ask me for advice.

862
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:45,710
Sometimes somebody sends
me a cunty email and uh,

863
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,740
they earned the right of a douche
bag of the week. If it's bad,

864
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:53,390
if it's bad criticism, if I deserve
it, I'll take one on the chin.

865
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:57,860
Um, and also I hiked the stuff
that I have going on in my career.

866
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:01,880
Okay. Bill, what do you have going
on in your career at this week? Well,

867
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:05,480
I will tell you on, uh, next Monday,

868
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,700
Monday the uh,

869
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:12,680
the fuck is today at damn this phone
once nine plus seven, the 16th,

870
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:17,750
March 16th, I am going to be
doing um, a couple of shows.

871
00:53:17,751 --> 00:53:21,320
I believe they added a second show
at the punchline in San Francisco.

872
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:23,390
The first one sold really well.

873
00:53:23,391 --> 00:53:27,480
And last I heard we were going
to add a second show. Um,

874
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,900
you can go to punchline comedy club.com.
I have all the information.

875
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,750
I probably don't even have that up
on my website. Do I? What a moron.

876
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,270
I'm going to do that at the end of this
podcast. By the time you hear this,

877
00:53:36,271 --> 00:53:38,740
it's going to be up there. Hopefully. Um,

878
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:42,320
I'm going to be at the
punchline San Francisco next
Monday night with Joe Barton.

879
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:44,520
Nick,
um,

880
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,020
and the shows are at seven o'clock and
I believe they just added a nine or nine

881
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:51,180
30.
And that's what I like to do.

882
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:54,870
I'd like to hype Shit where I have three
quarters of the information and later

883
00:53:54,871 --> 00:53:59,760
on this month, the final weekend of
March, whatever the hell those dates are,

884
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:03,420
I'm going to be at the house of
comedy and East St Louis White people.

885
00:54:03,421 --> 00:54:06,960
Don't be scared. It's going to
be a nice mixed crowd, you know,

886
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:11,390
and you know, just like our president
nice and mixed, you know, they'd go,

887
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:16,290
I don't let me bring in America together.
Um, and then I got up after that, I got,

888
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:17,880
uh,
the Trump marina.

889
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:23,400
Why don't I get on my fucking website
here and figure out most of you listening

890
00:54:23,401 --> 00:54:26,160
to this, by the way, on my website,

891
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:30,060
cause I gotta I gotta admit I'm
starting to find my space, my space.

892
00:54:30,061 --> 00:54:33,960
I'm starting to feel like the survivor
of a nuclear holocaust, you know,

893
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,020
kind of like will Smith's
character and I am legend

894
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:39,240
every day.

895
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,590
Every Monday I will be doing a podcast
at the pier down at the bottom of

896
00:54:43,591 --> 00:54:46,560
Manhattan, you know, and I
want you to saber tooth tiger.

897
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,350
I never understood those
fucking lions in that movie.

898
00:54:49,351 --> 00:54:50,610
Where the fuck did they come from?

899
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,290
You know the only lines in Manhattan
or in the zoo. So if everybody,

900
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:57,450
the zookeepers all died of
whatever fucking disease it was,

901
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:02,490
was that some animal lover who came
up with the end of the world? Rabies,

902
00:55:02,491 --> 00:55:07,170
I have to let these lions go and get
mauled to death just like you fucking

903
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:11,940
deserved. Um, okay. Here we go. Sorry. I
had to do that until I got to my website.

904
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,130
Um, April 4th, 2009,

905
00:55:14,131 --> 00:55:19,131
I will be at the Trump marina with
uninformed Joe to Rosa Comedy Central

906
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:21,900
Presents Joe to Rosa,

907
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:28,320
every local bar in Manhattan's Jody rose.
Sorry,

908
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,670
Joel, if you listen to this, I, you know,

909
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,360
good things come in three and you only
have two good things in your life.

910
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:35,580
All right? And I'm one of
them. Don't ever forget that.

911
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:40,440
You fucking half Egyptian S. All
right, getting a little louder,

912
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:44,760
a little more angrier.
Um, what else do I got?

913
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:49,761
I got the funny bone and Columbus and
my Caroline's date got moved from the

914
00:55:49,801 --> 00:55:54,060
middle of May to the last week
of April slash first weekend.

915
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:56,960
I guess it's the first weekend in May.
All right.

916
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:59,280
I'm sure I'm going to emails on that.
Oh my God,

917
00:55:59,281 --> 00:56:03,090
I was coming in from Chattanooga
just through your show.

918
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:06,780
Send me a free DVD.
I will,

919
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:10,320
as long as you open your mouth and let
the mailman jam it down he fucking throat.

920
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:15,630
I
really get made here.

921
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,260
Um, oh, we're going to be getting
less than the girlfriend over there.

922
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:23,740
She puts a fucking makeup
on. Okay. Audience of one.

923
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:30,400
Um, anyways, uh, oh, here
we go. You know, it's uh,

924
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:33,490
something that really annoys
the shit out of me. Uh, parents,

925
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:38,520
I don't like former Fred boy date rapists
to then have kids and then sit there

926
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:40,990
and, and you know, now
because they have a kid,

927
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,680
I have to be respectful around them.
I think I talked about this last week,

928
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:47,080
but I'm going to talk about it
again because it's happened again.

929
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:50,020
I'm sick of you form a
fucking loud douche bags,

930
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,520
you know who just ruined people's flights.

931
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:58,690
You've ruined baseball games basically.
You like me? Okay, you're an asshole.

932
00:56:58,691 --> 00:56:59,740
And now that you have a kid,

933
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:03,460
everyone else has to be on their best
behavior because you ended your life.

934
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:07,330
And the fun in your life. Everyone else
has to be on your schedule. All right?

935
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,030
Fuck you and your fucking kid,
all right?

936
00:57:10,031 --> 00:57:12,730
If you don't want them to be around
a fucking animal like myself,

937
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,380
don't take them out in public, okay?
That's what they have board games for.

938
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,250
So why don't you sit there with your
board game and you'd dip and re your

939
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:25,810
turtleneck sweater that you don't want
to wear as the rage for the person that

940
00:57:25,811 --> 00:57:28,960
you knocked up, builds up inside of
you. Why don't you keep that all right?

941
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:32,410
Walk out in your backyard
and scream into a bush. Okay?

942
00:57:32,411 --> 00:57:36,370
Believe you fucking kids
because I'm still single.

943
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:39,460
I don't have any kids and I'm having a
good time and I'm not having you be a

944
00:57:39,461 --> 00:57:43,390
fucking wet blanket because you have
this little creature that only half looks

945
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:47,530
like you. All right? Okay.

946
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,560
Comment of swinging.

947
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,260
I'm all right. I'm playing to the
crowd right now. I'm getting laughs.

948
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,010
I'm just fucking deliberately
being an asshole.

949
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:01,710
I'm really not in that bad of a mood,
Huh?

950
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,650
I'm not singling. You know what I mean?
I'm not married either. All right.

951
00:58:05,651 --> 00:58:08,620
So watch your p's and q's over there,
sweetheart.

952
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:14,440
Um, ever tell you I got my girlfriend,
they gave us little fucking,

953
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:15,880
I want to put my makeup on.

954
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:19,990
I'm a little eight year old princess
women love that Shit and you know,

955
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:23,110
and you'd think it would keep them
from heckling you during a podcast,

956
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:27,940
but it doesn't. The fucking
happiness only lasts for a few days.

957
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:33,790
All right, question number one. Okay.
So if you new to my podcast, I do a,

958
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:36,300
and this one is going to be a little
short this week. I know, I would say that.

959
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:40,180
Then I ended up doing 50 minutes,
but uh, I'm already up to 18 minutes.

960
00:58:40,181 --> 00:58:41,650
I'm gonna try to keep this,
uh,

961
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:46,540
kind of try to keep this about
30 minutes. Oh, by the way,

962
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:50,080
I went down to Irvine last
night and I watched, uh,

963
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,810
my old friend from the Chappelle show,
Charlie Murphy to a,

964
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,570
a nice hours worth of killer material
that I haven't seen before. Um,

965
00:58:58,571 --> 00:59:03,160
if you get a chance, definitely check
out Sharley. I think he really has a, uh,

966
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:08,620
just a totally original, original
fucking style. That's great.

967
00:59:08,621 --> 00:59:12,370
He just goes up there and he tells these
fucked up stories. Either that happened,

968
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,840
that he invented hybrid stories
that are partially true.

969
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:19,030
I don't even know what the fuck he was.
Great.

970
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:24,050
I sat there in the crowd like a
Goddamn Fan. Had a great time. Um,

971
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,480
and that is it.
So look at me hyping other,

972
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:29,750
took a little bit of a fucking great guy.
I am granted,

973
00:59:29,751 --> 00:59:34,370
I already hyped my shows and buried his
hype fucking 20 minutes into a podcast

974
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:38,810
and I'm patting myself
on the back. Um, alright.

975
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:42,530
I do questions. I answer questions
every week here on the podcast.

976
00:59:42,531 --> 00:59:45,080
So here are some questions.
Hey Bill,

977
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,680
I was wondering if you ever had a slow,

978
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:50,840
a slow spot in comedy.

979
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:55,550
Like if you ever had a period of time
when you didn't come up with any material,

980
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:57,230
any material for awhile.
Oh yeah.

981
00:59:57,231 --> 01:00:02,000
That happens all the time then it
happens like every six weeks, you know,

982
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:05,810
or whatever. Or we'll have for
a six week period. But, um,

983
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:09,380
I've learned how to get,
I've learned what works for me,

984
01:00:09,381 --> 01:00:13,280
how to get me out of those.
And I think I've answered this before,

985
01:00:13,281 --> 01:00:16,550
but I know I have a Zillion podcasts so
I will answer it again in the name of

986
01:00:16,551 --> 01:00:20,090
comedy. Um, what I do to
get myself out of those,

987
01:00:20,091 --> 01:00:23,900
I take all rules of,
of being a hack.

988
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:27,290
I just throw those out the window and um,

989
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:30,680
I'm really setting myself up to
get trashed. Like really, Bill,

990
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,660
I never noticed that you ever,
uh,

991
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:37,700
didn't take the rules of hack
off with your awful specials? Um,

992
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:42,350
no, I just basically I do two things.
What I'm going to write his block a,

993
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:46,370
I will talk about current
events like that dumb broad,

994
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:51,490
but the eight fucking kids and just
basically shit that like every comic is

995
01:00:52,251 --> 01:00:53,690
jumping on.
You know,

996
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,810
like you ever see when an animal dies
and the discovery channel's a bunch of

997
01:00:56,811 --> 01:00:59,900
vultures sitting around it. That's
kind of like hack materials. Like,

998
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:04,040
and I'll fucking fly right down with my
ugly buzzard head and I'll take a big

999
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:07,820
chunk out of it. I basically just
basically if you're in writer's block,

1000
01:01:07,821 --> 01:01:12,140
just do hacky shit
about topical new stuff.

1001
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:17,450
And also I try to ask my self
what's bugging me right now?

1002
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,860
Anything from, um, my girlfriend,

1003
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:28,970
it's going to bad look there.
My girlfriend too. Uh, like,

1004
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:32,810
um, the fact that I can't
come up with any new material,

1005
01:01:32,811 --> 01:01:37,580
anything that's bothering
me. And um, I just,

1006
01:01:37,581 --> 01:01:40,940
you just kind of use that as an exercise
just to go on stage and just to be

1007
01:01:40,941 --> 01:01:41,990
saying something new,

1008
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:45,710
even though you know it's hacky
shit that you never got to keep it,

1009
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:49,730
it still feels good to not be doing
all the jokes that you're sick of.

1010
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:54,530
And usually they'll end up spinning
into something else hopefully.

1011
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:59,000
And you kind of pull yourself
out of the mud and uh,

1012
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:03,860
and if all else fails, just pick on some
fat guy in the crowd. All right. No,

1013
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,410
don't do that. Don't do that. Okay.

1014
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:10,700
It didn't we learn anything
from Eddie Murphy in the clumps,

1015
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:12,830
whatever the fuck that more than,
what was that movie called?

1016
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:16,220
The night he professor,
you know, I fucked up.

1017
01:02:16,221 --> 01:02:20,040
I thought it hit all the questions right
in a row. Now I gotta scroll down. Hey,

1018
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:23,160
how did you guys enjoy the music last
week? Did you like the old school music?

1019
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:28,110
I'm going to play some more and we play
you a Ted Heath elks parade next week.

1020
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:31,350
This is slowly just going to
become like fucking pirate radio.

1021
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,630
I bought two more records this week.

1022
01:02:33,631 --> 01:02:37,500
I actually bought a clash record cause
I felt really bad about trashing them,

1023
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:40,320
not trashing, I'm just saying
I didn't understand that music.

1024
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:45,830
So I deliberately went out and I bought
a bunch of music that I never fucked

1025
01:02:46,501 --> 01:02:50,130
with when I was a kid cause I uh,
I got into ACDC,

1026
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:52,260
which led me into Motley Crue,

1027
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:57,150
which led me then down to a
really bad road of Glam hair metal

1028
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:01,290
that I want to say
ended with Brittany Fox.

1029
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,710
But somewhere in there
though, I did, I did.

1030
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,580
I found Stevie Ray Vaughan when he did
the video for, couldn't stand the weather.

1031
01:03:08,581 --> 01:03:12,150
So I always had one foot in decent music.
But uh,

1032
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:17,100
basically I totally shut out the
Ramones or the clash unless you know,

1033
01:03:17,101 --> 01:03:21,780
other than their radio shit,
Elvis Costello, this is all
shit I bought this week.

1034
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:25,830
I finally downloaded, uh,
David Bowie, that, uh,

1035
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:30,330
Ziggy stardust album.
And I was like, you know,

1036
01:03:30,331 --> 01:03:34,980
this is like one of these great concept
albums that people listened to in the

1037
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:35,910
70s. And I was like, fuck this,

1038
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:39,720
I'm doing it the way they did
it in the 70s minus the drugs.

1039
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:43,650
So I got my headphones that I have,
I do have headphones,

1040
01:03:43,651 --> 01:03:47,310
I have the big fucking,
you know what actually for drums,

1041
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,910
they kind of protect the ears from the
drums and he also can listen to your iPod,

1042
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:52,380
which I don't have my dismay.

1043
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:57,950
And I plugged it in my laptop and I
listened to the album and I fucked up was

1044
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:03,060
because rather than listening to it in
the track order, I guess on my iTunes,

1045
01:04:03,061 --> 01:04:07,500
I had it in, you know, last downloaded.
So it kind of jumped all around the album.

1046
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:11,010
I kind of realized when the Ziggy stardust
fucking kill themselves or whatever,

1047
01:04:11,011 --> 01:04:13,170
by the third song, I'm like, wow,

1048
01:04:13,171 --> 01:04:15,750
how's David Bowlby going to pull
himself out of this fucking thing?

1049
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:18,420
And then I realized,
you know,

1050
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:24,530
once again I fucked up with technology
but the fucking killer album and uh,

1051
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:29,160
I dunno if anybody has any suggestions of,
of music from that era,

1052
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:33,390
you know, all the shit that I
thought sucked, like talking heads.

1053
01:04:33,391 --> 01:04:35,040
I kind of like the couple of their songs,

1054
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:38,460
but like some David Burns
Solo shit I found is amazing.

1055
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,940
And to think that I was in a,
in a warehouse

1056
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:49,070
just trashing him during that period of
my life thinking that he sucked as I was

1057
01:04:49,141 --> 01:04:54,120
listening to Cinderella
and poison and all this,

1058
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,330
uh, Tesla, I'm not saying they were bad,

1059
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:01,800
but that was definitely the smooth jazz
of heavy metal. It was a, I don't know,

1060
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:05,850
it's just fucking
embarrassing.

1061
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,140
Really embarrassing.

1062
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:11,010
I think eighties music really gets a
bad rap when you start listening to, uh,

1063
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:14,440
I dunno.
I Dunno what the fuck up.

1064
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:18,220
I just literally asked you for advice
then and then I bought a couple albums.

1065
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,300
All right. Actually, literally
still by him too, by the way.

1066
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,000
Bought a couple of cds and
didn't even listen to them yet.

1067
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:29,770
And now I'm already trying to tell you
guys what's good music from the 80s CDC,

1068
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:32,620
the fucking most of the Inner Mussolini.

1069
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:37,450
It's fucking me. I Dunno.
I'm not. All right. Um,

1070
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:40,070
let's get to underrated
overrated here or what?

1071
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:41,920
You guys want to hear a
story about revenge. Huh?

1072
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:43,660
I like how I asked you guys questions.
You know,

1073
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:46,900
it's like you actually have a say and
as you sit there and nod your head and

1074
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,850
your cubicle, yeah, yeah. You know,

1075
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:53,500
a pump your fist on your
fucking treadmill, you know,

1076
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,120
or just say yes out loud,
loud,

1077
01:05:56,140 --> 01:06:01,140
loud in your middle seat on that Delta
Airlines flight you on Delta Airlines

1078
01:06:01,571 --> 01:06:02,350
right now.

1079
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:06,610
Is there somebody with bad breath eating
pistachios next to you ever tell you

1080
01:06:06,611 --> 01:06:10,570
that fucking story? Unreal. And
he's eating the red ones too.

1081
01:06:10,571 --> 01:06:15,010
That made his lips all fucking pink by
the end of it. Horrific. Horrific flight.

1082
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:19,630
All right, let's get to the revenge.
When the fuck is it? COSI generation.

1083
01:06:19,631 --> 01:06:23,080
I'm really disorganized this week.
Okay. Because I have guests. I have,

1084
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:26,860
I'm entertaining this week. All right.
And wearing a Tuxedo for three days.

1085
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,860
Underrated. Overrated, underrated.

1086
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:33,850
Overrated with fuck is the revenge story.

1087
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:42,610
God dammit. Oh, this isn't terracing.
I don't want to just read it.

1088
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,260
I'm just going to start.
I'm just going to jump around.

1089
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:49,520
I'm just going to jump around. Who's
at House of pain? Um, no. Well fuck.

1090
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:51,040
Oh fuck you.
I don't know who it was.

1091
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:54,160
I tapped out during that Perry
to write movie review bill.

1092
01:06:54,161 --> 01:06:56,800
I just got back from the
midnight showing of the watchman.

1093
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:58,900
I really don't know how to review it.

1094
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:03,310
I'm told it sticks pretty close to
the graphic novel and had cool special

1095
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:07,270
effects, great story and good acting.
But I kind of felt eh after it,

1096
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:10,360
after leaving the dark night,
I remember I was so amazed.

1097
01:07:10,361 --> 01:07:13,420
I didn't have a single thought run
through my head for at least five minutes

1098
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:18,030
after ironman and hulk. I left feeling
satisfaction. But with this movie,

1099
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:21,490
something just kind of left me feeling
depressed after watching and I think it

1100
01:07:21,491 --> 01:07:26,080
was the overall message of the movie
was serious told in a totally ridiculous

1101
01:07:26,081 --> 01:07:29,590
way. Anyway. Anyway, I would
recommend it. But go with caution.

1102
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:33,250
If you don't like comic books and
have trouble following fragmented,

1103
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:37,450
fragmented storylines like
Tarantino movies, I wouldn't go.

1104
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,820
You know,
it's said God damn good review.

1105
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:43,690
Got Right to the fucking meat and
potatoes of it. Oh, and by the way,

1106
01:07:43,691 --> 01:07:48,460
he says it was directed by the guy
who did the 300 story, 300 movies.

1107
01:07:48,461 --> 01:07:53,380
So there's a lot of man ass in
it. Yeah, I find that funny.

1108
01:07:53,381 --> 01:07:58,150
That guys really liked that.
Uh, that movie 300. I mean,

1109
01:07:58,151 --> 01:08:00,130
I thought it was pretty ridiculous,
but um,

1110
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:04,660
the amount of guys that get pumped
after they see that, I mean,

1111
01:08:04,661 --> 01:08:07,720
that literally was playgirl the movie.
I thought,

1112
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,400
um, I just thought, don't think ms
stupid. They, you can turn this spot. Ah.

1113
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:20,000
All right, good luck with
the, um, you know what that's
like. That's like Beyonce,

1114
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:22,820
my girlfriend downloaded
that fucking album.

1115
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:28,400
The name of the album is
I am dot, dot, dot, dot.

1116
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:33,350
Sasha fierce. All right, Beyonce. Well,

1117
01:08:33,351 --> 01:08:36,950
good luck with that character.
He kind of still sounded like Beyonce.

1118
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:41,480
If you ask me. Beautiful, gorgeous
woman, woman really can dance.

1119
01:08:41,481 --> 01:08:45,170
But her voice, oof. Jesus Christ.

1120
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:49,300
Yeah.
Yay.

1121
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:54,130
Horrible punishing you.

1122
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:58,120
Just fucking Polish into her.

1123
01:08:58,121 --> 01:09:00,880
Best thing was when she whipped her
head around and fell down on the stage.

1124
01:09:00,881 --> 01:09:03,970
That was probably one of the greatest
things I think I've ever seen.

1125
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,390
And a lot of it's just bitterness. She's
just absolutely gorgeous. You know,

1126
01:09:07,391 --> 01:09:08,590
she's totally out of your league.

1127
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:12,040
And is there anything funnier than
seeing a beautiful girl just fucking fall

1128
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:14,560
right on her ass?
You know,

1129
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,430
this is ridiculous and I'm sure she's
a nice fucking person, but you know,

1130
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:21,340
I should really, reality is, I'm
kinda thinking like, this is Jay z,

1131
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:25,180
his fucking wife. And uh, then he
stabbed somebody one time for something,

1132
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:30,010
although he did it in a hacky way.
He walked up and he used the Godfather,

1133
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,280
the line. He said, you broke my heart
and then stabbed him. That's all alleged.

1134
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:37,840
Why don't I shut the fuck
up? Okay, I will. All right,
here's a revenge story. Bill.

1135
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:38,980
I'm not really into revenge,

1136
01:09:38,981 --> 01:09:42,520
but if someone fucks with me to the point
where I think about pushing them off a

1137
01:09:42,521 --> 01:09:47,050
cliff, then yeah, I kind of feel like I
have to do something. So here's my story.

1138
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:51,910
Oh, this is a good one. Settle in
for this one. If you're at home,

1139
01:09:51,911 --> 01:09:55,660
get underneath your ass can and roast
some fucking marshmallows because this is

1140
01:09:55,661 --> 01:09:59,980
like a, this is the closest
thing to what go story. Um,

1141
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:02,800
this is just has that evil fucking,
uh,

1142
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:07,720
last house on the left Vibe, um, which
I loved that they're making. Again,

1143
01:10:07,721 --> 01:10:10,440
cause that reference will
finally make sense to people. Um,

1144
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:13,870
if you don't know what that is,
there was John Rose films in the 70s,

1145
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:18,520
w which were basically rate movies.
Last House on the left gator Bait.

1146
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:23,110
Fucking, uh, I spit on your
grave and evidently they're
going to make a comeback,

1147
01:10:23,111 --> 01:10:26,890
which I think is fucking
hilarious, you know, you know,

1148
01:10:26,891 --> 01:10:30,970
we haven't had a good rate
movie in awhile. All right. Um,

1149
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,490
let's remake last house on the left.

1150
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:41,200
I think that that needs to be
updated. All right. Anyways, Bill,

1151
01:10:41,201 --> 01:10:44,710
I had a girlfriend for about three
years. This is the revenge story. Bill.

1152
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:48,460
I had a girlfriend for about three
years who ended up cheating on me when I

1153
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:50,440
found,
and when I found out about it,

1154
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:56,370
I called her out on it and
she got defenses and turned
on me, blah, blah, blah.

1155
01:10:57,580 --> 01:11:00,880
Wow, dude, that's, that's some
pretty, uh, she's got skills.

1156
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,830
If she was able to do that, uh, you
cheated on me. You fucking bitch.

1157
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:10,120
Yeah. Well you never do the
dishes. Okay. I'm sorry.

1158
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:16,050
I guess you made a good point. How the
fuck did she turn on you? Unless you,

1159
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:18,870
all right bill, just shut up and read
the story. Okay. I will. So anyway,

1160
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:21,570
she turned on me. Um, then he goes,

1161
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:25,650
I made the poor decision and
took her back about a year later,

1162
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:26,521
about a year later,

1163
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:31,521
she cheated on me again and I told her
to go fuck herself prior to the second

1164
01:11:31,561 --> 01:11:35,220
cheating,
I bought a trip to Disney world for us.

1165
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:39,570
And about eight months after we broke up,
it was time for the,

1166
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:43,740
for the Disney world trip.
So I asked her if she wanted to go see,

1167
01:11:43,741 --> 01:11:48,270
she said yes and off we went.
Now my revenge kicks in.

1168
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:52,560
See, this is just like one of those
movies starts off all nice and sunny.

1169
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:57,300
We'll go into the camp and
going to Disneyland and here
comes fucking Jason on a

1170
01:11:57,301 --> 01:12:00,480
crystal lake. Um, so
now my revenge kicks in.

1171
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:05,520
All of the degrading things
I've ever wanted to do. This
chick I did to this one.

1172
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:10,110
Okay. And I have guests, so I get a
mumble. This shit I busted on her face.

1173
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:15,300
I pounded her into the ass
until she puked Jesus Christ.

1174
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:19,860
Women are just literally ripping their
headsets off right now. Anyways, he goes,

1175
01:12:19,861 --> 01:12:24,390
it was fantastic.
On the fourth night we had an argument,

1176
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:29,660
she told me that she wanted to go on this
trip to try and win me back cause she

1177
01:12:30,781 --> 01:12:33,000
felt bad for all the
things she had done to me.

1178
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:38,570
Basically she was apologizing for
cheating when I told her that there was no

1179
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:41,190
chance of us getting back together.

1180
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:46,350
And the only reason why I fucked her
was to make her feel like a prostitute.

1181
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:54,870
She bought a plane ticket
home and I felt wonderful.

1182
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:59,580
I guess what I'm trying to say is
some people deserve what they get.

1183
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:05,790
Oh God, what a great, great story.
Um, there's so many levels to that.

1184
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:09,630
Okay. First of all, just the fucking,

1185
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,480
the fact that she cheated on
you and you took her back,

1186
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:16,830
he just liked dineros character
and casino, you know what I mean?

1187
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:18,210
You didn't know how to handle it.

1188
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,340
And then she cheats on you second time
and then you just become jaded and you

1189
01:13:23,341 --> 01:13:28,200
just go into like a, it was like, you
know those movies where the guy, you know,

1190
01:13:28,201 --> 01:13:28,920
the,

1191
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,980
the week person's just getting the shit
kicked out of 'em and then finally they

1192
01:13:31,981 --> 01:13:33,840
just can't fucking take it anymore.

1193
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:37,200
And then all of a sudden they turned
into like fucking like Clint Eastwood

1194
01:13:37,201 --> 01:13:39,870
character.
You actually did that with this girl.

1195
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:43,800
And then the whole other
level that I love, okay.

1196
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:49,220
Is that now that you've finally pound
in this skank in bed the way she always

1197
01:13:49,531 --> 01:13:53,610
wanted to, probably the reason
she cheated on you. You know,

1198
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:56,460
cause you probably will do in the,
I love you kind of sex now.

1199
01:13:56,461 --> 01:14:01,050
You actually fucking do what you was
supposed to be doing with this girl.

1200
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:04,020
Now she wants to get back with you.
Fuck that.

1201
01:14:04,021 --> 01:14:06,600
She didn't go to Disneyland because
she wanted to get back with you.

1202
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:11,560
She went to Disneyland because she's
a fucking cunt who saw a free tip to

1203
01:14:11,561 --> 01:14:15,640
fucking Florida and she thought she was
going to play you again and get more

1204
01:14:15,641 --> 01:14:16,474
shit out of you.

1205
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,810
Then all of a sudden you come in there
and you throw down like Johnny fucking

1206
01:14:19,811 --> 01:14:22,720
Wad and now all of a sudden that then,

1207
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,950
then she wanted to get back with you and
then you told him to go fuck herself.

1208
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,580
Which was perfect because I thought you
were going to crumble in that moment and

1209
01:14:30,581 --> 01:14:35,140
you didn't, you know, and then she
fucking left and then that's great.

1210
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:39,700
And then you laughed your ass off and
jumped on the tea cups listening to,

1211
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:44,230
it's a small world after all,
you know, that's fucking great.

1212
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:48,700
Four stars. If you fucking film that,
I would, not only would I go see it,

1213
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:52,720
I would buy it on DVD.
Great fucking story of revenge.

1214
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:59,240
Um, all right. And we go, oh, we had a
lot of passion in it, Huh? Oh, we're,

1215
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:02,590
are we up to 34 minutes? All right, let's
hustle through this. All right. Overrated.

1216
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:07,240
Overrated. Underrated list for the week.
Overrated. High priced Mexican foods.

1217
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:11,830
You can get the same shit for half
the price across the street. You know,

1218
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:15,910
some shit is written so perfectly, I
don't even need to add to it. Exactly.

1219
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:21,040
100% correct. I still had to add to
it. Alright. Underrated. Fake boobs.

1220
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:24,130
Fucking awesome.
Um,

1221
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:27,880
I like how that's written so short
and it's just up to me to draw my own

1222
01:15:27,881 --> 01:15:32,820
collusion, my own conclusions.
Fake boobs. Fucking awesome. Um,

1223
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:36,740
have you ever touched him?
The fucking horrific. Um,

1224
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:41,140
personally I guess I hate fake boobs
are the worst. Uh, don't ever do that.

1225
01:15:41,810 --> 01:15:45,310
I don't ever do that. Then all of a
sudden in a matter how good they are,

1226
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:49,960
it's like you're having sex
with a fucking cyborg. I,

1227
01:15:49,961 --> 01:15:54,010
one of those awful Bruce Willis movies.
Remember those are judge dread.

1228
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:56,520
You know those movies where you know,
they always,

1229
01:15:56,521 --> 01:15:59,890
they always ended up hooking up
with some half person, half robot.

1230
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,020
That's what I feel about that stuff.

1231
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:05,320
And I really don't understand why people
get face lifts and stuff, you know,

1232
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:11,300
first of all it doesn't look good and
everybody noticed even if even if you

1233
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:14,170
didn't notice for some reason
when you get your face lift,

1234
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:18,580
it also becomes really shiny.
Can anybody explain what that is?

1235
01:16:18,581 --> 01:16:19,870
Is that the Botox?

1236
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:25,470
What is it about getting faceless that
makes you face so fucking shiny and it

1237
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:29,460
literally looks like laminated?
Um,

1238
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:31,961
now you know what it looks like.

1239
01:16:31,961 --> 01:16:35,860
It looks like the apples and the grocery
store that they spray to make them

1240
01:16:35,861 --> 01:16:38,920
really, really shiny. Speaking to
which you ever get an organic apple.

1241
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:43,240
I mean it's like so natural. There's
like a fucking warm in it. I like the,

1242
01:16:43,241 --> 01:16:47,620
I think I like the old shiny ones.
Um, all right, Phil Love U podcast.

1243
01:16:47,621 --> 01:16:52,360
Just wanted to say, I think using, I like
this one too. A bill. I just want to say,

1244
01:16:52,361 --> 01:16:54,670
I think using big words is overrated.

1245
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:59,500
If you can express something by
saying a simple, normal word,

1246
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,300
why use a big word?

1247
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,460
I just broke up with my girlfriend today
and earlier she had called me anthro,

1248
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,090
anthro phobic because I don't even know
what the fuck that means because I don't

1249
01:17:11,091 --> 01:17:12,590
like,
cause I don't like her friends.

1250
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:16,070
She called me anthro cause I
don't like her friends. Um,

1251
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,930
I just don't like most of her friends.

1252
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:21,560
It doesn't mean I hate people in
general or even hate or friends.

1253
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:24,470
I honestly didn't know what it meant.
So I looked it up.

1254
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:29,240
It means a fear of people,
which isn't even what she said.

1255
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:30,141
You're right.

1256
01:17:30,141 --> 01:17:35,141
She didn't even use it correctly or
actually what she or she has a delusional

1257
01:17:35,331 --> 01:17:39,440
view of her friends that her
friends represent everybody
or that her friends are

1258
01:17:39,441 --> 01:17:41,000
so great that if you don't like them,

1259
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:45,830
then you just hate all people because
her friends represent humanity.

1260
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:51,680
Jesus. Good movement. Dumping
that fucking stuck up Twat. Um,

1261
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:54,800
anyways,
I definitely do not like a lot of people,

1262
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:58,940
but I don't hate people
unlike that call last week.

1263
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:03,680
Who messed with that guy's mom? Mom's car.
Yeah. That guy was fucking nuts. Anyways,

1264
01:18:03,681 --> 01:18:05,750
it seems like a,
you're kind of the same way.

1265
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:09,800
I just don't see the point of using big
words other than trying to sound smart.

1266
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:14,990
It's like if something can be said more
easily and in a way that's easily more

1267
01:18:14,991 --> 01:18:17,090
easily understood by using smaller wood,

1268
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:20,060
words can't even fucking read.

1269
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:23,690
Especially if you have an idiot like
me reading it. Keep the word small.

1270
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:27,640
Would you say something like that
serial killer was, I can't even,

1271
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,640
I don't know what this word is.
Dak Know Adac no maniac.

1272
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:36,350
Or that Lee was obsessed with killing.
I don't think you'd say either.

1273
01:18:36,351 --> 01:18:38,360
I think you just say that
guy's a serial killer. I mean,

1274
01:18:38,361 --> 01:18:41,840
I think we know what serial killers do.
I know what you mean.

1275
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:46,740
Do I know what you mean by this is what
I think. I think, I think big words, uh,

1276
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:50,420
they're, they're much better
in print. You know what I mean?

1277
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:54,560
Cause you don't want to read, you know,
a great novel and just have someone like,

1278
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:59,600
dude, shit was fucked
up. You know, I was like,

1279
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:04,460
damn, I mean I wouldn't want to
read like I, I don't, I don't mind.

1280
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:07,370
I don't mind big words,
but I mean

1281
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:12,680
they have to be coming out of the
right person's mouth. In fact,

1282
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:16,490
I kind of liked them on some
level when, um, you know,

1283
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:20,270
but person use a big word and it makes
me want to read and they're actually

1284
01:19:20,271 --> 01:19:23,690
using it in an obnoxious way and they've
earned the right to use it that way

1285
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:26,690
because they actually do read
and don't watch TV. But yeah,

1286
01:19:26,691 --> 01:19:31,160
if it's just some chick you were dating
who has cunty friends and they watch the

1287
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,870
Osi every Thursday night and then
she pulls out a word like that. Um,

1288
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:39,560
that sounds like that, that was
a breakup word. She was like,

1289
01:19:39,561 --> 01:19:42,950
I'm going to use a big word here so I
can feel like I'm above this guy who's

1290
01:19:42,951 --> 01:19:46,160
dumping me because my low self esteem is,
is,

1291
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:48,650
is gonna fucking flow right over the side.

1292
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,820
And I'm going to break down and I'm going
to start crying and I'm going to have

1293
01:19:51,821 --> 01:19:53,870
a snot bubble and I'm
going to feel horrible.

1294
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,290
And I know in six months I'm going to
realize this person isn't worth crying

1295
01:19:57,291 --> 01:20:01,820
about. So I'm going to use a fucking
big word here to try to save myself.

1296
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:07,270
I really forgot what I was saying
halfway through that. That's weird.

1297
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:09,610
I actually agree with that guy.
And then in that scenario,

1298
01:20:09,611 --> 01:20:11,640
I just sorta trashed him like
saying he wasn't working,

1299
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:15,390
he was wasn't worth crying over.
You know what?

1300
01:20:15,391 --> 01:20:18,390
I don't know shit about either one of
you, but, uh, you wrote me the letter,

1301
01:20:18,391 --> 01:20:19,980
so I'm going to fucking side with you.

1302
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:24,750
I'm trying to be more balanced because
I trashed chicks twice in this. Uh,

1303
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:25,770
all right.
Hey Bill,

1304
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:28,770
I've been a big fan of yours since
I saw your European friends, Sam,

1305
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:29,910
as in his hand.
I was wondering,

1306
01:20:29,911 --> 01:20:33,750
when are you gonna come to the
punchline in Atlanta? Well,

1307
01:20:33,751 --> 01:20:38,751
why don't you go on my fucking website
and scroll down and look for punchline in

1308
01:20:38,881 --> 01:20:42,030
Atlanta?
That's usually a good way to find out.

1309
01:20:42,031 --> 01:20:45,450
When I'm at the punchline in Atlanta,
I'm there in June.

1310
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:48,900
Why do I put my dates up?
You know, you know why?

1311
01:20:48,901 --> 01:20:52,550
Because 90% of you actually read the
calendar and this fucking guy is not going

1312
01:20:52,551 --> 01:20:53,700
to listen to this podcast.

1313
01:20:53,701 --> 01:20:56,490
And he's going to email me again
this week and you know what?

1314
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,650
I'm actually going to send them
an email because I'm a whore.

1315
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:02,940
It'll tell me exact dates and put a link
on it. So I'm just going to shut up. Um,

1316
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:07,190
anyways. Um, all your
shit is lit up, man. So,

1317
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:14,040
um, anyway, overrated, underrated,
overrated. Having kids.

1318
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:17,130
Marriage is bad enough,
but for the life of me,

1319
01:21:17,131 --> 01:21:20,220
I can't understand why the fuck
anyone would ever want to have kids.

1320
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,680
Your life effectively
ends when you have kids.

1321
01:21:22,681 --> 01:21:24,660
Everything you do has to be for them.

1322
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:29,640
How fucking pathetic is your life that
you have, um, that you decide, you know,

1323
01:21:29,641 --> 01:21:32,220
what would be fun?
Never having any fun anymore.

1324
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:37,200
I can't wait to clean shit out of some
douchebag. Infants, Asshole, Jesus Christ.

1325
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,530
Only get four hours of sleep at night.

1326
01:21:40,531 --> 01:21:44,130
If I'm lucky and never have any
fucking fun with my friends ever again.

1327
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:48,060
I mean Jesus fucking Christ.
Are you kidding me? Um,

1328
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:51,870
underrated.
This is the same guy maker's mark whiskey.

1329
01:21:57,630 --> 01:22:01,050
Let me guess what you talk about after
you've had a couple of belts from that.

1330
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:06,570
Anyways, he says, this shit is all I
drink and it's fucking spectacular.

1331
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:10,770
Under 40 bucks a handle, 80 proof
and smoother than James fucking bond.

1332
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:16,230
Uh, this guy's great. This guy is
like the guy's guy and he's the guy.

1333
01:22:16,410 --> 01:22:17,640
You know what I love about this dude?

1334
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:21,150
This is the kind of guy when you're in a
bar and you know you're fucking up your

1335
01:22:21,151 --> 01:22:23,850
life, which is why you go to
the bar and you start drinking,

1336
01:22:23,851 --> 01:22:28,110
and this is the guy who's going to tell
you when you should face that everything

1337
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:32,860
you're doing is exactly right. He's the
guy who comes up. What's the matter man?

1338
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:33,781
I don't know man.

1339
01:22:33,781 --> 01:22:37,410
I blew with this chick and he's the
guy that you blue with this chick.

1340
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,150
What the fuck is,
well,

1341
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:41,910
you don't want to be with some
fucking Broadway you out of your funk.

1342
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:45,930
And he just builds you up and then
you get him. Or did you get a Dui?

1343
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:50,400
And then they take your shoe laces and
then you curl up on that burlap sack they

1344
01:22:50,401 --> 01:22:53,490
use for a blanket and you wait for
your dad to come down and pick you up.

1345
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:59,130
You know? But in that moment,
before all that shit happens,

1346
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:04,080
it's, this guy's the shit. Um, do you know
what it is? I think as you get older yet,

1347
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:04,791
like me,
I,

1348
01:23:04,791 --> 01:23:07,720
I'm starting to really feel like I
want to have a kid now because it gets

1349
01:23:07,721 --> 01:23:12,700
pathetic after awhile, you know? I
Dunno. I Dunno if it's, it's the,

1350
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:17,290
the magnetic pull of the herd,
you know what I mean?

1351
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,460
Everything has like a gravity
to it and I think they,

1352
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:23,530
as much as you tried to fucking
escape the orbit of the fucking heard,

1353
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:27,870
you get pulled back into
it. And, uh, I dunno.

1354
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:30,100
Sometimes I feel like I'm
having too much fun. Like,

1355
01:23:30,101 --> 01:23:33,640
as a 40 year old guy and
I'm sitting there, you know,

1356
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:35,950
learning how to play good times,
bad times,

1357
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:41,380
and I got the NHL package
and when I'm not watching TV,

1358
01:23:41,381 --> 01:23:44,230
I'm learning how to play ACDC songs.
So when I'm not doing that,

1359
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:46,450
I'm fucking telling jokes on stage.

1360
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:51,760
It just gets to the point you like
going like you start feeling guilty,

1361
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:56,080
you know, I ain't guilty, but you just
started looking like, you know what,

1362
01:23:56,081 --> 01:24:00,250
I need to fucking teach someone
else how to do their life like this.

1363
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:05,470
You know, I got to admit I am a
miserable motherfucker, but I am having,

1364
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:10,450
I'm having a great time and you can have
it too if you learn how to talk about

1365
01:24:10,451 --> 01:24:13,120
your Dick on stage. All
right, last thing, Bill,

1366
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:16,690
you started talking about the police last
week and it got me thinking about them.

1367
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:20,290
Uh, the band, the police, all this.
When I was talking about all the, uh,

1368
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,100
all the music that I missed
out on the police will,

1369
01:24:23,101 --> 01:24:27,730
one of the few that I listened to. Um,
anyways, you started talking about them.

1370
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:29,200
And so it pulled me out,

1371
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:34,030
made me pull out some of my old records
and I started listening to them. Um,

1372
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,010
and his underrated for the week.
As he said,

1373
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:38,230
sting is a very underrated bass player.

1374
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:41,530
Most of the baselines
he plays are amazing.

1375
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:45,340
I know most people think of him for his
solo work and all the crappy new age

1376
01:24:45,341 --> 01:24:49,120
stuff he does, but when he
was with the police, um,

1377
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:53,640
he could rock a base like no other.
Uh, yeah, I've gotta admit. Yeah,

1378
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:56,830
he's fucking, um, I would definitely,

1379
01:24:56,860 --> 01:25:00,280
I don't know if he is underrated
now with musicians. He isn't,

1380
01:25:00,281 --> 01:25:03,310
but I think with people he's underrated
because a lot of people feel that, yeah,

1381
01:25:03,311 --> 01:25:05,080
a lot of his solo stuff is cheesy.

1382
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:08,380
And meanwhile he's playing with
some of the bet like Vinny,

1383
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,360
Kali Uda in all these fucking guys.

1384
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:15,810
And then I make God at songs like really
laying that that field is a gold song,

1385
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:20,350
whichever it was like people think is
like, elevator music has him on base.

1386
01:25:20,351 --> 01:25:24,350
And I think Vinny call Udas
actually playing on drums. Um,

1387
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,950
all right. I'm a music nerd. All
right. And, uh, and that's it.

1388
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:32,390
It's kind of clock out
here and I have to go, uh,

1389
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:35,440
I got to go do some touristy
shit. So, uh, you guys,

1390
01:25:35,441 --> 01:25:38,380
I really want to thank you for
continuing to write in the questions,

1391
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:40,180
the underrated overrated. You
guys. You know, it's funny,

1392
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:43,840
you guys are getting so good at
this shit that, uh, the podcast,

1393
01:25:43,841 --> 01:25:44,920
I think it becoming better.

1394
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:48,040
I'm actually reading out loud and much
better way you guys actually using

1395
01:25:48,041 --> 01:25:51,340
punctuation and I,
you telling me some great stories.

1396
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:54,820
I'm loving the stories about revenge.
Um,

1397
01:25:55,870 --> 01:26:00,760
and if you just want to comment on revenge
in general, cause, um, I, you know,

1398
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:05,030
I dunno. Revenge really.
Uh, that's a line that I, I,

1399
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:09,650
I've never, I just don't care.
I just don't cross that. I just,

1400
01:26:09,651 --> 01:26:11,630
I feel like that is the deepest,

1401
01:26:11,631 --> 01:26:15,980
darkest part of your soul that
you can go into. You know,

1402
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:20,690
you're fucking, uh, you know what you
like. You like Jimmy Smits on Dexter.

1403
01:26:20,830 --> 01:26:22,490
Do you guys watch desks,
Dexter this season?

1404
01:26:22,491 --> 01:26:26,420
I'm gonna recommend a couple of
shows Dexter I liked, but, uh,

1405
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:30,350
you gotta watch brotherhood,
showtime on demand.

1406
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:33,500
You have to watch that fucking show.
And uh,

1407
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,910
it's just an unbelievable show
and is actually, there's a,

1408
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:41,040
there's a couple of guys first
season and Co Comedian Tony v that I,

1409
01:26:41,041 --> 01:26:45,350
that I learned so much from. And another
guy, I actually started out with,

1410
01:26:46,190 --> 01:26:49,490
uh,
Kevin Chapman who plays Freddy Cork,

1411
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:53,360
who's one of my favorite characters
on that, on television right now.

1412
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:58,310
Um, I don't know if you just did to
Gangsta fucking shows. It's the shit.

1413
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:01,090
It's a great fucking show brotherhood.
Um,

1414
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:05,750
I'm sure you can rent the first DVD some
even if you, even if you buy it, no,

1415
01:27:05,751 --> 01:27:08,000
don't buy it because maybe you don't
like it, then you're stuck with it.

1416
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:12,550
Then I get to listen to you
to be a contact, but fucking,
uh, go rented somewhere.

1417
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,860
I'm telling you it's a great show
and I'm also into breaking bad.

1418
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:21,380
Those are my three shows. Other
than that, I just watch sports and,

1419
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,380
uh, and that is it. All right.
This really tapered off in the end.

1420
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:28,420
I hope you guys enjoyed it. You
