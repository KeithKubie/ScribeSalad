MIKE PROCOPIO: All right.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.320
Well, good afternoon everybody,
and welcome to

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.120
Google I/O. We are grateful
to have you here.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.430
My name is Mike Procopio.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.180
I'm a software engineer on the
Google Drive SDK team.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.690
STEVEN BAZYL: And I'm
Steven Bazyl.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.665
I'm a developer advocate also
working on the SDK.

00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:25.220
MIKE PROCOPIO: And today Steve
and I are going to help you

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.430
make your apps rock.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:27.890
OK.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.550
So we are here to talk
about Google Drive.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.130
So Google Drive is the place
where you can store your files

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.680
securely in the cloud.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.200
You also get for free the
fundamentals of Google Drive--

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.380
sharing, searching,
collaboration, file revisions,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.440
organization, and even neat
little features like uploading

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.210
an image and it will
automatically do

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.320
identification of what's in
that image and make it

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.820
searchable.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.600
All that comes for free.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.100
With the Sync client, the Sync
program, you can keep files in

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.510
sync from your local hard drive
on your machine back

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.610
home with files in the cloud,
and the changes will propagate

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.760
as expected.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.840
And of course, one of the key
benefits of files in the cloud

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.680
is that you can access
them from anywhere.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.340
So where are we today, a
snapshot with Google Drive.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.350
Millions of users have
opted into Drive.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.610
There are more juicy stats,
but that's what we

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.050
can say right now.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.620
And we have fully realized the
idea of access anywhere, so

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.460
that means on the web, but
also on mobile devices of

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.110
various flavors and
using Chrome OS.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.060
We have an easy to use, fully
featured SDK software

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.500
development kit, with client
library support in eight

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.380
languages, the second version
of which we just announced

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.230
this morning--

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.800
really excited about that.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.590
And a snapshot right now in the
Chrome Web Store, which is

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.240
where we go to find apps, we
have 50 third-party drive apps

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.090
available right now in
the Chrome Web Store.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.270
STEVEN BAZYL: Yeah, I think we
just added Objective-C and

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.960
JavaScript today, in addition to
Java, Python, Ruby, and all

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.370
those other guys.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.330
MIKE PROCOPIO: Absolutely.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.230
So, two more since V1 of launch,
since the version one

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.970
of the SDK.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.670
Pretty thrilled about that.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.370
So, a pretty good foundation.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.860
So what's next?

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.720
Well, the answer is you, and our
apps, and the things that

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.900
we can do together.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.700
That's what's next, because
right now on Google Drive we

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.880
have a pretty solid set of
built-in applications, first

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.690
class productivity apps that
offer real time collaboration,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.510
sharing all the things
that come with Drive.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.890
We have a word processor,
Google Documents,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.400
Presentation, Spreadsheets,
and Drawings, the four

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.020
fundamental types that we have
right now today in Drive.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.440
We also have the built-in Google
Drive Viewer, which

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.640
gives you a static preview
experience for lots of

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.940
different file types.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.280
So basic things like PDFs and
images, videos and text, we

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.090
can render a pretty good
static preview.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.770
Right here, you want
to check this out?

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.000
Here, have a look.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.890
And we also have support for a
few proprietary formats like

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.470
Photoshop, Illustrator, and even
Microsoft Office formats.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.300
So that's pretty great, but
it's basic preview only--

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.320
you can't do anything with it.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.790
So here's an example of what you
can do right now with the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.860
Google Drive Viewer on
a file type in Drive.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.800
You can read your scintillating
scientific

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.400
publications that you keep in
Drive to remind yourself of

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.890
how exciting--

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:13.190
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.450
STEVEN BAZYL: And that is
actually your paper?

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.550
MIKE PROCOPIO: I don't think
I noticed that before.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.030
It might be that one time
when I was a roboticist.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.450
That's that.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.430
I reread it every now and then,
and man, that's boring.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.380
OK.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.810
So you can also-- more static
preview, preview photos of the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.230
places you wish you were
on vacation to.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.840
And then, of course, video
experience is very prominently

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.400
represented in Drive.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.700
You can watch the video of you
getting second place in a 5K

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.830
race over and over again, not
because you're bitter or

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.920
anything, but that's just
what you can do.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.970
However, the built-in
apps in that file

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.670
preview, it's just a start.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.230
It's just a starting place.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.590
As an ecosystem together,
we can definitely

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.970
do better for sure.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.340
So here's a snapshot of apps
right now that are already in

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.170
the ecosystem.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.440
Steve's been working with a
lot of these partners, and

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.030
this is where we've landed.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.670
More on that here in a second.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.130
So if you take away the static
preview constraint and

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.090
actually started to embrace
third party apps in Drive--

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.740
completely cloud enabled
access anywhere--

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.220
these are the sorts of
experiences that you can have.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.209
So HelloFax is an application
that we have right

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.510
now in the Web Store.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.150
You can do something
useful with a PDF.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.870
You can fax it for later offline
consumption when your

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.820
Wi-Fi goes down.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.220
You can also do things like
an e-reader could

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.180
operate on a PDF.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.840
There's lots of use
cases here.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.230
Another example is another app
that we partner with, Pixlr

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.110
Image Editor, a pretty robust
compelling first class image

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.990
editing app that works
on the Web.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.910
And so you can give your
photos that kind of hip

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.380
vintage look that all the cool
kids are doing these days, and

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.760
instantly thereby boosting
your social

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.620
network street cred.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.805
STEVEN BAZYL: And then share
them on Google+.

00:04:53.805 --> 00:04:56.350
MIKE PROCOPIO: Exactly, and
share it on Google+, these hip

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.180
new photos.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.840
But, of course, really we know
how you're going to use this,

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.470
and that is to create lolcat
memes early and often.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.590
So that's what I use that for.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.440
And, of course, with the video
experience, when you bring it

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.900
into the cloud with third-party
apps, you can do

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.180
more than just preview it.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.730
You can actually edit it now, so
your friends don't need to

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.660
know that you got second place
in a race by one second.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.430
You can edit it, and surely this
guy here looks like he's

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.450
winning the race.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.640
We'll see about that.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.140
So apps bring life
to our ecosystem.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.790
So with apps, you can fax and
edit, render, graph, and draw

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.590
diagrams, sign and publish,
map, chart,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.130
listen, mock and plan.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.130
And you can do this all
right now, today, with

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.430
Google Drive apps.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.650
And when you build a Google
Drive app, one of the key

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.510
values that our SDK lets you
bring to your users is to

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.300
integrate deeply with the Google
Drive web UI, mobile

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.690
and web clients.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.530
And so this means that we
give apps a first class

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.000
representation in Google Drive,
from management and

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.950
viewing product details,
searching by things created

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.210
with the app, as well as the
ability to create new using

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.050
your apps, so a launcher kind
of state, and of course, the

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.490
ability to open with using your
app for the things that

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.600
it has registered for.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.960
So you can use HelloFax
to open with

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.210
on a PDF, for example.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.010
So Steve and I are here to help
you continue to use this

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.980
SDK and to build awesome apps.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.230
These are vibrant and polished
apps that are first and

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.210
foremost secure, they put the
user first, and they integrate

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.870
well with Google Drive.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.990
So let's take a quick look at
nine things that we can do

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.670
right now to get your apps
to this polished state.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.670
STEVEN BAZYL: And I'm going to
take the first one, which is

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.270
just to talk about UX.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.340
And this is really going to be
geared towards apps that are

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.000
document oriented.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.890
You're building a photo editor,
a charting tool,

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.700
anything like that-- something
that fits really well within

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.420
that Google Docs ecosystem.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.740
And I love this quote.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.310
This is probably one of the most
probably misunderstood

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.810
and abused quotes among software
developers, at least

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.660
in my history.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.930
Whenever we talk about design
patterns or conventions or

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.520
anything, somebody inevitably
will bring this up and say,

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.280
oh, consistency it's
not important.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.320
That's only for stupid people.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.340
Not true at all.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.540
It's a foolish consistency.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.370
It's when you're doing things
for no reason just because

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.900
they're a convention that
it becomes a bad idea.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.500
But every platform, whether
it's Windows OS X, iOS,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.920
Android, they all have
conventions for a reason.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.573
It's because it makes the users
a lot more familiar and

00:07:33.573 --> 00:07:37.070
a lot more comfortable
with your apps.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.280
When you're not consistent,
bad things happen.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.390
So we actually did a
little UX study.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.590
This is when we were first
starting our trusted tester

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.960
period for Drive apps, and some
of the apps we tried were

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.360
little toy apps that
we built ourselves.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.570
Some were actually apps from
external developers.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.620
We put them in front of users
and asked them to do just

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.690
really basic activities
with all these apps.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.770
And the problem was, because
there are so many

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:04.290
inconsistencies in how people
did basic operations, most of

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.090
the users-- in this case,
over 2/3 of them--

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.160
just got lost.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.030
They didn't know how
to use those apps.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.130
So this is Google Docs.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.890
This is our word processing
tool, and it looks like any

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.830
other word processing tool,
but there's a couple key

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.375
elements I want to point out to
how the UI is put together.

00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:27.305
So we have some really basic
information about what file am

00:08:27.305 --> 00:08:28.520
I working on.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.220
Imagine a text editor that
didn't tell you the file name

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.110
that you were editing--

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.320
it wouldn't be very useful.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.679
Likewise, a lot of us use
multiple accounts, so it's

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:40.270
really helpful to know which
account we're locked in with.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.200
Obviously, content--

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.470
that's the point of the app.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.659
That's your section,
you really want

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.930
to make this great.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.750
Navigation is always nice and
consistent up in that basic

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.390
menu structure.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.990
And, of course, we have our
collaboration and sharing.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.710
The cool thing is with Docs is
that I can switch over to any

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.440
of the other tools that Mike
talked about earlier, those

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.760
presentations or spreadsheets,
and I'm going to have the

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.200
exact same layout for all
of those applications.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.670
And from a user's perspective,
that's awesome, right?

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.840
I can switch to one of these
apps, and be productive almost

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.030
immediately.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.630
So I want to show a third
party application.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.020
This is Lucidchart, and I think
they did a really great

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.980
job at balancing between having
their own distinct look

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.880
and feel and using those
conventions that help users be

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.840
really productive and feel
familiar with the application.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.335
Lucidchart is a collaborative
charting tool, where you could

00:09:32.335 --> 00:09:36.910
do flowcharts, spin diagrams,
mockups for different UIs.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.600
We're just going to
launch this here.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.710
And it just takes a couple
seconds to load up, but I'm

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:52.420
going to create a new document,
and we're not going

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.040
to give it a title.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.830
But basically, you see here this
actually looks a lot like

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.250
any of the Google
Docs editors.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.070
We have the same elements we had
here before-- our document

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.950
title, our file menu, our
sharing and account

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:06.140
information, a huge content
section, but it still is

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.770
distinctly their app.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.355
So for building applications
that are really geared at

00:10:10.355 --> 00:10:14.740
being productivity apps that are
meant to be complimentary

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.330
tools to the basic office type
applications, try to use these

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:23.120
consistencies, try to follow
these conventions much as if

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.730
you're building an app for a
mobile platform or one of the

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.980
desktop environments.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:35.200
Let me switch back to the
presentation here for you.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.530
Ooh, that was bad.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.990
All right, there we go.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.860
MIKE PROCOPIO: All right.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.110
Thanks, Steve.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.460
So one of the key value
propositions of Google Drive

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.010
is that you can access
your stuff anywhere.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.160
Drive is fully enabled
in mobile context.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.020
This is something that's
very important to us.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.630
So one of the things that your
app can do to be particularly

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.670
polished is also work well in
a mobile context, which is

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.120
becoming increasingly
how we work.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.690
And so by mobile context, we
don't mean just phones but

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.550
tablets as well--

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.190
a very exciting announcement
today.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.260
And then Chrome OS just
recently-- we'd like to

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.070
announce that Chrome OS
has full Drive SDK

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.350
integration as well.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.540
So here's an example of
something that works

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.960
today, right now.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.470
So an application doesn't
necessarily have to build a

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.190
native app to have a
mobile experience.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.990
So in this case, Aviary, which
is an image editor that's

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.480
available right now in our Web
Store, you can do basic

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.080
cropping, these sorts
of things.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.700
It actually is an HTML5 app
that works in the Web.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.610
So there is a native app, but
we don't need the native app

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.860
necessarily to be able
to use this properly.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.610
So I can launch this today and
do my editing on the go,

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.880
whatever is needed, save it back
to Drive, and the image

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.190
is saved there in the cloud.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.550
Now as it turns out, there's
also this notion of a native

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.380
experience.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.460
These are actually apps that you
install from the Android

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.490
marketplace that sit on your
phone and oftentimes will give

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:03.280
a richer, snappier experience
in certain contexts that we

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.420
like to use as well.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.220
These, as of our announcement
this morning with the Drive

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.640
SDK v2, also work with mobile,
which is very exciting.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.510
STEVEN BAZYL: They do, and
there's actually a really

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.330
great talk.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.660
I think it's this afternoon.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.275
It's Alain and Claudio from the
developer relations group

00:12:17.275 --> 00:12:21.940
on Drive are doing a talk on
how to build native apps.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.030
MIKE PROCOPIO: And, of
course, Chrome OS.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.840
So it's not necessarily just
mobile, but also the idea that

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.510
an app should be able to work
well in multiple contexts on

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.950
multiple form factors, ranging
from a small three or four

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.710
inch screen size to seven inch
to 10 inch tablets, including

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.800
the smaller screen sizes
associated with the most

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.540
mobile of our devices, like
a Chromebook, for example.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.420
So here's an example of in
Chrome OS right now, which

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.300
actually natively integrates
with Google Drive and brings

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:51.040
those files mounted on the Web
to make them look as if they

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.800
were first class local files.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.720
And you can actually launch apps
that you have installed

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.290
from Chrome OS and edit them
and save them back all

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.820
seamless and transparent.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.190
So that's our mobile story.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.820
It works today, and a polished
app should have a good

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.540
representation on a variety of
form factors for web-based,

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.360
mobile, and Chrome
OS contexts.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:08.730
STEVEN BAZYL: Cool.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.110
Thanks, Mike.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:13.310
The next topic I want to talk
about is how people access

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.300
content in Drive.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:19.300
So the examples you saw earlier
with the Drive UI and

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.240
how apps can plug-in
was all about

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.480
starting from within Drive.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.430
So I'm either on my mobile app
or I'm in the web UI, and I

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.530
find a file and I click on it,
and an app magically opens.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.570
A lot of the time, though, when
I want to access content

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.030
in Drive, I'm already in the
app that I want to use.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.530
And there's a lot of cases,
even things like photo

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.990
editors, for example, if it's
a really, really rich photo

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:45.230
editing app and I can do
compositing and bring in

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:49.780
multiple photos, I don't want to
change context in order to

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.980
get that content in.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.600
So what we have is a JavaScript
widget that you can

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.280
use to actually bring the
Drive UI into your

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.050
application.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.590
This is actually just a little
screen shot here of just a

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.250
viewer for picking photos.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.860
You could customize this Picker
very easily to fit the

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.880
context for your application.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.960
If you're loading text files, it
may be just fine to have a

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.000
list of file names.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.910
If, for example, your photo
editor, you want to have a

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.690
graphical view where you can
show thumbnails so people can

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.200
find their content
a lot faster.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.670
And for those who are curious,
this is Harley Goat Farms in

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.470
Pescadero, and I highly
recommend it.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:29.500
The baby goats are ridiculously
cute.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:34.930
But I want to show you guys a
demo of what this looks like.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.380
I'll switch over here.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.390
This is just the basic
view for Picker.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.680
It doesn't really look all that
much different than what

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.180
you would see for any other
native file system picker.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.520
Of course, we can say Picker,
and we'll do a

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.690
metapresentation here
and present our

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:53.720
presentation in a demo.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.920
If I wanted to do something
graphical, I can, again,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.300
change this to have images.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.440
Another cool thing you can do,
actually, though, is to let

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.180
users upload content directly.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.110
So say you have all this Drive
integration, but it turns out

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.850
that the file that
the user wanted

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.110
wasn't actually in Drive.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.270
It's still on their desktop.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.630
Well, they can just switch over
to upload, drag it right

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:15.180
on to there.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.220
It will upload to Drive, and
then we'll send that file

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.830
information to your app where
you can write appropriately

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.080
direct in the cloud.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.690
So that's basically
the Picker.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:33.090
It's actually really easy to use
this in your application.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:33.900
So this is the code.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.950
The first thing that you need
to do is just include our

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.070
loader script.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:43.340
That's at google.com/jsapi.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.420
That's just a generic loader.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.290
We have to tell it to load
the Picker library.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.590
Those are those first two
lines in the JavaScript.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.420
Because it loads asynchronously,
we need a call

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.840
back to tell us when
it's ready to use.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.420
That's where we'll wire up
all our event listeners.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.290
And when it's time to actually
show the Picker and we want to

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:02.130
load content, we just have these
couple lines here where

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.160
we create the Picker builder,
customize which views we want

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.560
to see, whether or not we want
to support upload or not, do

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.760
we want grid view or list view--
there are a whole bunch

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.260
of options you can do--

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.040
give it a callback function,
enter app ID,

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:15.980
and show the dialogue.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.420
So it's all of about five or
six lines of JavaScript to

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.330
show that dialogue and be able
to get that content out.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.670
Really handy, and saves the
users a lot of time because

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.940
now they can access that content
whether or not they're

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.600
in Drive or in your app.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.300
There you go, Mike.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.850
MIKE PROCOPIO: Great
Thank you.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:36.445
So earlier in the talk, we
talked about how important it

00:16:36.445 --> 00:16:37.940
was that your app is secure.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.310
It's perhaps the most important
thing that we can do

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.960
is to safeguard the user's data,
so we make this very

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.250
easy to do.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.430
And the fundamental mechanism
for protecting the user's data

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:51.870
is this notion of scopes, or
levels of access, that your

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.480
application requests, the user
approves, and then is then

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.820
granted to your application--

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.540
for example, to access files
on the user's drive.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.560
So once upon a time, these
levels of access were kind of

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.630
very coarse grained,
very broad.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:08.000
Things had access to entire
properties or websites.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.900
So, for example, there is such
a scope, a security scope,

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.530
that enables the application to
have access to the entire

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.069
contents of the user's drive.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:19.500
Well, that seems pretty scary,
so what we've introduced as of

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.109
Version One, and then we'll talk
about it pretty heavily

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:25.960
here today, is this new scope
up here called drive.file.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.630
And this means that an
application has per file

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.760
access to things on a one-off
basis based on user

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.390
authorizations in your Drive.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:37.910
So let's take a look more
deeply about how

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:41.050
this is going to work.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:41.930
Shupah!

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:42.720
There we go.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.550
So this is a familiar sort
of consent page.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.740
On your Android devices, Android
has this built-in

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:48.760
notion, as well.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.610
You approve native apps for
things' access on a more

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:53.030
hardware system level--

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.070
access to your location, access
to the contents of the

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.310
secure digital card in your
phone, for example.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.670
OK.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.100
So the same notion applies
on the Web.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.880
And here for example, Balsamiq
Mockups, which is one of our

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.230
partners, is requesting--

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.760
and it's up to the
user to approve--

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.040
information about your account,

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.620
and your email address.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:15.810
And then here is perhaps the
most important request, here,

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.400
is this view and manage Google
Drive files that you have

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.310
opened or created
with this app.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.880
So this means this app is not
requesting broad access to the

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.130
contents in the user's
Drive, but rather on

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:26.610
a one by one basis.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.850
So in particular when the user
grants this scope, the app is

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:33.010
able to create files
in the Drive.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:36.790
Also, open files that it created
and have access to

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:40.240
files that the user explicitly
granted.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.280
So let's take a look at how
this works, because we

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.550
surfaced this notion pretty
prominently in the Google

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.940
Drive web UI.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.263
For example, here is a picture
of a place that I wish I was

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:52.930
at for vacation, as
it turns out.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.440
And if we click View Authorized
Apps, we will see

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.930
that currently there is nothing,
despite having

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.990
installed apps, that is able
to access that file.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.090
So here's all the apps I have
installed right now.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.410
OK, good.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.450
So what I can do right now is
open this with one of the apps

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:08.100
that I have installed.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.620
In this case, we will
highlight--

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.900
let's do PicMonkey, another
image editing app.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.460
And here's the consent page--

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.220
fairly clear, basic information,
email address,

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.200
and I can expand this to see,
hey, this thing isn't going to

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.710
be able to access all the stuff
in my drive, but rather

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.450
just the things that
I tell it to.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:30.200
So we're going to allow access
to that, and PicMonkey is

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.060
going to launch.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.480
It takes a little bit of time
to first initialize, but the

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.240
picture of Napoli, a city
in Italy, comes up.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.840
I can crop and rotate and
do all that good stuff.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.230
But if I come back right now
to Drive, I have just

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.480
authorized that application
to that file.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.520
So if I view authorized
apps, we will see

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.060
PicMonkey shows up there.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.590
That is the only app that is
able to access this file, and

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.700
we want to be very transparent
about this.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.250
And if the user wishes at any
point in time, when they're

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:03.550
done, they can simply revoke
it, and PicMonkey no longer

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:07.740
has access to that file until
the user reauthorizes it.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.750
So I think that wraps up
the security section.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.230
There's a number of scopes
including read-only, and the

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.510
general notion here is to
request as few permissions and

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.040
as narrow scoping as possible
that's best for you, your app,

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.845
and the user as well.

00:20:21.845 --> 00:20:23.095
STEVEN BAZYL: Cool.

00:20:29.036 --> 00:20:30.726
We'll do it the old
fashioned way.

00:20:30.726 --> 00:20:32.910
MIKE PROCOPIO: That
was the backup.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:36.770
STEVEN BAZYL: So another common
thing, and this is what

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.840
we think is one of the really
awesome features of Drive, is

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.430
how easy it is for people
to share content.

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:47.710
And for those of you that use
Drive today, you've probably

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.310
seen a dialogue like this
whenever you tried to share.

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:53.490
You see this inside the editors
as well, inside docs

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.985
and spreadsheets and
presentations.

00:20:54.985 --> 00:20:59.570
You get this nice little
sharing setting.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:03.120
In the API, we actually have a
really low level API as well,

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.850
that used to be in the documents
list API, is in

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.710
there and v2 of the API that
launched today that lets you

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:10.920
manipulate all these ACLs.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:16.610
But it's very powerful and very
dangerous tools, and on

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.570
Mike's point of requesting the
fewest scopes possible in

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.450
order to manipulate the ACLs
programmatically, you have to

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.850
request permission to
all of the content

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.660
in the user's Drive.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.230
So it puts you in a hard place
of choosing between enabling

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.060
all these features like being
able to manipulate ACLs and

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:37.170
share files, while still
trying to use the least

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.580
permissive scope possible that
makes sense for your app.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.900
So we actually have a brand new
feature, and actually it

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.540
just hit production, I think two
days ago, and I actually

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.070
got a developer to implement
this in their app yesterday.

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:54.090
So I'm going to have
a demo of it.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.310
Again, this is pretty much
bleeding edge, since it was

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.885
hacked together in about
half an hour yesterday.

00:21:58.885 --> 00:22:00.230
MIKE PROCOPIO: It's
not as risky as

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.040
jumping out of an airplane.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.150
STEVEN BAZYL: That
is true, so--

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.190
MIKE PROCOPIO: But it's
still pretty risky.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.190
STEVEN BAZYL: The consequences
of this demo failing are not

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:10.980
nearly as bad, as serious.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.390
Anyway, Loupe is this really
cool little app.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:18.610
It does photo collages, and
they did a whole bunch of

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:23.620
integrations, such
as being able to

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.690
select photos from Drive.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:30.575
So we already had a couple
in there, but let's use--

00:22:30.575 --> 00:22:32.800
let's just add all of them.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.750
We'll just add a whole bunch of
photos, and they're going

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:37.550
to import in here.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.215
And I think they even
just added--

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:42.720
I don't know where it is here.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.640
I thought they added a Google
logo in here somewhere.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.572
MIKE PROCOPIO: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:47.572 --> 00:22:50.230
STEVEN BAZYL: Where is it?

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.482
Did I pass it again?

00:22:52.482 --> 00:22:54.100
Oh, there it is.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:59.020
So, we can arrange all these
photos in the Google layout,

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.640
which would be kind of
cool if it works.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.350
All right, there it goes.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:06.130
So this is a very social app,
and a lot of this is all about

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:07.460
creating these collages
and sharing--

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.010
MIKE PROCOPIO: This is why
we need third party apps.

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.740
I definitely could not have
implemented that.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.930
STEVEN BAZYL: Yeah, that
would've been a

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.000
stretch for a demo.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.650
But I should be able to do--

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:17.306
let's just see--

00:23:17.306 --> 00:23:20.990
in Google, and make it public.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:26.350
In theory, if this still
works, it will show the

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.220
sharing things.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.690
So the same exact dialogue that
you see inside Drive,

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.860
inside all of our editors, and
then I can just go in here and

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.460
share this with--

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.190
send it to my personal
account.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:45.630
And the same flow as if I shared
it from within Drive.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:50.740
The cool thing is the actual
work to implement this is

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.880
pretty trivial.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.900
And the fact that they were able
to do this in about half

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.560
an hour yesterday was
pretty awesome.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.940
So first thing we do, just like
we did with Picker, we

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:02.870
have a loader script.

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:04.020
It is a different one.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.230
So if you're using both, you
have two different loaders in

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.940
there, but the rest of
it is very familiar.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:13.900
So we call this gapi.load,
load drive-share.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.860
Again, a callback for when that
library is loaded, and we

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.205
want to show it in just
three lines of code.

00:24:19.205 --> 00:24:21.650
We build a share client
with our app ID.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.870
We say which items
we want to share.

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.960
These do have to be items that
our app has access to, so they

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.090
have to be things that we
created or that the user

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:32.180
allows us to access, and then
we just show the dialog.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.970
Super, super simple, really
great way to add that sharing

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:38.110
functionality into your app
with next to no effort

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:40.158
whatsoever.

00:24:40.158 --> 00:24:41.620
MIKE PROCOPIO: Great.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.400
OK, so another short and sweet
kind of tip here is to be

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:45.960
searchable.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.580
Google Drive lets you find your
content very easily and

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.670
when you share your content with
other users, those users

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:52.420
can find it easily as well.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.190
So for types that Google
knows about, we're

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:56.590
able to index them.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.030
So Google Docs or a spreadsheet,
for example, has

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:00.920
keywords in it.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.310
We index that automatically, and
when you search for that

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.450
file, it pops up immediately.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:07.740
Well, it would be great to do
that for third-party apps, and

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.250
this is something very important
to us, so we

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.510
actually let third-party apps
specify every they save or

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.810
update a file.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.340
Indexable text is basically a
list the keywords that the

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.310
user can use to find your file,
because we certainly

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.070
aren't able to decode all the
data models and the custom

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.170
file formats that third-party
apps are sending you.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:27.960
So here is a short and
sweet quick demo.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:32.380
Some say, I've been told, that
I have a propensity to use

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:37.050
kind of exciting large words,
like phenomenal, spectacular,

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.290
fantastic, and marvelous.

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.120
It is true--

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.490
I actually keep a map of them
with a third-party app called

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:45.170
MindMeister, but I don't
know where that is.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:48.000
It's not showing up
in here anywhere.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.860
So let's search for a
word called stellar.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:52.540
There it is.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.600
So this is my map that I keep
of all these exciting words,

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.900
so every time I need to use
one, to sound particularly

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.900
important, I can just pull it
right off of this map and I

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.930
have various synonyms that I
need on an as-needed basis.

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:05.530
So, here-- spectacular,

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.490
extraordinary, marvelous covered.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.510
So because MindMeister sets
indexable text, every time

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.640
they save the file--

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.950
which we know nothing about--

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.950
we are able to search for that
and discover it very easily in

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:18.850
the Drive UI as needed.

00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:25.352
You're good at that.

00:26:25.352 --> 00:26:26.360
STEVEN BAZYL: Tab tab.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.310
That's all I've got to do.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:28.995
MIKE PROCOPIO: All right,
another backup.

00:26:28.995 --> 00:26:31.695
STEVEN BAZYL: You have no faith
in the network, do you?

00:26:31.695 --> 00:26:32.320
MIKE PROCOPIO: No.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.770
STEVEN BAZYL: For someone who's
building cloud storage,

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:37.875
you would expect a little
bit more confidence.

00:26:37.875 --> 00:26:39.125
MIKE PROCOPIO: Sorry.

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.940
STEVEN BAZYL: All right.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:47.500
So this is another behavioral
thing with apps, and also

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.180
something we learned from doing
some UX studies, which

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.360
is autosaving.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.510
So we've sort of trained users
with a lot of these cloud apps

00:26:56.510 --> 00:27:00.390
now, particularly Google
Docs, that they should

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:01.810
never have to hit save.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.090
They should just do their work
and things just magically

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:09.180
happen and it's reliable, and
it's always up to date and

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.920
always reliable.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.550
And just to show how much people
have learned to rely on

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.940
this, that same UX study I
talked about earlier, 4/5 of

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.640
the users didn't even think
about saving their files.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.430
They just assumed whatever they
typed in, whatever they

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:28.100
did in all these apps that we
were testing, it just worked.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.520
You can imagine the
consequences, though, if your

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.040
app doesn't actually do this.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:39.400
So I'm doing all my work, and
two hours later I closed my

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.270
browser, I had to shut down or
something happens, and I'm

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.705
sitting here thinking all my
content's safe and it's gone,

00:27:45.705 --> 00:27:47.980
it's vanished.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.200
So thinking about how to
do autosave in your

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.291
applications--

00:27:53.291 --> 00:27:56.620
there are some complexities,
though.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.260
Who here attended the first
talk on Drive today?

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.870
Anyone?

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.950
So a handful of people.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.890
So there was something really
cool that was previewed in

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.810
that talk, which is
collaboration API, which is

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:12.920
basically operational transform
mutation-based API

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.120
for doing collaboration.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.160
That's not something we have
ready yet, though, so when you

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.320
deal with Drive, you have to
deal with Drive in the context

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.570
of reading and writing blobs.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:25.520
And, of course, if you're going
to autosave, you have to

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.650
make all these different
tradeoffs now.

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.480
If I have a small file, saving
that file frequently isn't

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.350
that big of a deal.

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.780
But as the file size gets
bigger, it becomes more and

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:37.260
more expensive for me to
do frequent savings.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.900
So we have to figure out how
much quota, how much bandwidth

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.680
do I want to use, versus how
much risk do I want to expose

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.710
that user to in case anything
were to go wrong.

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:51.020
Likewise, the other aspect of
this is a feature of the Drive

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:55.010
API, which is revisions.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.610
Anytime that you save content,
you have the choice of when to

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.190
create new revision that the
user can go back and revert

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.920
to, or whether or not you're
just going to touch the head.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.920
So when you're doing something
like autosaving, you have to

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:09.800
think about what save events
are significant enough to

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.220
cause a new revision versus
which ones you only wanted to

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:16.250
show up as just an update
to the head revision.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:19.010
If I create a new revision on
every keystroke, it would

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:21.780
basically render the revision
history useless.

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.120
I'm not going to sit there and
try to reconstruct eight

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.210
characters ago--

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:29.330
it's just not something that
would be useful for a user.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:30.830
It turns out it's actually
not that hard to

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.280
get this logic right.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.430
How you do this in your app
is going to be obviously

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:38.240
particular to what you're
doing, but here's just a

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:42.570
little JavaScript snippet that
I put together in a demo app.

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.980
It turned out to actually work
pretty well, and it gave me

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:51.110
what I felt as a user was close
to expected behavior and

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:55.150
close to how our own
editors work.

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:56.480
So in this case, all
I have here is

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.460
really just two things.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.060
I have an autosaver, which in
this case is just going to be

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:01.815
an interval function.

00:30:01.815 --> 00:30:04.880
It's going to run every
30 seconds.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.420
We can tune that either way
depending on our needs.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:11.280
It's just going to do a check if
the doc is dirty, I have a

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:16.240
chance to save, I'm
going to save it.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.410
When it saves, it's going to
say, well, if the last time I

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:21.910
saved this is really
long ago--

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:26.075
maybe it's hours, maybe it's
days, it's time to create a

00:30:26.075 --> 00:30:26.740
new revision.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.330
But if I just saved it 30
seconds ago, I'm just going to

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:31.790
consider that the same editing
session, and I'm just going to

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:34.000
update the last copy.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.520
Likewise, we can have
an explicit save

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.860
action in our menu.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.550
In that case, this is debatable,
but I decided if

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:42.910
the user says I want to save
this document, I think that's

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:46.460
important enough to create a
new revision in our thing.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.350
It actually turns out you can do
autosave with blobs that's

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:54.360
fairly reliable and fairly
frequent with actually not

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.040
that much code.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.320
So that's that.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.870
MIKE PROCOPIO: Great.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.160
So one of the features that we
announced this morning, when

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.750
we went live announcing the
Google Drive SDK v2, is a new

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.350
feature that lets third-party
apps operate directly on

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:11.940
native Google Docs types.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.030
And this is important, because--
and I didn't get

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.890
exact clearance on the number,
but something like eleventy

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:20.240
gabillion files that are native
Google Docs types are

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:20.390
stored in Drive.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:22.810
STEVEN BAZYL: That might be a
little bit of a stretch, but

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:24.195
we'll get there.

00:31:24.195 --> 00:31:24.690
MIKE PROCOPIO: OK.

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:25.470
We'll get there, you promise?

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:25.760
STEVEN BAZYL: Yeah.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:26.580
Just give us--

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.700
MIKE PROCOPIO: Eleventy
gabillion--

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.090
that's a lot of native Google
Docs types, and there's no

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:31.750
reason why third-party apps
shouldn't be able

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:32.980
to operate on those.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:36.610
As it turns out, the data type
that's associated with, for

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:40.510
example, Google Doc or a
presentation is Google

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:41.440
proprietary.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.850
It's snapshot based, there's
some logging so we can do

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:46.130
things like track revision.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:48.450
It's a fairly intricate data
model that we don't need to

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:52.210
expose, but what we can do is
programmatically expose

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:54.380
exportable snapshots, read-only

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.660
representations of that file.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:00.440
So for example, what we can do
now is a Google document has

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.810
the capacity to export as PDF.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:04.960
And do we have any apps
that can read PDFs?

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.730
Sure we do-- e-readers,
faxing.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:09.920
So what that means is right now
from the Google Drive UI

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.390
for apps that support it-- and
none do yet, because we just

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:15.430
announced it this morning, but
this is coming imminently--

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.780
you will be able to simply
right click on a Google

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:21.040
document or presentation or
spreadsheet and open it with

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:25.280
whatever apps can actually
handle the common export

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.290
functionality.

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:29.800
So in this case, a PDF for the
doc is able to be faxed.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.860
And another example is that
SlideRocket has the ability to

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.920
read in Microsoft Office
presentations, PowerPoint

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.570
presentations, and our built-in
presentations editor

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:43.687
in the name of data liberation
has the capacity to export in

00:32:43.687 --> 00:32:44.290
that format.

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:48.260
So we can actually import a
Google presentation directly

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.380
into a third-party
app, SlideRocket.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.440
So that was announced today, and
we're very excited about

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.990
that, and that will be rolling
out very soon.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:59.150
Example file formats that we
can support are, of course,

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:00.580
the obvious one is PDFs.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:04.240
And there's a few that may not
be necessarily obvious at

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:04.880
initial glance.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.400
But if you have a text editor,
there's no reason that a plain

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.910
text editor shouldn't be able
to open a Google document.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.200
Meanwhile, if you have an image
editor, you should be

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:17.670
able to read this vectorized
drawing format that we do with

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:24.910
SVG or in a raster format
like a JPEG or PNG.

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:26.600
To do this, it's very simple.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.790
You already in the Developer
APIs Console, you opt into

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:33.400
certain types that your app has
the capability to open,

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.970
and with the checking of this
box now, which is new, you

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:39.260
will automatically be able to
do this, and it will be

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.740
generally transparent to you.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:44.470
You'll just have to read from a
different place to actually

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:47.290
get the data from the exportable
endpoint that we

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.858
give you automatically.

00:33:49.858 --> 00:33:50.900
STEVEN BAZYL: Cool.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.920
Thanks.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.950
The last thing I want to talk
about is making your app

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:56.940
discoverable.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.540
The reason we're all building
these apps--

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.460
not all of us-- but we want to
get users, we want to get

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:05.330
customers, we want them to use
our app, be productive, and

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:08.370
hopefully turn into
paying customers.

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:10.050
And they only do that if
they can find our app

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.820
in the first place.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.929
For Drive, we do use the Chrome
Web Store as a way for

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:19.199
people to discover applications
that work with

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:20.730
Google Drive.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.120
So, obviously, it's very
important to make sure you

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.780
have a really strong
presence there.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.139
Actually, we can
even just go--

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:31.300
I think as of yesterday we just
added a new collection so

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.239
people can find apps.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:35.840
And, of course, everyone gets
this nice little "works with

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.070
Drive" badge on their
listings.

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:39.280
MIKE PROCOPIO: Look at all
those pretty apps.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.020
STEVEN BAZYL: I know, these
are awesome apps.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.670
And you can see the importance
of having a fairly nice

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:46.000
presence versus--

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.380
not to point out any really bad
apps-- but if you don't do

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:53.179
a good job, you get down to the
bottom and nobody's going

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:53.989
to find your app.

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:56.480
So you really want to focus on
making sure you have a nice,

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.190
clean presence.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:00.600
These are actually reviewed by
humans, the images and the

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.500
assets, and there are certain
guidelines that you have to

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:07.020
hit, particularly if you want
to get into any of the large

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.220
banners on the Chrome
Web Store.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.360
So I would encourage you to
check out the documentation

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.810
for Chrome Web Store for how
to publish apps, and pay

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.900
attention to the marketing
guidelines on there so that

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.560
you have a strong presence.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.310
But the part that is, I
think, even cooler--

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:29.821
and this was talked about, if I
can actually switch to that,

00:35:29.821 --> 00:35:32.810
there we go--

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:35.940
is we talked about
sharing earlier.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:39.310
Sharing is also an awesome way
for people to learn about your

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:40.730
app through word of mouth.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:42.860
So this is actually a screenshot
of the previewer

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:44.730
that we had built into Drive.

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:47.850
This is what happens when it
finds a piece of content that

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.390
was created by one of these
apps, but the user doesn't

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:51.140
have installed.

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:55.600
So in this case, I might create
a mockup of the next

00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:00.470
version of a great new widget,
save that mockup in Drive,

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:04.970
shares it with me,
and I get this--

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:07.610
I try to open it, it says, all
right, this was created by

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.782
Balsamiq, I don't have it,
let me go install it.

00:36:10.782 --> 00:36:12.510
In fact, we can actually
even just see what

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:13.620
that looks like here.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.645
Actually, I think I did this one
with a SlideRocket before.

00:36:16.645 --> 00:36:21.350
If I click install, I'm going to
get this nice link here to

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:24.330
the listing, and I can
choose to install it.

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:30.600
Even better is content that you
already have in your hard

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.020
drive at home, on your laptops,
and your desktops and

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:35.230
you put it into Drive--
it wasn't created by

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.530
any of these apps.

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:41.090
We can actually still promote
your app based on the type of

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:44.910
the file, so I can go into--

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:52.810
let's go into Drive, and let's
use one of these Loupe images.

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:54.900
So down here in the corner--
it's a little small right now

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.460
and we're trying to get
them to make this

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.640
a little bit bigger--

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.680
is this little Chrome thing.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:00.850
A little Chrome--

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:02.410
yay.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:04.970
Nothing like an IM
during a talk.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:07.170
Anyway, so you can
click on this.

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.640
Actually, in this case, we did
actually just launch this

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.220
feature like a day or two ago,
so there's not that many apps

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:15.220
that have added the metadata
yet to support this.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.340
But what I'm going to get is
an app that can do this.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.510
Obviously, we like this to show
PicMonkey and Aviary, and

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:23.110
so on, they just haven't
done their updates yet.

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:25.320
But I think there was in an
earlier talk for those who

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.080
went saw this with Microsoft
Project files.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:31.420
There's three or four apps in
the in the Chrome Web Store

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.695
that can open up those
files very easily.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.100
So it's a great way for people
to find your apps.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:46.680
To enable Drive to be able to
promote your app that way--

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.810
there we go--

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:51.710
is actually pretty simple.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:54.820
You just have to add a little
bit of text to your manifest

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:59.560
for the Chrome Web Store that
basically describes the MIME

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.230
types and the file extensions.

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:03.290
Actually, in this case, file
extensions are just kind of

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:04.570
modeled as MIME types.

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.680
In this case, I'm just saying I
can do text plain, or I can

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.390
do anything that ends in .txt,
which is that really, really

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:13.180
long MIME type.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:16.350
And this will basically allow
us to search for apps in the

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.560
Chrome Web Store that can handle
certain content, so

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.520
that when users migrate their
files to Drive and they put

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.300
everything in there, they can
open it and find your apps to

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.906
work with those files
in the cloud.

00:38:27.906 --> 00:38:28.860
MIKE PROCOPIO: That's great.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:29.990
You know what I love about that,
is that you don't have

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:31.930
to go to a store
to find an app.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.640
Actually, discovery is built
into regular work flows like

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.290
sharing and just viewing
your file.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:36.880
STEVEN BAZYL: Exactly.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.090
It's a great way to discover
new content and new apps.

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:40.980
MIKE PROCOPIO: So, good.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:42.760
A quick recap then.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:46.000
STEVEN BAZYL: Sure, I'll
hand that off.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.160
MIKE PROCOPIO: So we've show you
nine things that we can do

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.060
here and now to make
your app rock.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.670
So, UX matters, right--

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:55.020
UX consistency, user experience,
user interface

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.550
consistency, having a solid
mobile story, making sharing

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:02.590
super easy, security first and
foremost, the ability to open

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:05.330
anywhere, including opening
files from your app, setting

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.960
indexable text so you can be
searchable and discoverable

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.170
the files built with your app,
saving early and often with

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:14.940
autosave, opening Google Docs
types directly without having

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:18.690
to manually export first, and of
course, being discoverable

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:21.160
in the Chrome Web Store and in
our standard [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.940
STEVEN BAZYL: The thing is not
all these are going to apply

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:27.210
to every app, but the idea is
these elements are things

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:29.610
that-- the apps are successful,
the apps are

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:32.320
really well polished and get
great reviews, all adopted

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.480
elements of these things.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:38.230
So pick and choose which ones
apply, but a lot of things to

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:40.336
think about in designing
your apps.

00:39:40.336 --> 00:39:40.860
MIKE PROCOPIO: Definitely.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.140
Good advice.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:43.030
OK.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.010
So what next?

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.000
Well, what are you
going to build?

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.500
There are-- and I had to
get special clearance

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.410
for this one, too--

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:50.640
zillions of files
stored in Drive.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.575
STEVEN BAZYL: Not quite
there yet, but close.

00:39:52.575 --> 00:39:54.410
MIKE PROCOPIO: Let's
keep cranking--

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:55.490
files of all types.

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:58.080
Things that you would think of--
lots of images and videos

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:01.610
and PDFs, productivity suite
applications, text in rich

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:05.420
text format, plain text, ZIP,
RAR archives, and lots of

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.340
source code files,
interestingly.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:10.330
So what people are doing is just
kind of blanketly moving

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:12.750
to the cloud, uploading
entire hard drives.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:16.120
So the question is, what can we
do to bring life to these

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.900
files that exists right
now in Google Drive?

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:23.850
So basically we're in this kind
of new era of the cloud,

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:26.730
and the short story is if we
needed an app in the desktop

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:29.870
days, well, we're fully cloud
enabled now, and so we need it

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:32.740
now in the cloud.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:33.960
Did you change--

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.350
that is comic sans.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:36.710
That font is comic sans.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:38.020
Did you change that?

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.310
STEVEN BAZYL: I may have.

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:41.020
MIKE PROCOPIO: Unbelievable.

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.230
This is--

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:47.840
STEVEN BAZYL: I am a
fan of comic sans.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.441
I can't actually say it
with a straight face.

00:40:50.441 --> 00:40:52.240
MIKE PROCOPIO: This is what
happens in a collaborative

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:52.670
environment.

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:54.530
You know there's a revision
history on this.

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:54.800
STEVEN BAZYL: There is.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.550
So we could find out
who actually--

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:58.750
MIKE PROCOPIO: I'm
just saying.

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:00.270
We're going to find out.

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:01.750
But let's take this one more.

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:04.880
It's not just about the files
that are in users' drives

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.330
across the world right now, it's
also about experiences

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:10.660
that you can have, and sometimes
the file type is

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.060
secondary to the experience.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:16.560
So take, for example, Desmos
graphic calculator app here.

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.980
You can actually save the
equations that you enter in

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:21.020
and persist them into Drive--
for example, teaching and

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.020
lectures in a scholastic
context.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.620
But really graphing is
kind of real time--

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:27.950
learning about the app, rather,
learning about what

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:31.920
the equation does and how it
plots and what y equals 1 over

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.200
x looks like, so it's all about
the experience right

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:34.960
then in there.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.560
So there's lots of apps that
are like this as well that

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:41.075
aren't necessarily about the
files stored in Drive, but

00:41:41.075 --> 00:41:46.500
rather the capability and the
experience when using the app.

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.160
So we'll go ahead and start
to wrap up now.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.610
We'll have some questions here
shortly, but let's just say

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:54.160
one thing I wanted to mention
is that we are here for you.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.895
Developer advocates and
engineers, we work hand in

00:41:57.895 --> 00:41:58.840
hand-- love these guys.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.720
STEVEN BAZYL: We have a really
great relationship with the

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.080
engineering team.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.556
When you guys ask a question on
stack overflow or you have

00:42:04.556 --> 00:42:08.360
a feature suggestion, it's
basically just a hop, skip,

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.620
and a jump before it gets down
to the actual engineer who's

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:12.990
building it.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:14.820
And, of course, you can actually
meet a lot of the

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:17.570
team in the Sandbox today.

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.030
We'll be there afterwards and
you can come meet both the

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:23.040
developer relations and the
engineering team, and I think

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.340
even a few PMs, too.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.110
MIKE PROCOPIO: Sure.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:27.010
So the short story is my job
is to make him happy.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:28.805
STEVEN BAZYL: And my job
is to make you happy.

00:42:28.805 --> 00:42:30.690
MIKE PROCOPIO: Exactly, so
you see how this works.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:31.980
This is going to
work out well.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:34.200
Things you can go to you right
now-- the version two of the

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.480
documentation is live and
fully squared away here,

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.310
developers.google.com/drive,
and we also

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:41.040
have a support forum.

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:41.490
STEVEN BAZYL: Yeah.

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:45.920
Stack overflow, we have a Google
Drive tag on there, and

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.670
a bunch of us on there that are

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:50.030
constantly answering questions.

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:53.290
A few of them are in the back of
the room, and we do try to

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:54.665
respond pretty quickly.

00:42:54.665 --> 00:42:59.216
I think our response rate
is almost 100%.

00:42:59.216 --> 00:43:00.920
MIKE PROCOPIO: That's
impressive.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.310
Well, thank you guys
very much.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:03.580
We are grateful for
your attention,

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.042
and thank you again.

00:43:05.042 --> 00:43:10.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:12.680
MIKE PROCOPIO: We would like
to open up the floor to

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.600
questions at this point.

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.070
If you have a question,
come up to the mic so

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:15.825
we can get it recorded.

00:43:15.825 --> 00:43:18.630
STEVEN BAZYL: We have a little
bit of time, and if we run

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:20.990
out, we can take it outside
down to the

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:22.960
Sandbox and keep cutting.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:23.910
Go ahead.

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:26.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.150
STEVEN BAZYL: Could you turn on
the question mic, please?

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:33.240
Or you could just shout it
out, and we'll repeat it.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.290
AUDIENCE: So my question
is just a little

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:37.130
bit about the model.

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:42.070
So do you have to have your app
installed in Chrome to be

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:43.000
a document editor?

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.455
I saw in your scenario when you
try to open up a new doc,

00:43:46.455 --> 00:43:48.835
it suggests you install it.

00:43:48.835 --> 00:43:49.870
STEVEN BAZYL: Yes.

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:54.520
Right now for integrating into
the UI, that installation does

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.180
have to originate in the
Chrome Web Store.

00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:00.470
That is something that we've
gotten a lot of feedback on.

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.700
We are trying to make that a
little bit of a smoother

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.915
experience, so stay
tuned for--

00:44:04.915 --> 00:44:08.550
AUDIENCE: But it is possible
to have an app that edits

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:11.920
documents that it just lives on
its own URL and it's your

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.820
own domain.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.260
MIKE PROCOPIO: As of this
morning, absolutely.

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:17.390
An installation requirement to
use the API is no longer

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:19.470
present, it's just there you if
you want to integrate with

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.215
the open [INAUDIBLE] inside
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:21.215 --> 00:44:21.910
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:22.210
Thank you.

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:22.550
MIKE PROCOPIO: Cool.

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:24.220
Good question.

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.500
AUDIENCE: I had a quick
question about

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:26.470
the security model.

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:29.510
You're saying you obviously only
use as few securities and

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:30.890
permissions as you need.

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:33.500
I found, though, especially with
Android apps, a lot of

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.330
times developers will ask for
a lot more permissions than

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:37.090
you really think they should
need, and sometimes it's for

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:38.320
some optional feature.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.440
Sometimes it's for something
like monetization or

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.970
advertising or whatever.

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:44.820
It looks like it's kind of
an all or nothing model.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.270
There's no way I can just--

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:49.350
for example, the Loupe Sandbox
you showed, it's asking for

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:51.600
more permission than I
think it should need.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.170
Is there any way I could say,
well, you can have these, but

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.280
not this particular one,
and try and work

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.192
without it or something?

00:44:57.192 --> 00:44:58.320
STEVEN BAZYL: So
that's actually

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.590
a really good question.

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:01.740
Our [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:07.692
grant page does not allow for
optional permissions right

00:45:07.692 --> 00:45:11.500
now, so it is one of those
things where it--

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.260
typically, the reason why you
see a lot more [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:16.880
is people want to be able to get
your identity so they can

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.870
establish an account
for single sign on.

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:21.180
Often they ask for
an email address.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.865
If they're doing sharing,
sometimes they ask for contact

00:45:22.865 --> 00:45:24.700
and things like that.

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.610
But, yeah, there's no way right
now where you can say

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:30.730
during one of those requests
approve all but one.

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:32.910
It's an all or nothing
proposition with that.

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:36.890
What Mike was really referring
to was within Drive, moving

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:42.700
from all your content or none to
a model where now it can be

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.030
just some of your content.

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:47.520
But what you're talking about is
a little bit of a different

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.265
problem and something
we're aware of.

00:45:50.265 --> 00:45:51.980
AUDIENCE: I was just curious,
because basically you're

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.480
suggesting people don't ask
for the all complete

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.340
permission.

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.770
But since developers still can
do it, how does a user respond

00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:59.300
when they want to use something
where developers ask

00:45:59.300 --> 00:45:59.810
for all that?

00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:02.520
MIKE PROCOPIO: We try and make
the coarse permissions as

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:03.800
scary as possible.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.090
So let's chat some more.

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:06.530
This is a tricky problem--

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.660
let's chat some more
afterwards.

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:09.320
Ivan, do you have--

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.440
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.990
MIKE PROCOPIO: Repeat the
question, I got it.

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.835
Next question.

00:46:14.835 --> 00:46:17.180
AUDIENCE: Plus one on the
last guy's suggestion.

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.700
That's a really good idea.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:25.090
Similar on that same vein, is
there any desire to have the

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:27.440
apps be able to have permission
over a folder and

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.970
not just file specific?

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.210
Has any developers
asked for that?

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:32.215
STEVEN BAZYL: Yeah, so--

00:46:32.215 --> 00:46:33.410
MIKE PROCOPIO: It's a
really good idea.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:37.050
STEVEN BAZYL: The question is
any plan for folder scopes

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:38.990
instead of file scopes.

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:45.540
It's something we've heard a
lot, and yes, duly noted, but

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:47.050
I can't give you
any plans yet.

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:47.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:47.920
Thank you.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.766
MIKE PROCOPIO: Thank you
for that question.

00:46:49.766 --> 00:46:53.400
AUDIENCE: The indexable text, is
that just keywords, or like

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.160
for Balsamiq, that's
just a mockup?

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.590
So is that whole thing
searchable, or is it just

00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:58.855
keywords that they specify?

00:46:58.855 --> 00:47:00.456
MIKE PROCOPIO: In general, it's
just kind of raw text

00:47:00.456 --> 00:47:01.490
that we accept.

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:04.630
We actually accept it in an HTML
based format, so we're

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:06.860
able to parse out URLs on
these sorts of things.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.240
But it doesn't have to be
any specific format--

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.090
it truly is kind
of an abstract.

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:14.740
Here's a kind of a string field,
set your indexable text

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:19.560
in whatever kind of tokenized
parsable string of words that

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.830
you want, and we will index
it accordingly.

00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:23.900
So pretty simple to use.

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:24.640
Thank you.

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:27.240
That question regarded indexable
text and how to use

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.988
it and whether we can actually
parse custom data models, and

00:47:30.988 --> 00:47:32.360
the answer is yes,
we can do that.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.180
AUDIENCE: Is the Drive
SDK going to be

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.971
replacing the Docs API?

00:47:36.971 --> 00:47:38.960
STEVEN BAZYL: The question
is will it be

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.210
replacing the Docs API?

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:46.110
It is, as of today, feature
equivalent.

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:50.590
Anything that you could do
in the Docs API is now--

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:54.880
should be everything-- is
possible in the Drive API.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:48:00.590
Eventually I would expect
Document to get deprecated?

00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:01.800
[INAUDIBLE], do you know if
it's getting deprecated

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.310
anytime soon?

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:06.366
You would know, you're--

00:48:06.366 --> 00:48:08.970
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:11.610
STEVEN BAZYL: For now, they're
both supported.

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:15.490
MIKE PROCOPIO: Feature parity,
it is the new API network

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:17.770
going forward.

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:19.540
Thank you.

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.020
Time for a couple
more questions?

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:21.810
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:24.370
Did you think about
localization, like for

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:28.140
example, if you have that full
text search that I can give a

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:29.860
hint which language that is?

00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:35.660
Or for actions, that I can say
instead of open, what would be

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:37.010
the localized version of that?

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.930
Is there something in there--

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:39.710
I didn't have a look
at it yet, but did

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:41.272
you think about that?

00:48:41.272 --> 00:48:42.690
MIKE PROCOPIO: So the question
is generally about

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:45.300
localization and how we're going
to support, and I heard

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:48.620
two questions in there that
were good questions.

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:51.210
The first concerned verbs
like in the "open with"

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:52.460
menu in the web UI.

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:55.585
So the short answer there is
that those things are all

00:48:55.585 --> 00:48:58.260
translated in, I think, some
40 different languages.

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:01.810
The open verb itself
will be translated.

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:02.230
AUDIENCE: But custom--

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.570
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:03.990
MIKE PROCOPIO: --target of
things that you can create.

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:06.960
So, for example, in Balsamiq,
it's not a Balsamiq create,

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.580
you create a wire [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:11.630
That target is now or is very
soon going to be fully

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:14.380
localized in all
the languages.

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:16.330
And then I think the gentleman's
other question was

00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:19.085
more of how can we localize
a full text search?

00:49:19.085 --> 00:49:21.700
STEVEN BAZYL: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:25.400
To add onto what Mike was
saying, some of the widgets

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.490
that we showed, like
the Picker, for

00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:28.460
example, you can actually--

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:29.500
that's fully localized.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.190
So when you do the load you
can specify a language.

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:35.440
I don't think sharing is--

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:39.100
actually, that might render
based on the users, because we

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.730
know who the user is, so that
might actually render.

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:42.990
That I can find out.

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:45.210
A full text search is a really
good suggestion.

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:50.950
I don't think right now that
it will do that, but--

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:56.300
AUDIENCE: And for custom verbs
and targets, did you think

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.880
about that?

00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.580
Like, instead of open--

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:02.330
I don't know, edit, would be
localized, of course, but

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:04.850
other words like sign or
something like that?

00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:06.100
MIKE PROCOPIO: Right, exactly.

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.520
So the question is what kind of
verbs will show up in the

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.680
"open with" menu?

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.330
This is a classic UX tradeoff.

00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:15.670
You create a numeration of
things you can do-- facts or

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:18.320
sign, as you've said.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:21.270
So it's more accurate, but
there's an elegance to having

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:22.330
like a single--

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:25.130
whatever the verb is, under
an open width thing.

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:27.970
So there's a tradeoff here with
how fine grained we want

00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:30.190
to get and any friction
that may bring in.

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:34.110
STEVEN BAZYL: Right now the only
thing that's supplied by

00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:38.230
the developer is actually the
product name or the type of

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.520
item you're creating.

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.234
The verbs aren't customizable
yet.

00:50:41.234 --> 00:50:42.190
MIKE PROCOPIO: Good.

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.740
Good question, thank you.

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:43.640
Great, guys.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.330
I think that our time is right
on time here, so thank you

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:47.780
very much for your attention.

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:50.250

at your disposal if you want

00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:51.040
to come chat with us.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.990
We also have office hours

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.930
Thank you very much for
your attention.

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:56.010
We appreciate it.

00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:57.260
STEVEN BAZYL: Thanks, everyone.
