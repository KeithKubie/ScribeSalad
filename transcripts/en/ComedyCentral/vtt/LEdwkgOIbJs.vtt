00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:09.376
(dissonance)

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.048
- Charlie.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.684
Charlie.

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:19.686
Charlie.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.054
- What?

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.958
- Are you still awake?

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:25.892
- Yeah.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:28.361
- I can't sleep either.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:31.865 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm just thinking about,
like, the universe, you know?

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:35.335 align:start size:97% position:3%
Like, it's so big, and
there's so much stuff in it,

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:39.472
and there's like, so much that
we don't understand about it.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.842
You know what I mean?

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.177
- Yeah, sure.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:47.013
- What are you thinking about?

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:50.316 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I'm just thinking about
the book I'm reading.

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:52.819 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You're not thinking
about anything?

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:53.987 align:start size:81% position:19%
- No, I'm thinking
about the book

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.622
as I read the book.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:56.890
I'm reading.

00:00:58.291 --> 00:00:59.626
- Do you have any more gum?

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:02.328
- No, it's all gone.

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:10.703
- Home, home on the range

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:13.773 align:start size:81% position:19%
where the deer
and the antelope--

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:15.575
- Shh.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.644
(glass breaking, shouting)

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:18.478
- No, wait wait wait,

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:19.412
stop stop stop stop,

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:21.448
please, just stay where you are.

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:27.620
(dissonant music)

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.327
Sorry it's cold.

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:36.329
- We'd heard rumors of
a convoy near the river

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.564
headed to a military safehouse,

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:39.999
so naturally, we headed west.

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.938 align:start size:97% position:3%
We could never have
imagined what met us there.

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:48.875 align:start size:84% position:16%
We lost three of
our best sol-di-ers.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:54.681 align:start size:84% position:16%
They were brave men,
self-sacrificing,

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:56.449
they had a great look.

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:57.617
They were like--

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:58.918 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm sorry to
interrupt you, but...

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:00.053
Bridget?

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:01.621
Bridget, right?

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.224
- Um, hi.

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:05.725
- Matt, do you remember?

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:06.893
From camp.

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:08.661
We went to the same camp.

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:09.829
- Oh, hey.

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.798
- Hey, this is so weird.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:12.832
- It's really funny.

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:13.900
- How's it going?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.335
- Good, um,

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:17.637
you know, just doing this.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.539
Um, how about you?

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:20.473
- Good, you know?

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.208
Do you still talk to Brian?

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:24.644
- Brian, is he tall?

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.312
- No no no no, that's Ryan.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.480
You're thinking of Ryan--

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.715 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Matt, do you
mind if I just, um,

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:30.250
what is it that brings
you and your group to--

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.518
- The Lazarus Project.

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:33.153
- What is that?

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.621
- No, that's the
name of our group.

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:37.023
We're not just some
group, I named us.

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:38.558
- Oh, uh, all right.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:40.660 align:start size:97% position:3%
Well what brings the
Lazarus Project around here?

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.262 align:start size:94% position:6%
- We had heard rumors
there was a working outlet

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:44.564
somewhere in this sector.

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:45.798
Hmm, what is that?

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:47.367 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yeah, actually, you
came to the right place.

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:48.902
It's right back here.

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:53.473
It only works for a few hours
on the ninth of every month.

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:56.309 align:start size:97% position:3%
Usually in the late
morning or early afternoon.

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.777
- How'd you figure that out?

00:02:57.777 --> 00:02:59.345 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Oh, well, I just checked
a nearby router box

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.915 align:start position:0%
with a voltage meter, and
after graphing the coordinates,

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:03.383
this seemed like the
most likely building

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:05.018
to still be drawing current.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.120
The monthly thing is just
a fluke of the amperage

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.488
in the breaker system.

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.423
- So we're gonna play games.

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:11.658
We got three.

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.726
So that's good for the
two of us and Myron.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.495 align:start size:97% position:3%
But you guys could probably
switch out for Myron.

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:16.696
He barely plays.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.164
- We don't need any of that.

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:20.567 align:start size:97% position:3%
We're just here to recharge
our radio transmitters.

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:21.801
- Okay, sure.

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:23.336 align:start size:88% position:13%
- We were here first,
though, so I feel like--

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:25.071
- No, that's totally fine.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.509
- Thank you Charlie.

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.311
Let's hunker down here til
the outlet starts working.

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:34.214
Bridget, secure the perimeter.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.515
- Okay.

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:37.283
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:39.919
Perimeter's secure.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:56.736
- I could help, Bridget,
I'm not doing anything.

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:02.675
- Hi.

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:04.844
- Hey.

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:06.846
- It's cool, that's a nice vest.

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:07.747
You look very nice.

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.182
- Oh, thanks.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:11.684
It's bulletproof.

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:12.485
- Cool.

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:13.319
- Yeah.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.721
- So do you, uh,

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:17.824
do you like being in
the Lazarus Project?

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:18.958
- Yeah, I like it.

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.994
I mean, it's a lot of uh,

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:24.497 align:start size:97% position:3%
running around and securing
perimeters and stuff.

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:27.400
I mean, before this I
worked at this store

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.405
that did like, dog clothes and
treats and things like that,

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.541
and you know, this
is good, it's fine.

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:36.476
- Mhmm.

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:37.210
- I don't know.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.444
What about you?

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:39.846
How do you, how do
you like your group?

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.681
Does your group have a name?

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:44.117
- Um, yeah.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:48.621
It's, we're called
the Power... Rangers.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.791
- Like the kids show?

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:54.193
- Yes, like that.

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:56.296
- Cool, okay, sure.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.698 align:start size:84% position:16%
- But I'm the
leader of the group.

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:00.333
I'm like the main Power Ranger.

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:01.834
- I'm surprised to hear that.

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:04.270 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know, I just
assumed Charlie was.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.039
- Yeah, uh, no.

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.006
He's not.

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:08.207
A lot of people think that,

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:10.443 align:start size:88% position:13%
but he does sort of
like, the boring stuff,

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:13.479
like the math and the
talking and logistics,

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.748
and like, what we shouldn't
eat and stuff like that,

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:19.152 align:start size:84% position:16%
but I am like the
main, like the lead,

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.653
like the lead uh...

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:21.821
- Power Ranger?

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:22.689
- Yeah.

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.123
- Cool.

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:24.991
That's great.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:25.992
- Yeah.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.997
- What did you do before this?

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:35.268
- I was a soccer coach.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.206
- You miss it?

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.177
- Every day.

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:48.047
- We cut north here,
we can hit the water

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:49.816
safely outside the red zone.

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:51.851
- Or you could cut
along the canal.

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.253
Might be easier to stay hidden.

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:56.422
- He's right.

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:57.924
- You know, we could use
someone with your skills

00:05:57.924 --> 00:05:59.692
on this mission.

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:00.893 align:start size:84% position:16%
You're clearly
brave, intelligent,

00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:02.628
you got a great look.

00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:04.263 align:start size:84% position:16%
You'd make an
excellent sol-di-er.

00:06:04.263 --> 00:06:06.032
- Uh... I don't think I'd--

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.401 align:start size:97% position:3%
- How'd you like to join the
Lazarus Project, Charlie?

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:10.436
- Wow, uh,

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:12.438
jeez, I guess I, uh...

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:13.773
- We're live.

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:16.209
- Let's do this.

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:18.678 align:start size:88% position:13%
We don't know when this
thing will go dead,

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:20.279
so we need to move now.

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.881 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Wait a second,
Charlie, Myron, and I

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:22.949
camped out here overnight.

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:24.684
- You're just gonna play games.

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:26.285 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No, we're not just
gonna play games,

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:27.920
we brought a lot of fun stuff.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.655
Myron brought an
electric blanket.

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:31.391
- Come on man, just let
them do their thing.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.326
- It's our outlet, we found it.

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:37.697
I order you, uh,
to follow my order.

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:38.631
- What?

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:39.832
- As leader of our group,

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:41.901
I vote to banish
the Lazarus Project

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.936
from the beauty salon.

00:06:43.936 --> 00:06:45.238
Except for Bridget.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.672
If she wants to stay.

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:47.673
Be fine.

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:48.841
- Seriously?

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:50.476 align:start size:84% position:16%
You guys think
you're a real group?

00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:51.978
Do you even have a name?

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:53.413 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You don't have to repeat
what you said to me,

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.214
it was clearly a lie.

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:56.115
- Okay.

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:57.316
Um, fine.

00:06:57.316 --> 00:07:00.453
Uh, maybe we don't have a name.

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:03.556
Maybe we're not a real group.

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:06.959
Maybe that's okay,

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:10.363
because maybe groups and leaders

00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:12.231
aren't always a good thing.

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:14.634
You know?

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:17.837 align:start size:97% position:3%
Maybe we're doing a lot better
just as two best friends.

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.106
- I take no offense.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.374
- Shh, just one sec.

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:22.575
- You might be two best friends,

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:24.777
but you'll never
be true sol-di-ers.

00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:26.546
- I'm sorry, but
what is this word?

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:27.947
Sol-di-ers?

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.182
- Yeah, what do you mean?

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:30.550
- Are you trying
to say "soldiers?"

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.118
- Is he trying to
say "soldiers?"

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.519
- I really have no idea.

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:36.556
- No, it's spelled S-O-L-D--

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:38.257 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, it's
definitely "soldiers."

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:39.826
- You thought it
was "sol-di-ers?"

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:41.060
Like a French word?

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.994
- How long have
you thought that?

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:43.463
Does he say that word a lot?

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:44.464
- Yeah he does.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.698
- Sol-di-ers?
- Sol-di-ers.

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:46.933
- I get how you
would think that.

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:48.100
- If you only ever
see it in print?

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.368
- All right, enough.

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:53.673
Charlie, I guess I
was wrong about you.

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:56.609
I thought you had what it takes

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:58.945
to weather the storms of this--

00:07:58.945 --> 00:08:00.446
- Are you saying you
thought I would make

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:02.014
a really good sol-di-er?

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:03.816
- Wow, okay, you know what?

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:05.218
We're done here.

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:06.085 align:start size:94% position:6%
We don't have to negotiate

00:08:06.085 --> 00:08:06.986
Let's get out of here.

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:07.653
Lizard?

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:08.588
- Yes sir.

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:10.389
- This isn't over, Charlie.

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:12.358
- Bye Matt.

00:08:12.358 --> 00:08:14.427
- Bye.

00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:20.032
- Was that guy's name Lizard?

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:21.968
- He called him Lizard, yeah.

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:23.436
- It's probably a
nickname, right?

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:24.637
- It's gotta be a nickname.

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:26.839
