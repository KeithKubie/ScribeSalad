Hi, Micheal.

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:01.960
&gt;&gt; Hi, Charles.
How's it going?

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.440
&gt;&gt; It is going quite fine.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.220
How's it going with you?

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.080
&gt;&gt; Well this seems really exciting
it looks like maybe you're going to

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.240
drive the next lesson.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.490
&gt;&gt; I am going to drive the next lesson,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.250
and the next lesson is
called Game Theory Three.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.900
&gt;&gt; Game Theory Three.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.740
I feel like that presupposes the
existence of Game Theories One and Two.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.610
&gt;&gt; We have in fact done
Game Theories One and Two,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.230
we did it in the last class.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.573
And so there's no point in
doing it all over again.

00:00:25.573 --> 00:00:30.080
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay but
maybe people don't remember all of that.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.660
&gt;&gt; Well I'm sure they
don't because I don't so

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.450
maybe what we should do is we should
do another Scooby Doo flashback.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.520
&gt;&gt; Ahh, and
we can do this in a super special way.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.400
&gt;&gt; Because?

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.830
&gt;&gt; We're actually in the same
place at the same time.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
It's crazy.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.658
&gt;&gt; When's the last time that happened?

00:00:43.658 --> 00:00:45.447
&gt;&gt; Yesterday right.

00:00:45.447 --> 00:00:46.254
That's true, but

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:49.484
this is the first time we're actually
recording something like this that we

00:00:49.484 --> 00:00:52.520
are able to actually do that in a way
that it makes sense that the people.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.832
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; So let's do this go to flash we're

00:00:53.832 --> 00:00:54.753
going to do it together.

00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:55.926
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; Let's do it together, okay.

00:00:55.926 --> 00:00:56.448
You ready?

00:00:56.448 --> 00:00:56.987
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:56.987 --> 00:00:58.553
&gt;&gt; All right.Okay.

00:00:58.553 --> 00:00:59.749
You ready?

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:00.608
Let's do it.

00:01:00.608 --> 00:01:05.279
[NOISE]
