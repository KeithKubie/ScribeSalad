00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:01.702
I'm not going
to bullshit you.

00:00:01.702 --> 00:00:03.303
I know you. You've seen the
news.

00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:06.807
The current administration
is separating families

00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:09.810
from their children
at our border with Mexico.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.779
Nearly 2000 children
separated from their families.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:13.814
If you come across the border

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:15.616
we're going to take
your children away.

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:18.986
OK. Come across the border.
We take your children away.

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:20.187
That sounds harsh

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:23.123
but that's also the policy
of witches and candy houses.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:26.026
The upside down and Fuddruckers.

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:30.063
Side note, do not take
your children to Fuddruckers.

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:33.667
Now of course with this story
the anti-Trump media

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:35.702
is turning the outrage up to 11

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:39.006
claiming these poor kids
are in cages.

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:42.276
But if there's anything
disturbing about the situation

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:43.810
it's the word choice.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.013
Border Patrol people
have reached out to us.

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:48.181
They were very uncomfortable
in their words

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.617
with his characterization
of the words cages.

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.153
They said it's not inaccurate

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:55.856
but they're very uncomfortable
with using the word cages.

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:57.391
Yes very uncomfortable.

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:00.694
The word cages
is so uncomfortable

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:03.130
it's almost confining in a way.

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:06.500
Can you imagine
being forced into

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:11.238
using the word cages
to accurately describe

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:12.706
where you're putting children.

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:14.675
I mean the left
is all up in arms

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:16.944
over Trump's new
zero tolerance policy

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:19.513
that is separating immigrant
kids from their families.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:23.216
If you think about it for a
second literally only a second.

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:27.821
It sounds really really bad.
Like movie villain bad

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:31.625
like where the guys who phone up
and say "we have your daughter

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:33.360
"I hope you don't have
a special set of skills

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.795
"or else you'll find...

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:37.664
...us."
But guys,

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:40.534
don't let them shame you.
That's OK.

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:43.704
Don't be afraid of these
actions. You need to understand.

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.707
This is who we are.

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:50.043
We're the side that supports
separating kids

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:52.312
from their parents.
We're the deplorables.

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:55.782
Now if you voted for
the Trump administration

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:58.085
or are in the
Trump administration

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:00.153
you might be feeling
a little itch

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.556
and that fist sized spot
between your lungs.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:06.760
And that's just growing
pains, sorry, shrinking pains.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.730
You're working through
the different stages

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.632
of self acceptance.

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:12.833
For example denial.

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:16.103
Homeland Security
secretary, Kirsten Nielsen

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:18.905
defending the administration's
immigrant policies

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:21.541
in a series of tweets
writing this.

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:22.843
We do not have a policy

00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:24.845
of separating families
at the border.

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:25.912
Period.

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:29.549
Oh good luck following up
with that she said "Period."

00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:33.987
National conversation over

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:37.591
and if someone says "what about
all those children over there?"

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:41.294
Just say "well let's move
onto the next stage."

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:44.798
-Blame. -I hate the children
being taken away.

00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:51.705
The Democrats have to change
their law. That's their law.

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:54.374
That's the Democrats law.

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:57.911
Democrats forced that law
upon our nation.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:01.948
Yes Trump can't just undo
something the Democrats did.

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:04.518
It's not health care,
or taxes, or gun laws,

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:05.886
or anything Obama touched.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:09.089
His hands are tied. No sure.

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:10.590
Trump's own Department
of Justice

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.692
has acknowledged
that Trump and Sessions

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:16.863
created the policy and he can
halt it anytime he pleases.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:20.333
But if Trump really had that
power then who was he tweeting

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:23.503
"Change the laws" to in
all caps at 8:50 am?

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:27.074
You heard him Twitter.

00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:29.409
I don't know which one of you
eggs is in charge of this but

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.411
(bleep) fix it!

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:35.515
Unbelievable, wake up eggs!

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:39.953
If you're still uncomfortable

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:41.721
with what's happening
at the border.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:44.891
Try moving on to the next
stage: appeal to a higher power.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.694
The attorney general
Jeff Sessions turn to the Bible

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:50.163
to say the government
must follow the law

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:54.434
I will cite you to
the Apostle Paul in his clear

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:57.671
and wise command in Romans 13

00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.140
to obey the laws of
the government

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.142
because God is
ordained.

00:04:02.142 --> 00:04:03.910
The government for his purposes.

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:09.182
Jeff Sessions is always
appealing to a higher power.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:11.251
He needs to appeal
to higher powers

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.652
whether it's asking for help

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:14.521
getting the peanut butter
off the top shelf

00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:16.790
or getting him a booster seat

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.825
so he can draft up
some mandatory minimums

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:20.861
for skateboarding.
He needs it.

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:23.730
Now these are all
extremely valid responses

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.465
to a traumatic news cycle.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:28.368
But remember the goal
is acceptance.

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:30.137
Luckily one man
is already there.

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:32.372
Steven Miller has been
the architect

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:35.208
of basically anything
related to immigration.

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:37.043
Here's what Steven Miller
told The New York Times

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:39.479
that the separation of children
from their families

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.216
was a "simple decision
by the administration

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:46.419
to have a zero tolerance
policy for illegal entry.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.354
Period."

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:51.191
Period.
The Trump administration

00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:53.693
knows how important
it is to say "period"

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:55.061
at the end of a sentence.

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:58.031
Because, like a child, that
dot is so small

00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:00.534
it might completely lose
track of itself otherwise.

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:03.537
That's right.
The guy who was accepted

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:06.473
and helped dictate America's
southern border policy

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:09.042
is the same person who
reportedly told a classmate

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:10.177
they couldn't be friends anymore

00:05:10.177 --> 00:05:12.212
because the classmate
was Latino.

00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:13.747
Oh.

00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:17.584
Yeah. Helen's face may have
launched a thousand ships

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:20.453
but if those ships had seen this
face it would have turned the

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:22.789
(bleep) around.

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.325
So, Trump administration
members. Stop being

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.960
so defensive

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.463
don't pretend this isn't
your vision. Accept it.

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:33.567
Because this is who we are.
