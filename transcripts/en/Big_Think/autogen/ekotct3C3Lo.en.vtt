can just burn this down and you would

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439
can just burn this down and you would
 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.440
can just burn this down and you would
have nothing left and then it would be

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450
have nothing left and then it would be
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.510
have nothing left and then it would be
much easier for it to be mine and I have

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520
much easier for it to be mine and I have
 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.460
much easier for it to be mine and I have
no capital issues rebuilding and after I

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
no capital issues rebuilding and after I
 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.180
no capital issues rebuilding and after I
destroy it

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190
destroy it
 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.200
destroy it
that's how we created borders what what

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
that's how we created borders what what
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.940
that's how we created borders what what
kind of a world do we live in where

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950
kind of a world do we live in where
 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.350
kind of a world do we live in where
that's like an extent where that's

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
that's like an extent where that's
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.719
that's like an extent where that's
acceptable and now I mean that's still

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
acceptable and now I mean that's still
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.000
acceptable and now I mean that's still
acceptable all over the world today it's

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010
acceptable all over the world today it's
 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.330

just generally not as public but it's
 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.210
just generally not as public but it's
nuts and do I think that we will live in

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220
nuts and do I think that we will live in
 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.190
nuts and do I think that we will live in
a fully borderless world like that's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
a fully borderless world like that's
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.399
a fully borderless world like that's
gonna take a lot of change or a lot of

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409
gonna take a lot of change or a lot of
 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.250
gonna take a lot of change or a lot of
time and you know we'll see what happens

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260
time and you know we'll see what happens
 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.770
time and you know we'll see what happens
with the effects of climate change which

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780
with the effects of climate change which
 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.230
with the effects of climate change which
could fundamentally have some massive

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240
could fundamentally have some massive
 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.300
could fundamentally have some massive
impacts as far as creating what I would

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
impacts as far as creating what I would
 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.960
impacts as far as creating what I would
call a civilized refugee crisis but I

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
call a civilized refugee crisis but I
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.450
call a civilized refugee crisis but I
mean the way that we're starting to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460
mean the way that we're starting to
 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.310
mean the way that we're starting to
think about living in a borderless world

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
think about living in a borderless world
 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.350
think about living in a borderless world
is actually through one of my

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
is actually through one of my
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.929
is actually through one of my
technologies and it is called it's

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939
technologies and it is called it's
 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.300

founded by Suzanne Tempelhof and I'm a
partner in the company it's called bit

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869
partner in the company it's called bit
 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.890
partner in the company it's called bit
nation and bit nation is essentially the

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900
nation and bit nation is essentially the
 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.969

idea of Facebook for governance or DIY

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979
idea of Facebook for governance or DIY
 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.420
idea of Facebook for governance or DIY
government and we start out creating a

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430
government and we start out creating a
 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.580
government and we start out creating a
borderless society by actually working

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
borderless society by actually working
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.570
borderless society by actually working
on a human rights platform for people

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580
on a human rights platform for people
 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.350
on a human rights platform for people
who have been

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360
who have been
 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.200
who have been
disenfranchised so we use blockchain

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210
disenfranchised so we use blockchain
 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.830
disenfranchised so we use blockchain
technology to give refugees a global

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840
technology to give refugees a global
 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.960
technology to give refugees a global
identity a one-world citizenship and we

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970
identity a one-world citizenship and we
 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.300
identity a one-world citizenship and we
also do all of the e identity for the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310
also do all of the e identity for the
 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.380
also do all of the e identity for the
government of Estonia so we work within

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390
government of Estonia so we work within
 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.750
government of Estonia so we work within
systems of government who are interested

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760
systems of government who are interested
 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.910
systems of government who are interested
in using these technologies but in a way

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920
in using these technologies but in a way
 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.510
in using these technologies but in a way
that fundamentally empowers every person

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520
that fundamentally empowers every person
 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.430
that fundamentally empowers every person
on earth to exist to have the right to

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440
on earth to exist to have the right to
 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.070
on earth to exist to have the right to
live to exist and to be and to be

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080
live to exist and to be and to be
 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.820
live to exist and to be and to be
recognized so that's how we're starting

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830
recognized so that's how we're starting
 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.240
recognized so that's how we're starting
this world that has the potential to at

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250
this world that has the potential to at
 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.330
this world that has the potential to at
least at least for the time being have

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340
least at least for the time being have
 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.030
least at least for the time being have
more fluid borders and in the future I

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040
more fluid borders and in the future I
 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.010
more fluid borders and in the future I
personally believe that the idea of

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020
personally believe that the idea of
 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.900
personally believe that the idea of
government should be market-based people

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910
government should be market-based people
 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.710
government should be market-based people
should be able to opt in and to opt out

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720
should be able to opt in and to opt out
 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.530
should be able to opt in and to opt out
of systems of governance in the ways

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540
of systems of governance in the ways
 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.050
of systems of governance in the ways
that they are able to provide for their

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060
that they are able to provide for their
 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.380
that they are able to provide for their
people so governments are actually what

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390
people so governments are actually what
 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.160
people so governments are actually what
a concept

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170
a concept
 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.910
a concept
competing to be better to take care of

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920
competing to be better to take care of
 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.210
competing to be better to take care of
their people more than any other

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220
their people more than any other
 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.470
their people more than any other
government that is so deeply humanizing

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480
government that is so deeply humanizing
 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.380
government that is so deeply humanizing
and I think it's absolutely necessary if

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390
and I think it's absolutely necessary if
 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.949
and I think it's absolutely necessary if
we are to live in a world that is going

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959
we are to live in a world that is going
 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.360
we are to live in a world that is going
to have any kind of autonomous

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370
to have any kind of autonomous
 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.530
to have any kind of autonomous
self-governing organization so we're

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540
self-governing organization so we're
 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.259
self-governing organization so we're
yeah that's our whole world is creating

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269
yeah that's our whole world is creating
 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.080
yeah that's our whole world is creating
new holic rhotic systems of government

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090
new holic rhotic systems of government
 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.500
new holic rhotic systems of government
and we start by giving it to people who

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510
and we start by giving it to people who
 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.220
and we start by giving it to people who
need it more than anyone because those

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230
need it more than anyone because those
 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.400
need it more than anyone because those
people should not be forgotten

incredible things that distributed
ledger technology can provide for

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959
ledger technology can provide for
 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.880
ledger technology can provide for
generally the benefit of our entire

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.290
from the project and essentially became
invisible to the internet dropped off

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:48.300
invisible to the internet dropped off
 

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.060
invisible to the internet dropped off
the face of the earth Satoshi Nakamoto

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:50.070
the face of the earth Satoshi Nakamoto
 

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.780
the face of the earth Satoshi Nakamoto
has had one last little bit of

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:52.790
has had one last little bit of
 

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.430
has had one last little bit of
communication in 2011 to tell everyone

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440
communication in 2011 to tell everyone
 

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.840
communication in 2011 to tell everyone
that Dorian Nakamoto

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:56.850
that Dorian Nakamoto
 

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.660
that Dorian Nakamoto
who is this innocent Japanese band that

00:08:59.660 --> 00:08:59.670
who is this innocent Japanese band that
 

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.340
who is this innocent Japanese band that
was accused of being Satoshi and all of

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:01.350
was accused of being Satoshi and all of
 

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.840
was accused of being Satoshi and all of
a sudden was thrown into the media to

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:02.850
a sudden was thrown into the media to
 

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.080
a sudden was thrown into the media to
say the Dorian Nakamoto was you know not

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:06.090
say the Dorian Nakamoto was you know not
 

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.270
say the Dorian Nakamoto was you know not
actually Satoshi Nakamoto please stop

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:08.280
actually Satoshi Nakamoto please stop
 

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.960
actually Satoshi Nakamoto please stop
harassing him people from the press and

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:10.970
harassing him people from the press and
 

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.460
harassing him people from the press and
so that's actually the beauty of the

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:13.470
so that's actually the beauty of the
 

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.770
so that's actually the beauty of the
Bitcoin blockchain and the way that it

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:15.780
Bitcoin blockchain and the way that it
 

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.960
Bitcoin blockchain and the way that it
is not only ideologically constructed in

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:17.970
is not only ideologically constructed in
 

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.970
is not only ideologically constructed in
practice but in action from the founder

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:19.980
practice but in action from the founder
 

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.010
practice but in action from the founder
but the Bitcoin blockchain isn't the

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:22.020
but the Bitcoin blockchain isn't the
 

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.190
but the Bitcoin blockchain isn't the
only blockchain in fact there are many

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200
only blockchain in fact there are many
 

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.100
only blockchain in fact there are many
block chains and there will probably be

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:28.110
block chains and there will probably be
 

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.800
block chains and there will probably be
many more block chains and it's a

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:30.810
many more block chains and it's a
 

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.250
many more block chains and it's a
healthy robust ecosystem for a lot of

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:34.260
healthy robust ecosystem for a lot of
 

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.540
healthy robust ecosystem for a lot of
these block chains to have

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:35.550
these block chains to have
 

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.090
these block chains to have
interoperability for example there is

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:38.100
interoperability for example there is
 

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.360
interoperability for example there is
the etherium block train and etherium is

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:41.370
the etherium block train and etherium is
 

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.990
the etherium block train and etherium is
primarily used for smart contracts and

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000
primarily used for smart contracts and
 

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.970
primarily used for smart contracts and
you essentially have people that are

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:46.980
you essentially have people that are
 

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.120
you essentially have people that are
capable of creating apps like the in the

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.130
capable of creating apps like the in the
 

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.220
capable of creating apps like the in the
Apple App Store except that those apps

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:52.230
Apple App Store except that those apps
 

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.100
Apple App Store except that those apps
can have their own independent crowd

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.110
can have their own independent crowd
 

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.890
can have their own independent crowd
sale and can be independently monetized

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:57.900
sale and can be independently monetized
 

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.740
sale and can be independently monetized
by the people who use those applications

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:00.750
by the people who use those applications
 

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:04.730
by the people who use those applications
and who believed in the ideas so

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:04.740
and who believed in the ideas so
 

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.490
and who believed in the ideas so
essentially instead of having a big VC

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:07.500
essentially instead of having a big VC
 

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.440
essentially instead of having a big VC
funding round someone can come in and

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:09.450
funding round someone can come in and
 

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.230
funding round someone can come in and
say I really think that doing a

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240
say I really think that doing a
 

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.290
say I really think that doing a
blockchain based prediction market is is

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.300
blockchain based prediction market is is
 

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.570
blockchain based prediction market is is
fascinating and it's something that has

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:17.580
fascinating and it's something that has
 

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.570
fascinating and it's something that has
only become possible because of

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.580
only become possible because of
 

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.000
only become possible because of
blockchain technology so instead of

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.010
blockchain technology so instead of
 

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.920
blockchain technology so instead of
going adventure route I'm actually gonna

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:24.930
going adventure route I'm actually gonna
 

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.770
going adventure route I'm actually gonna
open up this idea this technology that I

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:27.780
open up this idea this technology that I
 

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.500
open up this idea this technology that I
built on the etherium platform which is

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:30.510
built on the etherium platform which is
 

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.800
built on the etherium platform which is
a blockchain to the community and I'm

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:33.810
a blockchain to the community and I'm
 

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.200
a blockchain to the community and I'm
going to allow the community to fund

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:36.210
going to allow the community to fund
 

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.350
going to allow the community to fund
this idea with something like ether

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360
this idea with something like ether
 

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.450
this idea with something like ether
which is the currency of aetherium and

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:41.460
which is the currency of aetherium and
 

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.640
which is the currency of aetherium and
in doing that we not only have the money

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:43.650
in doing that we not only have the money
 

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.580
in doing that we not only have the money
to build but people also have the

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:46.590
to build but people also have the
 

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.210
to build but people also have the
ability to become monetized as they

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:50.220
ability to become monetized as they
 

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.280
ability to become monetized as they
interact on our platform in our system

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:52.290
interact on our platform in our system
 

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.090
interact on our platform in our system
and so I think the future for blockchain

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:56.100
and so I think the future for blockchain
 

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.790
and so I think the future for blockchain
technology is fundamentally because you

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800
technology is fundamentally because you
 

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.120
technology is fundamentally because you
have opt-in principles it's like would

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.130
have opt-in principles it's like would
 

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.420
have opt-in principles it's like would
you if you had the choice would you opt

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:05.430
you if you had the choice would you opt
 

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.340
you if you had the choice would you opt
in to a restricted Internet

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:08.350
in to a restricted Internet
 

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:12.910
in to a restricted Internet
No and so I think that generally people

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:12.920
No and so I think that generally people
 

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.350
No and so I think that generally people
are going to move toward the ideas that

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360
are going to move toward the ideas that
 

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.870
are going to move toward the ideas that
inherently and fundamentally give them

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:19.880
inherently and fundamentally give them
 

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.030
inherently and fundamentally give them
the most opportunity and the most

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.040
the most opportunity and the most
 

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.880
the most opportunity and the most
freedom but in my personal opinion it's

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:24.890
freedom but in my personal opinion it's
 

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.340
freedom but in my personal opinion it's
it's healthy to have this robust

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:27.350
it's healthy to have this robust
 

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:30.190
it's healthy to have this robust
ecosystem of ideas where many people can

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:30.200
ecosystem of ideas where many people can
 

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.350
ecosystem of ideas where many people can
create and fundamentally in the true

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360
create and fundamentally in the true
 

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.060
create and fundamentally in the true
nature of this technology being a

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:34.070
nature of this technology being a
 

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.790
nature of this technology being a
market-based invention people are able

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800
market-based invention people are able
 

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.420
market-based invention people are able
to choose they're able to choose which

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:40.430
to choose they're able to choose which
 

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.320
to choose they're able to choose which
blockchain provides the best services

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:44.330
blockchain provides the best services
 

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.420
blockchain provides the best services
for them what matches with their

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:46.430
for them what matches with their
 

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.090
for them what matches with their
ideology how they believe and how they

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:49.100
ideology how they believe and how they
 

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.640
ideology how they believe and how they
want to carry out their life and so

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:51.650
want to carry out their life and so
 

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.380
want to carry out their life and so
fundamentally it's not necessarily I

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:53.390
fundamentally it's not necessarily I
 

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.140
fundamentally it's not necessarily I
would like to believe that the wisdom of

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:56.150
would like to believe that the wisdom of
 

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.060
would like to believe that the wisdom of
the crowds will guide us in the right

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:58.070
the crowds will guide us in the right
 

00:11:58.070 --> 00:11:59.920
the crowds will guide us in the right
direction for this technology because

00:11:59.920 --> 00:11:59.930
direction for this technology because
 

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.380
direction for this technology because
what is the value of something like this

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:02.390
what is the value of something like this
 

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:03.790
what is the value of something like this
if it is not for the people

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:03.800
if it is not for the people
 

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:10.720
if it is not for the people
participating in the system
