00:00:00.336 --> 00:00:01.661
- [Voiceover] So pause
the video and see if you

00:00:01.661 --> 00:00:03.030
can solve for x here.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.605
Figure out which x-values
will satisfy this equation.

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:08.914
All right, let's work through this.

00:00:08.914 --> 00:00:11.452
So, the way I'm gonna do
this is I'm gonna isolate

00:00:11.452 --> 00:00:13.668
the x plus three squared on one side

00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:17.790
and the best way to do that
is to add four to both sides.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.359
So, adding four to both sides

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.430
will get rid of this
four, subtracting four,

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.417
this negative four on the left-hand side.

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:28.913
And so we're just left
with x plus three squared.

00:00:28.913 --> 00:00:31.616
X plus three squared.

00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:33.417
And on the right-hand
side I'm just gonna have

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:34.937
zero plus four.

00:00:34.937 --> 00:00:38.483
So, x plus three squared is equal to four.

00:00:38.483 --> 00:00:42.425
And so now, I could take the square root

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:45.859
of both sides and, or, another
way of thinking about it,

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.875
if I have something-squared equaling four,

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:50.979
I could say that that something needs

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:53.790
to either be positive or negative two.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.286
So, one way of thinking about it is,

00:00:55.286 --> 00:00:59.061
I'm saying that x plus
three is going to be equal

00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:03.024
to the plus or minus
square root of that four.

00:01:04.294 --> 00:01:06.216
And hopefully this makes
intuitive sense for you.

00:01:06.216 --> 00:01:08.255
If something-squared is equal to four,

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:10.299
that means that the something,

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.469
that means that this
something right over here,

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:15.368
is going to be equal to the
positive square root of four

00:01:15.368 --> 00:01:16.850
or the negative square root of four.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.379
Or it's gonna be equal to
positive or negative two.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:20.890
And so we could write

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.866
that x plus three could
be equal to positive two

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:28.847
or x plus three could be
equal to negative two.

00:01:28.847 --> 00:01:31.410
Notice, if x plus three was positive two,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.196
two-squared is equal to four.

00:01:33.196 --> 00:01:35.086
If x plus three was negative two,

00:01:35.086 --> 00:01:37.158
negative two-squared is equal to four.

00:01:37.158 --> 00:01:40.268
So, either of these would
satisfy our equation.

00:01:40.268 --> 00:01:42.564
So, if x plus three is
equal to two, we could just

00:01:42.564 --> 00:01:46.586
subtract three from both
sides to solve for x

00:01:46.586 --> 00:01:50.797
and we're left with x is
equal to negative one.

00:01:50.797 --> 00:01:53.401
Or, over here we could subtract three

00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:56.670
from both sides to solve for x.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.102
So, or, x is equal to
negative two minus three

00:02:01.102 --> 00:02:02.735
is negative five.

00:02:02.735 --> 00:02:04.259
So, those are the two possible solutions

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.364
and you can verify that.

00:02:05.364 --> 00:02:07.791
Take these x-values,
substitute it back in,

00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:09.264
and then you can see when
you substitute it back in

00:02:09.264 --> 00:02:11.198
if you substitute x equals negative one,

00:02:11.198 --> 00:02:12.863
then x plus three is equal to two,

00:02:12.863 --> 00:02:15.429
two-squared is four, minus four is zero.

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:17.342
And when x is equal to negative five,

00:02:17.342 --> 00:02:20.047
negative five plus three is negative two,

00:02:20.047 --> 00:02:24.006
squared is positive four, minus
four is also equal to zero.

00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:25.988
So, these are the two possible x-values

00:02:25.988 --> 00:02:27.897
that satisfy the equation.

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:30.386
Now let's do another one
that's presented to us

00:02:30.386 --> 00:02:33.016
in a slightly different way.

00:02:33.016 --> 00:02:37.942
So, we are told that f of x is
equal to x minus two squared

00:02:37.942 --> 00:02:39.151
minus nine.

00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:41.305
And then we're asked at what x-values

00:02:41.305 --> 00:02:45.687
does the graph of y equals
f of x intersect the x-axis.

00:02:46.577 --> 00:02:49.829
So, if I'm just generally
talking about some graph,

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.477
so I'm not necessarily gonna
draw that y equals f of x.

00:02:53.557 --> 00:02:58.120
So if I'm just, so that's our
y-axis, this is our x-axis.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.106
And so if I just have the
graph of some function.

00:03:01.106 --> 00:03:02.792
If I have the graph of some function

00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:04.610
that looks something like that.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.567
Let's say that the y is
equal to some other function,

00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:09.275
not necessarily this f of x.

00:03:09.275 --> 00:03:11.568
Y is equal to g of x.

00:03:11.568 --> 00:03:14.576
The x-values where you intersect,

00:03:14.576 --> 00:03:18.333
where you intersect the x-axis.

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:20.368
Well, in order to intersect the x-axis,

00:03:20.368 --> 00:03:22.989
y must be equal to zero.

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.223
So, y is equal to zero there.

00:03:25.223 --> 00:03:27.804
Notice our y-coordinate
at either of those points

00:03:27.804 --> 00:03:29.762
are going to be equal to zero.

00:03:29.762 --> 00:03:32.681
And that means that our
function is equal to zero.

00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:35.598
So, figuring out the
x-values where the graph

00:03:35.598 --> 00:03:39.524
of y equals f of x intersects the x-axis,

00:03:39.524 --> 00:03:40.701
this is equivalent to saying,

00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:45.364
"For what x-values does
f of x equal zero?"

00:03:45.364 --> 00:03:47.020
So we could just say,

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.963
"For what x-values does
this thing right over here

00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:52.326
"equal zero?"

00:03:52.326 --> 00:03:54.074
So, let me just write that down.

00:03:54.074 --> 00:03:56.629
So we could rewrite this as x,

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.926
x minus two squared

00:03:59.926 --> 00:04:02.776
minus nine equals zero.

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:05.180
We could add nine to both
sides and so we could get

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.085
x minus two squared is equal to nine.

00:04:09.085 --> 00:04:11.014
And just like we saw before, that means

00:04:11.014 --> 00:04:13.504
that x minus two is equal to the positive

00:04:13.504 --> 00:04:16.064
or negative square root of nine.

00:04:16.064 --> 00:04:19.982
So, we could say x minus two
is equal to positive three

00:04:19.982 --> 00:04:23.998
or x minus two is equal to negative three.

00:04:23.998 --> 00:04:25.868
Well, you add two to both sides of this,

00:04:25.868 --> 00:04:28.659
you get x is equal to five,

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:32.147
or x is equal to, if we
add two to both sides

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:35.675
of this equation, you'll get
x is equal to negative one.

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:36.857
And you can verify that.

00:04:36.857 --> 00:04:39.744
If x is equal to five,
five minus two is three,

00:04:39.744 --> 00:04:42.642
squared is nine, minus nine is zero.

00:04:42.642 --> 00:04:46.370
So, the point five comma zero

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.630
is going to be on this graph.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.410
And also, if x is equal to negative one,

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.356
negative one minus two, negative three.

00:04:53.356 --> 00:04:57.156
Squared is positive
nine, minus nine is zero.

00:04:57.156 --> 00:05:01.022
So, also the point negative one comma zero

00:05:01.022 --> 00:05:04.238
is on this graph.

00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:05.883
So those are the points where,

00:05:05.883 --> 00:05:08.059
those are the x-values where the function

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:10.035
intersects the x-axis.
