00:00:02.341 --> 00:00:03.840
AMIT SINGHAL: I
can't hear you, man.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.825
How's everyone doing?

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.800
So, I'll let you in on a secret.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.640
For 40 years, 40
years, I've been

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.430
trying to learn how to dance.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.710
Every teacher I
hired, quit on me.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.190
So I decided to hire
the best in the world.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.840
So, everyone, with loud,
thunderous applause,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.830
please welcome my new dance
teacher, Madhuri Dixit-Nene.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.830
Clearly these two
need no introduction,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.220
but let me just
remind you-- for some

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.290
of those who are a bit
younger than I am, OK?

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.720
So Madhuri is clearly one of
the most popular leading actress

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.390
in Indian cinema, known for
her powerful performances

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.579
and amazing dance skills
that you just saw.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:58.495
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.185
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: Thank you.

00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:02.560
AMIT SINGHAL: She
wowed audiences

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.350
in classic films like, "Tezaab,"
"Ram Lakhan," "Saajan,"

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.510
"Hum Aapke Hain Koun!"
and many, many more.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.490
Six film theater awards grace
her mantlepiece at the house.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.740
And that's out of a
16 record nomination

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.540
that she got in
Film Theater awards

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.120
and that's just the
Film Theater awards.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840
Let me just read a list
of awards she has won.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.240
Pretty much anything that
you can win in Indian cinema,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.740
Madhuri has won
them, and that's why

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.580
I need the paper,
because I won't

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.890
be able to remember those.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.440
So Madhuri has won Kalabhinetri
award, Platinum Diva Award,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.520
Screen Award, "Vogue"
Bollywood Beauty Legend Award--

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.950
right guys?-- Zee Cine
Award, just to name a few.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.060
And to top it all off, she
was awarded the Padma Shri,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.880
one of the highest
civilian honors

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.801
by the government
of India in 2008.

00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:05.050
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: Thank you.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.060
AMIT SINGHAL: She's also a
UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.230
and her husband is an
accomplished cardiothoracic

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.330
surgeon, Dr. Shriram Nene.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.660
Now, Ram is a product of some
of the top cardiac schools

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.630
in the country, Washington
University and UCLA,

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.450
and practiced for over
a decade before moving

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.966
to India with Madhuri and
their two lovely sons.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.610
Together, they started
Dance with Madhuri,

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.810
an initiative to
help teach everyone

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.220
in the world about
dance, and want

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.290
to expand it to include
music, acting, and medicine.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.830
I've known both
of them put a bit,

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.920
and there is one thing, for
which they do not give out

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.180
an award, but if they
did, Ram and Madhuri

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.850
would win it, hands down,
every year of their lives.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.440
And that one thing is humility.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.290
They both have hearts
of gold, and they

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.960
have filled their lives with
family, love, selflessness,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.920
and, yes, humility.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.652
Madhuri and Ram, it's
a joy to welcome you

00:03:25.652 --> 00:03:26.485
to the Google stage.

00:03:35.524 --> 00:03:37.190
SHRIRAM NENE: Thank
you very much, Amit.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.660
It's our pleasure to be here.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.750
Amit and I spent a bit of
time together last summer,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.910
which he may or may not
have told you about.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.110
We did a 6-day trek
in Ladakh, and we

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.020
start at about 9,000
feet and went all the way

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.750
to 17,500 feet.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.140
And this was the sort of trek
that humbles any one of us,

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.340
and this guy was like Iron Man.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.900
He came in-- flew in at
the last minute, on Diamox,

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.270
and the rest of us were
all having our vasodilation

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.210
headaches.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:14.130
And, I mean, you can imagine
walking between 10 and 15 miles

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.730
a day at that altitude.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.060
It really tests you.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.149
And the bottom line
is having friends

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:25.070
like him is what matters
in anyone's lifetime,

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.550
and that's what makes it full.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.350
And so it's an absolute
pleasure to be here

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.010
amongst friends and family.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.699
And we are really
looking forward to this.

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.740
AMIT SINGHAL: Thank you,
Ram, for the kind words.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.850
OK, now you all guys, be
nice to me in the future, OK?

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.630
Madhuri, when you started
on the Bollywood scene,

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.850
you were known for
your dance style.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.050
How long have you been dancing?

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.120
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: Well,
I have been dancing ever

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.286
since I was three years old.

00:04:57.286 --> 00:04:58.767
I'm classically trained.

00:04:58.767 --> 00:04:59.600
I've learned kathak.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.450
That's an old Indian style
of classical dancing.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.160
Yes, woo!

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.970
I love that style.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.450
I really love that
style, because I

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.550
feel once you learn kathak,
you can do any style

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.350
in the world-- which I have
done through my movies.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.270
I am a very, very
passionate actress.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.070
It's my first love, acting,
but dance has always

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.830
been my passion.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.360
I've grown up dancing.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.210
So even when I did my films, I
try to do some extra, you know,

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.980
that add a little
bit of extra with me

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.150
and Saroji, the choreographer.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.310
Yes, everybody knows about her.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.630
We formed a lovely
team, and we work

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.320
so well together because we were
both passionate about dancing.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.780
And we wanted to take
Indian film dancing

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.010
to a different level.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.550
And that's what our goal
used to be every time we

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.600
did a song together.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.960
AMIT SINGHAL: Awesome.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.504
So what drew you to dance?

00:05:53.504 --> 00:05:55.670
Was it instant when you
were, like, three years old?

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.430
I mean, like, this
is what I want to do.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.555
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: It
came-- I don't know-- to me,

00:05:59.555 --> 00:06:00.820
it came naturally.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.660
I just was attracted to dance.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.860
And I think it's everything.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.280
Dance, to me, is everything,
because it keeps you fit,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.720
it makes you feel good, it
makes your soul feel good,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.919
and it's just-- it's a
beautiful way to express.

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:22.460
AMIT SINGHAL: And there are lots
of parents into the audience

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.630
here, who are probably putting
their kids in dance school,

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.230
right now.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.270
What advice would both of you
have for those parents here?

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:37.060
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: Well, I
would say, go to your computers

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.200
and Google us.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.810
Dance with Madhuri
is my website,

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:42.780
and you can go on that.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:43.540
You can take a look.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.956
There are so many
different styles

00:06:44.956 --> 00:06:48.220
we are teaching on
this site, and I

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.540
think what is so important is
to see what your kid takes to.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.446
A child has to take to a
certain style of dancing.

00:06:56.446 --> 00:06:58.320
And they will just know
it within their souls

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.080
that this is what I want to do,
or that is what I want to do.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.396
And let them follow their
heart, because if they

00:07:03.396 --> 00:07:05.020
do something they
love, they'll really,

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.700
really give it their all.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.190
All the styles are there under
one roof on Dance with Madhuri.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.740
So I would first like them
to try it out, and see,

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.885
and select which dance
they would like to learn.

00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:17.260
They can learn it
on the website,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.150
or they can go to a
school and learn it.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.200
SHRIRAM NENE: I think, to add
one thing to that-- dance,

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.860
to me, is about happiness,
confidence, and health.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.920
And what it epitomizes
is a holistic way to,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.650
kind of, take care of yourself.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.240
It becomes a metaphor
for life in some regards.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.030
So when we put this
project together,

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:43.880
quite an interesting journey,
in that, as some of you know,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.420
I grew up here.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.690
And I had done some
software entrepreneur work

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.940
at the age of 14,
and had a company.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.560
And my Indian parents
said you either

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.300
become a doctor or engineer,
or we won't pay for it.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.850
Does that sound
familiar to you guys?

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:00.870
AMIT SINGHAL: Yes.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.430
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE:
And so, the thing

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:06.610
was, being the dutiful
son, I became a doctor,

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.010
and I became a heart
surgeon, and I really loved

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.190
my career-- very rewarding,
took care of some amazing people

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.110
in very difficult times.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.310
But my problem was
I couldn't scale it.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.110
No matter how hard I worked--
300 to 500 patients per year.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.610
And the issue for
me was that there's

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.660
7 billion people on the planet.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.770
So the journey I
made was that, if I

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.290
could take my original skills
combined with her media talent,

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.000
and then amalgamate them
with brick-and-mortar,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.250
we could change the way
people think about medicine.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.669
And we move to India in
2011-- kind of a bold thing.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:41.130
You can imagine
my parents' face.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.140
What are you doing?

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.650
You are the head of a hospital.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.200
You are a partner in a group.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.850
You've been practicing
for 10 years,

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.640
and you do 300 to
500 cases a year.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.460
And you're just abandoning all
that to go and start a start-up

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.667
or something like that?

00:08:52.667 --> 00:08:55.000
I don't know, it's a journey
many of you might have made

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.860
or will make at some
point in your life,

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.310
but daunting nevertheless.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.300
And so then during the course, I
was building out the healthcare

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.700
constructs, and one
day she said to me

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.750
that culture, as we
know it, is changing.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.620
And I learned dance and
acting, because I loved it.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.050
It was passionate.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.520
And what ended up
happening was, now,

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.534
in the cinemas and other things,
it's a lot of commercialism.

00:09:18.534 --> 00:09:19.950
She's like, if I
could teach this,

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.976
I could change the
way people think.

00:09:21.976 --> 00:09:24.100
And I'm like, well, you're
facing the same problems

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.360
that I am that we
can't scale it.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.170
So what if we put a team
on this and scaled it?

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.410
And what ended up
happening was three

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:36.282
months of rapid prototyping and
engineering, launched in 2013,

00:09:36.282 --> 00:09:37.490
didn't know if it would work.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.948
And what we ended
up finding out is

00:09:38.948 --> 00:09:41.080
that people could
learn remotely,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:46.030
and they could extend their
level, and move forward.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.200
So the idea is to build a
global village for culture,

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.290
where everyone is equal.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.530
And I think the last thought
is, genius exists in everyone.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.261
The standardized tests
don't examine it.

00:09:56.261 --> 00:09:58.010
And the problem is
there's a lot of people

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.650
on the planet who don't have
the opportunities that we do.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.600
And so the idea is if you
can take this out to them,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.410
and find them, and nurture
that kernel of genius

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:09.880
into a full-grown plan, you
will change the way people think

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.460
and how things happen.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.810
So her love of dance
kind of spurned this,

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.350
and it became a
platform, and it grew.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.450
And so I'll show you
some of that later.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:20.950
AMIT SINGHAL: Great,
thank you, Rob.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.550
That's great.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.070
So as you said, you were raised
here, and I know for a fact

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.700
that before you met
Madhuri, you did not

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.150
follow Indian cinema very much.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.532
OK?

00:10:33.532 --> 00:10:34.490
So what happened, dude?

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.820
When someone mentioned
Madhuri for the first time,

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.290
did you run to your
computer and Google her?

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.415
SHRIRAM NENE: That's a good
way to set it up there.

00:10:45.722 --> 00:10:46.780
You know, I might have.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.110
I don't know.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.740
The thing is, my
folks are from Mumbai,

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.570
and I can only speak Marathi.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.540
I didn't speak Hindi,
and so we hadn't grown up

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.100
watching Hindi cinema.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.910
And the other thing
was, I was at UCLA,

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.990
and so we took care of a lot
of the Hollywood industry.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.500
And I'll be very
candid with you.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.580
The industry there
is completely crazy.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.720
I mean, the types
of people you meet--

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.370
The last thing I want to do is
see someone in the industry.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.040
But then I met her
brother, and he

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.930
was phenomenal, very
down-to-earth, very grounded,

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.950
and kind of fit our,
sort of, overall mindset

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.270
and agreed to meet her.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.490
And I think I probably might
have Googled her back then,

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:32.715
or Yahooed her, or something.

00:11:32.715 --> 00:11:34.840
AMIT SINGHAL: He just
doesn't want to admit it, OK?

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.850
SHRIRAM NENE: No, no,
I'm giving them that.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:37.950
AMIT SINGHAL: It's cool,
we all know how it works.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:38.450
It's OK.

00:11:41.177 --> 00:11:43.010
SHRIRAM NENE: Yeah, and
the rest is history.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.480
And there you have it.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.170
AMIT SINGHAL: So
Madhuri, how was it

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:52.170
leaving Mumbai,
Bollywood, and coming here

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.680
and living in Denver--
rather cold compared

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.520
to Mumbai-- for over a decade?

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.312
How was it for you?

00:11:57.312 --> 00:11:59.395
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: Yeah,
you know, in Mumbai it's

00:11:59.395 --> 00:12:01.130
hot, hotter, and hottest.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.770
For the first time, I saw
snow, and cold, and fall,

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.820
and all the four seasons.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.100
And it was beautiful.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.710
I mean, Denver is a beautiful
place to live for anyone.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.370
You walk out, and everything
that I had never found

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.810
in Mumbai I got in Denver.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.020
It was pleasing to the eyes,
the air is so beautiful,

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:27.345
and the mountains all around--
a very beautiful place.

00:12:27.345 --> 00:12:29.670
You know, in life,
everybody has dreams, right?

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:30.540
You have goals.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.380
You have dreams.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.800
And having a
family, having kids,

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.300
was a big part of my dream,
not just my profession,

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.020
and being an actress,
and everything else.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.460
But, for me, this was
a big, big deal for me.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.040
Because I grew up
in a big family.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.050
We have four siblings.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:52.660
And so, for me, having kids
was very, very important.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.910
Having a husband,
a home, and that

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.560
was a big part of my dream.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.560
Of course, I wanted 12
children at one point,

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.240
when I was a little bit--
But after I had two,

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.140
I was like, yeah,
this is good enough.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.260
I mean, that's how
I enjoyed myself.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.370
I kind of throw myself
into everything I do,

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.710
whether it was looking
after my kids or my home,

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.370
or living that life,
going out shopping.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.070
It gave me a sense of freedom.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.790
Because in Mumbai,
if I go shopping,

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.270
there are like 10 people
around me, you know.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.180
And I was never left
alone, basically.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.010
But here, I remember
the first time

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.990
I went out to just grocery shop,
I had to take my car and go

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:33.490
and my heart was
just like, pumping.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.040
It was like, boom,
boom, boom, boom,

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.665
boom-- as if I'm
trying to do something

00:13:36.665 --> 00:13:39.110
that I've never done before.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.500
But it just freed me.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.000
It gave a sense of freedom.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.540
And for me, life is not all
about just my profession

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.880
or just acting, or just dancing.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.340
It's the experiencing
every day, you know,

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.630
the different kind of things
you have to go through,

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:56.032
the situations and how you
deal with them, and the life

00:13:56.032 --> 00:13:56.610
lessons.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.430
And I love to live
my life, basically.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.215
And so, that's what was
most attractive about it.

00:14:02.215 --> 00:14:04.090
AMIT SINGHAL: Wonderful,
that's so wonderful.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:04.589
Yes.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.380
We're talking about movies.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.800
You've done, like,
70-plus movies.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.900
How many?

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.420
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: 78-plus.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.700
AMIT SINGHAL: 78-plus movies.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:17.200
Yes.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.242
Is there a favorite one for you?

00:14:23.242 --> 00:14:25.450
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: You
know, everybody asks me that,

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.750
but-- It's a very
cliched answer.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.200
So, people may say, oh, you're
very diplomatic, but it's true.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.880
Because every movie
we do, there's

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.409
a little bit of me in the movie.

00:14:35.409 --> 00:14:37.450
But if you put a gun to
my head and said, no, you

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:41.190
have to say one movie,
which you've really enjoyed,

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:45.040
I would say, I enjoy
doing that movie

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.560
because we were a lot
of actors together

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.980
at every point in the
movie-- 12 of us, six of us.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.740
And we really had
fun making the movie.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.520
Also it talked about
all of the values

00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.750
that I believe in-- family,
and an extended family,

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.540
and everybody living
together in peace,

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.800
and harmony, and all that.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.841
And it would be "Hum Aapke
Hain Koun!" obviously.

00:15:10.561 --> 00:15:11.560
AMIT SINGHAL: All right.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.882
So after that question,
here's a two-part question.

00:15:14.882 --> 00:15:16.090
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: Two part?

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.715
AMIT SINGHAL: It's
a two-part question.

00:15:17.715 --> 00:15:20.540
Part one, is there
ever pizza and movie

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.040
night at the home when
you put in a Madhuri movie

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.170
and all of you watch it?

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:30.580
Number two, when you do do
that, or when your kids do watch

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.092
a Madhuri movie, how
judgmental are they

00:15:33.092 --> 00:15:34.050
about your performance?

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:40.370
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: I'll just
tell you one little incident.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.230
As I was leaving home, my
kids were watching cable,

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.510
and one of my movies
was on, "Koyla."

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.104
And they were like,
sitting in front of the TV,

00:15:49.104 --> 00:15:50.520
and I'm like, OK,
I'm out of here.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.326
I'm leaving.

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:52.790
And I left.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.512
And I came back in the
evening, and on the computer,

00:15:55.512 --> 00:15:56.970
on one of my kids'
computers, there

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:01.016
was a little note hanging
there which said, Mom.

00:16:01.016 --> 00:16:02.820
And I'm like, what's this?

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.540
So I just picked it up.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:10.075
And it was, "Dear Mom, Why are
you acting so funny in "Koyla?"

00:16:10.075 --> 00:16:13.170
Love, Aaron."

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.050
So, for them, it's like,
you know, it varies.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.500
Their reaction varies.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.220
And I remember in Gulaab
Gang, there is this one short

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.470
where I raise my hand, and
then I'm like the big boss,

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:24.860
and I'm doing this.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.920
And my kids saw it
and just freaked out.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.405
And they were doing
variations of that.

00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:33.670
People were walking like a duck,
you know, and doing all that.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.530
So nobody takes me
seriously in my family.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.592
That's what I'm trying to say.

00:16:37.592 --> 00:16:39.550
SHRIRAM NENE: I think
the other comment to make

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:43.690
is, we don't wear
stars on our shoulders.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.950
And when we go home,
all of that turns off.

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:48.870
In fact, all of the trophies
that you're talking about

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.770
are all in the office.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.810
We don't allow them at home.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.860
We don't watch her films.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.570
I mean, I've only
seen like a handful

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.070
since we've been married, mainly
because of the Hindi issue.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.880
Now I speak Hindi,
but the issue is,

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.510
I think it's about being
grounded and not getting

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.310
caught up in your careers.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.490
I mean, whether it's a heart
surgeon, or an actress,

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.380
or anything else,
that's just a job.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.980
You're passionate
about what you do,

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.829
but it's the holistic
kind of balance

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.400
that you strike in your life.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.210
And just remember that
you're very fortunate--

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.660
and every one of us
is in this room--

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.760
and there's a lot of
people who don't have that.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.230
So the idea is to think of
others when you do stuff,

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.910
and to do it for those reasons,
rather than for yourself.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:34.910
Although we're very
passionate about what we do,

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:36.540
regardless of what it is.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.440
But I would say the movie nights
are generally the Transformers

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.380
or something like
that with the boys,

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.430
and just hanging out
and having some fun.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.695
AMIT SINGHAL: So how's
the move to India been?

00:17:49.695 --> 00:17:51.080
I think it's been amazing.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.830
I mean, India has
changed dramatically.

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:59.410
My in-laws-- I'm
sorry, my family

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.000
came from Dadar in
Mumbai, if you guys

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.530
have been to Mumbai at all.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.210
And I would go back
there every summer

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:11.210
to hang out with my
grandma and grandpa.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:14.380
So I'd been there and seen
it change over 40 years.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:18.110
If you go there now-- not just
Mumbai, but Dehli, Bangalore,

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:22.680
any of these cities-- it's
come in such a direction.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.060
And I don't know if you
call it forward, sideways,

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.400
upside down, whatever.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.430
But, I mean, it's becoming a
Western culture very quickly.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.640
And they have some significant
issues they grapple with,

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.190
and yet the culture
is so beautiful.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:39.010
I call Mumbai my
Manhattan of sorts,

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.060
because you can get
food any time of day.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.980
The people are very warm.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.590
And there are
different struggles.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:50.020
I mean, traffic is the same
everywhere, I found out today.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.170
And it was the same.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.230
It was the same in LA,
the same in Mumbai,

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:56.920
and whatnot-- just
variations on the theme.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.190
But I think, overall, it's
been an amazing experience.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:03.322
And I would recommend, if you
guys get some time-- I mean,

00:19:03.322 --> 00:19:05.030
a lot of you guys, I
see in the audience,

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.210
are from India, originally.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.251
And so you understand it.

00:19:07.251 --> 00:19:09.350
But I think it's so
rapidly changing.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.390
And, I mean, this new
prime minister and whatnot

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.820
is bringing us in a direction,
which is unfathomed.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:19.610
And even in the last 10
years, the number of advances

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.119
are amazing.

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:21.910
AMIT SINGHAL: Cool.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.760
So that's great.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.860
Now, you moved back to
India, and the first question

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.130
my daughter had for
me was, does she

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:30.650
go to [INAUDIBLE] herself now?

00:19:32.947 --> 00:19:33.905
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: Uh.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.500
I think it's back
to square one now.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.590
I have to pick and choose where
I can be or where I can go.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:45.940
But I do try.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:51.070
Because after living in Denver
and after being so independent,

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:55.220
then you go back, and everything
is a little different then.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.950
Because when you live there,
you take everything for granted.

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:01.380
You know, oh my maid is going
to go and get this, that.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.110
But now, when you've lived by
yourself and done everything,

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:07.000
it's like, I want to
go, but how do I do it?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.110
So then I wear my
hat or my big gold

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.440
glares, or something like that.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.580
And I feel, oh, this
is the proper disguise.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.170
Nobody's going to look at me.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:17.560
And when you're buying
your veggies or whatever,

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.226
and then somebody
comes in and whispers,

00:20:19.226 --> 00:20:21.380
can I have an autograph, please?

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.630
Oh, I failed again.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.770
But, yes, I do try to do that.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.065
It's a little limited,
but I still try.

00:20:29.065 --> 00:20:31.190
SHRIRAM NENE: I would say
the truth is this, right?

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.170
There's not many places
she can go in public.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.480
Me, on the other hand, I'll
go by train, I'll go by bus,

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.600
and my people will say,
no, you can't do that.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.120
It never really
bothered me, right?

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.010
I grow up in the US.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.064
The hardest part for me is that
I can't change a light bulb

00:20:51.064 --> 00:20:53.480
without someone saying, no,
you've got to call this person

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.720
or do this.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.910
I'm like, really, come on.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:57.030
I grew up in the US.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.850
We did everything for ourselves.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.580
And so it's been that way
a little bit of a change,

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.280
but for her-- I mean, in the US,
she would put together the Ikea

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.370
furniture and the other
stuff we'd got and--

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:08.400
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE:
I love to do that.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:08.780
SHRIRAM NENE: She loved it.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:09.363
Yeah, exactly.

00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:14.270
AMIT SINGHAL: And from
what little I know,

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.910
she was much better
at it than Ran.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.275
OK?

00:21:18.275 --> 00:21:20.050
SHRIRAM NENE: Not true.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.170
AMIT SINGHAL: So let's talk
about Dance with Madhuri now.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.840
You're trying to build
a community of artists,

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.800
of dancers, people who
love dancing, people

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.820
who want to learn dancing.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.612
Where did the idea come from?

00:21:34.612 --> 00:21:35.820
Where do you want to take it?

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.800
SHRIRAM NENE: The thing is, I
kind of hinted at this earlier,

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.830
every single one of us has a
little genius in them, right?

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.660
And it just dawned
on us that what

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.910
if Pablo Picasso never got his
pencil, or pen, or paintbrush?

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:56.940
What if Marie Curie never got
an opportunity to go and learn?

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.450
And what if Einstein
never had an opportunity

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:01.340
to write his thesis?

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.520
And then think, how
many people in the world

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.800
never have that opportunity?

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.350
And so, for me, I started
out with this health

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.620
construct to take good
evidence-based medicine

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.066
to everyone on the planet.

00:22:13.066 --> 00:22:14.440
Because what I
saw was that there

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.610
were a lot of people
who weren't getting

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:20.330
the opportunities that all
of us have in this room

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.320
and in the US.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.870
And even in the US,
for that matter,

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.040
when I was practicing
several years ago,

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.400
38 million people
never had insurance.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.050
And the idea is that medicine
is one of those things

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:35.400
that everyone should have,
but it went further than that.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.590
And what it became
was a platform

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:41.360
where we could experiment,
and we could teach people

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.840
in a fun and social manner.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.020
So this is one of those things
where if you gameify learning,

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.480
you can change the
way people learn.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.590
I remember learning when I
was growing up that it was

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:52.960
all rote summarization, right?

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.210
You must learn this, and
then throw it up on the test,

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:56.600
and you will do well.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.611
But my feeling is that really
leaves out the bell curve,

00:23:00.611 --> 00:23:01.110
right?

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.194
The ends of it.

00:23:02.194 --> 00:23:04.610
And so what we've done is tried
to make it fun and social.

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.840
At the same time, we've
taken dance, in particular,

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.900
and used it to stay fit.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:13.350
So I put a fitness band
on her, and in 15 minutes,

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.200
her heart rate
sustained was 130 to 160

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.990
and her caloric burn
was 400 calories.

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.080
So we put that on
our YouTube channel--

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.840
just wanted to put
that plug in there--

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.100
and we had like 175 hours
of viewing per month.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.806
It became, like, our
number-one most-viewed thing.

00:23:31.806 --> 00:23:34.180
And so what we found is people
we're learning, certainly,

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.320
but they were using dance
as a means to work out.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.528
And, if you think about it,
what would you rather do?

00:23:38.528 --> 00:23:41.040
Be on a treadmill
looking at a TV

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.390
or whatever, or have some
beautiful woman in front

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:44.990
of you, taking you
through the moves

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.650
and losing calories
in 15 minutes?

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.810
And then what we did was
we knit that together

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.460
with a social network
and a marketplace.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.250
So now when these people learn,
they're not just learning,

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.219
but they're creating
video resumes.

00:23:58.219 --> 00:23:59.760
And what they're
doing is essentially

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.512
becoming marketable.

00:24:01.512 --> 00:24:03.470
So what we're doing is
we're discovering talent

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:07.710
from all over the planet,
not just from one area.

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.990
I would love to cue that
one video, if we have it,

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:12.410
on the [INAUDIBLE] piece.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.240
AMIT SINGHAL: All right, guys.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.406
Can we cue the video please?

00:24:16.439 --> 00:24:18.730
SHRIRAM NENE: I think this
tells the story very nicely.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.480
So, all in all, it became a
passion play, in that, what

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.210
could we do to change
people's lives?

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.272
And dance was really
the tip of the iceberg,

00:24:31.272 --> 00:24:32.980
because if you take
this and build it out

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.911
to the other verticals, it
becomes incredibly [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:35.911 --> 00:24:36.410
Here you go.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:37.076
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:37.076 --> 00:24:39.301
AMIT SINGHAL: Here's the video.

00:24:39.301 --> 00:24:41.092
SHRIRAM NENE: So this
is an average lesson.

00:24:47.938 --> 00:24:49.405
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.640
-So before we actually
start the lesson,

00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:01.400
I want you to get familiar
with some of the hand mudras.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.780
Your right hand with the
lotus, and the other hand

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.102
is like a deer hand.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.890
1, 2, 3.

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:12.860
So you're curling your
hands [INAUDIBLE] style.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.280
OK, so this is the sign, or the
hook, or the signature step.

00:25:58.252 --> 00:26:00.244
Chen, god will be separate.

00:26:15.682 --> 00:26:18.670
Rhada, rhada, rhada, rah.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.200
AMIT SINGHAL: So
speaking of dance, Ram,

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.334
could you dance
before you met her?

00:26:29.334 --> 00:26:31.750
SHRIRAM NENE: Yeah, I could
cut a rug, but not like after.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.670
I mean, some of the
parties we've gone to,

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:37.800
and some of the things she's
taught me, it's another world.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.672
AMIT SINGHAL: And are
you any better now?

00:26:39.672 --> 00:26:40.880
SHRIRAM NENE: I would say so.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.640
Can you answer that?

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.681
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: Yeah.

00:26:42.681 --> 00:26:44.722
I mean-- [AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.880
We were at this party, and
you know, they were like,

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.976
oh, you have to dance.

00:26:50.976 --> 00:26:53.225
Doctor Nene, you've got to
dance, dance, and everybody

00:26:53.225 --> 00:26:54.330
was insisting.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:56.867
And there was [INAUDIBLE],
and there was [INAUDIBLE], and

AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.430
SHRIRAM NENE: You
know, yeah, woo!

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:00.013
Who said that?

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.760
So all of them, and
I had to grab him

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.830
and say, OK, you got
to dance on the floor.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:11.284
And he was like, oh, my god!

00:27:11.284 --> 00:27:12.950
I'm like, we were
shooting for all this,

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:16.670
and I think he's picked
up a lot, just watching.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:20.010
And he was so good on the floor
that [? Farah ?] came up to me

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.500
and says, he's going to be
my next dance partner, now.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:29.180
So yeah, I, mean he is free of
spirit, and he loves to learn,

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.610
and he's very observant.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:34.580
And whenever we were doing
classes, or whatever--

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.250
by the way, he's also done
one of the classes where,

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:41.760
it's called "Dance
for the Non-Dancer"--

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.509
so his training started there.

00:27:43.509 --> 00:27:44.800
AMIT SINGHAL: I will take that.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.150
I will take that, yeah.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.441
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: And I
think you should try it, too.

00:27:48.441 --> 00:27:50.260
AMIT SINGHAL: Yes, thank you.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.040
SHRIRAM NENE: I think
it's infectious.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:52.540
You know?

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.790
I mean, you see these
people, and it's just,

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.800
as they say, poetry
in motion or fluid.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.884
And it really kind of
drives you after a while.

00:28:02.884 --> 00:28:04.550
I mean, there's a lot
of things that do,

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.190
but there's different
types of art.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:09.299
This is one of those things
that really makes it happiness.

00:28:09.299 --> 00:28:10.090
AMIT SINGHAL: Cool.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:12.490
So in a minute I'm
going to open it up

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:13.920
to the audience for questions.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.680
If you have a question
for Madhuri and Ram,

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.970
please get to one of these mics.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:23.470
You know the TGIF routine.

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:26.590
SHRIRAM NENE: I was going to
make just one comment, two

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:27.420
comments, actually.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.950
The one is it's free.

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.970
And our goal is to
keep it free forever,

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.580
so that there's
absolutely no impediments

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.240
or obstacles to the end user.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.850
The second is, all of
the greatest artists

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:41.600
are coming on the
platform, whether it's

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.460
Birju Maharaj, Saroj
Kahn, Terrence, Remo,

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.620
and a host of [INAUDIBLE]
and other choreographers.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.090
The idea is to create
one place where everyone

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:57.190
can go and feel free to add
and subtract and bring everyone

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:58.220
together.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.450
And the idea was literally
global village for culture.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:04.060
And so that's the
idea behind it.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.060
AMIT SINGHAL: OK,
before I open it up.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.890
One question.

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.540
What's that one piece of
technology that you guys can't

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:11.190
live without?

00:29:16.399 --> 00:29:18.690
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: At my
house, we cannot live without

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.150
technology.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:23.115
There has to be a gadget for
everything in the house, right?

00:29:23.115 --> 00:29:23.614
Yeah,

00:29:23.614 --> 00:29:24.697
SHRIRAM NENE: Pretty much.

00:29:24.697 --> 00:29:27.340
AMIT SINGHAL: I know, but that's
like, "I love all my children"

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:27.840
answer.

00:29:35.776 --> 00:29:36.280
All right?

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.420
That's what a guy's supposed
to give as an answer.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.032
OK?

00:29:39.032 --> 00:29:40.490
Now, someone put
a gun to your head

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:42.585
and said, what's the
one piece of technology?

00:29:45.468 --> 00:29:46.312
AUDIENCE: IPhone.

00:29:46.312 --> 00:29:48.020
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE:
Oh, my goodness, yes.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:48.680
iPhone.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.630
Easily.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:50.577
Yeah.

00:29:50.577 --> 00:29:51.920
[AUDIENCE BOOS]

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.836
SHRIRAM NENE: All right,
all right, all right.

00:29:53.836 --> 00:29:54.980
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.313
I'm going to show you some love.

00:29:56.313 --> 00:29:58.480
I've got my Android phone.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.980
[AUDIENCE CHEERS]

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.410
And actually, I'll just
tell you one other thing.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.990
I've got Dance
with Madhuri on it.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:11.460
It actually runs
better than my iPhone.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.541
So try it.

00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:15.040
AMIT SINGHAL: Oh,
that's so awesome.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:20.370
Now, we asked people who
couldn't get in today,

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:22.500
to submit a bunch of
questions for you.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.170
And let me start asking
some of those questions

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:28.340
that people have
submitted for you.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:32.340
Now, many of us who came
to the US as adults,

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:37.280
have found the social anonymity
of not being known by anybody

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.360
something to adjust to.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.160
In your case, the feeling
must have been far greater.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.790
Did you welcome that change?

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.630
If not, how did
you deal with it?

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:50.900
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: Yeah,
it was a welcome change.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:57.240
Because when you're, like,
famous or a celebrity in India,

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.320
there's not much you can do.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:30:59.820
and.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:04.670
The way I worked, for me life
was just from one studio,

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:06.580
to another, to
another, to another.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:10.410
And I really didn't get to
live life normally, you know,

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.960
like how everybody lives.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.566
They go out with your
friends, the college friends,

00:31:14.566 --> 00:31:15.690
and I started really early.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.420
I started when I was 16.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:21.840
So I missed out on that, and,
not that I'm complaining,

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:25.460
but that's the life I knew.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.300
And when I moved
to Denver, it was,

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.660
like I said, a freedom for me.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.620
Because suddenly I was free to
do anything that I wanted to.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.030
I could go to the grocery shop.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:36.870
I didn't have to dress
up or do anything.

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:40.820
I could just go the way I
was, and I could get grocery,

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.780
I could take my kids
out, go to the park,

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.270
just enjoy everything.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:49.030
And another part of
it is when I met Ram.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.920
He was into adventure
sports, and he

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.774
used to do all kinds of crazy
stuff, which I had never

00:31:53.774 --> 00:31:54.440
done in my life.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.560
I'm a very careful
person, very protected,

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:01.770
and I just knew that
I was an actress

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:03.610
and I went from one
studio to another,

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:06.580
and I danced, and sang,
and acted, and everything.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.010
But this was like freedom.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:09.200
I was outdoors.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:16.537
The first day after we met, he
said, let's go mountain biking.

00:32:16.537 --> 00:32:17.328
And I'm like, yeah.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.530
And I had not ridden
a bike in 20 years.

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:25.544
I had done it when I was
little, and I had not.

00:32:25.544 --> 00:32:27.710
And I thought, mountain
biking is just taking a bike

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:30.080
and going on a mountain, right?

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.800
How can that be?

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.640
And I went with him, it was
like, whoa, I was coming down,

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.670
like, rocky things.

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:38.310
And I was like,
did I just do that?

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:41.740
At some poor spots, I was like,
I don't think I can do this.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.530
And he was like, why?

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:46.050
Because I haven't
done this in 20 years.

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:48.820
So he was like, you
cannot mountain bike?

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:50.104
And I said, no.

00:32:50.104 --> 00:32:52.520
So there were some portions
where he had to carry my bike,

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.700
and we just walked
across and did all that.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.610
But it just gave me a sense
of freedom, just showed me

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:00.840
another life altogether,
and I've really, really

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.930
enjoyed every moment of it.

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.400
AMIT SINGHAL: That's so joyful.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.130
Let's take the first
question, please.

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:09.390
AUDIENCE: Hello, Madhuri.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:09.800
Hello, Dr. Nene.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.280
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: Hello.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:10.610
SHRIRAM NENE: Hi.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:11.450
How are you?

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:13.860
AUDIENCE: First,
complement first.

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:19.420
Madhuri, you are great,
amazing gift to this universe.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.350
It's really, really amazing.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:23.820
And here, I was not
listening anything.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.070
I was just staring you,
because this is the first time

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:28.080
I'm seeing you in person.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.660
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: Thank you.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.020
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.390
One two Madhuri,
and one to Dr. Nene.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.650
Madhuri, how does feel
like being Madhuri?

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:43.260
Like, do you see, like,
something special?

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.787
Or, like, it's kind
of god gift, right?

00:33:45.787 --> 00:33:47.870
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: I know,
let's put it this way,

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:49.819
that you guys make
me feel special.

00:33:49.819 --> 00:33:50.360
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.230
How does that love
feel around you?

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:53.080
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE:
Yeah, there's

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.520
a lot of love around
me, and I know

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.186
everybody's looking
at me very lovingly,

00:33:56.186 --> 00:33:58.480
and it makes me feel special.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.420
It makes me feel special,
but I don't know.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.790
I am just a very happy person.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.450
I am very positive in life.

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:08.300
And when I look at
something, I see life,

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.530
you know, like the glass
half full not half empty.

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:14.199
So I just enjoy every
moment in my life,

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:16.489
and I don't think
too much about that.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.460
I don't think about the fact
that I'm Madhuri or whatever.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:23.420
I'm just a person who
loves doing things,

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.804
and I want to share
that with my fans now.

00:34:26.804 --> 00:34:29.429
Because I love dancing so much,
I want to share that with them.

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:33.334
And so, that's how I look at it.

00:34:33.334 --> 00:34:34.750
AUDIENCE: What's
the one thing you

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:39.659
want to give it to the
world other than dancing?

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:43.130
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: I
think joy, happiness, just

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:45.090
feel good about themselves.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:47.780
That's something I would
really love to give back.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.560
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.210
Question to Dr. Nene is,
what was your first reaction

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:53.084
when you met Madhuri?

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.350
SHRIRAM NENE: I don't
know what to say.

00:34:58.350 --> 00:34:59.570
I didn't know who she was.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:04.382
AMIT SINGHAL: He was speechless,
that's what he's saying.

00:35:04.382 --> 00:35:06.734
SHRIRAM NENE: Yeah, that.

00:35:06.734 --> 00:35:08.400
AMIT SINGHAL: This
man will never learn.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.977
I've tried teaching him, OK?

00:35:09.977 --> 00:35:11.810
SHRIRAM NENE: I've been
married long enough,

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:12.935
probably it doesn't matter.

00:35:12.935 --> 00:35:14.851
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: Now
I make him speechless.

00:35:14.851 --> 00:35:15.744
I don't let him talk.

00:35:15.744 --> 00:35:16.660
SHRIRAM NENE: Exactly.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:17.790
What?

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:25.170
No, but what you find-- so
there's a couple of points.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:28.950
The first is, I grew up in LA.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:31.560
I was surrounded
by the industry.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.880
And so what you found
is, they put their pants

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.460
on one leg at a time,
just like everyone else.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:41.960
And the issue is
that-- the connect

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:45.070
was that we didn't treat each
other different, regardless

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:47.240
of what our stature
was, what we did.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.280
And the one thing
I loved about her

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.510
was that she's down
to earth, and very,

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:56.840
very straightforward and
focused, and no nonsense,

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.099
and that's not always the
case in the filmy line.

00:35:59.099 --> 00:35:59.890
I'll tell you that.

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:01.340
I think you can answer that.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.970
And so we are kind of the
un-filmy people, in that we're

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:06.870
real, and we like
to stay that way.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:10.314
And you won't see us going
out and doing crazy stuff.

00:36:10.314 --> 00:36:11.730
I mean, that's fun
once in awhile.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:15.090
But the bottom line is that
it has to be a balance.

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:18.430
And so the answer
is, she was real.

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:20.320
That's what mattered to me.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:23.540
And certainly with my career and
her career, the other comment

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.450
someone had asked, I think,
was the anonymity factor.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:30.230
She's the one person who's
been everywhere and yet been

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:31.080
nowhere.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.790
And what I mean by that is,
they closed the Eiffel Tower

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:35.690
for one of her shoots.

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:38.540
And, imagine that, the Eiffel
Tower-- the [INAUDIBLE],

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:39.710
everything else.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:43.390
They went to a
glacier in Alaska,

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:46.610
had multiple chopper setups,
and shooting for a movie

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:49.850
called "Pukar," and
yet, for these guys,

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:52.860
it's a matter of jetting in,
getting in hair and makeup,

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.100
putting on your clothes,
and jetting out.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.820
So in the time we've been
married, the one kind of gift

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.910
was that we could go
and do things normally.

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:03.430
And the US kind
of afforded that,

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.960
in that she could
actually go out and drive

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:09.310
to Whole Foods or whatever
and buy groceries.

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.840
Which that doesn't
sound like a lot.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.540
It sounds like a
chore to most people,

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.685
but for someone like
this, it's like freedom.

00:37:15.685 --> 00:37:16.310
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:17.530
I can imagine.

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:18.559
AMIT SINGHAL: Thank you.

00:37:18.559 --> 00:37:20.350
AUDIENCE: And I really
want to thank Google

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:21.920
for organizing this.

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:22.760
Thank you.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.760
AMIT SINGHAL: Thank you.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.684
Let's take the next question.

00:37:27.684 --> 00:37:28.600
AUDIENCE: Hello, guys.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.210
So Madhuri, at what
point in your career

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:34.290
did you realize-- maybe were
you reflecting at some point--

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:35.180
that you had make it?

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.450
Cause there are a lot of men and
women in India and everywhere

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:39.241
in the world, who want
to be where you are.

00:37:39.241 --> 00:37:42.940
And when did you feel,
yes, I've done it?

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:46.150
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE:
My film called

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.890
"Tezaab" was released
in '89, and I

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:51.660
remember I was not in
India when it released.

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.620
I was here in the US.

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:56.200
And I was in Washington,
or Chicago, I think,

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.240
because my sister
was getting married.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:03.160
And my agent at that point
had called me, and he said,

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.374
[NON-ENGLISH] picture,
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:38:05.374 --> 00:38:06.482
Like that.

00:38:06.482 --> 00:38:08.940
And I had never had a hit film,
so for me, it was like, oh,

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:09.439
good.

00:38:09.439 --> 00:38:10.781
I have a hit film now.

00:38:10.781 --> 00:38:11.280
It's a hit.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.470
It's a success.

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:15.640
And so I was very
happy about that,

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:19.360
but I'd never faced recognition
before when I was working.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.962
Oh, once in awhile, maybe.

00:38:20.962 --> 00:38:22.712
But I had landed at
the airport, and there

00:38:22.712 --> 00:38:24.370
was these two little
kids, you know,

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.350
who come in and kind of
wipe your car sometimes.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:31.090
So they were looking at me,
and suddenly one of them says,

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:33.750
Are you the [NON-ENGLISH] girl?

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:34.460
I said, Yeah.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.260
Can we have an autograph?

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.800
And I was so thrilled--
signing an autograph

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.440
and somebody's recognized me.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.960
And I signed my name, and
I wrote Madhuri Dixit,

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.010
and I gave it to him.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:46.260
And he turns to the other
guy and says, [NON-ENGLISH].

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.850
So, yeah, that was the
first time I thought,

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:57.492
oh my goodness, I made it.

00:38:57.492 --> 00:38:58.200
AMIT SINGHAL: OK.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.710
Let's take the next
question over there.

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.177
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is Kanubria.

00:39:02.177 --> 00:39:03.260
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: Hello.

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:05.385
AUDIENCE: First of all, I
still feel I am dreaming.

00:39:05.385 --> 00:39:09.790
I cannot believe you are
watching me right now.

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:11.020
So I have two questions.

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.970
The first is about
Dance with Madhuri.

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:15.160
I've never danced
in my entire life,

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.000
and it's probably because
of that inhibition

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.720
that you were talking about.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.230
And that has grown
so much that I'm not

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:22.570
at all comfortable dancing.

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:25.660
So how would Dance with
Madhuri help, and what advice

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.190
do you have for people like me?

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:29.023
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE:
Well, Dance with Madhuri

00:39:29.023 --> 00:39:31.730
is something you can do in your
own time, in your own space.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:34.190
You could be in your own
room in front of a computer.

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:35.910
Nobody's watching you.

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:39.140
And it's just the teacher
in front of you and you.

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:42.300
And I think somewhere it'll
help you get away inhibitions,

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.460
because nobody's
watching you do that.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.756
And with Dance with Madhuri,
you can rewind it 20,000 times

00:39:47.756 --> 00:39:49.380
and see it again,
and again, and again,

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:51.334
which a school
doesn't afford you.

00:39:51.334 --> 00:39:53.750
Because once you go there, the
class is just for one hour.

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:56.430
You come home, and you
have to basically work

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:59.810
where your memory-- you know,
wherever your memory is good,

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:01.490
that's what you will remember.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:04.310
But with this, you can
practice in your own time,

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:05.320
in your own space.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:11.730
And every little lesson is
split into 15-seconders.

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:14.220
So they will teach you
step-by-step every little

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.010
thing.

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:17.269
And I think it'll be
easier to learn that way.

00:40:17.269 --> 00:40:17.810
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:19.370
AMIT SINGHAL: Let's take the
next question over there.

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:20.560
I'm keeping time.

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.640
I want lots of people
to ask questions.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:22.900
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.160
Thank you.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.240
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: I
hope that answers you.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:24.870
AUDIENCE: Yes, thank you.

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:25.960
AUDIENCE: Hi, Madhuri.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.220
You've got an enigmatic smile.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.920
You're a fantastic dancer and
definitely a fabulous artist.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.300
I mean, we're all graced here.

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.040
My question to Mr.
Nene is, you were

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.540
walking down the aisle with
the heartthrob of India, right?

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:41.730
All the men-- How many
letters and emails

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:44.600
did you get from all the men
from India, grabbing this lady?

00:40:46.837 --> 00:40:48.670
SHRIRAM NENE: I don't
remember much of that.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:51.570
It was my chief resident year
at UCLA in general surgery,

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.450
and we didn't get a
whole lot of sleep.

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:57.760
Fortunately, there was
a good PR core there.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.079
And they would protect me.

00:40:59.079 --> 00:41:00.620
But once in awhile
on rounds, someone

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.310
would surprise you
and say, hey, are you

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:03.900
this person or that person?

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.130
And that was new for me.

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:08.740
And so I didn't
really live in that.

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.640
I mean, we were
kind of insulated.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.011
Our agents everyone set up--

00:41:12.011 --> 00:41:14.510
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: He didn't
know what he was getting into.

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:15.468
SHRIRAM NENE: In short.

00:41:17.494 --> 00:41:18.660
SHRIRAM NENE: Next question.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.050
I'm sorry, I'll have to
make that the last question.

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:22.030
Over there.

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:24.030
AUDIENCE: Which-- Hi, Madhuri.

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:27.340
Apurna, biggest [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:31.400
Who among the following is the
best dancer according to you?

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:39.600
A, Hrithik Roshan, B, Salman
Khan, C, Govinda, D, Prabhu

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.192
Deva?

00:41:41.192 --> 00:41:44.210
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: Oh, my god.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:45.720
AMIT SINGHAL: [NON-ENGLISH].

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.110
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE: Yeah.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.620
The thing is that all of these
guys are such a good dancers,

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.850
but, of course, if you take
the whole, like package,

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:56.674
I would say-- No,
not in that sense.

00:41:56.674 --> 00:41:57.608
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:00.140
Wrong word to use.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.520
SHRIRAM NENE: Gotta be
careful around here.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:01.935
MADHURI DIXIT
NENE: Yeah, I know.

00:42:01.935 --> 00:42:03.180
I know.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:06.540
If you take the whole, uh,
personality and everything.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:08.395
I think that's a better word.

00:42:08.395 --> 00:42:09.520
It would be Hrithik Roshan.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.790
Because I think,
[WHISTLES AND CHEERS] yeah.

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:16.340
Because when he dances, it's
like, he just mesmerizes you.

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:20.090
SHRIRAM NENE: I would say
Prabhu Deva, by a long stretch.

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:21.280
He's like on fire.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.524
He has no bones,
literally, no bones.

00:42:23.524 --> 00:42:24.940
The guy can twist
and do anything.

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.440
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE:
Yeah, I remember

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.310
doing "Que Sera Sera" with him.

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:30.470
So that was quite a tough song.

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:32.730
AMIT SINGHAL: So,
I tell you a story.

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:35.870
Ram and I were hiking
for six days in Ladakh.

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:37.440
And six days are a long time.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.610
Periodically, we'll get bored.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:42.410
And whenever I got
bored, I made Ram

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:45.510
sing one of those Hindi
songs of hers, OK?

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:50.220
And with Ram's Hindi, I would
be entertained for hours.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.550
So Ram, would you
please do us the honor?

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:53.530
SHRIRAM NENE: No, no.

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:54.890
AMIT SINGHAL: Yes!

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:57.695
And we are going
[INAUDIBLE] for you, OK?

00:42:57.695 --> 00:43:00.805
All right, guys, let's give
Ram a big round of applause.

00:43:00.805 --> 00:43:03.230
Let's go!

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:05.548
SHRIRAM NENE: I don't know.

00:43:05.548 --> 00:43:06.507
So what are we singing?

00:43:06.507 --> 00:43:07.839
AMIT SINGHAL: Whatever you like.

00:43:07.839 --> 00:43:08.700
One of her songs.

00:43:12.502 --> 00:43:14.710
SHRIRAM NENE: Never fails
to put me on the spot here.

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:15.270
Last time--

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:21.480
AMIT SINGHAL:
[INAUDIBLE] is fine.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:24.280
SHRIRAM NENE: I really--
you know, I need, like,

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.390
karaoke and all the
other stuff to begin--

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:27.806
AMIT SINGHAL: Oh,
we can give you.

00:43:30.394 --> 00:43:31.060
Dinga-dong-ding.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:46.280
SHRIRAM NENE: [SINGING HINDI]

00:43:46.280 --> 00:44:01.907
MADHURI DIXIT NENE:
[SINGING HINDI]

00:44:01.907 --> 00:44:03.490
AMIT SINGHAL: All
right, guys, join me

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:07.125
in thanking Madhuri and Ram
for gracing us at Google today.

00:44:09.475 --> 00:44:11.100
MADHURI DIXIT-NENE:
Thank you, so much.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:11.920
Thank you, all of you.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.378
SHRIRAM NENE: An
absolute pleasure.

00:44:13.378 --> 00:44:14.590
Thank you.
