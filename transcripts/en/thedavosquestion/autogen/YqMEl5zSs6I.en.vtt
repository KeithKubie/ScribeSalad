some information to share here on

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020
some information to share here on
 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.750
some information to share here on
YouTube which is great we're here at the

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760
YouTube which is great we're here at the
 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.580
YouTube which is great we're here at the
World Economic Forum and one of the

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590
World Economic Forum and one of the
 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.160
World Economic Forum and one of the
challenges we face within 23 and me and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170
challenges we face within 23 and me and
 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.470
challenges we face within 23 and me and
also as a global problem is the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480
also as a global problem is the
 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.120
also as a global problem is the
patenting of the human genome and we're

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130
patenting of the human genome and we're
 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.710
patenting of the human genome and we're
really interested in hearing back from

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720
really interested in hearing back from
 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.080
really interested in hearing back from
the community about thoughts on how we

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090
the community about thoughts on how we
 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.080
the community about thoughts on how we
can get around this problem of creating

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090
can get around this problem of creating
 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.240
can get around this problem of creating
almost like a quilt or a patchwork of

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250
almost like a quilt or a patchwork of
 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.670
almost like a quilt or a patchwork of
ownership of new genome by companies

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680
ownership of new genome by companies
 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.429
ownership of new genome by companies
invite institutions universities we just

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439
invite institutions universities we just
 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.959
invite institutions universities we just
think this is untenable for the future

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969
think this is untenable for the future
 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.430
think this is untenable for the future
especially when we get to a point where

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440
especially when we get to a point where
 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.889
especially when we get to a point where
we can sequence the entire genome how on

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899
we can sequence the entire genome how on
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.450
we can sequence the entire genome how on
earth is someone going to get access to

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460
earth is someone going to get access to
 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.060
earth is someone going to get access to
all of their information if if it's all

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070
all of their information if if it's all
 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.819
all of their information if if it's all
of a patchwork and and people think they

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829
of a patchwork and and people think they
 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.069
of a patchwork and and people think they
claim ownership of the genome so we

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
claim ownership of the genome so we
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.380
claim ownership of the genome so we
would like to pose this question and our

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390
would like to pose this question and our
 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.479
would like to pose this question and our
position is that we don't think that

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489
position is that we don't think that
 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.520
position is that we don't think that
this is right that some company or

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530
this is right that some company or
 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.170
this is right that some company or
institution can own a piece of your

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
institution can own a piece of your
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.270
institution can own a piece of your
genome it's okay for them to make a drug

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280
genome it's okay for them to make a drug
 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.130
genome it's okay for them to make a drug
against a piece of the genome or to

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140
against a piece of the genome or to
 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.139
against a piece of the genome or to
innovate on the genomes but simply by

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149
innovate on the genomes but simply by
 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.700
innovate on the genomes but simply by
being able to read it and tell you what

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710
being able to read it and tell you what
 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.650
being able to read it and tell you what
that information means we think is it's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
that information means we think is it's
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.240
that information means we think is it's
just not the wave of the future and it's

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250
just not the wave of the future and it's
 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.469
just not the wave of the future and it's
really going to block innovation as

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
really going to block innovation as
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.870
really going to block innovation as
company so that's my challenge to all of

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880
company so that's my challenge to all of
 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.479
company so that's my challenge to all of
you Thanks
