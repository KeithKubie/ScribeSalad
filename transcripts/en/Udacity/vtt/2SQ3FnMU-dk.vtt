00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.673
Grant has recruited Athena, with all of her experience designing things, to

00:00:03.673 --> 00:00:08.600
create a new logo for the Gleaming Glasses company. It's going to have a pair

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.696
of glasses on it, of course, and Athena wants to make sure that the glasses are

00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:17.922
exactly symmetric. Now, she really likes the look of the function f of x equals

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:22.850
x to the 4th, what I have graphed right here. So, she's trying to figure out

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.936
how to use it to make the glasses. We need to figure out how to help Athena

00:00:26.936 --> 00:00:32.174
transform this function. Flip it over, move it from side to side, like this,

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:37.600
and also move it up and move it down. All these different kinds of

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.065
transformations are definitely going to be required for the design of this

00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:43.569
logo. Let's help her out.
