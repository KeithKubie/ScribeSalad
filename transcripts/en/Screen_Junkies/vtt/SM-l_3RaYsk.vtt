00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.130
With a franchise-ruining sequel slash reboot
on the horizon

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.420
It's time to celebrate the 30th anniversary
of the film you loved as a child of the 80's,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.100
Or the cartoon you loved as a child of the
90's,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.250
Or the theme song you sort of recognize as
a child of today:

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.130
"Who ya gonna call?"

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.860
GHOSTBUSTERS.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.199
Before Harold Ramis passed away,

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.660
Bill Murray became a professional party crasher,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.440
And Dan Aykroyd went batshit crazy,

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.160
"I don't think we will ever have a formal
relationship, a formal contact, with any alien

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.900
species out there. Especially after 9/11."

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.110
They were the Ghostbusters: old looking, out
of touch, out of shape nerds.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.729
"When we get to 20, tell me. I'm gonna throw
up."

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.860
Yep, this is what movie stars looked like
in '84, kids.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.460
When there's something strange in your neighborhood,
there's only one group of unlicensed heavily

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.370
armed, disgraced college professors you can
call:

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.000
The Ghostbusters.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.129
"Ghostbusters, what do ya want?"

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.500
There's Spengler. A nerd.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.129
"I collect spores, molds and fungus."

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.180
Ray. A nerd.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.570
"And if the ionization rate is constant for
all ectoplasmic entities, we could really

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.450
bust some heads -- in the spiritual sense,
of course."

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.120
Venkman. A borderline sexual predator.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.980
"Will you stay here in bed til I get back?"

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.500
And Winston. Who was supposed to be played
by Eddie Murphy, but got more or less written

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.790
out of the movie when he passed on the role.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.670
And eventually cropped out on home video,
too.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.200
When ghosts rise from the dead to haunt New
York, the Ghostbusters are the only thing

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.160
between the city and total chaos

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.880
Causing the media to run glowing profiles
of their successful business

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.190
Instead of the fact that GHOSTS EXIST AND
ARE HAUNTING NEW YORK!

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.580
But it's nothing the Ghostbusters can't
handle:

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.810
they've got the car,

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.020
The gadgets,

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.930
And the vaguely scientific know-how to put
evil in its place.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.870
"10 people witnessed a free-floating, full-torso,
vaporous apparition."

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.100
"Ectoplasmic residue!"

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.390
"Complete particle reversal!"

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.780
"Total protonic reversal."

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.050
"Focused, non-terminal repeating phantasm."

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.540
"Four fold cross-rip."

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.990
"You have been a participant in the biggest
interdimensional cross-rip since the Tunguska

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.920
Blast of 1909!"

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.780
"It felt great!"

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.319
I'm pretty sure he made half of that stuff
up.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.739
Slide down the firepole and into a PG-rated
movie that children loved, even though it's

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:18.269
full of

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.500
Cursing,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.800
"Oh sh*t."

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:21.780
"Sh*t."

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.060
"I have seen sh*t that'll turn you white!"

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.900
"What an a**hole."

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.349
"This man has no dick."

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.189
Casual smoking,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.189
Boob grabbing,

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.329
And ghost head.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.440
Whoa. Kid's movies were way better back
in the day.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.519
So grab your stick,

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:51.629
"Grab your stick!"

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:52.389
Heat em up,

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:53.329
"Heat em up!"

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.269
Make em hard,

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.209
"Make em hard!"

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.579
And don't cross the streams

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.049
"Don't cross the streams."

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.489
as the Ghostbusters take down the best snobs
the 80's had to offer

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.019
"You are a poor scientist, doctor."

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.280
"Exactly what are you a doctor of?"

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.540
"$5000? I had no idea it'd be so much. I won't
pay it."

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.620
And imprison hundreds of innocent creatures
who don't do much besides

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.889
Read,

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.159
Eat,

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.439
Drive,

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.159
And uhh...

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.840
Uh...

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.569
"I feel so funky"

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:27.260
Umm...

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.860
"I feel like the floor of a taxicab"

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.200
Let's say... Ooze?

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.860
Starring...

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.150
Bill You Murray Me?

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.569
Funny Dan Aykroyd

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.489
Egon But Not Forgotten

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.519
Sick Horny Weaver

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.439
80's Dick

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:45.400
Young Old Larry King

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.499
Flubber

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:47.999
Dark Helmet

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:49.510
David Bowie

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.840
Not Eddie Murphy

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.010
Fat Casper

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.999
The Dad from Family Matters?

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.760
And Ron Jeremy?!

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.349
Whoa, no way!

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.120
Ghostbusters.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.580
Kids, this was called a "library." It's
like a printout of Wikipedia where you have

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.500
to be quiet. 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.120
"Shhhhh!"
