00:00:00.248 --> 00:00:01.601
 On the work of Khan Academy 

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:03.982
 Let's practice several experiments. 

00:00:03.982 --> 00:00:05.780
 We have been collecting here 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.840
 we'll get round numbers. 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.080
 These numbers are exactly divisible by either 10 or 100. 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.700
 Now let's look at it here. We add 427 to 63, 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.628
 it may seem tough to you. 

00:00:18.628 --> 00:00:20.540
 At first glance, though we may be able to calculate and write them down, 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.940
 but I just took a few units from them, 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.420
 I'm adding another 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.920
 and in this case both are rounded numbers, 

00:00:26.348 --> 00:00:26.848
 If I get 3 units of 63, then 60 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.720
 and if I add that 3 units to 427, 

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:35.913
 I'll get 430 and 60 plus 430 

00:00:35.914 --> 00:00:37.551
 it is solved very simply. 

00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:39.292
 Now, let's see what this question is about us. 

00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:41.928
 This example shows us step by step 

00:00:41.928 --> 00:00:45.885
 and it asks us that there are 63 plus 427 examples 

00:00:45.886 --> 00:00:49.810
 (Plus 60 plus), plus 427? 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.586
 So, how many are actually 60 plus 

00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:53.838
 May be 63, 

00:00:53.838 --> 00:00:58.749
 There are 427 on both sides, 63 in this case plus 60 plus 3. 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:00.119
 We have already seen a result here. 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:02.267
 At the next stage, simply their order has changed. 

00:01:02.267 --> 00:01:05.366
 (Plus 60 plus three) plus 427 

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.366
 As a result 

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:11.131
 60 plus (three plus 427). 

00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:12.374
 So we have three figures 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.752
 From 63 to 427 we are adding. 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.240
 So, three plus 427 equals 430. 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.450
 Now, this collection operation has become easier. 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.109
 60 plus 430, we can count it in our brains. 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.291
 We're just adding six decimal places here, 

00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:31.470
 and we get 490, which is the result. 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.233
 Let's work with some examples. 

00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:38.192
 So we're here 

00:01:38.192 --> 00:01:40.189
 we will collect these two numbers. 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.567
 For this, take them 

00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:44.585
 round 

00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:46.128
 in this case, we 

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:50.640
 275 numbers are 270 and the total number of digits. 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.884
 This is plus 270 plus five. 

00:01:52.885 --> 00:01:54.243
 Look, the other part is the same, 

00:01:54.243 --> 00:01:57.551
 plus 595, plus 595 

00:01:57.552 --> 00:01:59.433
 Now, what are we doing for this? 

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:03.124
 If we bought five of 275 units and added up to 595 

00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:04.880
 just as we did now, 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.829
 595 will be 600. 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.229
 In this case, calculation becomes easier. 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.485
 Let's take a look again. Here's the first one 

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:13.271
 270 plus five and later plus 595 

00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:15.220
 but we can change the order here 

00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:18.880
 we are adding the first to five of 595 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.470
 then we add 270. 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.826
 This is the result 

00:02:21.826 --> 00:02:24.311
 270 plus five plus 595 equal to 600. 

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:27.608
 The whole purpose was bought from 275 to five units 

00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:30.800
 Adding to 595 was about 600. 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.940
 We can count it in our brains 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.440
 270 plus six hundred 

00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:39.200
 that is, multiplying by 100 six times, and ultimately the answer is 870. 

00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:42.602
 Let's work on a few more examples 

00:02:42.603 --> 00:02:43.799
 Fill empty field. 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.802
 51 plus 83 equals plus 84 

00:02:48.802 --> 00:02:51.959
 There are a total of 83 pieces here. 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.590
 in this case, we reduce the size of 51 units, 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.519
 resulting in 50 plus 84. 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.469
 Why should everyone know that? 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:01.688
 Why do they do it? 

00:03:01.688 --> 00:03:03.696
 Actually, I can easily figure this out, 

00:03:03.696 --> 00:03:04.927
 because I simply say 

00:03:04.927 --> 00:03:08.688
 eight plus nine plus four plus plus five others 

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:12.762
 this is 13 decimal and four loneliness or 134. 

00:03:12.763 --> 00:03:14.922
 This is easier for me. 

00:03:14.922 --> 00:03:17.325
 but the most important issue is if we have any number in one number 

00:03:17.325 --> 00:03:19.369
 If you add, you have to deduce the same number of numbers. 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.330
 This is the law of the place of assembly 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.312
 it is basically the same. When changing the place, the jam does not change. 

00:03:25.312 --> 00:03:27.700
 Let's make another example. 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.692
 138 plus 710 equal to plus 700 

00:03:32.693 --> 00:03:35.559
 It was 710, now it is 700 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:37.916
 we have 10 units of that number. 

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:39.738
 we have to add another number that we received. 

00:03:39.738 --> 00:03:42.745
 138 and more 10 

00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:45.380
 It is 148. 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.785
 What is the advantage of this? 

00:03:46.785 --> 00:03:49.454
 148 plus 700 operations in our brains, 

00:03:49.455 --> 00:03:53.420
 We get 848 responses to calculate this way 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.765
 it's easier than calculating here.
