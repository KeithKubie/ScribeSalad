[BEEP]

00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:06.570
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.440
EMILY: Hello, and welcome
to the latest episode

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.830
oh the Boring Show.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.790
MATT: Welcome.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.570
EMILY: So we have a
number of questions

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.030
that people have been posting,
and so we wanted to address

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.180
a couple of those first.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.430
MATT: Do they know who we are?

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.210
I guess we've been
on so many times.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.620
I'm Matt.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.750
EMILY: Hi, I'm Emily.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.422
It's the Matt and Emily show.

00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:27.630
What could possibly go wrong?

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.000
MATT: Are we building
a countdown app?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.390
EMILY: In one hour.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.121
MATT: OK, questions.

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:34.620
EMILY: Yes.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.790
MATT: OK.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.400
EMILY: All right,
so first, we get

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.320
people asking with
some frequency

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.240
where the code is located.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.300
It's on Philip's GitHub.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.600
It's Phillip H,
github.com/philiph,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.380
and then hn_app app for
the Hacker News app.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.440
People also keep
asking about when

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.020
is a Flutter channel happening.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.090
It is happening soon.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.050
This year.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.650
MATT: Yes.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.890
Keep your eyes open.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.720
It will be happening
in the near future.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.564
EMILY: Very soon.

00:01:06.564 --> 00:01:07.980
Would you like to
take a question?

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.530
MATT: Sure, fire
a question at me.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.190
EMILY: So Gill
McLorry asks about--

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.570
he wants to see more full-blown
e-commerce apps with Flutter.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.560
MATT: OK.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.430
So we have a couple
of sample apps,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.270
I think in /flutter/samples.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.350
One is Shrine 2.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.330
Is Shrine 2 there?

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.050
I think so.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.320
EMILY: I think so.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.460
MATT: OK.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.210
EMILY: Yeah it is.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.260
MATT: And that gives
an example of sort

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.760
of the basic framework for
having a collection of items

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.120
and adding it to
a shopping cart.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.020
Doesn't necessarily do all the
checkout and payment pieces.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.470
Philip also has his
state experiments,

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.550
demonstrated how to apply
different architectural styles

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.670
or different state management,
to a shopping cart sample.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.090
So that might be useful.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.580
And then I know recently
Square's released

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.200
their plug-ins for both physical
payments with the dongly

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.220
thing--

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.290
technical term, dongly thing--

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.900
and also their virtual
payments as well.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.160
So there's a few resources
to get you started.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.070
EMILY: Yeah, and I believe
Square has examples in there

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.620
plug-ins.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.360
So you can check those out
for actually making payments.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.850
MATT: Oh, and there's also
Andrew's Veggie Seasons

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.530
app, which isn't
necessarily e-commerce,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.950
but does have the concepts
of different items

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.100
and showing them in
lists in an iOS style.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.240
So that might be useful.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.530
EMILY: Yeah.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.320
So we're probably not going
to implement e-commerce

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.095
in our Hacker News app.

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:44.430
Unless we're charging--

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.300
MATT: We could sell dashes.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.380
EMILY: We could get some
money to our failing

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.770
internet journalism economy,
charge for articles.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.900
But yeah, maybe if we do
another app we'll work on that.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.910
Prasad Pankar asks about00
oh, this was in, I think,

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.860
two episodes back.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.110
Andrew was working
with the GDEs and they

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.630
had two buttons
in a row, and they

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.940
added a spacer between them.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.930
And someone was asking,
oh, what about the space

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.140
between parameter when
you put things in a row?

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.910
Is that better, or
should you use padding,

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.160
or should you use spacer?

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.160
I would say I think it
depends on the situation.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.687
So if you have just
two buttons, you

00:03:37.687 --> 00:03:39.420
can stick a spacer in there.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.560
Sure, whatever.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.190
If you have maybe five
buttons or something,

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.310
putting a spacer widget
in between gets annoying.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.220
And so I think that
space between parameter

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.910
would be perfect.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.060
I think just kind
of look at your code

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.090
and see if it
starts looking busy.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.000
MATT: And does spacer
do relative positioning

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.110
or actual positioning?

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.151
I haven't really used it.

00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:03.870
EMILY: I don't know.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.720
MATT: So space between
does relative positioning,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.470
so irrespective of
size or whatnot,

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.509
it will space them
appropriately.

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:12.300
But if you really want
to tweak your spaces

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.180
and you want to have
that precise control,

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.600
then spacers or how you size
box a lot between things,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.830
and there's padding as well.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.480
So there's a bunch
of different ways

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.490
you can do spacing in Flutter.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.670
And it really depends on
the situation and also

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.550
your preference.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.050
EMILY: Yeah.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.110
So I would say, in summary,
just try and look at the code

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.690
and see what looks cleanest.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.970
That's kind of the main thing.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.320
People also keep asking
about Google Maps in Flutter.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.080
First of all, there
is a plug-in that's

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.720
created by the Flutter team
for Google Maps in Footer.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.810
It is currently in
developer preview,

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.855
and we're working hard
on getting that out

00:04:58.855 --> 00:04:59.730
of developer preview.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.630
So expect a demo on
that soon as well.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.500
MATT: Warning on--
you can use it now

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.680
and it works really well.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.310
But that API will break.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.640
EMILY: It will change.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.140
MATT: Sorry.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.390
EMILY: It will work right now.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.680
MATT: It will work right
now, but the API will change

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.691
and thus will, if you
use the current API,

00:05:17.691 --> 00:05:19.690
you will need to update
your code in the future,

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.610
because we're ensuring
that that API elegantly

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.724
fits with Flutter widget style.

00:05:26.724 --> 00:05:28.390
So we're still iterating
on that to make

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.840
sure we give a, hopefully, what
we consider to be a really good

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.020
experience through the SDK.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.870
So if you use it now,
bear in mind you're

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.870
going to be going back to
change your code somewhat

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.290
in the future when you
upgrade to the latest version.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.230
EMILY: I will say, though,
thanks to pub specs

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.010
and versioning, if you leave it
at the version that you're at--

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.760
MATT: That's true.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.760
EMILY: --it won't break.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.810
So you could keep--

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.116
yeah, your code can
stay consistent,

00:05:55.116 --> 00:05:56.740
but there will be a
new version coming.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.406
And if you want the
latest and greatest,

00:05:58.406 --> 00:06:00.280
it will change a little bit.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.380
And let's do one last question.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.120
MATT: OK, one last question.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:11.050
EMILY: So Em Feinstein was
asking about view models

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.850
interventions.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.660
If you want to--

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.090
He was saying he'd never heard
of view models in context

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.750
of Flutter.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.820
And so where do you use
it and what does it--

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.760
MATT: View models is a
reasonably abstract concept.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.950
And it can be applied to Flutter
or not applied to Flutter.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.380
There is a good example
that I saw out there.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.950
Somebody wrote an article
about using Flutter in Redux.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.950
And what they did
was, after they

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.910
did the transform on
the store for the data,

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.910
they applied a view model
to make the data that didn't

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.650
necessarily fit elegantly
with how their widgets were

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.849
rendering, they transformed
it into a view model,

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:56.140
which then much more elegantly
fit how their UI looked.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:04.134
So it was a nice way of
basically adapting your data so

00:07:04.134 --> 00:07:05.800
that you didn't have
to do a lot of data

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.080
manipulation inside your code
for your widget tree itself.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.520
So it wasn't necessary
by any means.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.500
But for making your code maybe
that little bit more readable

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.420
or whatnot, it made sense.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.650
If you've got simple
data, maybe it doesn't.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.310
But if you've got a very
complex, mungy set of data

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.450
coming back from, whether
you're using a block in a stream

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.937
or you're using
scope model or Redux,

00:07:30.937 --> 00:07:32.770
having to transform
that data into something

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.670
that fits your front end,
yeah, that would seem to work.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:37.570
EMILY: Yeah.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.370
The way I would think about
it is your view model--

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.070
so maybe you've got
this complex model

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.630
on the back end
of all this stuff,

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.940
and it's just the basic
concept of encapsulation.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.900
So maybe you don't want
to expose all of that

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.610
to all of your widgets.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.920
You only want to
expose a part of it.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.450
So you put a little view--

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:04.455
it's just your API of what
you're showing to your widgets

00:08:04.455 --> 00:08:04.955
to display.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.190
To what Matt was
saying, I believe

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:17.080
that terminology is also used
in Brian Egan's Flutter Redux

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.450
package as well,
so check it out.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:21.502
MATT: Yep.

00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:22.210
EMILY: All right.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:22.709
MATT: Good.

00:08:22.709 --> 00:08:23.369
OK, so--

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:24.160
EMILY: Coding time.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:24.910
MATT: Coding time.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.050
What are we coding today?

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.220
What is the plan.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:32.820
EMILY: So we're back
on the Hacker News app,

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.980
and the goal today is
accomplish two things.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.669
MATT: Two things.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.210
EMILY: So we're going
to show incorporating

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.610
web views into our
Hacker News app,

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.230
because when I'm
clicking through it,

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:49.390
it's kind of annoying that it
keeps opening into, say, Chrome

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.910
or whenever my
mobile browser is,

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.310
and I have to switch back
and forth from app to app.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:57.010
So it would be nice to just
have a web view of that.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:01.100
And then also people have been
asking about scroll position.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.070
So we're going to--

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.280
so that when you switch between
the two tabs you can preserve

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.540
where you've scrolled .

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.560
So we will get into that too.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.660
MATT: Sounds good.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.740
EMILY: What could
possibly go wrong?

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.090
MATT: You're going to find out.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.600
OK, so how are we
going to kick off?

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.210
What's the first thing
we're going to do.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.774
EMILY: Well, would
you like to code?

00:09:21.774 --> 00:09:22.690
MATT: I guess I would.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:23.720
I love to code.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.450
You know me.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.350
I might even balance my
brackets correctly this time.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.560
Wouldn't that be adorable?

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.230
OK, so what have we got here?

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.420
We've got the Hacker
News app running,

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.350
and I've got it in
my iOS simulator.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:42.850
And when I click on
one of these, I can--

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:47.500
boink-- and so this is
taking me out to probably

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.700
Safari's version of a
non-address-viewable--

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.090
what's it when you don't
have the address bar?

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.810
An address bar-less Safari view.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.376
Wow, that took a lot more
effort than it should have done.

00:10:04.376 --> 00:10:05.875
And so I can see
it and that's fine.

00:10:05.875 --> 00:10:07.130
And I can go back
and I have done,

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.546
but that's not
using the web view.

00:10:08.546 --> 00:10:09.770
EMILY: And that's actually--

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.500
I will say, so I was
plunking around with Android

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.520
and that experience
is better on iOS.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.155
MATT: So there's a trick
to hiding the thing.

00:10:19.155 --> 00:10:20.030
So let's take a look.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.735
In here, we have--

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:26.880
here we go.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.190
So this here, we're using
the URL launch package.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.390
EMILY: Yep.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.300
MATT: And here is where--
let me get rid of this.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.560
There we go.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.000
Here is where
we're launching it.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.740
So what you can do, if you take
a look, is this actually has--

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.600
if I have autocomplete working--

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.707
it has force Safari web view.

00:10:47.707 --> 00:10:48.290
EMILY: Mm-hmm.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.570
MATT: And it also has--

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.980
whoops-- it has force web view.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.300
So let's just take
a look at the--

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.770
let's take a look at these.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.070
So force Safari
web you is for iOS.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.280
And this will either launch
Safari in full-blown Safari

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:04.890
or not--

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.806
and we can play around
with that in a second--

00:11:06.806 --> 00:11:09.950
and this force web view does
the same thing for Android.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.080
So you can get it to hide.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:17.490
So if I come in here and
I went force Safari VC,

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:24.330
let's make that true, save.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.760
Let's see do I
need to hard reload

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.218
or do we need to
do a full restart?

00:11:27.218 --> 00:11:30.610
OK, so that's probably
the way it normally is.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:31.980
OK, that's fine.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:39.960
Let's make it false and
we'll do the same thing.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.980
We have to do a hard
restart on that one.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:49.030
So let's hard restart
this and take a look.

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:50.850
This is how we're
starting, here we go.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.034
That's the same as before.

00:11:52.034 --> 00:11:53.700
This is where it's
going to embarrass me

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.800
by doing the same thing
every single time.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.890
EMILY: If that's true, we're
going to expect to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.015
MATT: I'm hoping it's going
to be like, big reveal.

00:12:01.015 --> 00:12:04.770
There's this there something.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.250
OK, well, not really.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:12.210
What that lets you play with,
again, going back to it,

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:20.550
is this opens web URLs in
Safari container versus view

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.490
controller versus
full-screen Safari.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.094
That's what should happen.

00:12:25.094 --> 00:12:27.510
But at the moment, it doesn't
seem to quite be doing that.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.260
So if you want--

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.270
EMILY: Do you think
it's something

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.010
because we're using an emulator?

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.920
MATT: Oh, it might be.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.850
But if you want to do that on--

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.410
EMILY: Would you want to--

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.980
I don't know if you want
to pull up a Android.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.284
Actually, you keep talking.

00:12:44.284 --> 00:12:45.200
I'm going to pull up--

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.890
try and do it on the
Android and see if I--

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.306
MATT: Well, let's see if we
can get it working in Android.

00:12:49.306 --> 00:12:52.704
So let Emily pull
up hers, and we

00:12:52.704 --> 00:12:54.120
were going to jump
into web views,

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.946
but we'll stick with URL
launch for the time being.

00:12:55.946 --> 00:12:57.550
EMILY: No, you can keep
going onto web views.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.060
I'm just going to play around
with this, because I'm curious

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.470
what we're supposed to see.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:06.890
MATT: So try force web view and
see what you get on that side.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:10.510
Right, I'm going to keep
going on the web view.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.140
So what we want
to do is, instead

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.520
of having the full
screen view controller,

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.530
we want to be able to
use a widget, a web view

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:25.090
widget, which will allow
us to embed the panel,

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.550
or the widget that's showing--

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:30.870
or create a widget that will
let us see the full web view.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.050
And then that-- for a
full screen thing you'd

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.410
ask why we'd want to do that.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.200
Well, it will let us
do a bunch of things.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.950
Predominantly, we can
treat it as a widget

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.830
and we can put other
widgets in the page.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.599
We can overlay
widgets on top of it.

00:13:42.599 --> 00:13:44.640
So let's take a look at
what we want to do there.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.306
The first thing we want to do is
we need to include the package.

00:13:47.306 --> 00:13:51.540
So the package for web view
is, we're going to go in here.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.280
And let's go over to--

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.130
EMILY: See here?

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.290
Sorry.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.490
When I do it on Android, it
asks which browser do you

00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:59.860
want to open it on?

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:05.910
And so then I'm like, let's
say just once, but then--

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.100
OK, thank you, Chrome.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.460
No!

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.360
OK, so you got this.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:11.560
But--

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.726
MATT: So you've got full-blown
Chrome at that point.

00:14:13.726 --> 00:14:16.560
EMILY: Yeah, but then you
have to literally swap.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.144
I haven't added your
thing, but that's

00:14:18.144 --> 00:14:20.643
why I was like, that's why you
actually want to add webview.

00:14:20.643 --> 00:14:21.240
I'm not--

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.198
MATT: That's also true.

00:14:22.198 --> 00:14:26.738
EMILY: I'm not sure why on iOS
it's just already more awesome.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:30.545
MATT: No comment.

00:14:30.545 --> 00:14:33.419
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:33.419 --> 00:14:34.460
EMILY: OK, sorry, please.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.000
I'm going to try this
forced web view thing.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.270
MATT: OK.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:36.978
What was I doing?

00:14:36.978 --> 00:14:39.844
I was going to Flutter packages,
and I am going to pull up our--

00:14:39.844 --> 00:14:41.010
EMILY: The web view package.

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.270
MATT: The web view package.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.300
EMILY: And I think it's called--

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.300
MATT: Flutter a view.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.250
No, it's not that one.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.570
EMILY: So here's a
little trick thing.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.680
There are two web view packages.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.400
There's a community
one and then the one

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.390
that is provided by
the Flutter team.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.870
And I believe that the
community one is actually

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:03.570
planning on redirecting to the
main one once the main one is--

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.790
this is also in developer
preview, I will say,

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:09.000
but it's pretty darn stable.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.020
And the Flutter team one
has a couple other features

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:16.440
that we can get into later that
the community one does not yet.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.160
MATT: Absolutely.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:23.040
So the one we're looking
for is the web view Flutter.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.140
And obviously, we're
fairly far down

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.207
the versioning at
the moment, 0.1.2,

00:15:27.207 --> 00:15:28.540
but we're going to use this one.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.310
So I'm going to take
webview_Flutter,

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.330
going to go back
to my dependencies,

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.140
and I don't need that.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:39.100
Let's pop it in here.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:45.400
And I am going to
put in the version,

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.010
and then that's going to go
and pull down a bunch of stuff.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.120
So there we go.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.545
So I'm going to go
back to my code.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:16:00.320
And what I'm going to do--
so we have the launch here.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.020
So what I'm going to do is let
me create a new widget that's

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:09.400
going to represent the new
page that we're going to go to.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.926
So I'm going to go
all the way to go--

00:16:11.926 --> 00:16:14.650
OK, so let's just
go to the bottom.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:18.670
And I am going to create
a stateless widget,

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.215
and I'm going to call this--

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.910
EMILY: Full page web view.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:25.619
MATT: Full page--

00:16:25.619 --> 00:16:26.535
EMILY: How does that--

00:16:26.535 --> 00:16:27.640
MATT: Hacker News page--

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.460
Hacker News--

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.470
EMILY: Article.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.690
MATT: Oh, you know, OK,
I'm going to call it

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.582
Hacker News web page.

00:16:38.582 --> 00:16:39.640
That's a terrible name.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.570
I'll change it in a second.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.028
So what I'm going to do here
is, I'm going to do the usual.

00:16:44.028 --> 00:16:45.710
I'm going to need a
scaffold because I'm

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:46.420
going to a new page.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.003
I don't need a
scaffold, but I'm going

00:16:48.003 --> 00:16:50.490
to use a scaffold, because
it's going to make things nice.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:51.490
EMILY: For the record--

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:55.480
sorry, this forced web view,
I'm not seeing any difference.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.115
MATT: Really?

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:57.740
Because I played
around with it before.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:02.380
And it would give
you, basically,

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.430
a full-blown web browser.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.931
It would hide the address bar.

00:17:05.931 --> 00:17:06.680
EMILY: That thing?

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.180
MATT: Yeah.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.106
EMILY: Huh.

00:17:08.106 --> 00:17:10.480
MATT: The interface has changed
in that, or maybe I was--

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.510
I-- maybe--

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.420
EMILY: I don't know.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.990
MATT: It's like that.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.539
EMILY: Sorry.

00:17:14.539 --> 00:17:15.099
MATT: No worries.

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:15.800
EMILY: Continue.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.119
MATT: OK, so what am I doing?

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.035
I'm adding an app bar.

00:17:18.035 --> 00:17:19.042
Isn't that exciting?

00:17:19.042 --> 00:17:20.500
Now we're just
going to call this--

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:27.774
let's just title
this up, uh, just

00:17:27.774 --> 00:17:29.950
call it web page for the moment.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:35.550
Of course that needs
to be a widget.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.725
OK, there we go.

00:17:36.725 --> 00:17:37.350
So that's good.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:41.100
So now in the body of this,
what we're going to put in

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.490
is-- well, what do we have now?

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.390
So we have--

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.690
I bet we have something
like this, which

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:51.000
means that I can go in and--

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.824
EMILY: Is it-- did
you do packages get?

00:17:53.824 --> 00:17:54.990
MATT: I did do packages get.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.840
Let's just double check
the name of this--

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.320
EMILY: [INAUDIBLE]
looks like it's red.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.170
Is that normal?

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.380
MATT: Yeah.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.350
I do the fancy material.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.800
EMILY: Did you import it?

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.175
MATT: I'm trying to get it to
import, but unfortunately--

00:18:08.175 --> 00:18:09.930
EMILY: Oh, the auto import.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.650
MATT: Auto import's not working.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:19.750
So import package, Websocket
channel is not what I want.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.167
EMILY: That'd be Flutter.

00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:21.750
MATT: Flutter.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:22.583
EMILY: There you go.

00:18:25.015 --> 00:18:27.624
MATT: And we're going to come
down here and, OK, great.

00:18:27.624 --> 00:18:28.540
So we have a web view.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.748
So what does a web view take?

00:18:29.748 --> 00:18:31.510
Well, web view takes
a bunch of things.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.920
But there's a nice
handy initial URL.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:39.300
Initial URL, and that's
going to take, let's just--

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.470
EMILY: Oh, it's just
a straight, it's

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.710
not a-- it's just parameter.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.790
MATT: Oh, it's parameter.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.610
Not enough coffee in the world.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:52.836
Let's take that out of it.

00:18:52.836 --> 00:18:54.210
So this is going
to build a page.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:19:00.060
It's going to have a web bar
and it's going to have web view.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.020
EMILY: Very exciting.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.270
MATT: Super exciting.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.680
Let's modify it a
bit and call this--

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.470
Philip's totally going
to rename it something.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.800
EMILY: That's what
[INAUDIBLE] for.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.970
MATT: Exactly.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.650
Next time, fix Matt's
terrible naming system.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:16.140
I'm going to pass the URL--

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:21.460
final string URL-- and
we can make use of that

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.830
once we have that going.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:29.410
So let's go back to launcher.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:35.260
And so what we want to do here
now is, we have the result

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.490
and can launch, so let's
just take this out of time.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.520
What we're going to
do is we are here,

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.460
we've got our [INAUDIBLE]
pressed, we've got our result.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:55.480
So if our result is
not equal to null,

00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:00.620
then we are going
to push a new page.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.410
So we are going to do--

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.020
EMILY: Material page route--

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.030
or navigator.push.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.240
MATT: Navigator.push.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.390
So we've got to get
navigator.of from our context,

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:11.710
if I remember correctly.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.290
EMILY: Actually, fun fact,
you can do navigator.push

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.350
and pass in context,
or navigator.of context

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:18.140
and then push.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.473
MATT: All right, let's try that.

00:20:19.473 --> 00:20:21.400
So let's do navigator.push.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.180
Never tried this.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.050
Cool.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:26.790
And so you say we can
probably take context.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.630
That actually makes it
look a little tidier.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.630
EMILY: Yeah, I feel
like just fewer things.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.355
I think it's just a--

00:20:33.355 --> 00:20:34.480
it's not a named parameter.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.271
MATT: Oh, it isn't?

00:20:35.271 --> 00:20:37.094
EMILY: It's like [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:37.094 --> 00:20:38.260
I guess they didn't do that.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.676
MATT: And then
we're going to have

00:20:39.676 --> 00:20:43.240
to have a material page root.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.495
Material page root takes a--

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:46.120
EMILY: Builder.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.070
MATT: Builder.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.200
OK.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.480
EMILY: That takes
a context, I think.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.610
MATT: That takes a
builder, which takes a--

00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:59.090
EMILY: Little context.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:20:59.590
And then--

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:05.500
MATT: Context, which then is
going to return a-- and we

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.340
called it--

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.690
sorry, I called it--

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:12.250
Hacker News, best web
page ever, longest name.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.800
And we couldn't go result dot--

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.440
is the URL in here somewhere?

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.270
I think there is--

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:22.960
URL, comma--

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.580
EMILY: Dun dun dun.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.620
MATT: And it-- wait, not comma.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.160
There you go, that
looks slightly nicer.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.406
OK, so let's go down
the bottom and let's

00:21:31.406 --> 00:21:34.030
actually use that URL because I
don't think we need to do this,

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:38.690
because clearly code
works first time.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.270
OK, so we've got this.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.900
I'm going to do a hard
restart, just 'cause.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.860
I munch about the roots,
probably not necessary.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.266
That's going to
go pull this down.

00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:50.890
Start with a website,
not a mobile app.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:51.770
Well, let's pick
up the next one.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:52.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.654
EMILY: How appropriate?

00:21:54.654 --> 00:21:57.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:01.420
MATT: And then when we
click on this, it does that.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.308
EMILY: What what?

00:22:02.308 --> 00:22:02.974
MATT: What what?

00:22:02.974 --> 00:22:04.115
Yeah, what, what exactly.

00:22:04.115 --> 00:22:06.327
EMILY: That's not a nav bar.

00:22:06.327 --> 00:22:07.160
MATT: Wait a second.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.010
That's-- I commented out.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:09.910
EMILY: Yeah.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:10.870
MATT: Launch.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.860
Is that why my thing
wasn't working properly?

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.250
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.607
EMILY: What?

00:22:16.607 --> 00:22:18.190
MATT: Oh, that's
from the icon button.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:19.480
What did I change?

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.290
Two places.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.530
EMILY: Oh jeez.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.200
Maybe I was in the
wrong place too.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.450
MATT: This tile text--

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:26.170
where is this?

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.910
Oh, this is the-- am I
in the wrong list view?

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:29.201
Because there's two list views.

00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:30.430
EMILY: No results.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:31.090
Oh my gosh.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:33.440
MATT: This is from
new stories, I bet.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.734
Is it?

00:22:34.734 --> 00:22:36.150
EMILY: I thought
we had just one--

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:37.910
MATT: It's the same one.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:38.850
OK.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.894
EMILY: This suggests
it's time for a refactor.

00:22:41.894 --> 00:22:44.060
MATT: I'm going to go and
I'm going to cut and paste

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.960
my code to that other place.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.710
EMILY: I'm going to
look up and figure out

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:48.850
why we have two launches.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:51.000
MATT: OK.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.690
All right, so I'm
going to take this

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:57.250
and then I am going
to go find here,

00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:06.002
icons.launch, and so we're going
to take this individual out

00:23:06.002 --> 00:23:09.040
and we're going to pop this in.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.470
We don't need our if
statement anymore.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.780
EMILY: There is a build results
method that is not called.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.410
MATT: OK, refactor time.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:21.190
And here we have article.URL.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.850
Let's save that.

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:26.140
EMILY: This is why we
should have code reviews.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.390
MATT: This is why I should
have read the code before I

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:29.980
started writing this.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.260
EMILY: Both of us.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.080
MATT: OK, so let's
see what happens now.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.654
And I go here and, oh, look,
I have a platform exception.

00:23:38.654 --> 00:23:40.070
I'm trying to
create a [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.200
an unregistered type.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:41.950
Aha.

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:45.040
So, the first thing
that we should note

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.740
is there's an extra step that
you need to take at the moment

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.470
when you're doing iOS with
web use and not Android.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:54.370
And if you're not like me
and actually read the readme,

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:55.000
it says--

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.470
EMILY: I didn't read the readme.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:01.297
MATT: --we need to put
into the p info list--

00:24:01.297 --> 00:24:03.130
it would have been handy
if we just actually

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:07.180
had the XML that I
could cut and paste in.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.190
EMILY: Yeah.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:09.230
I actually--

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.980
MATT: That's fine.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.230
We can-- that's easy.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:16.120
So what I need to do is
I need to go into here

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.980
and do some munging.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.660
We'll just let that crash out.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.302
Oh, it's a web page.

00:24:22.302 --> 00:24:23.260
EMILY: But there's no--

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.884
MATT: Yeah, no, it's
because the system

00:24:24.884 --> 00:24:29.799
itself barfed at that point
because I unpaused the thing.

00:24:29.799 --> 00:24:30.465
So where are we?

00:24:30.465 --> 00:24:32.530
EMILY: Oh, because it crashed.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:33.030
MATT: Yeah.

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:34.240
EMILY: Got it.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.670
MATT: We are runner--

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:37.170
EMILY: Yeah.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.850
So we're going-- this
is a step only for iOS

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.240
because Android doesn't
have the view listing.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.560
And again, this should
go away when we're

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.290
outside of developer preview.

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:50.140
MATT: Yeah so I'm
going to need a key,

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.885
and my key is going to be this.

00:24:52.885 --> 00:24:55.010
EMILY: I have my Flutter
[INAUDIBLE] views preview.

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:01.265
MATT: And we're going to
have, if I remember correctly,

00:25:01.265 --> 00:25:01.875
a string.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.850
EMILY: If you curate, yeah.

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:08.330
I'm pretty sure I did that.

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:12.130
MATT: Today on the Boring
Show, we write XML.

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:13.642
EMILY: Matt's favorite.

00:25:13.642 --> 00:25:14.350
MATT: Yes, it is.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.230
I love XML.

00:25:18.972 --> 00:25:21.160
I'm crying on the inside.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.590
EMILY: Send Matt all
your XML questions.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.645
He'll gladly answer them.

00:25:25.645 --> 00:25:26.767
MATT: Please don't.

00:25:26.767 --> 00:25:28.850
I don't know if that should
be capitalized or not.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:29.497
We'll find out.

00:25:29.497 --> 00:25:31.080
EMILY: It's all caps,
I'm pretty sure.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.312
MATT: So because
I've changed my iOS,

00:25:34.312 --> 00:25:35.645
I'm going to rebuild everything.

00:25:35.645 --> 00:25:36.145
EMILY: Yeah.

00:25:36.145 --> 00:25:37.729
MATT: Because what
you change on that,

00:25:37.729 --> 00:25:39.728
it's not going to pick
it up because we're going

00:25:39.728 --> 00:25:41.390
to have to rebuild in effect.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.580
EMILY: We're outside
of the Flutter world,

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.100
so hot reload, all bets are off.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.487
MATT: And I'm going to
just be on the safe side

00:25:48.487 --> 00:25:50.320
and I'm going to wipe
out my build because--

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.696
EMILY: I don't normally do it.

00:25:52.696 --> 00:25:54.570
MATT: I've been bitten
by that once or twice.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.790
And I'm going to
start running again.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:57.290
OK.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.649
EMILY: Did you delete
the other method?

00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:01.940
MATT: Did I delete-- which one?

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.980
EMILY: Sorry, the one that was--

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.790
build results or
something that--

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:06.670
yeah, build results.

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.969
You can delete that
as far as I can tell.

00:26:08.969 --> 00:26:10.760
MATT: I'll delete it
once I see it working.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.470
And then if it stops working
[INAUDIBLE] deleted it.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.860
Can you tell I'm
slightly paranoid?

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:20.240
OK, so this is going to take
a few seconds to fire up.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.940
I'm going to take a look
at that URL launcher thing

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:23.900
after the show.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.064
And the next time we have a
show, we're going to clarify.

00:26:27.064 --> 00:26:29.480
EMILY: I suspect it might be
because we were both changing

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.629
it in the wrong function.

00:26:31.629 --> 00:26:33.920
MATT: We were changing it in
the wrong function, that's

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:34.754
very true.

00:26:34.754 --> 00:26:37.170
But I'm not going to go back
and waste another 15 minutes.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:37.990
EMILY: No, agreed.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:39.180
I don't think--
we're not going to--

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:39.680
MATT: OK.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.960
EMILY: Yay!

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.950
MATT: There we go.

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.860
Never been so excited about
bringing up a web page.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:49.610
That's good.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:52.310
OK, look, it does the
scrolly scrolly thing.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.580
It does the navigation
navigation thing.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.940
EMILY: Oh, so I think
you should show them

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.670
one other little quick thing.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:01.460
So this is just like
any other widget.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.580
So you can stick
other Flutter widgets

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:05.920
on top of it or something.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.590
You want to just like throw
in a floating action bar,

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.390
just for fun?

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.630
MATT: I'm just going to throw
in a floating action bar button.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.070
I can throw in a
floating action--

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:14.420
action bar.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.475
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:16.475 --> 00:27:17.870
EMILY: It can be useless.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:20.660
MATT: Like I said, not
enough coffee in the world.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.790
EMILY: Just to prove
that it's a widget.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:25.040
MATT: This is nice, because
I've created a new widget,

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.456
so I can do what
I like down here.

00:27:26.456 --> 00:27:29.830
So I'm going to, in effect, I
can probably stay on that page.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:30.330
EMILY: Yeah.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.070
MATT: So let's just
fire up that page again.

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.320
EMILY: Hot reload for the win.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.590
MATT: This should
be a different page,

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:37.070
but yeah, it's
doing webby things.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.700
EMILY: Would now be a good
time to talk about JavaScript?

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:48.590
So with web view you can
activate or deactivate--

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.975
or enable JavaScript.

00:27:49.975 --> 00:27:52.100
MATT: You can see your
JavaScript mode is currently

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:52.910
disabled.

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:54.740
EMILY: Yes, so by
default it's disabled.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:59.720
And I got an email from Amir,
who created the web view

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.650
plug-in literally last
night, and there's

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:07.010
going to be breaking change
with the name of that variable.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:10.070
It's going to be lowercase
s, so JavaScript mode.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:11.420
But right now--

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.680
MATT: We have a typo to fix.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.756
So yes, your idea will hopefully
give you the right thing.

00:28:16.756 --> 00:28:18.130
EMILY: It should
be pretty close.

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:18.925
You can figure it out.

00:28:18.925 --> 00:28:19.725
MATT: What is this going to do?

00:28:19.725 --> 00:28:20.600
Is this going to be--

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.710
EMILY: It's ena--

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:24.462
MATT: JavaScript mode.enabled.

00:28:24.462 --> 00:28:26.170
And I'm assuming he's
going to fix that--

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.072
EMILY: Unrestricted.

00:28:28.072 --> 00:28:30.030
MATT: So that'll probably
change as well, then.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.960
EMILY: Yeah.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.940
MATT: OK, so let's save that up.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.660
I'll probably need
to re-navigate.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:43.700
Yay.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.026
Now I'm just unrestricted
run JavaScript.

00:28:46.026 --> 00:28:46.900
Nothing can go wrong.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.512
EMILY: Right?

00:28:47.512 --> 00:28:48.470
MATT: What was I doing?

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:49.880
You wanted a
floating action bar.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.040
I'm going to go--

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:57.790
stateless [INAUDIBLE]
widget, floating action bar.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:59.300
EMILY: Oh, just
stick it in this--

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.220
MATT: It's a joke.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.755
It's a joke.

00:29:01.755 --> 00:29:03.880
We're just going to write
a floating action button.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.213
It's going to float, do actions.

00:29:05.213 --> 00:29:06.680
It's going to be great.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.370
EMILY: Do it.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.703
MATT: All right, I'm just
going to put a floating action

00:29:09.703 --> 00:29:11.330
button in here.

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:17.170
Floating action
button takes a child.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:17.930
EMILY: Yeah.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.220
MATT: And that's
going to be an icon.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:20.780
Like this.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:21.279
EMILY: Sure.

00:29:21.279 --> 00:29:22.030
Yeah.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:25.160
MATT: And this is going to be--

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.110
EMILY: I think there's
a icons.favorite.

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:29.160
Yeah.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:29.660
Heart.

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:33.420
MATT: Icons.favorite.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.683
EMILY: I think it'll appear
even if we don't have it--

00:29:35.683 --> 00:29:36.266
MATT: Oh look.

00:29:36.266 --> 00:29:37.120
EMILY: Look at that.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.820
So yeah, right now pressing
it doesn't do anything.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:43.690
But this is just to
prove that you can

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:44.942
stack any other thing on it.

00:29:44.942 --> 00:29:45.650
MATT: Well, look.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:48.060
It's just like-- it's
got a little shadow there

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.940
because I put the unpressed in.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.450
And we can put other things.

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.090
Like, basically, this
is just a widget.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:55.580
EMILY: Yeah.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.970
But right now I think
it's probably not useful.

00:29:57.970 --> 00:29:59.880
So we can take it out.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.770
MATT: This is
probably not useful.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.350
So we will take it out.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:06.270
And there we go.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:07.260
Got it.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.770
So this is nice, but this is
fairly coarse-grained, just

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:12.260
full web page view.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:18.540
So wouldn't it be nice if we
had a preview screen, perhaps?

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.890
EMILY: That would be nice.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:22.230
Maybe I could implement it.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.130
MATT: Maybe you
could implement it.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:24.870
Do you want me to push
this, or should we just--

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:26.150
OK, I'll push this change.

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:27.580
EMILY: Or I mean, actually--

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.789
I could just go.

00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:29.830
MATT: I'm going to push--

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.200
EMILY: No, you push so I'll
have the imports and everything.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.033
MATT: Oh yeah, you can
have all the imports.

00:30:34.033 --> 00:30:36.030
Also Phillip will
start weeping when

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:38.460
he sees Hacker News web
page, the page, you know,

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.620
app suddenly appear.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.840
So where am I?

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.765
Master plus four.

00:30:47.511 --> 00:30:49.260
Why don't you talk a
little bit about what

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.480
you're going to do while
I do boring push things.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:57.420
EMILY: Yes, so I will
make a little preview,

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.250
because I don't
know, sometimes I

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.350
read the links on
the Hacker News app

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:02.880
and I'm like, what is that?

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.560
Do I want to click
on it to read more?

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.310
I don't know.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:10.770
So we can put a little
web view to see if we

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.370
want to read the full thing.

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:19.890
And so this is probably not
the best use of web view,

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:25.890
but I just want to show it
to show another way of how

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:30.690
you can corporate web use into
the rest of your Flutter app.

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:33.480
And there's a interesting
thing that's going to happen.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:41.430
So the list view is scrollable,
and your web view is also

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:45.880
scrollable, but you want to be
able to scroll that little web

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:51.060
view preview when
you are also doing--

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:54.090
so that you can
preview that page.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:57.120
So there's a
parameter on web view

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.880
that's like a
gesture recognizer.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:05.940
And you can use it to capture
any gestures for that web view.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.100
For example, if I scroll
in the web view part,

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.830
it'll scroll that, but if I
scroll outside the web view,

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:13.310
then I can scroll the
whole list view itself.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:15.060
You can do that with
any gesture you want.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:22.800
The other thing to keep
in mind with web views

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:28.170
is if you have multiple web
views, like in this case where

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:30.600
I might have a web view
for every single article

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.095
when I expand that tile, you--

00:32:35.095 --> 00:32:36.280
have you pushed?

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:36.780
MATT: Yes.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:37.740
EMILY: All right.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.650
We'll talk about keys--
well, multiple web views--

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:41.600
in a minute.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.100
All right.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.974
Let me pull [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:49.342 --> 00:32:50.285
MATT: Uh oh.

00:32:50.285 --> 00:32:51.785
EMILY: It's because
I deleted that--

00:32:56.339 --> 00:32:57.880
it's because I
deleted that function,

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.080
the unnecessary function.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.086
MATT: Now you can go on
like that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:01.086 --> 00:33:05.120
EMILY: Get [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.860
All right, and let us--

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:11.165
MATT: Your get-fu is far, far,
far in advance of my get-fu.

00:33:11.165 --> 00:33:14.354
EMILY: It's because I have
gotten in so many weird spots.

00:33:14.354 --> 00:33:16.270
MATT: That's because I'm
always like, I'm just

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:17.892
going to push first.

00:33:17.892 --> 00:33:22.220
EMILY: Flutter packages
get, just to get everything.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:22.720
MATT: Yep.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.440
EMILY: All right.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.290
So let me launch this.

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:29.230
MATT: So you're-- OK,
so you're using Android,

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:32.200
which we don't need to change
any of the Android manifest

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.410
files or anything like that.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:33.830
EMILY: Correct.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:34.913
MATT: It should just work.

00:33:34.913 --> 00:33:36.100
EMILY: But even if we--

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.220
well, if I was using
iOS, because you

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.640
had changed [INAUDIBLE]
pull your code down,

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.430
it would have it.

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:43.900
MATT: Yes, if you
were using iOS.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.570
EMILY: But anyway.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:50.350
Yes, so what we want
to do is we want to,

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:55.450
in our little-- let's find
the expanded tile widget that

00:33:55.450 --> 00:34:00.110
allows you to click, and then
go to see that new launch thing.

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:04.500
So expanded--
expansion tile, my bad.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:09.310
All right, so I'm going to
get rid of commented code

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:11.929
because it's just
taking up space.

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:13.059
MATT: Who needs comments?

00:34:13.059 --> 00:34:13.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.639
EMILY: Commented out code.

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:17.414
Comments are good.

00:34:17.414 --> 00:34:19.480
The code's like, not executing.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.139
What's that for?

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:27.679
Why is it not launching?

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:28.839
This is like--

00:34:28.839 --> 00:34:29.630
MATT: I don't know.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.190
Are we having--

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:34.280
EMILY: Flashbacks of
Flutter Live here?

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.870
MATT: ADB problems.

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:38.270
No, you're good, you're good.

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:39.590
EMILY: OK.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:42.590
While it continues to
think about launching,

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:46.850
so we've got this
on-pressed function

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:52.736
and we have our
comments, got our button.

00:34:52.736 --> 00:34:54.110
MATT: So there is
an icon button.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.670
EMILY: So we
probably-- let's see.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.530
This is all in a row.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:01.250
How about we wrap it in a column
and then we can stick the web

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:02.230
view below that?

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.110
MATT: Yeah, that makes sense.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:03.680
That sounds good.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.554
EMILY: What the heck?

00:35:04.554 --> 00:35:05.780
It's not launching again.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:06.530
MATT: Is there a--

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:07.930
EMILY: My computer--

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:13.040
MATT: What does your
debug console say?

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:17.030
Oh, articles search
extends, build results--

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:18.980
oh, it is using build results.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:21.320
EMILY: Oh.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.760
My bad.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.230
MATT: Use dash.

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:26.600
Good news is we already
updated the code for that.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.670
EMILY: Yeah.

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:28.730
MATT: What is that doing?

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:30.830
Oh, that's where we do
the search thing here.

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:32.536
EMILY: I'm going to
do a get reset hard.

00:35:32.536 --> 00:35:33.660
MATT: So let's take a look.

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:36.630
Did that actually work, while
Emily is fixing that, back over

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:37.130
to me.

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:42.000
So this is probably
happening here.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.580
So we've got a search.

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:46.099
So I can type in cre
and that would appear.

00:35:46.099 --> 00:35:47.390
And then when I click on, yeah.

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:49.400
So that takes it to--

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.630
so that's using the--

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:52.296
EMILY: So then do we
need it technically

00:35:52.296 --> 00:35:53.860
implement it in both?

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:54.590
The launch thing?

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:55.798
I mean, we can do that later.

00:35:55.798 --> 00:35:57.710
MATT: I think we
should dry up our code.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.340
EMILY: Dry up our code?

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.939
MATT: Dry-- only write it once?

00:36:01.939 --> 00:36:02.480
What is the--

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.855
EMILY: Oh, don't
repeat yourself.

00:36:03.855 --> 00:36:05.330
MATT: Don't repeat yourself.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.580
I just repeated you.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.710
Don't repeat Emily.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:08.788
Dre.

00:36:08.788 --> 00:36:11.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.480
It's a thing.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.790
D-R-E, I just invented it.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:15.230
That's me.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:16.640
So yeah, we should probably--

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.639
EMILY: Or actually do
repeat Emily for emphasis.

00:36:18.639 --> 00:36:20.757
MATT: Do repeat Emily.

00:36:20.757 --> 00:36:22.590
So yeah, OK, that's
used on the search page.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:26.360
So that's that mystery solved.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.480
EMILY: Although I feel like,
yes, as you were saying,

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.370
we should factor
things out because it

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:32.490
seems like a shared code.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:32.990
MATT: Yep.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.970
EMILY: We can deal with
that in a little bit

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:37.100
because right now we're
talking about web views.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:40.284
MATT: OK, so we're going to
update the expanded place.

00:36:40.284 --> 00:36:41.450
Oh no, we're building still.

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:42.158
EMILY: Assuming--

00:36:42.158 --> 00:36:43.270
MATT: We're building.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.880
Here we go.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.520
We're building.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.353
Something's running.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:48.910
EMILY: Oh my god.

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:49.868
MATT: The anticipation.

00:36:49.868 --> 00:36:51.989
EMILY: You would think
this was a complicated--

00:36:51.989 --> 00:36:52.530
MATT: I know.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:53.610
EMILY: --compute-intensive app.

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:54.818
MATT: Pushing all them code--

00:36:54.818 --> 00:36:56.000
EMILY: Yeah, OK, phew.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.840
All right, so here we go.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:04.101
So as we were talking about,
let us wrap this in a column.

00:37:04.101 --> 00:37:04.600
MATT: OK.

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:09.170
I think Flutter
coding just always

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:11.670
comes down to wrapping columns
and rows and vise versa.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:12.170
EMILY: Yes.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:14.280
Oh, and people asked
about this a lot.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.510
They're like, how did you get
that little pull down thing?

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:23.720
On a Mac, it's Command period,
and on Linux or Windows

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.000
it is Control
period, pretty sure.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.290
And this is in VS Code.

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:28.240
MATT: Yes, in VS Code.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.655
I can't remember what
it is in Android Studio.

00:37:31.655 --> 00:37:35.891
EMILY: It's, I think, Alt Enter
or something, Option Enter.

00:37:35.891 --> 00:37:38.390
MATT: So two ones you need to
know for Visual Studio Code is

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:42.920
Command dot for that, and if you
want to get the context menu,

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:47.610
it's Command Control P.

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:48.110
EMILY: Yes.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:51.474
MATT: Which gives you the full
list of things you can do.

00:37:51.474 --> 00:37:53.015
It's how I do a hard
restart, anyway.

00:37:53.015 --> 00:37:54.546
EMILY: Why does it not like--

00:37:54.546 --> 00:37:56.270
oh, just because--

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.840
OK.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:02.025
So initial URL is going to be
the URL of this thing, which

00:38:02.025 --> 00:38:02.525
is--

00:38:02.525 --> 00:38:03.590
MATT: So we have article.url.

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:04.490
EMILY: Oh, article.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:05.975
OK.

00:38:05.975 --> 00:38:07.820
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:08.750
MATT: Cool.

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:10.806
EMILY: Why is it
not happy with me?

00:38:10.806 --> 00:38:11.930
MATT: Positional arguments.

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:15.020
EMILY: Oh, we're not
in the children's list.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.450
That would be--

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:17.090
There we go.

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:17.840
MATT: There we go.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.309
EMILY: OK, so there's that.

00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:22.850
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:25.328
EMILY: Now this is
going to be huge.

00:38:25.328 --> 00:38:27.262
MATT: Just going
to put this in a--

00:38:27.262 --> 00:38:28.220
EMILY: So maybe we'll--

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:28.720
MATT: Whoa.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.150
EMILY: Oh, and it's
unhappy because it expands

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:36.701
to fit the size, but list view
is a infinitely expandable

00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:37.200
thing.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.600
So it's like, oh my gosh,
I can expand everywhere.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.114
So let's wrap it in a container.

00:38:41.114 --> 00:38:41.780
MATT: Container?

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:42.932
Cool.

00:38:42.932 --> 00:38:44.015
EMILY: And give it a size.

00:38:46.957 --> 00:38:49.040
MATT: So we don't need to
give it a height, right?

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.206
Because it'll fit the width.

00:38:50.206 --> 00:38:53.721
EMILY: Yeah, it'll expand
for the rest of it.

00:38:53.721 --> 00:38:55.720
OK, that's a little better,
except I'm not-- oh,

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.624
there we go.

00:38:56.624 --> 00:38:57.540
MATT: Oh, that's nice.

00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:58.630
That's looking good.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:01.129
EMILY: We should probably enable
the JavaScript thing again.

00:39:01.129 --> 00:39:02.590
MATT: We should
enable JavaScript.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:04.848
EMILY: JavaScript
mode unrestricted.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.690
And this clearly functions
without JavaScript.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:12.850
Whoa, that was fun.

00:39:16.506 --> 00:39:17.880
Method--

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:21.380
MATT: Get size on a
null object reference.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.030
EMILY: Something in Android.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:28.530
I'm gonna copy this, and I
might send Amir a bug report.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:32.710
I've not seen this, but--

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:33.690
MATT: Yeah.

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:37.400
When in doubt,
file a bug report.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.400
Start it up again.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:40.920
But cool.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.900
So as you can see,
with a web view,

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.730
it is just another widget.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:47.670
So you can resize it,
you can draw over it,

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:51.480
you can put in a stack
and do crazy things.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.790
You can probably animate
it around the place,

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:59.670
if you're feeling
particularly creative,

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:02.319
is one way of putting it.

00:40:02.319 --> 00:40:03.110
But yeah, you can--

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:07.200
EMILY: You want to give
designers headaches.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.760
MATT: You can have
expand-o-vision

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.760
on your web page.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.750
So it's as flexible
as you want it to be.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.380
Now, because this is using--

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.330
this is being rendered
by the underlying

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:20.550
either Android or iOS system.

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:24.000
And it's using our new platform
widget, I believe it's called.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.080
EMILY: Mm-hmm.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.440
MATT: Which is a way
that you can actually

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:32.010
take Android views or
the equivalent in iOS

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:35.170
and have them render
through our widget piece.

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:36.190
It's not free.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:42.000
There's a little bit of cost,
in terms of performance when

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.620
you have one or two on screen.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.480
Probably not
noticeable, but just

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.390
be aware that if you use
these types of widgets that

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:51.789
are rendered by the
platform, the more you add,

00:40:51.789 --> 00:40:53.580
the greater the cost
you're going to incur.

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:55.320
So just handy tip there.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.580
Use these--

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:57.722
EMILY: Judiciously.

00:40:57.722 --> 00:40:59.180
MATT: I was going
to say sparingly.

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:02.126
Judiciously is two
more syllables.

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:03.500
That sounds much
more impressive.

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.776
So-- what she said.

00:41:05.776 --> 00:41:06.431
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:06.431 --> 00:41:06.930
EMILY: OK.

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:08.215
MATT: Don't repeat Emily.

00:41:08.215 --> 00:41:09.550
EMILY: Dre.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:12.350
All right, so--

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:13.440
MATT: Does it work again?

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.340
EMILY: It is.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.420
MATT: OK.

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:17.800
EMILY: So it works.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.630
And now the one other thing is,
so you can see I'm scrolling--

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:23.400
list view scrolls.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.310
But I can't scroll
this web view.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:29.950
So right now it's just like,
oh, well I can see the title,

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:32.670
but maybe I want just
a little bit more.

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:34.830
So you can use this
gesture recognizer

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:38.970
to capture some
gestures that you want.

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:40.540
So it's just a parameter.

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.180
It takes a set.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.354
And so I'm going
to add to that set.

00:41:45.354 --> 00:41:47.520
MATT: Oh, you're doing that
double double dot thing,

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.228
which is really-- what
do they call that?

00:41:49.228 --> 00:41:50.080
EMILY: Um--

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.060
MATT: There's a term.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.890
It's the double
dot thing, and it's

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:56.610
a really handy way of keeping
your code neat and clean.

00:41:56.610 --> 00:42:00.250
EMILY: Yeah, basically it's
returning the original calling

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:00.750
object.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:03.030
So it'll return the set.

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:05.550
So rather than using a
set declaring a variable

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.620
and then adding it, I'm
just like, take the set

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:08.495
and I'm adding to it.

00:42:08.495 --> 00:42:12.270
But add-- I think
it returns void,

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:13.970
but we want to return the set.

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:16.320
Anyway, OK, so we're adding--

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.445
just a recognizer is a--

00:42:18.445 --> 00:42:22.740
my computer is
trying to calculate--

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.200
MATT: Pi for some reason.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.160
EMILY: Yeah.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.810
I seem to have lost
the ability to--

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:28.910
oh my gosh.

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:33.490
MATT: Why don't you right
click and read the--

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:33.990
EMILY: Yeah.

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:36.390
So OK.

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:37.710
So we want a factor--

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:42.150
yes, I'm going to jump to
the definition because--

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:44.720
MATT: No, not functions,
command [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.840
Oh, no we weren't.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.979
EMILY: Function F12,
jumps to definition.

00:42:47.979 --> 00:42:49.770
MATT: Does function
F12 jump to definition?

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:50.670
OK.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:51.950
I should be taking notes.

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:52.790
EMILY: Yeah.

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.370
Not function-- yeah.

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:56.810
OK, so just the recognizer.

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:59.220
So we need a factory of--

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.590
MATT: I'm scared by this one
sequence gesture recognizer

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:02.750
giant thing.

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:03.700
Is it scary?

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:04.510
EMILY: No.

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:05.310
MATT: OK.

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:08.380
EMILY: It's just a
typedef, if I recall.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:13.140
So my computer, I don't
know what's going on.

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:14.600
MATT: Not enough cores.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.450
More cores.

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:17.550
EMILY: Except this is
like a brand new computer.

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:24.960
Come on, guys all right, so we
have a factory and apparently

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.260
we no longer have--

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:26.760
there we go.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.569
Syntax dialogue.

00:43:28.569 --> 00:43:30.360
MATT: I'd suggest you
run top, but we don't

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.840
want to be debugging your--

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:37.060
EMILY: Let me-- I'm
going to kill Chrome.

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.952
Start with that.

00:43:39.952 --> 00:43:41.622
MATT: When in
doubt, kill Chrome.

00:43:41.622 --> 00:43:43.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.914
EMILY: OK, so we want
to make a factory.

00:43:49.914 --> 00:43:52.330
MATT: So what does it look
like in the actual code itself?

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:54.830
EMILY: If I can get
back to that page.

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:56.580
Oh my gosh.

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.160
MATT: OK, why don't you--

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.290
EMILY: Commit and--

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:03.410
MATT: I'm going to take a
look at-- what's it called?

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:05.980
EMILY: Factory.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:07.360
Yeah, so just the recognizers.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:07.860
MATT: OK.

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.150
So while Emily fixes her piece--

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:11.790
EMILY: While my
computer decides to--

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:17.760
MATT: I'm going to go
and find my web view.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.090
EMILY: How about--

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:22.780
MATT: And we're going to take
a quick look at the code for--

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:25.484
EMILY: Maybe I've been banned
from using my computer.

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:30.259
MATT: OK, no worries.

00:44:30.259 --> 00:44:31.550
We'll take a look through mine.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:33.890
So I'm going to go here.

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:37.150
I'm going to take a look
at gesture recognizers.

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:41.220
And as we see here, this
is going to take a set,

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.590
but what we really want
to do is we want to go

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:45.206
and we want to check out--

00:44:49.666 --> 00:44:50.166
whoops.

00:44:54.134 --> 00:44:55.470
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:57.870
I need to function F12.

00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:59.222
EMILY: I'm going to commit this.

00:44:59.222 --> 00:45:01.180
And I think we're going
to go to your computer,

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.200
because my computer is--

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:02.700
MATT: OK.

00:45:07.016 --> 00:45:09.970
So what we have here is
we have a set factory

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:12.570
of one sequence gesture
recognizer, gesture recognizer.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:18.765
Now the one sequence gesture
recognizer, abstract class.

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:23.952
And takes a whole
bunch of things.

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:30.230
And so we're going to
need a factory to create

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:35.570
a set of gestures, I assume.

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:37.510
So what were you doing here?

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:41.140
You were doing dot
dot add inside here.

00:45:49.434 --> 00:45:51.100
We're going to need
to create a factory.

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:52.890
I'm going to wait for Emily,
because she knows more

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:54.431
about this than I
do, and of course I

00:45:54.431 --> 00:46:00.508
may be stumbling in the
dark for creating these.

00:46:00.508 --> 00:46:02.750
EMILY: Oh my gosh.

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:04.240
MATT: So the nice
thing is that you

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.880
are able to capture
any type of gestures.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:09.920
So you can capture
scrolly gestures

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.660
or tap gestures or zoomy--

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:19.670
any-- I believe any type of
gestures that Flutter supports.

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:23.390
EMILY: Yes, scrolly, zoomy.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:24.050
MATT: Wow, OK.

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:25.550
What we're going
to do here is we're

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:26.990
going to take a
slight break and we're

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:28.573
going to come back
in a minute or two,

00:46:28.573 --> 00:46:31.124
because I think we're
going to resolve

00:46:31.124 --> 00:46:32.540
a couple of technical
difficulties

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:33.331
before we continue.

00:46:33.331 --> 00:46:35.220
So back in a second.

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.790
[BEEPING]

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:37.770
And we're back.

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:38.890
EMILY: Hello.

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:40.464
I have a different computer now.

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:42.630
MATT: I've got a computer
what doesn't work anymore.

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:44.550
Thanks, Emily.

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:48.590
EMILY: All right, so back
to gesture recognizers,

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:56.010
we're going to add a
factory of the gestures

00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:58.440
that we want to capture.

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.240
MATT: A factory of
the gesture, OK.

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.380
EMILY: So the reason
is because, again,

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:05.190
if you hop over here to
see, gesture recognizers

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:08.910
takes a factory of these
gesture recognizers.

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:12.000
So we are making a gesture
recognizer, if you will.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.620
MATT: OK.

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:18.600
EMILY: So let me hop into
factory for a hot second.

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:22.060
It's just a generic thing.

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.980
So we want a vertical
scrolling gesture recognized.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:26.760
So let's make--

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.630
MATT: So we don't
want to capture

00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:29.796
any gestures other than
just the vertical scrolling.

00:47:29.796 --> 00:47:30.420
EMILY: Yes.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:40.667
And I think-- let me look
up the name of this thing.

00:47:40.667 --> 00:47:41.500
MATT: Vertical here.

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:42.676
There is a T missing.

00:47:42.676 --> 00:47:43.800
EMILY: Oh, that would help.

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.311
One sequence gesture recognizer.

00:47:58.311 --> 00:47:58.852
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:08.990
EMILY: That-- can we
pull up what all--

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:10.140
MATT: Web view web browser?

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:12.310
EMILY: Yes.

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:16.660
One sequence gesture recognizer.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.590
In a different thing.

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:22.710
We want this on Flutter.

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:27.169
MATT: Tab Gesture recognizer.

00:48:27.169 --> 00:48:27.960
Gesture recognizer.

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:33.055
EMILY: OK, so we want--

00:48:33.055 --> 00:48:35.060
MATT: A one sequence
gesture recognizer?

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.080
EMILY: Yes.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:44.930
And it's not-- it's a drag,
and it's vertical drag gesture

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:46.930
recognizer.

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:47.680
MATT: There we go.

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.650
OK.

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:52.457
This all looks super
complicated, but--

00:48:52.457 --> 00:48:53.540
EMILY: Just read the dots.

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.980
MATT: The code itself,
read the example.

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:58.210
EMILY: Vertical drag--

00:48:58.210 --> 00:48:59.820
I can't remember this.

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:00.956
Oh, drag, no.

00:49:00.956 --> 00:49:01.830
MATT: Vertical drag--

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:03.670
EMILY: Vertical drag gesture.

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:06.930
Gesture recognizer.

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:07.655
MATT: Yay.

00:49:07.655 --> 00:49:09.488
We probably have to
import something, right?

00:49:09.488 --> 00:49:10.154
EMILY: Probably.

00:49:20.712 --> 00:49:21.688
MATT: Actually dynamic.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.930
Oh, do we have to do some
sort of initialization

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:29.560
on the factory?

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.378
EMILY: Yeah, I think it's
like a .create or something.

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:42.389
Factory.construct on the type.

00:49:42.389 --> 00:49:45.840
MATT: You've got the type.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:50.850
EMILY: This is a
set of factories.

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:51.350
So--

00:49:53.682 --> 00:49:55.515
MATT: It's the problem
of saying it's trying

00:49:55.515 --> 00:49:58.694
to return factory dynamic.

00:49:58.694 --> 00:49:59.860
That isn't an expected type.

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:05.687
The constructor returns--
factory dynamic constructor--

00:50:05.687 --> 00:50:07.020
Oh, because it's not finding it.

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:07.485
EMILY: It's not imported.

00:50:07.485 --> 00:50:07.985
MATT: Yeah.

00:50:07.985 --> 00:50:10.680
EMILY: OK, so again,
oops-- not that.

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.481
Import.

00:50:12.481 --> 00:50:12.980
Whew.

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:13.810
MATT: Yay.

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:14.310
EMILY: OK.

00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:16.350
And one required argument.

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:18.540
What is required for a factory?

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:20.740
Oh, it's a function
that returns.

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:23.990
So this is like a return
the vertical drag gesture

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:25.230
recognizer--

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:27.534
mouthful.

00:50:27.534 --> 00:50:28.480
So--

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.260
MATT: OK.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:32.213
EMILY: Vertical drag
gesture recognizer.

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:39.441
Let's see how this works.

00:50:39.441 --> 00:50:40.940
MATT: So it gives
it a factory so it

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:42.500
can create the vertical drag--

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:43.145
EMILY: Yeah, and the factory--

00:50:43.145 --> 00:50:43.730
MATT: --can make it.

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:44.120
OK.

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.002
EMILY: --is just like a little.

00:50:45.002 --> 00:50:47.150
MATT: Now I understand
why it's doing that.

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.280
EMILY: Factory is basically
a glorified closure,

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.710
as far as I can tell.

00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:52.035
It is a glorified closure.

00:50:52.035 --> 00:50:53.660
MATT: Factories are
glorified closures.

00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:54.470
OK.

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:56.750
EMILY: OK, so we have this.

00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:57.350
And look.

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:58.240
MATT: Look at the scrolls.

00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.781
It's got a scroll
bar and everything.

00:50:59.781 --> 00:51:01.640
EMILY: And then you
can scroll this.

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:02.635
MATT: That's cool.

00:51:02.635 --> 00:51:04.250
So now we--

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:07.517
OK, and we could do like
horizontal scrolling

00:51:07.517 --> 00:51:08.600
if the window's too small.

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.800
EMILY: We can do the--

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.460
MATT: We could capture taps.

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:14.846
Because you probably can't
tap on a link in that, right?

00:51:14.846 --> 00:51:16.190
Would we need to capture that?

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:19.650
EMILY: That's a good question.

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:20.210
Yeah.

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.340
MATT: OK.

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:24.100
So you have very fine-grained
control over this.

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.920
EMILY: Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:29.010
So f can capture
exactly what you want.

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:35.940
And I want to talk for just
a quick second about keys.

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:41.140
So we have, in this
thing, we're going

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.720
to have multiple web views.

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:44.910
MATT: Yes.

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:51.030
EMILY: Now, we already have
a key in here, up on this

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:53.640
build item with
this expansion tile,

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:57.480
so that when you
swap between these,

00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:05.250
it knows to close the top two.

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:10.080
Basically, Flutter looks
at it as layout by type.

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:13.915
And so right now we have this
list view with expansion tiles,

00:52:13.915 --> 00:52:16.050
and it just sees a list
of expansion tiles.

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:18.420
It doesn't know
anything about them.

00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:21.210
And because the expansion
tiles have state,

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:26.850
like is it closed or is
opened, when we go over here,

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:28.560
these are new
expansion tiles and we

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:32.240
don't want them to be opened
because they're different.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.920
And so we put it in
as this key thing.

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.450
MATT: There is a very
good video explaining

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:41.340
all of these key things
starring a certain cohost, which

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:43.990
I watched again last night to
remind myself exactly how keys

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:45.240
work, and this is pretty good.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.130
So what is it?

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:47.730
Which--

00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:49.759
EMILY: It's Widgets
101 and it's episode 4.

00:52:49.759 --> 00:52:50.550
MATT: There you go.

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:53.820
Watch that one and
you will know all you

00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:54.886
need to know about keys.

00:52:54.886 --> 00:52:55.760
EMILY: And then some.

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.560
MATT: And then some.

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.268
EMILY: But so we
already have a key here,

00:52:58.268 --> 00:53:00.510
but I want to show
another reason why,

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:03.120
if you have multiple web views
and you have this thing where

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:06.920
you have a list of web views,
keys might be necessary.

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.540
So I'm going to take it out.

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:12.840
And so let us--

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.625
we've got this--

00:53:14.625 --> 00:53:17.070
MATT: 20% off our
search engine plans.

00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:19.080
EMILY: Oh boy.

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.180
MATT: 20% off our
search engine plan.

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:24.160
EMILY: And yet we're
in a different tab.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:28.530
And so because web
views are also stateful,

00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:33.000
this is where you would
need to check out keys,

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.430
because it's like, oh, I have
a web view in this layout.

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:36.450
I'll just show it again.

00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:39.030
Because it's trying to
optimize and be super fast

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:40.390
in performance.

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:42.450
So we put a key in to be
like, no, actually it's

00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:43.930
a different web view.

00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:46.890
MATT: So you're saying that
stateful widgets in something

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.530
like a list view, you
need to be careful

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:52.290
if you change the
things in the list,

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:55.000
because they may not update
without actually specifying

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:55.500
a key.

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:56.160
EMILY: Right.

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:59.479
And so this is a little funky.

00:53:59.479 --> 00:54:01.020
Because like it
doesn't actually seem

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.186
like we're changing anything,
because it's like, oh,

00:54:03.186 --> 00:54:05.460
I'm just scrolling
through the thing.

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:07.320
Under the covers, the
way we implemented it,

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.470
if you remember with Block
and stuff, we have a stream.

00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:14.100
And we are simply changing
the different set of articles

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:16.830
that we display, be it top
stories or new stories.

00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:19.420
So we are modifying
that list view.

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:21.090
MATT: So this is
the same list view

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:24.180
but it's showing
different lists.

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:24.680
EMILY: Yes.

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.030
MATT: OK.

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:30.190
EMILY: Yeah, so that's
why it gets a little--

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:35.050
we are modifying things
and keys become important.

00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:38.400
OK, so we also promised that
we were going to show you page

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:44.190
view, but I feel like because
my computer cannot handle adding

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:49.090
web views, we took
a little more time.

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:52.120
So I'm going to give you a
quick preview of how to do that.

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:55.080
And then we can work through
that in a later episode.

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.870
So here's how it goes.

00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:01.410
There is this other key
called a page storage

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:04.590
key that, incidentally,
stores the location of where

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:07.230
you are scrolling.

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:14.625
So what we would need to do is
we would go to our list view,

00:55:14.625 --> 00:55:16.520
wherever that is.

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:22.180
List view, I think
this is the right one.

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.690
Build suggestions.

00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:26.260
MATT: Oh, that suggestion,
that's the search one.

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:26.980
EMILY: OK.

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:28.250
OK, so, yes.

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:32.220
So what we would do is
you just take a key,

00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:34.260
and it's page storage key.

00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:34.940
MATT: OK.

00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:37.790
EMILY: And you put in
a value that's unique.

00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:40.670
However, if you remember
what I just said

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:42.830
a second ago about
streams, how actually,

00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:44.450
in this case we
have one list view

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:45.680
and we're just kind
of swapping out--

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:48.250
MATT: We have one list view,
but showing two different lists.

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:48.750
EMILY: Yes.

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:50.375
MATT: Depending on
what you have-- yes.

00:55:50.375 --> 00:55:53.030
EMILY: So if we
try and store where

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:56.070
we've scrolled in the single
list view and then change it,

00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:57.680
it's going to get
really mad at us.

00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:59.404
It's going to be
like, wait, what?

00:55:59.404 --> 00:56:01.070
I was scrolled here
and now suddenly I'm

00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:02.490
scrolled in this other place.

00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:03.823
And so it's going to yell at us.

00:56:03.823 --> 00:56:06.620
So the solution is-- and this is
why we're not going to do this

00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:07.310
right now--

00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:09.530
is we can use a--

00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:12.470
I think it's a--

00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:14.810
we can break out the
stream into two streams.

00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:17.940
So we have the top stories
and the new stories.

00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:20.690
And then we will put it in
actually two separate tabs

00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:23.950
instead of this list view
thing that pretends to--

00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:25.375
that's adding and removing.

00:56:25.375 --> 00:56:26.750
MATT: And so what
happens then is

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:28.460
when you switch
between the two tabs--

00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:29.390
EMILY: It will store.

00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:32.021
MATT: Your lists will be stored
at the appropriate scroll

00:56:32.021 --> 00:56:33.020
points for both of them.

00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:33.590
EMILY: Yes.

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:37.514
So you can look forward to
that in this upcoming episode.

00:56:37.514 --> 00:56:39.680
MATT: And we'll be sure to
use my computer for that.

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:40.160
EMILY: Yeah.

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.670
I think I've been
banned from ever--

00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:42.910
MATT: Your fan is like--

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:44.160
this is actually quite toasty.

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.850
I'm warm now.

00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:48.200
EMILY: So thanks for watching.

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:52.070
Feel free to throw in any
more comments or questions

00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:56.570
down in the comments,
and we will be back in--

00:56:56.570 --> 00:56:57.320
MATT: Two weeks.

00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:58.520
EMILY: Yeah.

00:56:58.520 --> 00:56:59.580
MATT: Bye bye.

00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:02.930
