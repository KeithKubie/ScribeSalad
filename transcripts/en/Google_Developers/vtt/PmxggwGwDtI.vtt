HistoryPin essentially
allows you to take old photos

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:12.542
and pin them onto a modern day
street view to make a comparison--

00:00:12.542 --> 00:00:14.250
essentially a time machine--

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.083
so that you can compare

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:18.792
between what was there before
and what is there now.

00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:22.708
Kodak estimates there are billions
of photos sitting under people's beds

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:24.250
that are never shown.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.250
And essentially, they're going to disappear--

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.250
the photos, along with the stories
that go with them.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.625
They're essentially going to be gone.

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:34.583
So, the idea was to take all
of these photos and stories

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:37.625
and put them on the web
and allow anybody to see them.

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:40.500
So, using Google Maps technology,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.833
it's a great kind of way
to navigate all of these things.

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:52.250
All of the APIs and the documented
information is fantastic.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.583
And it really makes it easy.

00:00:54.583 --> 00:00:56.833
Well, you can expect an app very soon.

00:00:56.833 --> 00:01:01.167
So you'll be able to go to a place,
look at the old photo,

00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:02.750
and hold up your phone

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.958
and see what it looks like now
and what it looks like then.

00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:10.000
And it'll show you all the
photos around you as well.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.875
We're also introducing tours
to both the website and to the app.

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:19.208
So, you'll actually be able to walk
from one photo to the next.
