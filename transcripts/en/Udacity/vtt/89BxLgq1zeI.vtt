00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Looking at our solution over here, we can see that the only place this matters

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is p(1-p) flows right through to down here.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So we need to change these to numbers.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So this is going to be 0.50.51.96Â²/0.05Â²

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and for this it will simply be 0.6 times 0.4 times the same thing.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:46.000
For p = 0.5, this evaluates to 384.16 and for 0.6 it evaluates to 369.79.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Since again we can't have fractional people, the answer is 385 and the answer for 0.6 is 369.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
A quick way to see why this changed so little is simply that this is the same.

00:01:01.000 --> 99:59:59.999
N 0.50.5 is 0.25. N 0.60.4 is 0.24.
