I think it's really important for

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269
I think it's really important for
 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.110
I think it's really important for
parents to realize that the majority of

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120
parents to realize that the majority of
 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.570
parents to realize that the majority of
kids are going to experiment with drugs

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580
kids are going to experiment with drugs
 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.850
kids are going to experiment with drugs
and alcohol typically marijuana and

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860
and alcohol typically marijuana and
 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.490
and alcohol typically marijuana and
alcohol long before you would like them

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500
alcohol long before you would like them
 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.490
alcohol long before you would like them
to do not freak out if this happens

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500
to do not freak out if this happens
 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.590
to do not freak out if this happens
because the vast majority of them are

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600
because the vast majority of them are
 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.140
because the vast majority of them are
not going to have a problem and although

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150
not going to have a problem and although
 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.050
not going to have a problem and although
a lot of people would say oh get them

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060
a lot of people would say oh get them
 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.570
a lot of people would say oh get them
into treatment etc the problem is that

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580
into treatment etc the problem is that
 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.000
into treatment etc the problem is that
our treatment centers put the marijuana

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010
our treatment centers put the marijuana
 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.549
our treatment centers put the marijuana
users in with a heroin and cocaine users

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559
users in with a heroin and cocaine users
 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.919
users in with a heroin and cocaine users
and this is not where you're basically

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:38.929
and this is not where you're basically
 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:41.079
and this is not where you're basically
taking your kid out of a bad peer group

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:41.089
taking your kid out of a bad peer group
 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:43.059

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:45.579
and putting them into a you know for
lack of a better word worse peer group

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589
lack of a better word worse peer group
 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.520
lack of a better word worse peer group
and this is not what you want to do if

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530
and this is not what you want to do if
 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.000
and this is not what you want to do if
your kid doesn't actually have a problem

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010
your kid doesn't actually have a problem
 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.829

parents so unfortunately because of the
 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.109

bad nature of our treatment system it's

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119
bad nature of our treatment system it's
 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.410

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.020
not like you can oh just in case you
could end up doing harm by trying to

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030
could end up doing harm by trying to
 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.599
could end up doing harm by trying to
help and that is a real issue but what I

help and that is a real issue but what I
 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.359
help and that is a real issue but what I
would say for parents is that the real

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369
would say for parents is that the real
 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.240
would say for parents is that the real
risk factors for kids to have serious

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250
risk factors for kids to have serious
 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.840

for it because that is where the
 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.460
for it because that is where the
problems develop there's a lot of people

the people who don't have addiction
 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.300
the people who don't have addiction
problems they get exposed to a drug

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310

that's like the best thing ever and they
 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.300
that's like the best thing ever and they
say oh my god I better not do this again

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310
say oh my god I better not do this again
 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.330

because this could ruin my life and this

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340
because this could ruin my life and this
 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.340
because this could ruin my life and this
is why addiction is such a complicated

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350
is why addiction is such a complicated
 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.440
is why addiction is such a complicated
problem because you would think that

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450
problem because you would think that
 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.240
problem because you would think that
overwhelming pleasure would just take

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250
overwhelming pleasure would just take
 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.330
overwhelming pleasure would just take
over everybody but most people have

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340
over everybody but most people have
 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.950
over everybody but most people have
meaningful lives that they don't want to

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960
meaningful lives that they don't want to
 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.360
meaningful lives that they don't want to
lose and that they don't want to ruin

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370
lose and that they don't want to ruin
 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.060
lose and that they don't want to ruin
and when they see a sort of instant list

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070
and when they see a sort of instant list
 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.070
and when they see a sort of instant list
experience it says well you know they

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080
experience it says well you know they
 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.710
experience it says well you know they
say whoa like this you know I better not

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720
say whoa like this you know I better not
 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.360
say whoa like this you know I better not
mess with this I could just lose myself

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370
mess with this I could just lose myself
 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.780
mess with this I could just lose myself
in this so unfortunately that is the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790
in this so unfortunately that is the
 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.820
in this so unfortunately that is the
response of the majority of people and

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830
response of the majority of people and
 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.240
response of the majority of people and
also fortunately most people do not find

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250
also fortunately most people do not find
 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.730
also fortunately most people do not find
most drugs even opiates overwhelmingly

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740
most drugs even opiates overwhelmingly
 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.900
most drugs even opiates overwhelmingly
for ik the response is hugely varied in

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910
for ik the response is hugely varied in
 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.180
for ik the response is hugely varied in
relation to your genes and to the set

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190
relation to your genes and to the set
 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.740
relation to your genes and to the set
and setting in which you take the drugs

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750
and setting in which you take the drugs
 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.090
and setting in which you take the drugs
and all kinds of other things so it's

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100
and all kinds of other things so it's
 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.470
and all kinds of other things so it's
it's really important to recognize that

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480
it's really important to recognize that
 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.260
it's really important to recognize that
this is a developmental thing and you

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270
this is a developmental thing and you
 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.350
this is a developmental thing and you
know the truth is that in your teens and

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360
know the truth is that in your teens and
 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.350
know the truth is that in your teens and
in your early 20s is when you are at

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360
in your early 20s is when you are at
 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.130
in your early 20s is when you are at
highest risk and the other advice I

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140
highest risk and the other advice I
 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.800
highest risk and the other advice I
always like to give parents is to be

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810
always like to give parents is to be
 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.850
always like to give parents is to be
honest and to tell you know try to get

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860
honest and to tell you know try to get
 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.030
