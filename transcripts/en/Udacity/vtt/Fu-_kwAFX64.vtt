00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.310
So, this is what I've done.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.930
You'll notice here that I had to add a new div with a container class.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.100
This makes sure that the margins on the side of the screen look good.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.130
Then, inside of the container we have our row.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.290
And then finally the columns inside the row.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.780
Scrolling down, we can see that each row has a total of 12 columns.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.260
So for instance this row, with Featured Work, has column medium 12,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.660
while the row below Featured Work contains two columns,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.330
each one of class column medium 6.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.950
Notice how we have multiple rows on the page.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.820
For instance, we have a row here for Featured Work, and inside the row we have

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.340
column medium 12 because Featured Work takes up the entire width of the screen.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.990
However, in the row that contains our two samples of work,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.300
we have two columns, each of size six.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.500
Six plus six is 12.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.380
So, these two take up the entire row.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.900
Coming back to our question,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.940
we did need to add a container div outside of our rows, so that one is true.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.230
We didn't need to add any new divs to organize columns in rows.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.950
That was already done for us.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.450
Inside of our rows, we did need to add new divs with columns to organize our

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.340
content, so this last one is also true.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.430
