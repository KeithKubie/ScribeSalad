00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.030
Luis looked at the expression x
minus y times x squared plus

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.410
xy plus y squared, and
wrote the following.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.600
He said, using the distributive
property-- so he

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.360
took x minus y and he
distributed this expression

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.690
onto the x and this expression
onto the negative y.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.010
So that's why we have an
x times this entire

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.585
expression over here.

00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:24.550
x times the entire expression
minus y times this entire

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.610
expression.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.800
Then he says, using the
distributive property again,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.290
this is equal to-- so then he
distributed this x into that

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.010
and got all of the first
three terms here.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.330
He got these first three
terms. And then he

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.990
distributed the y.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.940
He distributed the y over here
and he got these three terms.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.760
And then he saw, looks like
that this term x squared y

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.710
cancels out with a minus x
squared y, and the xy squared

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.770
cancels out with the negative
xy squared.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.480
Then he saw that it equals
x to the third

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.250
minus y to the third.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.290
And he wrote down, I conjecture
that x minus y

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.990
times x squared plus xy plus y
squared is equal to x to the

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.220
third minus y to the third
for all x and y.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.960
Did Carlos use inductive
reasoning?

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.230
Explain.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.410
Well, inductive reasoning is
looking at a sample of

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.620
things-- looking at some set
of data, if you will-- and

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.340
then making a generalization
based on that.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.850
You're not 100% sure, but based
on what you've seen so

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.280
far, you think that the pattern
would continue.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.720
Or you think it might be true
for all things that have that

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.240
type of property or whatever.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.050
Now in this situation,
he didn't look at

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.220
some type of a sample.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.630
He actually just did a proof.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.460
He multiplied this out
algebraically.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.630
In fact, it's incorrect for him
to say I conjecture here.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.650
A conjecture is a statement or
proposition that is unproven,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.470
but it's probably going
to be true.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.020
It's unproven but it seems
reasonable, or it seems likely

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.900
that it's true.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.030
This isn't a conjecture.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.950
This is proven.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.930
He proved that x minus y times
x squared plus xy plus y

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.100
squared is equal to x to the
third minus y third.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.240
He should have written-- and
this is a much stronger thing

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.320
to say-- he should have said, I
proved that this is true for

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.340
all x and y.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.010
So to answer the question, did
he use inductive reasoning?

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.350
No.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.000
I would say that he made
an outright proof.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.730
No, he made a proof.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.010
Inductive reasoning would have
been, if he would have saw, if

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.290
you would have given him 5 minus
2 is equal to-- or 5

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.150
minus 2 times 5 squared plus 5
times 2 plus 2 squared, and

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.180
you saw that that was equal to
the same thing as 5 to the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.630
third minus 2 to the third.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.770
And then let's say he did it
for, I don't know, one in

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.350
seven in a couple of examples.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.430
And it kept holding for all the
examples that it was the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.900
first number cubed minus the
second number cubed.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.340
Then it would have been
inductive reasoning to say

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.140
that that is true for
all numbers x and y.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.690
But here it's not
an induction.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.890
He didn't use induction.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.930
Or I shouldn't say induction.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.560
He didn't use inductive
reasoning.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.500
He outright proved that
this statement is true

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.660
for all x and y.
