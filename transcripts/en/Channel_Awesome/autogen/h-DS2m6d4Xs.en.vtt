00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810
philosophies of this world that
 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.170
philosophies of this world that
obviously have major philosophies from

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180
obviously have major philosophies from
 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.680
obviously have major philosophies from
our world as well um I'm trying to think

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690
our world as well um I'm trying to think
 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.920
our world as well um I'm trying to think
that there wasn't I mean it's not that

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930
that there wasn't I mean it's not that
 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.629
that there wasn't I mean it's not that
there's nothing going on this episode I

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639
there's nothing going on this episode I
 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.819
there's nothing going on this episode I
just can't find a ton to talk about with

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829
just can't find a ton to talk about with
 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.120
just can't find a ton to talk about with
it I I know I sort of feel bad saying

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130
it I I know I sort of feel bad saying
 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.030
it I I know I sort of feel bad saying
that but it's it's the basic technique

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040
that but it's it's the basic technique
 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.539
that but it's it's the basic technique
and it works it's nice to take an

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549
and it works it's nice to take an
 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.099
and it works it's nice to take an
episode that dives more to the technique

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109
episode that dives more to the technique
 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.880
episode that dives more to the technique
I guess the one thing that I would say I

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890
I guess the one thing that I would say I
 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.070
I guess the one thing that I would say I
would like done a little different is at

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080
would like done a little different is at
 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.770
would like done a little different is at
the very end

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780
the very end
 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.170
the very end

you'll never have to do that so now he

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470
you'll never have to do that so now he
 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.760
you'll never have to do that so now he
has the technique and the hope is that

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770
has the technique and the hope is that
 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.890
has the technique and the hope is that
he would never have to do it I like that

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900
he would never have to do it I like that
 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.879
he would never have to do it I like that
I like that

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889
I like that

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910
he has to just trust him that he's good
 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.640
he has to just trust him that he's good
enough to do it but that's not enough

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650
enough to do it but that's not enough
 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.290
enough to do it but that's not enough
for Zuko he has to go and he has to

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300
for Zuko he has to go and he has to
 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.659
for Zuko he has to go and he has to

climb the mountain tries to get the
 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.270
climb the mountain tries to get the
lightning himself and it looks like he's

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280
lightning himself and it looks like he's
 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.240
lightning himself and it looks like he's
really coming face to face with his

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250
really coming face to face with his
 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.510
really coming face to face with his
shame essentially and again with this

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520
shame essentially and again with this
 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.940
shame essentially and again with this

something head-on uh Zuko is doing
 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.770
something head-on uh Zuko is doing
something very similar I would have

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780
something very similar I would have
 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.130
something very similar I would have
liked a little a little longer on top of

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140
liked a little a little longer on top of
 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.680
liked a little a little longer on top of
that mountain and it's it's effective it

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690
that mountain and it's it's effective it
 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.640
that mountain and it's it's effective it
works I think it could have been like a

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650
works I think it could have been like a
 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.370
works I think it could have been like a
major tear dropping scene which I'm not

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380
major tear dropping scene which I'm not
 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.860
major tear dropping scene which I'm not
saying that like nobody didn't shed a

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870
saying that like nobody didn't shed a
 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.240
saying that like nobody didn't shed a
tear in this I'm sure somebody did you

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250
tear in this I'm sure somebody did you
 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.780
tear in this I'm sure somebody did you
know but man if you added like just

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790
know but man if you added like just
 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.030
know but man if you added like just
another minute you know which is a long

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040
another minute you know which is a long
 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.130
another minute you know which is a long
time in you know kids cartoons I

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140
time in you know kids cartoons I
 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.200
time in you know kids cartoons I
understand that I'm not feel like oh

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210
understand that I'm not feel like oh
 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.730
understand that I'm not feel like oh
come on this was obvious no I

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740
come on this was obvious no I
 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.159
come on this was obvious no I
you gotta it's a compromise I totally

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169
you gotta it's a compromise I totally
 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.140

get that I just wish there's like maybe

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150
get that I just wish there's like maybe
 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.860
get that I just wish there's like maybe
one more minute on that mountain just

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870
one more minute on that mountain just
 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.480
one more minute on that mountain just
seeing him try to come to grips with it

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490
seeing him try to come to grips with it
 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.250
seeing him try to come to grips with it
or just yelling at the mountain or

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260
or just yelling at the mountain or
 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.800
or just yelling at the mountain or
letting it hit him uh I think it

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810
letting it hit him uh I think it
 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.960
letting it hit him uh I think it
probably been more effective but yeah it

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970
probably been more effective but yeah it
 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.279
probably been more effective but yeah it
was still affected it still worked uh

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289
was still affected it still worked uh
 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:04.870
was still affected it still worked uh
yeah I guess it's a knee I can't think

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880
yeah I guess it's a knee I can't think
 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.370
yeah I guess it's a knee I can't think
of too much else to say on this one it's

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380
of too much else to say on this one it's
 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.120
of too much else to say on this one it's
not by any means a bad episode it's a

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130
not by any means a bad episode it's a
 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.710
not by any means a bad episode it's a
good episode to have like I said we get

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720
good episode to have like I said we get
 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.710
good episode to have like I said we get
more the technique it's just not Wow

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720
more the technique it's just not Wow
 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.659
more the technique it's just not Wow
holy crap was that like really really

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669
holy crap was that like really really
 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.630
holy crap was that like really really
good so but it was these it was a decent

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640
good so but it was these it was a decent
 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.610
good so but it was these it was a decent
episode I can't find too much else to

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620
episode I can't find too much else to
 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.000
episode I can't find too much else to
say about it so um yeah probably a short

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010
say about it so um yeah probably a short
 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.409
say about it so um yeah probably a short
one here but hopefully I'll have more to

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419
one here but hopefully I'll have more to
 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.680
one here but hopefully I'll have more to
say on the next one so I'll see ya there

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690
say on the next one so I'll see ya there
 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.200
say on the next one so I'll see ya there
at the next one at there I don't know

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210
at the next one at there I don't know
 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.350
at the next one at there I don't know
what that means
