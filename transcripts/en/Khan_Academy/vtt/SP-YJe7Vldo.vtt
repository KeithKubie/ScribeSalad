00:00:00.743 --> 00:00:02.728
Voiceover:Most of your mathematical lives

00:00:02.728 --> 00:00:04.583
you've been studying real numbers.

00:00:04.583 --> 00:00:08.136
Real numbers include
things like zero, and one,

00:00:08.136 --> 00:00:15.308
and zero point three
repeating, and pi, and e,

00:00:15.308 --> 00:00:17.535
and I could keep listing real numbers.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:18.641
These are the numbers that you're

00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:20.555
kind of familiar with.

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:22.910
Then we explored something interesting.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.468
We explored the notion of what if

00:00:24.468 --> 00:00:26.309
there was a number that if I squared it

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:28.535
I would get negative one.

00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:31.103
We defined that thing
that if we squared it

00:00:31.103 --> 00:00:34.560
we got negative one, we
defined that thing as i.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.749
So we defined a whole new class of numbers

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:40.222
which you could really view as multiples

00:00:40.222 --> 00:00:42.259
of the imaginary unit.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:47.357
So imaginary numbers
would be i and negative i,

00:00:47.357 --> 00:00:52.839
and pi times i, and e times i.

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.754
This might raise another
interesting question.

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:58.783
What if I combined
imaginary and real numbers?

00:00:58.783 --> 00:01:00.422
What if I had numbers
that were essentially

00:01:00.422 --> 00:01:02.848
sums or differences of
real or imaginary numbers?

00:01:02.848 --> 00:01:06.504
For example, let's say
that I had the number.

00:01:06.504 --> 00:01:08.612
Let's say I call it z,

00:01:08.612 --> 00:01:11.793
and z tends to be the most used variable

00:01:11.793 --> 00:01:12.942
when we're talking about

00:01:12.942 --> 00:01:15.921
what I'm about to talk
about, complex numbers.

00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:19.253
Let's say that z is equal to,

00:01:19.253 --> 00:01:23.258
is equal to the real number five plus

00:01:23.258 --> 00:01:28.130
the imaginary number three times i.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.354
So this thing right over here

00:01:29.354 --> 00:01:31.667
we have a real number
plus an imaginary number.

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:33.319
You might be tempted to
add these two things,

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:34.512
but you can't.

00:01:34.512 --> 00:01:35.890
They won't make any sense.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.417
These are kind of going in different,

00:01:37.417 --> 00:01:39.704
we'll think about it visually in a second,

00:01:39.704 --> 00:01:41.505
but you can't simplify this anymore.

00:01:41.505 --> 00:01:43.174
You can't add this real number

00:01:43.174 --> 00:01:44.951
to this imaginary number.

00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:46.457
A number like this, let me make it clear,

00:01:46.457 --> 00:01:51.669
that's real and this is
imaginary, imaginary.

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:56.541
A number like this we
call a complex number,

00:01:56.541 --> 00:02:00.107
a complex number.

00:02:00.107 --> 00:02:02.524
It has a real part and an imaginary part.

00:02:02.524 --> 00:02:04.664
Sometimes you'll see notation like this,

00:02:04.664 --> 00:02:07.201
or someone will say what's the real part?

00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:10.115
What's the real part of
our complex number, z?

00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:13.879
Well, that would be the
five right over there.

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:14.876
Then they might say,

00:02:14.876 --> 00:02:16.840
"Well, what's the imaginary part?

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.751
"What's the imaginary part
of our complex number, z?

00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:23.883
And then typically the
way that this function

00:02:23.883 --> 00:02:25.296
is defined they really want to know

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:28.799
what multiple of i is this imaginary part

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:29.818
right over here.

00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:34.414
In this case it is going to
be, it is going to be three.

00:02:34.414 --> 00:02:35.953
We can visualize this.

00:02:35.953 --> 00:02:38.368
We can visualize this in two dimensions.

00:02:38.368 --> 00:02:39.690
Instead of having the traditional

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.496
two-dimensional Cartesian plane

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:44.590
with real numbers on the horizontal

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.155
and the vertical axis,

00:02:46.155 --> 00:02:48.960
what we do to plot complex numbers

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.798
is we on the vertical axis we plot

00:02:52.798 --> 00:02:56.290
the imaginary part, so
that's the imaginary part.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.625
On the horizontal axis
we plot the real part.

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:04.352
We plot the real part just like that.

00:03:04.352 --> 00:03:06.051
We plot the real part.

00:03:06.051 --> 00:03:08.230
For example, z right over here

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.706
which is five plus three i,

00:03:09.706 --> 00:03:12.767
the real part is five so we would go

00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:17.238
one, two, three, four, five.

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:18.321
That's five right over there.

00:03:18.321 --> 00:03:20.107
The imaginary part is three.

00:03:20.107 --> 00:03:25.540
One, two, three, and so
on the complex plane,

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.491
on the complex plane we would visualize

00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:31.744
that number right over here.

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.377
This right over here is how we

00:03:33.377 --> 00:03:36.239
would visualize z on the complex plane.

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.793
It's five, positive five
in the real direction,

00:03:38.793 --> 00:03:41.173
positive three in the imaginary direction.

00:03:41.173 --> 00:03:43.284
We could plot other complex numbers.

00:03:43.284 --> 00:03:46.106
Let's say we have the complex number a

00:03:46.106 --> 00:03:50.145
which is equal to let's
say it's negative two

00:03:50.145 --> 00:03:51.388
plus i.

00:03:51.388 --> 00:03:53.254
Where would I plot that?

00:03:53.254 --> 00:03:55.613
Well, the real part is negative two,

00:03:55.613 --> 00:03:56.932
negative two,

00:03:56.932 --> 00:03:59.163
and the imaginary part is going to be

00:03:59.163 --> 00:04:01.424
you could imagine this as plus one i

00:04:01.424 --> 00:04:02.563
so we go one up.

00:04:02.563 --> 00:04:04.196
It's going to be right over there.

00:04:04.196 --> 00:04:07.220
That right over there
is our complex number.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.130
Our complex number a
would be at that point

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.149
of the complex,

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:14.188
complex, let me write that,

00:04:14.188 --> 00:04:17.909
that point of the complex plane.

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:19.426
Let me just do one more.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:22.148
Let's say you had a complex number b

00:04:22.148 --> 00:04:24.645
which is going to be,

00:04:24.645 --> 00:04:29.494
let's say it is, let's say
it's four minus three i.

00:04:29.494 --> 00:04:30.809
Where would we plot that?

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:32.886
Well, one, two, three, four,

00:04:32.886 --> 00:04:36.740
and then let's see minus one, two, three.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.358
Our negative three gets
us right over there.

00:04:39.358 --> 00:04:40.499
That right over there would be

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:43.045
the complex number b.
