00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.719
Hey Mark, check it out.

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.020
I made a directed graph of all
the tasks I need to do to become

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.070
a gentleman's spy.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.720
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's see.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.810
Being smooth depends on
an intimate knowledge of whiskeys?

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:12.450
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.690
&gt;&gt; Which depends on spending a year at a
mountain monastery devoting your life to

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.390
meditation and whiskey sampling?

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
See,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.000
I even configured each
task with the group.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.080
One for marksmanship, one for
counterintelligence, one for

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.510
looking good in a suit.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.310
&gt;&gt; Sure, but do you actually
know how to do all these tasks?

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.110
Like, for example what would
be in the action list of

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.970
the shockingly good at fencing task?

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.610
&gt;&gt; Good point.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.880
Well, other people have become
gentleman spies in the past.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.200
I'll just look up a documentary on
James Bond, or Sterling Archer and

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.930
I'll figure it out.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.330
&gt;&gt; You realize these
are fictional characters, right?

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.600
&gt;&gt; That's just your opinion, man.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.160
Rumor has it,
they were actually based on-

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.180
&gt;&gt; Never mind.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.500
&gt;&gt; But you do have a good point.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.390
We've learned a lot about the nuts and
bolts of how to declare, configure, and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.660
run Gradle tasks.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.080
But we still don't know how to define
the tasks you'd need to build,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.690
say, a Java project.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.300
Hey, super spy!
[SOUND].

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.140
What would be the console commands you'd
use to compile and build a Java project?

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.705
&gt;&gt; It'd be like, Java C something,
and then you'd need to add some stuff

00:01:04.705 --> 00:01:06.865
[CROSS-TALK]
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:01:06.865 --> 00:01:12.340
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, writing your tasks to build
a Java project would be a huge pain.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.640
Especially if we wanted to
make sure it was all portable.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.380
Thankfully, my colleagues at Gradle,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.320
as well as hundreds of
community contributors.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.110
Have developed a huge number of plugins
that define useful tasks for you.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.050
We don't have to write a single
task to build a Java project.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.720
We just need to import
the task from the Java plugin.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.960
Too bad we can't import any spy skills.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.520
&gt;&gt; It's all right.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.150
I really wanted to be
a build engineer anyway.
