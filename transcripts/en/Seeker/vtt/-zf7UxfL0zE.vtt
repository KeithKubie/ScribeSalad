00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.340
Do you get hot and bothered when your date
throws up on their food and slurps it all

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.340
down?

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.540
Then you my friend may be a flyosexual.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.970
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.000
My dad always warned me that flies were the
scum of the earth and that I should NEVER

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.310
(i repeat: NEVER) allow them to land on my
food.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.310
They’ll vomit!

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.310
They’ll poop!

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.420
They’ll spread contagious diseases and you
will die!

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.849
Felt a bit like receiving an abstinence lecture,
to be honest.

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.219
In a recent survey, Orick asked participants:
“if you were at a restaurant, which critter

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:34.640
would make you drop your fork?

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.640
Rodents?

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.640
Cockroaches?

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.640
Flies?

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.640
Ants?

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.640
Or snakes?”

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.640
SNAKES!

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.640
I’d definitely be atta that joint in a heartbeat.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.719
61% of people said they would bounce if they
saw cockroaches, but scientists warn that

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.510
FLIES are actually twice as germy as cockroaches.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.179
And they’re specifically referring to those
pesky houseflies that can be found anywhere

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:56.579
- after all, there are over 90,000 different
species of flies.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.350
So what’s the real deal on flies and food?

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.489
Flies do gross things like eat garbage and
poop and rotting animal carcasses.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.500
All those germs from the gross stuff they
think is delicious gets transferred to their

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.460
legs and small hairs all over their body.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.020
It only takes a second for them to transfer
those germs to your food or to your body.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.460
It’s also true that flies can’t chew,
so in order to eat, they spit enzymes on their

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.840
food to dissolve it and then slurp it up.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.680
And yet another truth is that flies can carry
cholera, dysentery, and typhoid.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.479
But...notice most people DON’T get those
diseases...which brings me to the rational

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:32.479
side of things.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.479
Flies that are festering on food can definitely
make you sick, so if there’s a bunch of

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.299
flies feeding on a rotting apple - you probably
shouldn’t eat it!

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.189
But when they land on food for a few seconds,
it’s unlikely that it’ll transfer enough

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.590
bacteria to make you sick.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.130
It’s also a misconception that they poop
every time they land.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.970
That would be a lot of tiny fly bowel movements.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.929
They might spit or vomit on your food if they’re
intending to eat it, but it’s the bacteria

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.770
that’s stuck to their body that actually
spreads disease and makes people sick.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.960
Long story short: fly vomit is your friend,
fly bodies?

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.070
Not so much.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.130
Thanks for watching DNews - do you get grossed
out if flies land on your food?

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.629
Let me know down below and we’ll catch you
on the next episode - hopefully with a little

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:11.459
less feces.
