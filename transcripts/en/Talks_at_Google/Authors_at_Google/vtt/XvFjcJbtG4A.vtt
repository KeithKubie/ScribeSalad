[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:07.720
SPEAKER 1: I want to
introduce Tim Larkin,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.730
and I hope you guys enjoy it.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.230
Thank you.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.244
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.715
TIM LARKIN: So when you look
at this subject, I mean,

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:22.340
I really appreciate
you guys showing up

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.350
for it, because most
people don't even

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.199
want to look at the subject.

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.740
You know, violence means a lot
of different things to people.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.980
And it's a very specific
word that I used,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.400
and I had to fight my publisher
to put it in the title.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.720
Because oftentimes,
we misunderstand

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.960
when the appropriate time
would ever be to use violence.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.190
The tagline that I normally
have in my training is violence

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.060
is rarely the answer.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.460
But when it is, it's
the only answer.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.070
And the interesting
part of that is

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.020
most people don't understand
when it is the answer.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.850
They

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.891
So that's the whole premise
for writing the book,

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.780
because the subject
of violence has

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.740
been so stigmatized
in the last 50 years

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.530
that we don't even look at it.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.090
We think there's no
good information when

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.230
you look at violence.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.438
And therefore, the only
people that have availability

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.670
to the tool are the predators.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.440
And my goal is to educate
people on the tool of violence.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.190
And today specifically,
I want to take you

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.070
into some uncomfortable areas.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.260
The best information,
when it comes

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.200
to your own
self-protection, really

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.750
comes from the worst
parts of society.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.840
And we're going explore how to
look at something that we would

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.080
think we would have to dismiss,
and where we can actually

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.940
extrapolate really
good information

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.690
from these individuals.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.110
But I think what we have
to do is we have to--

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.610
let me just see
what we've got here.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.967
So the presentation will be
the Alpha Predators Speak.

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:53.300
And so we're going to hear
from people within the prison

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.510
system.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.070
But before we do that, I want
you to understand the reason we

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.440
look at it is because they
live in this petri dish

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.730
of asocial violence.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.680
Asocial violence is
imminent violence.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.330
There's no communication.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.210
There's no back and forth.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.699
This is, you're facing
grievous bodily harm.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.860
If you don't take
action, you're basically

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.965
going to be participating in
your own murder at that point.

00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:17.840
And that's the
definition, that's

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.100
the threshold of when you
as sane, socialized citizens

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.000
would ever use the tool of
violence to protect yourself.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.594
It's when you're
devoid of choice.

00:02:26.594 --> 00:02:28.760
You know, if you have to
ask yourself whether or not

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.180
it's time to use violence, then
it's absolutely not the time.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.920
And that's probably
the hardest thing

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.110
for people to wrap
their heads around.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.680
They don't want
to imagine a time

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.750
when they have to use violence.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.200
And that's something that the
people within the prison system

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.921
really understand, because
the only way they can survive

00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:46.670
is if they're successfully
using violence.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.150
It's their currency.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.630
These prison gangs
derive all their power

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.900
from the successful use
of the tool of violence.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.660
And because it's
derived from that,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.910
they have to be very
results-oriented.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.844
They have to look
at the individual,

00:03:01.844 --> 00:03:03.510
and they have to look
at the human body,

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.426
and they have to sit
there and say, what works

00:03:05.426 --> 00:03:06.900
and what doesn't work?

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.594
They don't care about
opinion, you know?

00:03:08.594 --> 00:03:11.135
They don't care about whether
or not they like combat sport Y

00:03:11.135 --> 00:03:14.220
or combat sport G.
It doesn't matter.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.022
What matters is, did
you get a result?

00:03:17.022 --> 00:03:19.600
And we'll talk more about why
they look at things that way.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.460
Actually, let's go ahead.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.460
I just want to say from
your own self-protection

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.860
that I want to start
out with a video.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.776
Can we go ahead and start
out with this video?

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:31.655
I want you to watch this video.

00:03:31.655 --> 00:03:33.530
We're going to go ahead
and start playing it.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.630
This is an armed robbery.

00:03:38.016 --> 00:03:39.890
Actually, can you show
it from the beginning?

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.580
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.910
TIM LARKIN: Yeah, show it
slow from the beginning.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:42.980
Show the first time.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.688
And then as soon as
they jump on the guy,

00:03:44.688 --> 00:03:47.580
you can fast forward to the--

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.090
This is just an
armed robbery that

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.490
happened in Seattle on a bus.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.830
And you can see the guy in
the background just walking

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.711
calmly, robbing people.

00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:06.190
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:09.172 --> 00:04:12.154
[YELLING]

00:04:12.154 --> 00:04:13.810
- Drop your gun!

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.585
- Drop the gun!

00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:15.210
TIM LARKIN: OK.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.899
Go ahead and fast forward
it to the slow motion.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.769
So now I want you to
watch the event again.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.980
I think they do it two
more times in slow motion

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.303
where you see the gun
actually on the individual.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.565
OK, that's good.

00:04:56.565 --> 00:04:59.040
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.580
What did you notice about that--

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.330
AUDIENCE: No one--

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.390
TIM LARKIN:
--watching that event?

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.650
Nobody-- yeah, exactly.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.990
No interaction amongst anybody,
even though three people

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.490
were robbed prior
to that individual

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.500
getting the gun put on him.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.272
Notice anything else?

00:05:12.272 --> 00:05:14.196
AUDIENCE: He was completely--

00:05:14.196 --> 00:05:16.560
he was completely oblivious
to his surroundings.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.480
TIM LARKIN: Oblivious
to his surroundings.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.980
Yeah.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.585
Situational awareness was gone.

00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:21.584
AUDIENCE: When he went--

00:05:21.584 --> 00:05:25.450
when the potential victim
went to diffuse the situation,

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.560
he was pretty smart
to angle the gun down

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.940
and toward the assailant so
that he wouldn't have the option

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.440
to use it.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.030
TIM LARKIN: Yeah,
he did a great job

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.835
of redirecting the vector
that you're talking about,

00:05:36.835 --> 00:05:38.260
and he did a good job there.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.428
Did you notice anything else?

00:05:40.428 --> 00:05:43.519
AUDIENCE: He had time to put
his reading book in the pocket

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:44.060
or something.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.562
Whatever he was doing.

00:05:45.562 --> 00:05:47.281
He had something in
his hand, and then he

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:50.110
had time to [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.140
TIM LARKIN: These
things have hijacked us.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.100
Look at this.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.450
That individual had
a gun put on him.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.920
He redirected the vector.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.300
He actually did some good stuff.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.121
He penetrated.

00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:02.620
He went in.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.690
A lot of things were
actually good there.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.930
He had this in his hand.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.940
And if you watch that again,
the reason I love showing

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.532
this is because
literally, he is--

00:06:12.532 --> 00:06:14.740
and he can't get it right
into his pocket right away.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.406
He's literally--

00:06:15.406 --> 00:06:16.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.830
--a gun is on him, his
life is on the line,

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.970
and he wants to make sure
this damn thing doesn't drop,

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.640
instead of using it as
a bludgeoning device.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.800
I just want you
guys to understand

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.810
how much these
things have hijacked

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.829
our situational awareness.

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:32.870
This is the number one
thing just to be aware of.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.453
No there's nothing
we can do about it.

00:06:34.453 --> 00:06:35.860
Yeah, now that
you see it, it is.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.295
It's comical.

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:37.870
AUDIENCE: Why isn't he
using it from the beginning?

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.280
TIM LARKIN: Yeah, you'd
think he would use it,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.154
but watch this again.

00:06:40.154 --> 00:06:42.730
So this is-- OK, awareness now.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:43.555
So now, good.

00:06:43.555 --> 00:06:45.700
He gets up and he keeps
penetrating forward.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.960
Not bad.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.210
You think he's about to
use that to strike the guy.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.710
And look.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.084
Look how many times it takes
him to get it in the pocket.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.120
Don't underestimate, you know?

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.670
The reason I come here today,
we live in this amazing world

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.480
of technology.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.870
You guys are at the
absolutely tip of the spear

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.350
being at Google, OK?

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.290
And so it's amazing
to live in this.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.320
My job, though, as I see
is to remind everybody

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.840
that we still live in
this physical world,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.370
and that your world can be
turned upside down in seconds

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.610
if you just don't have basic
situational awareness on that.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.200
I mean, if I had
told you a story

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.290
that a guy had a gun on him,
and that he redirected it,

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.900
and that he was more concerned
in putting it in his pocket,

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.080
you would have
thought I was crazy.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.590
I have to show you that visual,
because it makes no sense.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:44.770
Now that goes into an area
that probably most of you

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.159
have not looked at, which
is the prison gangs.

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:50.200
And the reason I like to
look at the prison gangs

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.730
is because these guys
live in a world that

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.479
is completely asocial
in violence, meaning

00:07:57.479 --> 00:07:59.770
they have to understand how
to use the tool of violence

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.870
to be successful
in what they do.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.840
But the way they look
at it is very strategic.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.298
And also, we make
these assumptions

00:08:06.298 --> 00:08:09.760
that prison is a very chaotic
environment, that these prison

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.830
gangs are just chaos and
the violence is random.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.750
And nothing in my studies could
be further from the truth.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:18.672
I got to consult with a
lot of top corrections

00:08:18.672 --> 00:08:21.130
individuals that literally talk
to Aryan Brotherhood, Black

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.140
Guerrilla Family, Mexican Mafia.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.830
And these are two videos that
I can share with you that talk

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.060
to these shock collars.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.310
One is from the
Aryan Brotherhood,

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.652
and the other one is
from the Mexican Mafia.

00:08:32.652 --> 00:08:34.360
And I'm going to play
the videos and just

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.120
let them speak so you
hear them, and then I'm

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.440
going to tell you why what
they said is relevant to us

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.030
and what we can learn
out of that, OK?

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.952
So let's go ahead with the
Aryan Brotherhood first.

00:08:45.952 --> 00:08:46.618
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:46.618 --> 00:08:49.600
- 27.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.710
- This is the most notorious
inmate you've never heard of.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.190
But behind bars,
he's a living legend.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:02.610
By his own count, he's killed
22 men inside prison, all

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.197
during gang-related conflicts.

00:09:05.197 --> 00:09:07.280
- I'm probably one of the
most violent individuals

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.021
you'll ever meet in your life.

00:09:09.021 --> 00:09:09.520
No brag.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.260
Just fact.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.720
It's that simple.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.200
- As a veteran of
numerous gang wars,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.290
he's built a reputation as a
lethal prison yard combatant.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.220
- I'm not the kind of man that
you want to underestimate.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.590
The fact that I'm still
alive proves that.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.350
- His name is Michael Thompson.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.510
As a leader of the
Aryan Brotherhood,

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.926
he's been a key figure in the
gang's bloody rise to power.

00:09:34.926 --> 00:09:37.050
- We've had the same
blood on our hands.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.030
Intimacy comes in many,
many different forms.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.400
Few things are as
intimate as murder.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.970
Most people don't
understand that.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.340
It's not a social club.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.670
It's not a bunch of kids
playing at neo-Nazis.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.950
These are very,
very dangerous men

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.200
who will exterminate your family
[SNAPS FINGERS] like that.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.350
- The Brotherhood's
strategy is simple.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:03.330
Be more extreme, more violent,
more terrifying than everyone

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.430
around you.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.980
- Inmates will always fear
me more than they will staff,

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.740
because they believe that I
will kill them if they don't

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.300
do what I tell them to do.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.850
That's the essence of power.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.100
- The Brotherhood
encouraged Michael Thompson

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.570
to study anatomy texts, hunting
for the most efficient ways

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.270
to kill.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.373
- Killing is not
something to take lightly.

00:10:25.373 --> 00:10:27.466
It's not something
that I'm proud of.

00:10:27.466 --> 00:10:29.840
But it's a reality.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.970
It's a reality based on this
environment, and it's brutal.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.136
There's nothing more brutal.

00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:36.389
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:37.930
TIM LARKIN: So the
Aryan Brotherhood,

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.690
through the successful use
of violence, represents--

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:44.665
I believe it is one half of
1% of the prison population.

00:10:44.665 --> 00:10:48.600
And yet they absolutely
controlled prisons for years.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.730
For a while, they were taken
out with some legal action,

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.220
but they're back up, strong
as they've ever been.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.440
And the reason they
were able to do that

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.920
is because they were
so good at violence.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.220
As a matter of fact, when the
Mafia Don John Gotti years ago

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.260
was incarcerated,
they had to do a deal

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.900
with the Aryan Brotherhood
in order to protect him.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.160
The Italian mob couldn't
protect him in prison.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.260
What's interesting
is through this,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.510
they're able to control,
just like the Mexican Mafia,

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.800
they're able to control
everything on the streets.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.220
Now understand,
these individuals,

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.800
both these individuals that
you're going to see here spent

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.270
a majority of their time when
they were leaders in a gang--

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.860
they both have defected--

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.610
when they were in.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.150
They were incarcerated
23 hours out of 24 days.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.930
They had little to no technology
available to them, yet they

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.780
ran organizations that literally
ran billions worth of dollars,

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.120
tens of thousands
of distributors,

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.680
and they controlled it all
with just basically, you know,

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.650
very low, low-tech means.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.577
So from an
entrepreneurial standpoint

00:11:52.577 --> 00:11:54.160
when I talk to
entrepreneurial groups,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.160
it's really interesting.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.760
You know, the excuse of, I
don't have the latest app

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.790
or I don't have the latest this
to do my job kind of goes out

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.017
the window when you
see how creative some

00:12:03.017 --> 00:12:04.600
of these individuals
are, because they

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.210
run their organizations,
their vetting processes

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:13.360
and everything are similar, very
similar to any high-end vetting

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.680
process that you'd see
in any corporation.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.639
So it's pretty amazing.

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:18.221
When you look at
them, you would think

00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:19.430
there'd be no similarities.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.060
There's huge similarities
between how these organizations

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.290
are run successfully.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.260
The difference is the currency.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.441
You know, where here, we
look at economic currency.

00:12:28.441 --> 00:12:29.440
We look at market share.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.200
We look at cash flow.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.310
We look at the ability
to pull from that.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.270
Technology.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.890
These guys, it's all derived
through their successful use

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.430
of the tool of violence.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.590
The next individual you're going
to hear from is Rene Enriquez.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:42.660
He was called the Boxer.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.400
He was one of the main shock
collars in the Mexican Mafia.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.604
He is going to talk about
the education process, when

00:12:48.604 --> 00:12:49.520
they educate somebody.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.410
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.940
- This is the most
notorious inmate you've--

[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:58.708 --> 00:12:59.374
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:59.374 --> 00:13:02.590
- The Mexican Mafia
was created in 1956

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.140
at the Deuel
Vocational Institution

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.870
in Tracy, California.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.550
Its founder was Luis
Huero Buff Flores.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.350
Huero Buff's concept
was to create

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.770
the gangs of gangs, a
group of super killers

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.390
that would go on to control
California State Prison

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.230
inmates.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:17.670
It's based on violence.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.730
It's based on terror.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.650
Its whole philosophy
is the utilization

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.450
of violence and terror to
achieve its objectives.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.200
California's kind of like a pie.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.190
Once a crew understands
that a territory's

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.140
claimed by [INAUDIBLE],,
they will not

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.060
encroach upon that territory.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.095
To do so is punishable by death.

00:13:35.095 --> 00:13:37.947
The Mexican Mafia does
not deal with individuals

00:13:37.947 --> 00:13:39.030
it believes to be sources.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.800
It kills them.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.018
If you rat, you die.

00:13:41.018 --> 00:13:42.680
If you cooperate, you die.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.310
If you are a source, you die.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.465
There is no exception to this.

00:13:46.465 --> 00:13:49.494
Murder is the solution to most
problems in the Mexican Mafia.

00:13:49.494 --> 00:13:50.892
It is effective.

00:13:50.892 --> 00:13:54.485
Violence is a language
that we have perfected.

00:13:54.485 --> 00:13:55.970
We kill our problems.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.435
Violence and murder is
our conflict resolution.

00:13:59.435 --> 00:14:02.900
The black hand is about death.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.870
The Mexican Mafia is death.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:11.810
This is a modern-day murder inc.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.137

you these pictures.

This is when--
his arrest photos.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.960
Because the guy
you're about to see,

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.720
you're going to think he's
a Fortune 100 CEO the way

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.210
he talks, except
for the neck tattoo.

00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:30.593
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.600
- Education has always been a
proponent in the Mexican Mafia.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.440
It has always been understood
that education is power.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.980
We immerse ourselves in
literature, correspondence

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.050
courses, reading, writing.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.530
Mexican Mafia members
don't know limitations.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:54.350
[INAUDIBLE] opportunity, and
they do that through education.

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:57.850
They understand that without an
education, they have no future.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.610
It is the visionaries,
the progressive thinkers,

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.770
the individuals who
have strong intellect

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.374
that become the leaders
of the Mexican Mafia.

00:15:05.374 --> 00:15:06.790
There is a station
for individuals

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:09.610
in the organization
who have no education,

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.010
and they are the monosylabbic
knuckle draggers.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.601
We call them the no accounts.

00:15:13.601 --> 00:15:15.850
These are individuals who
have stationed organizations

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:18.040
at the lowest rungs
of our hierarchy.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.410
For the individuals
who become educated,

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:21.730
they float to the top.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.850
They become our elite,
our de facto leadership,

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.920
the creme de la
creme, if you will.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.810
Once it's understood that
a carnal is educated,

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:32.750
possesses strong
social political skills

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.220
and an advanced business
acumen through a series

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.730
of violent acts, which is
our status mobility system,

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.205
this coupled with his
intellect launches him

00:15:42.205 --> 00:15:46.030
to a position of carnal de
palabra or a brother of word.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.480
This is not an official
rank in the organization,

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.524
but it's inherently
understood by the membership

00:15:50.524 --> 00:15:52.690
that this individual is a
force to be reckoned with.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.110
He is a leader among leaders.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.910
Some of the literature utilized
by [INAUDIBLE] Mexican Mafia

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:01.040
members is "The Art
of War" by Sun Tzu.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.790
This gives us a view into
psychological warfare.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.870
The 48 laws of power,
which is self-explanatory,

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.000
Machiavelli's "The
Prince," which

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.410
affords us an in-depth
view into politics

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.980
and utilizing humans
to achieve our goals.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.410
Abnormal psychology
and general psychology

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.840
so that we can understand
human behavior.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.240
Anatomy, which teaches
us how to kill.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.530
Violence is our language.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.050
We have to know how to kill.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.840
We do this, this
acquisition of knowledge

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.030
is to further our
ability to be leaders,

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.430
to enhance the overall
objective of the organization.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.340
This is not casual
reading for us.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.750
This is our discipline.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:41.230
Mexican Mafia members understand
that knowledge is power.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.990
And with this power, we
can generate finances.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:49.287
And through finances, we extend
the reach of the organization.

00:16:49.287 --> 00:16:49.870
[END PLAYBACK]

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.660
TIM LARKIN: OK, so the
reason I shared this to you,

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.160
you might be thinking, wow.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.210
That's intense.

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:56.200
It is intense.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.017
And these individuals are there.

00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:00.100
But what I wanted you to
see was the similarities.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.266
When they got to the idea
of talking about violence,

00:17:02.266 --> 00:17:04.329
there were two
similarities that you saw.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:06.430
One was anatomy.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.069
Anatomy across the board was
something that they studied.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.599
And the reason is
anatomy ends up

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:14.530
being the Rosetta Stone
for self-protection.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:15.710
And they understand this.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.579
And the reason it's worth
looking at these individuals

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.380
is they can't afford
to be wrong when

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.790
they use the tool of violence.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:28.510
And so good information comes
from horrible parts of society,

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:32.710
but it doesn't mean that
there's not good information.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:37.155
Our own self-protection has
kind of been outsourced.

00:17:37.155 --> 00:17:39.730
We've really, in
the last 50 years,

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.340
stopped kind of being our
own first responders, stopped

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.640
learning about physically
protecting ourselves.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.350
We've got away from that.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:51.130
And the downside of
that is it's rare

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.420
that I get to do
talks like this.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:57.120
People normally see
me after the fact.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.200
70% of the people that
come and train with me

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.660
are people much
like yourselves that

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.830
live in great neighborhoods,
have great lives,

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.780
all the right friends,
they never probably

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.510
experience violence, and
then in seconds, their lives

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.557
were turned upside down.

00:18:12.557 --> 00:18:13.390
And they come to me.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:14.950
And I can't undo that.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.032
I can't undo what
happened to them.

00:18:17.032 --> 00:18:18.490
I can give them
things to make sure

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.140
that it doesn't happen
more in the future to them.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.740
I can give them skill sets that
will allow them to understand

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.259
what happened to them.

00:18:25.259 --> 00:18:26.800
But what I really
try to do is I like

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.660
to reach to that 30% that
proactively comes and seeks out

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.740
self-protection training.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.630
Just by attending
this talk, you've

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.030
proactively started to
look at this information.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:41.350
And that's a huge first step.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.110
The other thing is we tend
to make these individuals

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.430
into super humans.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.380
We think there's something
special about them.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:52.200
Yet the best people in the
world using their hands

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.150
and improvised tools
to kill other humans--

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.100
they reside in these systems--

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.580
have zero training in combat
sports and martial arts.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.500
So it's not necessarily
about the training.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:06.090
It's about knowledge
and it's about intent.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.370
What's hard for us
as a society is we

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:13.270
have to decide when it would
ever be appropriate for us

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.790
to use the tool of violence.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.780
And I call it a tool,
because it is a tool.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.130
And the way you have to
understand that is let's

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:25.780
imagine a scenario of a mother
who is in her house at night.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.030
Her husband has gone
on a business trip.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:29.890
She just put her
infant son to bed.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.690
She's cleaning up
in the kitchen,

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.080
getting ready for the next day.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.080
And all of the sudden
through the back door, guy

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.120
comes crashing through
and attacks her.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.740
He's trying to assault her.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:44.080
Has her up against the railing.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.840
And you know, she realizes
he's bigger, he's faster,

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.582
he's stronger.

00:19:47.582 --> 00:19:49.040
She's going to try
to do something.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.940
She flails around and she just
scratches his face really hard.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.340
She just rips down the skin.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.900
It enrages him.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.110
He then looks over and he
sees the butcher's block,

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.420
and he grabs that knife
out of the butcher's block

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.520
and he plunges it
inside of her neck.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.651
Her eyes roll up.

00:20:04.651 --> 00:20:05.525
It's over in seconds.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.460
Let's imagine the
same scenario again.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.620
This time he comes
crashing through this way.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.350
She gets thrown up
against the railing again.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.676
She realizes he's bigger,
he's faster, he's stronger.

00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:18.800
There's nothing she can do.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.890
But this time, she's the one
that sees the butcher's block.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:23.330
She grabs the knife.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:26.210
She plunges it into
the side of his neck.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.280
His eyes roll up.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.250
It's over in seconds.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.370
Now in the first
scenario, we would

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:35.780
say that individual, because of
what he did to a young mother,

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.569
deserves to be prosecuted
to the full extent of law.

00:20:38.569 --> 00:20:40.610
He probably should be
incarcerated, at a minimum,

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:41.651
for the rest of his life.

00:20:41.651 --> 00:20:43.850
If there's a death penalty
in that municipality,

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:47.080
he probably deserves it.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.200
In the second scenario
with the mother, we say,

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.720
she should be held up
as a standard to society

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.860
that she not only protected
herself but her young infant

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.530
son.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.740
She should face no
prosecution of the law.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.260
If anything, she should be
held up as a model citizen

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.570
for protecting yourself,
as horrible as it was.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.070
What I want you to
understand in this talk

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:14.540
was the knife to the side of
the neck worked both times.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.310
It didn't care if
it was the good guy

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:19.880
or it was the bad guy
using the information.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.170
Violence is merely a tool.

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:24.470
How the tool is used will be
determined, whether or not

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:27.050
it's a justified use
of the tool or if it's

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.420
a criminal use of the tool.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.072
But the act itself is violence.

00:21:31.072 --> 00:21:32.155
It is not self-protection.

00:21:32.155 --> 00:21:33.740
It is not self-defense.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.510
That is determined
after the act.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.700
That's where everybody
gets it wrong.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.040
Everybody thinks violence
is something separate.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:44.390
Violence is what is used
in all of these scenarios,

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:46.670
and we need to understand
how the tool of violence

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:48.050
most effectively works.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:52.449
And what you find when you
look at individuals like this

00:21:52.449 --> 00:21:54.740
and you look at the people
that are the most successful

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:58.550
in using this is the biggest
flip that you need to make

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:02.240
is to get away from the idea
of bigger, faster, stronger,

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.710
because that's what we all use.

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:05.835
We look at somebody who's
bigger, faster, stronger,

00:22:05.835 --> 00:22:08.840
and we say, there's
nothing I can do.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.520
And what's most
interesting is when

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.130
you talk to these individuals
and the way they look at things

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.820
is they don't see
differences in human beings.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.800
What they do is they all
focus on the similarities.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.350
They might see somebody who
is physically bigger, faster,

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.900
and stronger than them,
and they'll look at them,

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:24.733
and they'll say, OK.

00:22:24.733 --> 00:22:25.790
He has a throat like me.

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:27.200
He has knees like me.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.610
He has a groin like me.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:30.950
He has a lower margin
of the ribcage like me.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.230
And that's how they
look at people.

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.690
And through that access,
they're giving their brain

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.060
really good
information that says,

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:41.310
I'm going to access all the
similarities in a human being,

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.120
and I'm to go after those which
are going to get me a result.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.480
And they also understand
that injury to the human body

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.830
is universal in all of us.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.980
We all have these
areas of the human body

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.630
that are susceptible to injury.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:57.022
And the best place to get data
for that is sports injury data.

00:22:57.022 --> 00:22:58.730
And the reason you
want to look at sports

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.440
injury data is
because that's humans

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.620
colliding with humans and humans
colliding with the planet.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.980
And those are forces that
you and I can replicate.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.160
So we can take away a lot of
the objections that most of us

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.740
have to training for our own
physical self-protection.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.580
I have had probably some
of the most unlikely people

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.100
in the last 25 years
of me doing this

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.250
that have been able to use
very base information of injury

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.720
to the human body to save
themselves against bigger,

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.000
faster, stronger individuals.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.430
Had a 52-year-old dentist
that walked in on a Sunday

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.160
to his clinic,
saw that a druggie

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.310
was busting into
his little infirmary

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:40.160
to grab some of the drugs there.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.530
Saw the doctor.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:42.590
Doctor realized, oh, man.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:43.610
I don't have an escape.

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.124
Where he was, there's no
door or anything for him.

00:23:46.124 --> 00:23:47.915
Realized that it was
an imminent situation.

00:23:47.915 --> 00:23:49.490
This guy starts
fumbling, looking

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:52.730
like he's going to try to grab
what turned out to be a knife.

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:55.334
And this individual
realized, this is asocial.

00:23:55.334 --> 00:23:56.750
There's no
communication going on.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.660
This individual just
wants to harm me.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.160
Charged the individual,
and this guy charged him.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.020
Hit him to the side of the
neck, grabbed his head.

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:06.860
This is the doctor.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.530
Grabbed his head, was at
the door jamb, and said,

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:10.910
oh, that door jamb's hard.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.820
Hit him twice in the
head with the door jam,

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.320
and the guy dropped
to the ground

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.170
where he thought he might have
to stomp on him because he

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:19.730
thought maybe the
individual still

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.720
had the ability to attack him.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.180
Realized the guy
was nonfunctional,

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.060
realized it was over, was
able to call the police.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.642
And you know, affect the arrest.

00:24:28.642 --> 00:24:31.100
What was interesting was the
police said to him after, they

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.090
said, you would
have been justified

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.214
in killing this individual.

00:24:33.214 --> 00:24:34.820
His rap sheet is--

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.510
why didn't you?

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.910
And he was able to
say, I recognized

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.710
he was no longer a threat.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:42.270
And that's because he understood
injury to the human body.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:45.101
Now this is an individual that
went 52 years in his life--

00:24:45.101 --> 00:24:46.850
I don't understand
this, because I grew up

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:50.390
with brothers-- he never
had any physical encounter.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:54.590
His first physical encounter
after understanding

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:57.090
just this basic concept
that I'm talking about,

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:59.190
he was able to physically
protect himself.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.520
So this is not competition.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.650
You know, don't think of
your own self-protection

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.120
as competition.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.520
Think about it as learning
the skill sets of destruction,

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.550
which are very
straightforward and simple,

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:13.490
and achievable for
everybody in the room.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:17.870
If we compete, we're
talking about athleticism.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:21.260
We're talking about years
of training, tactics.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.280
But let's talk about what
makes competition work

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.600
in the combat sport
arena that we all kind of

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.090
hold up as the ultimate.

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:32.270
In order for competition
to have violence,

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:35.990
a competition of violence,
we have to take away what?

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:37.310
Injury to the human body.

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.740
In order to gamify violence,
you have to take it out.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.410
If you look at the Ultimate
Fighting Championship, which

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:46.040
is kind of the premier
MMA event, you look at it,

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.460
last time I looked at
it, there were 31 rules.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.210
27 of those rules outlawed
injury to the human body,

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:56.500
and rightfully so, because
there's no place for it.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.980
You know, to deliberately
maim, cripple, or kill

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.370
your opponent is not the
game in combat sports.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.850
Yet when you put injury
back into the equation, all

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.730
of the sudden, that puts
everybody on equal footing,

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:14.290
because injury bypasses
bigger, faster, stronger.

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:17.230
My career, what got
me into this early on

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.720
was I was training
as a young boy--

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.420
I'm a Navy brat, and I wanted
to be in the SEAL teams.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.860
That's all I wanted to do.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.943
And this was before the
SEALs became the big group

00:26:25.943 --> 00:26:26.980
that they are now.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.950
But in the early '80s,
I went through training.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.560
I was bigger, faster, stronger.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.520
I was the number
one guy in my class.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.990
I was a couple weeks
away from graduation.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:39.700
I already knew the
team I was going to,

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.830
which was the best
team at the time.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:46.180
I did a no big deal dive that we
had to do right before the end.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.660
I felt an underwater
wave hit my ear.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:53.909
Burst my eardrum, came out,
fluid came out of my ear.

00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:55.450
And that's the last
thing I remember,

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:57.940
because then I lost all sense
of sensation of balance.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.980
I was in vertigo underwater.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.710
This was the first
time in my life

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:05.860
that I had ever experienced
true injury to the human body

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:09.790
where my brain basically
betrays my body,

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:11.586
and I have no control over it.

00:27:11.586 --> 00:27:12.460
I was able to get up.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.290
They got me to the
surface and I was there.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.831
But my career was
over before it even

00:27:15.831 --> 00:27:18.490
started, because I was no
longer going to be able to dive.

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:21.820
My ears were ruined
at that point.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.611
That set me on a
path that I realized

00:27:25.611 --> 00:27:27.610
the more I looked into
injury to the human body,

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.000
we're all susceptible
to these things.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.500
You know, any one
of us can do this.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.660
And it didn't matter that I was
bigger, faster, and stronger.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.080
It didn't matter
that I had will.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.550
We don't ever want to
rely on will, you know?

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:40.210
And what was really
interesting is

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.174
when you apply these
similarities, when

00:27:42.174 --> 00:27:43.840
you sit there and
look at the human body

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.165
and you realize, this
individual is just

00:27:46.165 --> 00:27:48.580
as susceptible to
injury as I am and we

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.590
start focusing on that,
the brain's really

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:52.510
good at that type of training.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:55.030
It's a very different mode.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.319
If you tell yourself,
I'm helpless, you are.

00:27:58.319 --> 00:27:59.860
But I'll challenge
that, because I've

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.020
trained people with far
more physical disability.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.978
I'm looking at everybody
in the room right now.

00:28:03.978 --> 00:28:06.640
I've trained people with
amazing physical disabilities,

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.940
challenges, and they've
been able to use the tool

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.260
to protect themselves.

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.760
As long as you can
think and move,

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.340
you have the ability
to protect yourself.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.550
And the way you think
of it is a predator

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.326
will give you an
opportunity, and now you

00:28:20.326 --> 00:28:21.700
will have some
information on how

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.270
to exploit that opportunity.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.820
So it's not a
competition, you know?

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.660
I look at it like
competition is like taking

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:32.057
a huge block of marble
and saying to you, OK.

00:28:32.057 --> 00:28:32.890
Here's your chisels.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.426
I want you to create
"David" for me.

00:28:34.426 --> 00:28:36.550
I want you to create
Michelangelo's "David" for me.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:39.110
Well, very few of
us could do that.

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:41.391
But if I put sledgehammers
in the room and said,

00:28:41.391 --> 00:28:43.390
you're not going to get
lunch until this thing's

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:47.080
a bunch of rubble, we'd all
be able to achieve that,

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:47.830
because why?

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:50.770
Destruction takes no skill set.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.760
You know, you just
have to do it.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.850
And the other thing that
we all have to understand

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:57.700
is we're all hardwired to
be really good at using

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.689
the tool of violence.

00:28:59.689 --> 00:29:01.105
That was the one
thing in the book

00:29:01.105 --> 00:29:02.590
that I really
wanted to point out

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:07.630
was that the reason we're here
is because we are the best

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:11.890
species in using the tool of
violence to protect ourselves,

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:12.430
you know?

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:13.450
That's number one.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:15.940
Now that does not mean
we're inherently violent.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:19.120
It just means from
a survival standard,

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.360
we were able to evolve.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.630
And the most interesting
part about that is we

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:26.480
are not the biggest, fastest,
and strongest species.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.720
And I say that all the
time, especially when

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.279
I'm training a lot of the
alpha operators, you know?

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:33.070
A lot of counterterrorist
guys that I train

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:34.837
and the Special Operations guys.

00:29:34.837 --> 00:29:35.920
A lot of egos in the room.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.502
And oftentimes I ask, OK.

00:29:37.502 --> 00:29:38.460
Who wants to volunteer?

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:39.490
I've got a 10' by 10' cage.

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:41.073
I've got a 65-pound
mountain lion that

00:29:41.073 --> 00:29:43.510
hasn't eaten in three
days, and I need you

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.340
to go five minutes with him.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.300
Any takers?

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.920
You know, no.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.832
Because why?

00:29:48.832 --> 00:29:50.290
That's not what
makes us dangerous.

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.320
What makes us
dangerous is our brain.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:57.160
The human brain is the
ultimate concealed carry.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:02.512
You're seeing that
when something happens

00:30:02.512 --> 00:30:03.720
like what happened in Vegas--

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.900
I'm from Vegas, by the way.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.800
My wife actually is a
captain with Las Vegas Metro.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.710
She ran the incident
scene for that.

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.560
So I have first-hand knowledge
of a horrible situation

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.640
that we all experienced.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:25.060
But the problem is that when
we look at an act like that,

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.420
we often ask the
wrong questions.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.400
We want to know,
what was he thinking?

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.520
Why was he doing this?

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.500
You know, we don't
want to believe

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.208
that there are
individuals out there that

00:30:34.208 --> 00:30:37.184
are able and capable to
do violence like this.

00:30:37.184 --> 00:30:39.100
And we want to think
that there's some way you

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.140
could have prevented this.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.870
Or we want to outlaw
the tool that was used.

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:45.880
And this is not a
gun control debate.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.480
What I'm trying to
tell you is I've

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.010
been in areas of the world--

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:50.850
I travel internationally--
where there

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:55.610
are the most severe penalties
for having any sort of weapon

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:56.310
on them.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:59.870
And yet the proliferation
of weapons is just huge.

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:02.520
The human mind will
find a way to do it.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.130
And that's what
makes us dangerous.

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.720
You know, the tool
itself, like I just

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.310
showed you with the knife
to the side of the neck,

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.520
is not the problem.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.170
It's the intent that
we're doing that.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:12.890
Now we flip that.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:15.710
The reason I come out and
talk to people like this

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:18.140
is because there's a
perception that a lot of people

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.420
think you have to be some
sort of a special individual

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.220
to be able to protect
yourself physically,

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.050
and nothing could be
further from the truth.

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:27.950
If you want to become
a combat athlete, yes.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:30.185
That's a completely
different skill set.

00:31:30.185 --> 00:31:33.740
And that's reserved for
the physically elite.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.010
My days of being able to compete
in the combat sport world

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:38.600
are long gone.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.460
You know?

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:40.180
I don't want to deal with that.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:40.940
I have a lot of friends.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:41.600
I'm from Vegas.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.890
I know a lot of the UFC guys.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:44.660
They're amazing competitors.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:48.380
But out on the street,
everything's 50/50.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.610
It really comes down to that.

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:53.710
It's whoever can get the
first injury on a human being.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:55.910
Now you'd ask yourself, OK, Tim.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.750
I really don't want to train.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:01.200
This really is uncomfortable.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.116
Why would I ever want
to physically put myself

00:32:03.116 --> 00:32:05.270
in a situation like
this and do training

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:07.610
for my own self-protection?

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:12.740
The reason you want to consider
it in some way, shape, or form

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:15.110
is because what it
inculcates in you

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:19.397
is behavior modification on
how you act in the real world.

00:32:19.397 --> 00:32:20.480
And that's the real thing.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.550
Because if you know what
the ramifications are,

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:26.120
if you know that if I ignore
my situational awareness,

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:31.400
if I choose to take that dicey
road at night because it's

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.220
going to save me 10 minutes
and I've got away with it,

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.812
nothing's really happened yet.

00:32:35.812 --> 00:32:38.270
But when you know that if you're
in a situation when you're

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:41.082
devoid of choice,
here's the tool that's

00:32:41.082 --> 00:32:42.290
going to get you out of here.

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:44.831
Here's what you're going to have
to do physically to somebody

00:32:44.831 --> 00:32:47.120
to save your own life.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.710
The behavior
modification is huge.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:53.480
Most people that I come across
with in some part of their life

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.280
are doing the
equivalent of sleeping

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.950
with their head on
a railroad track.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.930
And they're betting
the fact that the train

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:02.600
didn't come last night,
that it's not going to come.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.930
My goal in teaching somebody
how to use the tool of violence

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:07.670
is that's going to
allow them to finally

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:09.950
take their head off
the railroad track

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:12.264
so the potentiality for
violence is minimized.

00:33:12.264 --> 00:33:13.430
Because that's my real goal.

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:15.020
My real goal is
not to teach people

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.580
how to use the tool of violence.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:17.720
It is a necessary thing.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.060
I think everybody should
understand how to do this,

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.400
just like everybody
understands how to swim.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.140
How many people in
here know how to swim?

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.030
OK.

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.304
Now did you parents, when
they originally had you swim

00:33:28.304 --> 00:33:30.470
or when you took it upon
yourself to learn swimming,

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:33.430
was it because you wanted
to become Michael Phelps?

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.930
No.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:36.320
It's because you
don't want to drown.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.090
That's the same
thing when it looks

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:39.500
to your own self-protection.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.680
You should have some basic
knowledge of the tool.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:46.490
And you know, knowing it
doesn't bring it upon you.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:50.000
There are people that think if
they look at this information

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.981
that somehow they'll
either become criminal,

00:33:51.981 --> 00:33:53.480
which is not true--
you're not going

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.120
to break your own moral code.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.850
And they also think, oh, well,
maybe it'll bring it upon me.

00:33:58.850 --> 00:33:59.945
There's that whole idea.

00:33:59.945 --> 00:34:02.509
If I focus on violence, violence
is going to come find me.

00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:04.550
And I understand, that's
kind of the karmic thing

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:05.810
that people talk about.

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:08.539
My argument to that
is, do you have a--

00:34:08.539 --> 00:34:11.389
most places have
a code where you

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:14.362
have to have a fire
extinguisher in your kitchen.

00:34:14.362 --> 00:34:16.070
Does that mean you're
looking for a fire?

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.360
Does that mean that
you're bringing a bigger

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.650
chance of fire into your life?

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:19.322
No.

00:34:19.322 --> 00:34:20.780
Actually what
happens is you end up

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.865
living a much more
peaceful life.

00:34:22.865 --> 00:34:25.489
Because just like the fact that
you don't worry about a kitchen

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:27.572
fire because you say, OK,
I've already understood.

00:34:27.572 --> 00:34:28.550
I got the thing.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.024
I know I can get
out of the house.

00:34:30.024 --> 00:34:31.190
I've already looked at that.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:34.565
I know how to operate
the fire extinguisher.

00:34:34.565 --> 00:34:35.940
You then go on to
live your life.

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.356
You cook, you have a great
time, you don't worry about it.

00:34:38.356 --> 00:34:40.352
Same thing in self-protection.

00:34:40.352 --> 00:34:41.810
When you've learned
the basics, you

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.559
understand how the
tool of violence works,

00:34:43.559 --> 00:34:48.860
you understand why things
happen, you change on

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:52.388
how you do-- you make much
better decisions in your life.

00:34:52.388 --> 00:34:53.929
And you get yourself
out of problems.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:56.030
Because a lot of times
what happens is we

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:59.870
participate in things that we
don't have to participate in.

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:01.520
You know, you will
sit there, after you

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.032
learn about the
tool of violence,

00:35:04.032 --> 00:35:07.130
you're not going to take
the bait on the road rage.

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:10.052
You're not going to take
the bait at the bar.

00:35:10.052 --> 00:35:12.260
You know, a lot of people
will show this information.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.843
They'll show it in
a bar fight format.

00:35:13.843 --> 00:35:16.392
Like, I have people in my
industry basically teaching you

00:35:16.392 --> 00:35:18.350
how to win a bar fight,
which is basically also

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:20.630
how to win a jail cell.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:21.754
You know, which is that.

00:35:21.754 --> 00:35:23.420
It's showing the
absolute wrong context.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:24.980
And the majority
of you, if you were

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.930
shown how to win
a bar fight, you'd

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:28.250
ignore all that information.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.317
And rightfully so,
meaning because it's

00:35:30.317 --> 00:35:31.400
showing the wrong context.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.830
But there's probably some
good information in there.

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:36.680
They've just shown it in
a way that's criminal,

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.120
and we inherently know that.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.760
Therefore, we dismiss even
looking at the information,

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.560
and that's the problem.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.630
My whole goal is really what
I said at the beginning.

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.830
I have a narrow
definition of when

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:49.930
we'd ever use the
tool of violence,

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:52.450
and really, it's
devoid of choice.

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:56.900
It's you are facing imminent
grievous bodily harm,

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.557
and there's no exit, and there's
no communication going on.

00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:00.640
It's a very narrow window.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.360
It's the same window that
if you had a firearm on you,

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.890
you would feel
justified in emptying

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:07.240
the firearm into that threat.

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.080
That is the threshold on
when you'd ever use the tool.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.330
So people say from
a legal standpoint,

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:15.460
if you're asking
legal questions,

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.879
it's probably not the time
you use the tool of violence.

00:36:17.879 --> 00:36:19.420
If you want to shut
the loud mouth up

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.810
or if your ego's been
done or somebody's

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:24.650
being inappropriate--

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:26.290
and I'll give you
a perfect example,

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:28.870
because I'm not immune to this.

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.250
My son now is 21.

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.960
My oldest son is 21.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.290
I picked him up at
about 10 years ago.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:37.000
10 years ago, I pick him up.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.235
And I go to take him--

00:36:39.235 --> 00:36:41.110
I had a seminar that I
was training that day.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:42.160
I was going to drop him
off with my brother.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.080
He was going to go hang out
with my brother for a while.

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.079
We were going to have a
great dinner that night.

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:47.105
I pull out.

00:36:47.105 --> 00:36:47.980
Nobody's on the road.

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:48.479
I pull out.

00:36:48.479 --> 00:36:50.710
This guy comes barreling
down and somehow

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:51.820
thinks I got in his lane.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.450
Like, I tried to cut
him off or something.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:54.190
So he's steaming.

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:55.840
He was really mad.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.060
And he's, you know, flipping
me off, doing everything.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.376
And I just kind of let it go.

00:37:00.376 --> 00:37:01.750
Well, of course,
there's a light.

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:02.708
You know, he's stopped.

00:37:02.708 --> 00:37:04.240
I have to pull up next to him.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.870
And that's when it starts.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:06.700
Oh, look at you.

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.491
Yeah, you think you're
so tough, tough guy?

00:37:08.491 --> 00:37:09.720
And I'm like, my what?

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.130
Eight-year-old son is
sitting right there

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:14.050
that he's yelling
through, and he's

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:15.490
calling me all sorts of names.

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:16.271
I Have a tattoo.

00:37:16.271 --> 00:37:17.020
He says, oh, look.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:17.830
You think you're a tough guy.

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:18.510
You've got this tattoo.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.718
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:37:19.718 --> 00:37:21.820
He's baiting me,
baiting me, baiting me.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:24.153
And I could just tell, he was
just a really annoyed guy.

00:37:24.153 --> 00:37:26.159
And it was embarrassing
to have my son hear me.

00:37:26.159 --> 00:37:27.700
What was more
embarrassing was my son

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.491
having to be holding
"Black Belt" magazine,

00:37:29.491 --> 00:37:30.920
of which I was on the cover.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.782
You know?

00:37:32.782 --> 00:37:36.370
And to eight-year-old
boy, he's like, God.

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:39.780
You should have-- you could
have got out there and taken

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:40.280
care of him.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.800
Don't let anybody
talk to you like that.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.080
And I said, you're right, son.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.580
I probably could
have got out there,

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.140
and there's a good chance that
I would have done pretty well.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.400
I said, but I had the choice.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.440
I had the choice not to.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.990
What I didn't tell him, because
he was young at that time,

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:56.060
is yeah, I had to
also think, OK.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:56.830
So I'm successful.

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:58.761
What if I get arrested?

00:37:58.761 --> 00:37:59.260
You know?

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.600
Because I chose to
participate in that.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.520
What if he got me.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.645
What if I didn't know he
had a weapon or something,

00:38:05.645 --> 00:38:07.630
and I'm killed in
front of my son?

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:10.210
You know, the ramifications
of all those things.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:13.371
The only reason I was
able to make that decision

00:38:13.371 --> 00:38:15.370
is because I had thought
about it ahead of time,

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:16.786
and I understood
the ramifications

00:38:16.786 --> 00:38:17.680
of using the tool.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.620
If I have a choice, I never
want to flip that coin,

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.680
because that coin is
always a 50/50, you know?

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.750
So it's very rare.

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:28.016
So living in that world, I'm
a very calm person that way.

00:38:28.016 --> 00:38:29.890
I want to be the
friendliest person there is.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:32.098
People meet me, they go,
God, you're such a nice guy.

00:38:32.098 --> 00:38:33.790
And when I do that, I go, good.

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:34.567
I got you.

00:38:34.567 --> 00:38:36.150
I want people to
think I'm a nice guy.

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.000
I don't want them to
think there's anything--

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.624
because if I need
the tool of violence,

00:38:38.624 --> 00:38:41.690
I want it to be a total
surprise that I can use it.

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:43.550
And I don't mean that
from a paranoid sense,

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:46.810
but I want to operate
that way, you know?

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:49.024
And I understand.

00:38:49.024 --> 00:38:50.440
I understand there
are times where

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.230
we-- most of the time when you
want to respond with violence,

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:54.370
it's the wrong time.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:56.870
Most of the time when
you want to communicate,

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:57.910
it's the wrong time.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:59.850
And what do I mean by that?

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.140
Guy spills a drink on
you, is kind of obnoxious.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.280
Oh, you want to respond.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.279
You want to go in there.

00:39:04.279 --> 00:39:06.029
You want to start escalating.

00:39:06.029 --> 00:39:07.570
In the middle of
the night, your door

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:08.890
gets kicked in in your bedroom.

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:10.780
Guy in a balaclava
and a shotgun,

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.520
and two other guys
with duct tape.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.110
What do you want to do?

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:14.810
Who are you?

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:15.720
Why are you here?

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.260
You know, it's
like, probably not--

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:17.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:21.760
--probably not the right time to
use that information, you know?

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.139
And so my goal in all of this
is just to, by looking at this

00:39:25.139 --> 00:39:26.680
and by going through
the book, you'll

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.690
have a very good
understanding of how

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:30.970
violence fits into
our society, The fact

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:32.317
that this is something that--

00:39:32.317 --> 00:39:34.150
the most uncomfortable
thing for most people

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.770
is not the fact of
learning the tool.

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:37.240
It's when they go
through it, it's

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.147
finding out that they're
already really good at this.

00:39:40.147 --> 00:39:41.730
They already know
how to use the tool,

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.480
and it's a little bit
uncomfortable for most of us,

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.880
because we haven't had access
to that for a long time.

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:53.079
By passing on this type of
information, we could have--

00:39:53.079 --> 00:39:55.120
probably the one thing I
would probably leave you

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.444
with before there might be
any questions is the most

00:39:59.444 --> 00:40:01.360
interesting thing is
when I trained originally

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.276
in the military and the
law enforcement arenas

00:40:03.276 --> 00:40:06.430
and we did it in all the Special
Operations area, what we found

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:11.050
was there were less incidences--
in the military sense,

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:13.445
there were less incidences
of liberty risk.

00:40:13.445 --> 00:40:14.320
We used to call them.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.640
Guys going out and getting in
fights on their off-time duty.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.210
In the law enforcement
world, there

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:22.390
was a drop in
excessive use of force.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:24.820
And what we found is the
more highly trained somebody

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:31.210
is in a lethal application of
violence, the calmer they are.

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:34.600
It's the exact paradox of
what you'd think it would be.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.430
By understanding
violence, you actually

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:39.160
end up living a much
more peaceful life.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:39.920
And I found that.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.740
The most capable
individuals that I

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.920
happen to know that
are in this world

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.290
are extremely calm
individuals, and really

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:49.248
go out of their way--
and I'm saying the people

00:40:49.248 --> 00:40:52.300
that participate in society, not
the people that we incarcerate.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.070
But the people that
participate in society

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:56.410
that have a very good
understanding of the tool

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:57.430
don't misuse it.

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:59.530
They understand when it
would ever be appropriate.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.470
And until that time, they
are focused completely

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:04.669
on having a great life.

00:41:04.669 --> 00:41:06.460
And that's really what
I wish for everybody

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.260
that I come in contact with.

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.810
My sincere hope is
that when people come,

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:12.970
seek out training,
or do that that I

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:16.240
hope the information remains
completely useless to them

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.470
the rest of their life.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:19.900
I hope they get
to live that life.

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.140
But should it come, I want
to be like that doctor,

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.410
that unlikely individual that
all of the sudden his brain

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:27.667
says, OK.

00:41:27.667 --> 00:41:29.750
This isn't the first time
I've thought about this.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.000
Now I know what to look for.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.583
I know there are
opportunities for me.

00:41:32.583 --> 00:41:35.120
How do I focus on
my opportunities?

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.810
And that's probably the
biggest change that you can do.

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:40.180
But it starts with
looking at the subject.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.610
And you know, merely
listening to this talk today

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:46.180
alone has really helped
open that up for you guys.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:49.120
And I hope maybe it'll
pursue reading the book

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.140
and asking yourself
the right questions.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.600
What are you doing in
your life right now

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.630
out of convenience that
is putting you at risk?

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:02.230
And there's probably a
lot of things, you know?

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:05.680
And I have a story for every
one of those, unfortunately.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.750
But you can internally
do that yourself.

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:13.780
But this has been an
opportunity for me

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.820
to share with you why
I wrote this book.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.220
This book is probably 20 years.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:19.844
This is the book that
I've been wanting

00:42:19.844 --> 00:42:21.520
to write for quite
some time, because I

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.070
think it's a timely
subject, unfortunately.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:25.540
And we're not going to go away.

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:29.140
And what you're seeing
also is you're seeing

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:30.580
what's really scaring people--

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:33.164
yeah, Vegas was
a horrible event,

00:42:33.164 --> 00:42:34.330
but that was using firearms.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:35.788
But the more scary
thing for people

00:42:35.788 --> 00:42:39.670
are the people using
vehicles, people running out

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:44.050
just using table knives, using
machetes, things like that.

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:49.069
Readily available, low tech,
you know, violence basically.

00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:50.860
And it's becoming
[INAUDIBLE],, because you

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:52.660
can't outlaw intent.

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.260
You can't outlaw
the human brain,

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.160
and the human brain
will find that.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.640
One of the terrorism
experts that

00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.710
was interviewed on
one of the things,

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.930
the night of the
Nice truck bombing

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:04.790
or the Nice truck
attacks that came in,

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:06.100
it hit him all at once.

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:07.600
And he said something
that I've been

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.370
saying for quite some time,
which was, we're finally here.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.590
We're up against the opponent
that we can't predict

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.190
and we can't defeat, and
that's the human mind.

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:17.682
When a human has the
will to do something,

00:43:17.682 --> 00:43:18.640
they're going to do it.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:22.030
And that's why you want to have
a base understanding of how

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:24.850
this tool works so you
don't have irrational fear.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:29.650
My whole goal is not that you
don't have fear or trepidation.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:32.000
I don't want you to freeze.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:32.500
You know?

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:36.921
And by understanding the tool
of violence, you don't get that.

00:43:36.921 --> 00:43:37.420
You know?

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:37.930
You sit there.

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:39.940
You're not surprised by
an event like in Vegas.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.110
You understand it.

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:43.060
You know, you're
saddened by it, but you

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.240
understand the potentiality
for things like that.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.420
You look at it.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.390
What I want to leave
you with is a quick way

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:53.170
to start changing the
way you look at violence,

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:56.170
and it's going to
be a challenge.

00:43:56.170 --> 00:44:00.310
For the next 30 days, when
you see an act of violence

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:02.380
in the news, when you
see an act of violence

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:05.740
on TV, the internet, and
unfortunately-- fortunately

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:09.670
for me because it's instructive,
there's a lot out there.

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:11.800
But if you're looking
like a closed circuit TV,

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.260
I want you to look at
the act of violence,

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.680
and I want you to do what
these alpha predators do,

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:19.180
because it was really-- this
was probably most jarring thing

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.820
that I saw when I was
interviewing these guys.

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:24.310
When they see an
act of violence,

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:26.410
they look at-- they
never see themselves

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:28.459
from the victim's perspective.

00:44:28.459 --> 00:44:31.000
So where you and I would see an
act of violence and we'd say,

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:31.460
oh my God.

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.170
Look at what
happened to that guy.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:34.110
Oh, I wonder if we
could have done this,

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:35.680
and we're trying
to work our way out

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:38.210
of the other side
of the equation,

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:40.440
they only identify
with the winning side

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.640
of the use of the
tool of violence.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.260
OK?

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:49.420
The alpha alphas look at that,
and they not only look at it

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:50.770
from the winning side.

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:53.086
They then try to
improve upon it.

00:44:53.086 --> 00:44:54.460
They'll say, yeah,
that was good,

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.980
but I would have
done it this way.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:01.270
Now we think by
doing that that, oh,

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:03.130
we're condoning criminal acts.

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:05.560
Because maybe the victim,
it was a criminal act.

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.700
What you're really
doing, though,

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.190
is we are not going to condone--

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:11.080
I'm not asking you to
do this and say, yeah,

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.790
we're condoning
the criminal act.

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:15.395
What I want you to do
is inoculate your brain

00:45:15.395 --> 00:45:17.020
and understand there's
nothing to learn

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.280
from the victim's perspective.

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:21.100
There's no useful information
from the victim's perspective.

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:25.030
What is useful to you is when
you see an act of violence

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.820
is asking yourself the
question, when did everything

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.220
change in the winner's favor?

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.417
Whoever ended up winning
in that act of violence?

00:45:32.417 --> 00:45:34.000
I know that's a
horrible thing to talk

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.140
about when you're looking at a
murder or something like that.

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:37.720
But if you watch
it, there's going

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:41.240
to be a point where something
happened to the other person,

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.860
and then it just
went from there.

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:46.430
And that something usually
is injury to the human body.

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:50.780
Some part of the human
body got a big result,

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:52.850
and that's the
useful information.

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:55.340
When you see things
in prison yards,

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:58.690
if you ever see a prison fight
that's out there like maybe

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:00.230
on the news or
something like that,

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:02.146
it's interesting to watch
the act of violence.

00:46:02.146 --> 00:46:04.980
Far more interesting to
watch everybody around.

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:08.360
They're like this and they're
looking the whole time,

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.510
because they want to know where
the useful information is.

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:14.630
So my goal to you,
my challenge to you

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:19.900
is a 30-day challenge of
looking at the tool of violence.

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:23.860
Ask yourself, when did it change
in the other person's favor?

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.750
And then in about 10 days--

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.690
I'll give you 10 days
to get used to that--

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:30.070
in 10 days start
asking yourself,

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:32.290
how would I improve upon it?

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:33.850
How could I have
done that better?

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:37.330
And what you start doing is
you start telling your brain,

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:39.730
I only identify with the
successful use of the tool.

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:44.230
And this works with
every mental training

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:47.350
program that's out there
as far as visualization.

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:49.570
If you're a golfer,
you don't ever

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:54.220
imagine, OK, I go from
the tee to the rough,

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:58.510
from the rough to the beach,
three strikes on the beach,

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:01.937
get up on the green, and
I do a four putt, OK?

00:47:01.937 --> 00:47:03.520
Which is essentially
what you're doing

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:06.480
when you're looking at things
from the victim's perspective.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:06.980
No.

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:08.605
What do you imagine
if you're a golfer?

00:47:08.605 --> 00:47:12.820
You go tee to fairway,
fairway to green, one to two

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:15.370
putt, whatever is realistic
for you at that point.

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:17.329
But that's what you start
putting in your head.

00:47:17.329 --> 00:47:19.620
And there's nothing wrong
with you doing the same thing

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.430
when it comes to the
pull of violence.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:23.710
Asking yourself, where's
the positive information?

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:26.680
It is uncomfortable for
the first couple of days.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.810
After a while, you feel
almost like a coroner.

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:31.570
A coroner will look
at a murder victim

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:33.970
and will have empathy
for the murder victim.

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:37.270
But once he or she
starts the report,

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:39.211
it's very clinical
and straightforward.

00:47:39.211 --> 00:47:40.960
And that's what you
need to do when you're

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.209
looking at an act of violence.

00:47:42.209 --> 00:47:43.684
I want you to
protect your brain.

00:47:43.684 --> 00:47:45.100
And that's probably
the big thing.

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.490
I just want you
to understand, you

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:52.090
don't need to give
up your empathy.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.110
You'll have that.

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:57.174
But if you really want
to make a quick change,

00:47:57.174 --> 00:47:58.090
just start doing this.

00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:03.199
So I would love to hear--

00:48:03.199 --> 00:48:05.490
I have an experiment going
on right now with the book--

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:08.430
I would love to hear your
response to that, you know?

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:09.990
I'm having guys
right now that are

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:11.460
in the middle of the 30-day.

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.380
Within four days,
they're noticing changes

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:15.810
in how they look at the subject.

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:17.160
Now the last thing.

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:21.505
If you go to
whenviolenceistheanswer.com,

00:48:21.505 --> 00:48:24.197
everybody that's here,
I do a 10-module--

00:48:24.197 --> 00:48:25.530
there's 10 chapters in the book.

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:29.430
I have 10 videos that I've
done that are available to you

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:30.144
for free--

00:48:30.144 --> 00:48:31.560
there's no cost
to it-- where I go

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.330
in-depth on each one of these.

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:36.840
And it's a really good program,
and I think you'll like it.

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.370
I can't thank everybody enough
for having me here today.

00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:42.000
I'm totally available
for any questions.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.730
But this was a
really great chance

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:45.360
to come out and
share the message.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.150
So thank you.

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:51.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:56.040
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE] so guys,
we have a couple minutes left.

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.220
Does anyone have any
questions or comments

00:48:58.220 --> 00:48:59.730
you want to throw Tim's way?

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.742
Going once.

00:49:04.742 --> 00:49:05.569
Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:06.610
So we'll start over here.

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.327
Yeah.

00:49:08.327 --> 00:49:09.160
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.770
I have a question about the
30-day challenge you just

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:12.540
mentioned.

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:15.460
You said somebody will
come and give you feedback

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:16.610
that they have.

00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:19.210
They see some changes in
their life or their mind.

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:21.336
Could you just share what
kind of change they have?

00:49:21.336 --> 00:49:22.043
TIM LARKIN: Yeah.

00:49:22.043 --> 00:49:23.680
Most people, the
change that they

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.990
have when doing what
I just asked you to do

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:29.050
is all of a sudden they
start operating differently.

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:33.790
They start seeing themselves
as able to actually act

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:35.140
in proactive violence.

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:36.220
Be proactive in violence.

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.597
Rather than be defensive
and wait for things

00:49:38.597 --> 00:49:40.180
to happen to them,
they're immediately

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:41.330
looking at opportunities.

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:44.710
It flips the brain that way.

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:47.680
We call it-- in the book,
I call it cause state.

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.000
It's worked with traders.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.850
Like, I've trained a lot of the
traders in the financial world.

00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:54.017
And you don't want to
be in the effect state.

00:49:54.017 --> 00:49:55.600
When you're in the
effect state, which

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.360
is you're trying
to react to what's

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.860
already been done to you, you're
way behind the power curve.

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:03.040
In a life or death
situation, it's critical.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.700
You know, you want
to be in cause state

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:05.950
and you want to be in control.

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:07.360
In a business
sense, you know, it

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.520
can be costly for you to
always be in the effect state.

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:12.290
So the mindset is there.

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:14.230
And in violence, the
best way to do it

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:17.770
is to start identifying with,
OK, what works in violence,

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:18.400
you know?

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.200
The traders took
that information

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.350
and said, well, nothing happens
till I execute the trade.

00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:26.530
So instead of just being
in paralysis by analysis,

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:28.360
they understood they
had to make decisions

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.734
and they had to
execute, and then

00:50:29.734 --> 00:50:33.056
they had to judge off of
that, judging off of action.

00:50:33.056 --> 00:50:34.930
The premise works in a
lot of different areas

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:36.985
that are not
life-threatening, but

00:50:36.985 --> 00:50:39.310
in your life-threatening
situation,

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:42.220
if somebody grabs
you around the neck,

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:45.100
I want your first thought
to be, oh, thank God.

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.480
I know where his hands are.

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.500
What do I have?

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:48.940
And you immediately
transfer-- you

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:51.712
ignore this being done to you,
because you can't undo this.

00:50:51.712 --> 00:50:53.170
But what I can do
is say, oh, look.

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:53.980
There's his throat.

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.210
There's his eye.

00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:57.340
This is all available to
me, because you've trained

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:59.024
your brain to react that way.

00:50:59.024 --> 00:51:00.940
And this is the first
thing that saves people.

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:03.610
I've had have numerous
accounts of people

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:06.442
that have trained with us that
they get into this situation.

00:51:06.442 --> 00:51:07.900
The first thing
they saw, you know,

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.180
they saw that one square inch
of the human body that they knew

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:11.810
would get a result, and
that's what they did.

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:13.435
They immediately
attacked, because they

00:51:13.435 --> 00:51:15.220
were trained that way,
rather than trying

00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:17.870
to undo what was being
done to them at the time.

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:22.360
And you'll find the people that
survive in violent situations

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.801
are the people that respond
by injuring the other person,

00:51:25.801 --> 00:51:28.300
not trying to keep themselves
from being stabbed, from being

00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:30.100
hit, from being punched.

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:32.740
It's a much more difficult
equation, you know?

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.340
So that's how you start.

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:36.055
But it starts up
here with the brain.

00:51:36.055 --> 00:51:38.680
I can teach you all the physical
movements and all the punching

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:39.180
and kicking.

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:42.100
If I can't get your brain
to operate correctly,

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:43.610
it's never going
to work for you.

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:45.760
So that's why drills
like this are really very

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.020
straightforward and simple.

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:49.311
And these are probably some
of the biggest game changes

00:51:49.311 --> 00:51:52.374
that people have when they
start looking at this subject.

00:51:52.374 --> 00:51:53.350
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:54.475
TIM LARKIN: You're welcome.

00:51:56.590 --> 00:51:59.270
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for the talk.

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:03.010
I think the biggest barrier for
people, the way I perceive it,

00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:06.330
is the fact that these
criminals, for instance, they

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:09.660
are clearly, most of
them, psychopaths, right?

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:12.940
They don't have this mechanism
that keeps most of us

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:16.780
back from engaging in violence,
because our brain basically

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:20.380
says, you know,
thou shall not do,

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:23.360
you know, intentional
harm to somebody else.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.890
And I think the reason it
could be difficult to engage

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:32.050
in your 30-day challenge is
because of this reaction from

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:34.780
the brain that says, I
cannot identify myself with

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:37.600
a psychopath that does things
like that, and therefore,

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:39.770
I'm not going to think that way.

00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:43.152
So do you have a
solution to that?

00:52:43.152 --> 00:52:43.860
TIM LARKIN: Yeah.

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:47.230
You basically have people
like turn the audio off,

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:49.980
and they clinically-- we
get caught up in the story.

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.887
You remember, when I was telling
you about the young woman being

00:52:52.887 --> 00:52:55.220
attacked by the guy and a
knife to the side of the neck,

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.142
you probably were all
caught up in the story.

00:52:57.142 --> 00:52:58.600
You know, what you
need to focus on

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:00.580
was the knife to the
side of the neck.

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:01.950
And that's the difference.

00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:02.720
I get it.

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.700
We all want the story.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.158
Right now, what's
the biggest thing

00:53:05.158 --> 00:53:07.100
people want in the
Vegas shooting?

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.390
A story.

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:09.950
They wonder, why
was he doing this?

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:10.790
Does it matter?

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:11.710
It really doesn't.

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:13.457
There's nothing to learn.

00:53:13.457 --> 00:53:15.040
You know, they're
analyzing his brain.

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:17.890
They're going to do
all these other things.

00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:20.890
That's not where the
good information is.

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:22.972
And it's hard for
us, and the reason

00:53:22.972 --> 00:53:24.430
I give you this
30-day challenge is

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:26.846
because you're going to be
amazed that after three or four

00:53:26.846 --> 00:53:29.647
days of this that you
don't feel like a criminal.

00:53:29.647 --> 00:53:30.730
You don't feel aggressive.

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:31.790
You don't feel
anything like that.

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:33.915
But your brain-- you're
giving your brain direction

00:53:33.915 --> 00:53:36.070
to look at things
differently and go, oh, OK.

00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:36.790
That worked.

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:38.623
That was-- that's
actually good information.

00:53:38.623 --> 00:53:39.240
Oh, look.

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.840
He got a huge
result out of that.

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:41.669
Oh.

00:53:41.669 --> 00:53:43.960
And I've challenged people
with some really hard things

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:45.230
to look at.

00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:48.820
But again, you're not
condoning the act.

00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:50.860
What you do is you're
inoculating your brain

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:53.881
from looking at the
losing side of violence.

00:53:53.881 --> 00:53:56.380
And that's the most important
thing for our self-protection.

00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:57.640
We can empathize
with the victim,

00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.980
but if we look at things from
the victim's perspective,

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:02.930
we're actually putting
ourselves at risk that way.

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:05.137
And so that's the whole
idea of the exercise.

00:54:05.137 --> 00:54:05.970
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:06.930
Thank you.

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:12.340
AUDIENCE: You mentioned the
sleepwalking through life

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.072
and having a head
on the train tracks.

00:54:14.072 --> 00:54:16.030
And thank you for the
talk, because I'm already

00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:18.071
starting to think about
just some simple things I

00:54:18.071 --> 00:54:20.710
do that I'll do
differently moving forward.

00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:24.910
Curious if you identified
one or a handful of the most

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:27.850
common things that people
are kind of oblivious to

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:28.980
in their everyday life.

00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:30.590
TIM LARKIN: Yeah.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:34.990
The number one thing is
obviously our obsession

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:36.700
with our smartphones.

00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:38.792
And what I mean by that
is what we're doing

00:54:38.792 --> 00:54:40.250
is we're depriving
ourselves-- what

00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:44.590
we saw on the bus is
we, on a regular basis,

00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:47.730
are depriving ourselves
of our sensory systems.

00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:49.450
My vision is myopic.

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:50.570
It's focused here.

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:54.490
And oftentimes, I've
also hijacked my hearing.

00:54:54.490 --> 00:54:59.410
And you tell people, like, the
other thing that you have to do

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:02.320
is people say, well, I should
be able to do X, Y, or Z.

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.880
And yes, in a perfect
world, you should.

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.630
I should be able to
live in a neighborhood

00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:10.350
where I don't have to
lock my doors, but I do.

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:10.850
You know?

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:12.569
And so it's this
idea of, it's my job

00:55:12.569 --> 00:55:14.110
to sit there and
tell people, listen.

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:14.830
I get it.

00:55:14.830 --> 00:55:17.080
You want to be able to
jog and listen to this,

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.440
and you want to be able
to jog at 10:30 at night.

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:23.860
Precipitously, you know, I
show this one video of an ATM--

00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:25.630
these old people
going to an ATM.

00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:26.607
And they sit there.

00:55:26.607 --> 00:55:27.190
And I show it.

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:29.646
And I showed it to a bunch
of self-defense experts also.

00:55:29.646 --> 00:55:31.270
And everybody's
saying, well-- and this

00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:34.990
was an old guy that was
hobbling up and his wife, right?

00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:38.224
Well, the old guy should have
been turning around and facing

00:55:38.224 --> 00:55:40.390
this way so he would have
seen the attackers coming,

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:42.348
and then they come up
with all these scenarios.

00:55:42.348 --> 00:55:44.550
Nobody looked at the time code.

00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:45.660
It was 10:30 at night.

00:55:48.205 --> 00:55:50.330
What was so important that
they had to get cash out

00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:52.970
at 10:30 at night that
they couldn't have got up

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:55.490
20 minutes earlier in the
morning when the risk is

00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:57.650
precipitously lower?

00:55:57.650 --> 00:56:01.576
How many times had they done
that and got away with it?

00:56:01.576 --> 00:56:03.950
You know, they're probably
almost even arrogant about it.

00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:05.908
I should be able to do
it in this neighborhood.

00:56:05.908 --> 00:56:08.952
And they were just there and
the predators were there,

00:56:08.952 --> 00:56:10.160
and they saw the [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.840
So simple things.

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:15.290
You know, I don't want to
show an older gentleman how

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:18.020
to deal with three
raging attackers

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:21.260
when all I have to tell
him is, don't do it.

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:22.130
Just don't do it.

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:25.186
And your risk is going
to go precipitously down.

00:56:25.186 --> 00:56:26.560
And that's the
hard part of this.

00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:30.080
I show the physical aspect
of it because I have to,

00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.640
but it is the last resort.

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.675
And I'll tell you
what's most important.

00:56:33.675 --> 00:56:36.050
The people that have had to
use the physical for the most

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:39.689
part and the people that
come to me that are that 70%

00:56:39.689 --> 00:56:41.480
that violence has
already happened to them,

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:45.590
I will tell you each and every
time, it's this one thing.

00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:49.782
At this point, I felt
something was wrong.

00:56:49.782 --> 00:56:51.740
But because it would have
been socially awkward

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:56.507
for me to either leave or do
something, I kept with it.

00:56:56.507 --> 00:56:58.340
And then by the time
this started happening,

00:56:58.340 --> 00:56:59.300
it was already too late.

00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:00.140
I was already in it.

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:03.650
So I will tell you,
we have thousands

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:05.900
of years of evolution
of nonverbal cues

00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:09.080
that are in our body,
and do not ignore those.

00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.847
Risk being socially awkward.

00:57:11.847 --> 00:57:13.430
Guy gets into the
elevator and pulls--

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:14.780
women are amazing this way.

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:17.630
Women have far more of an
awareness of the potentiality

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:19.400
for violence than men do.

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:22.650
I did a thing recently
with Tony Robbins.

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:24.500
It was at one of his events.

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:26.229
And he asked before
I started training,

00:57:26.229 --> 00:57:28.270
he asked everybody in the
room, he goes, hey, I'm

00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:29.930
not saying it happened,
anything happened to you,

00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:31.670
but the last three
days, how many of you

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:33.560
have felt potentiality
for violence?

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:36.290
Maybe 5% of the men [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:39.530
Well over 95% of the
women raised their hands.

00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:43.160
And it was just an awareness of
a strange guy walked this way.

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:44.810
Women are extremely
aware of that.

00:57:44.810 --> 00:57:47.720
So don't not--
don't ignore that.

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:50.387
That is probably our
number one thing.

00:57:50.387 --> 00:57:52.970
Because I'm the one that deals
with it on the other end of it,

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:54.680
because I'm the one that has
to hear the story about how

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:56.888
you did ignore it, and then
you didn't have the skill

00:57:56.888 --> 00:57:58.861
sets to deal with it physically.

00:57:58.861 --> 00:57:59.360
You know?

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.590
And So that's probably
my biggest thing.

00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:04.007
And what's interesting is the
more you look at the tool,

00:58:04.007 --> 00:58:05.840
the more you look at
these acts of violence,

00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:08.330
train your brain to do
this, you automatically

00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:10.651
just start making
better decisions.

00:58:10.651 --> 00:58:11.150
You know?

00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:13.920
We're actually
really-- we're not

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.170
looking to engage in violence.

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:16.753
And the other thing
that's interesting

00:58:16.753 --> 00:58:19.880
is your situational
awareness, by raising it up,

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.560
you're far less
likely to be chosen.

00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:23.847
Predators don't
want a challenge.

00:58:23.847 --> 00:58:25.430
They don't want to
go against somebody

00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:26.630
who's situationally aware.

00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:29.088
They want to go against somebody
who's lost in their phone,

00:58:29.088 --> 00:58:31.020
not paying attention.

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:34.310
And so my goal with my clients
is not to eradicate violence.

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:36.870
That's Criminal violence
is going to be there.

00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:39.757
I just want my people
to get the pass.

00:58:39.757 --> 00:58:41.840
I want my people to have
enough skill sets in them

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.657
that they just don't
look like an easy victim.

00:58:44.657 --> 00:58:46.240
And that's really
what it's all about.

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:47.180
Did that answer--

00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:47.615
AUDIENCE: Yeah, for sure.

00:58:47.615 --> 00:58:48.050
Thank you.

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:48.675
TIM LARKIN: OK.

00:58:53.751 --> 00:58:55.000
AUDIENCE: That was incredible.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.490
One of the best talks
I've heard in a while.

00:58:57.490 --> 00:59:01.060
I liked the analogies of the
fire hydrant and the train

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:01.670
track.

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:04.420
But my question to you right
now is, as I'm sitting here

00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:07.192
and we mentioned the Vegas
shooting a couple times,

00:59:07.192 --> 00:59:09.400
and I'm trying to do that
exercise that you challenge

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:11.409
us to, if we could just--

00:59:11.409 --> 00:59:13.450
maybe it's a little too
sensitive, but maybe not.

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:15.360
Can we just walk
through that together?

00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:20.230
So would it be in the eyes
of the attacker in his room?

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:22.930
Would it then be what
could he have done better,

00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:25.170
or how could he have
harmed more people?

00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:26.040
TIM LARKIN: Yeah.

00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:27.690
In that particular environment--

00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:31.480
OK, just to be very
brutally honest with it,

00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:35.530
you know, it could have
been a whole lot worse

00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:36.850
with what he had up there.

00:59:36.850 --> 00:59:40.090
He actually-- we're really
lucky that he wasn't

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:43.450
able to use all of the
ammunition that he had up there

00:59:43.450 --> 00:59:44.880
and utilized all of the guns.

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:45.970
So that perspective.

00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:48.610
When you look at the numbers
of rounds shot and the people

00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:52.480
killed, you say, oh, OK, well,
he wasn't that good, you know?

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:54.320
I mean, that's a hard--

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:55.180
do you see how--

00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:58.504
you're all probably struggling
with what I just said, OK?

00:59:58.504 --> 00:59:59.420
And I understand that.

00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:00.850
But I'm putting my head--

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:01.642
you know, OK.

01:00:01.642 --> 01:00:04.390
Using the act of violence,
using a tool like that,

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:05.170
this is what--

01:00:05.170 --> 01:00:08.260
and what this does is it takes
all of the irrational fear

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.640
away from us, OK?

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.470
I know if I was
there-- and by the way,

01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:12.970
I was scheduled to be there.

01:00:12.970 --> 01:00:14.680
Tony Robbins basically
probably saved me

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.440
from being shot, because I
was doing his event in Maui,

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.570
and I gave my Route
91 tickets away.

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:21.755
My wife and I gave them away.

01:00:21.755 --> 01:00:24.190
And we were both going
to go to the event.

01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:25.700
and that's when it all happened.

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:28.360
Like I said, she ended up
being incident commander.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.980
Had I been there, you're
in an open-- and guys,

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:34.150
it's a blank parking lot.

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:36.910
There is no cover anywhere, OK?

01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:38.380
I could accept that, though.

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:41.417
Meaning when I look at
all this I realize, OK.

01:00:41.417 --> 01:00:43.000
A lot of people that
have been trained

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.770
have been in
situations where there

01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:46.580
was nothing they could do.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:50.290
And the good part about that
is they actually knew that.

01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:52.450
A lot of people really
just wrack their brains.

01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:53.879
They survive situations.

01:00:53.879 --> 01:00:56.170
And they think, because they
don't understand the tool,

01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:57.430
they think, well, maybe
there was something I could

01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:58.570
have done, and they just--

01:00:58.570 --> 01:00:59.980
they guilt themselves.

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:02.200
When you understand
the tool of violence,

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.610
you also understand
when you're screwed.

01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:06.064
You understand
when, hey, there's

01:01:06.064 --> 01:01:07.480
nothing I can
potentially do here.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.655
And you're OK with it.

01:01:09.655 --> 01:01:12.294
I had one of my guys that
became an instructor later on.

01:01:12.294 --> 01:01:13.960
He was a manager at
a restaurant when he

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.820
was going through grad school.

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:18.070
Takes the trash out
with his busboy,

01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:20.080
comes back to a
guy with a shotgun.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.720
His first thought, the way
the guy's holding the shotgun,

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.800
I can take him.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.120
He has no idea of the angle.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.980
I can go in and I can take him.

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.050
But I'd better wait,
because I've got to see.

01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:30.070
I've got my whole
staff in there.

01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:31.420
I've got to see what's going on.

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:32.740
Goes in there, and sure enough.

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:36.040
Four more guys with shotguns,
staff all on the ground, prone.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.620
He gets down prone
on the ground, OK?

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:40.240
Realizes there's nothing to do.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.950
They comply with everything.

01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:43.820
Here's the difference.

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.560
Because he had been
training in this

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.476
and because he'd been
doing some of the things

01:01:47.476 --> 01:01:51.610
I'm asking you to
do, of the 30 people

01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:53.805
on staff that were
in that restaurant,

01:01:53.805 --> 01:01:55.810
prone on the ground,
he was the only one

01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:58.720
that didn't need psychological
counseling after.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.170
And he was the only one that
could identify the shooters,

01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:06.400
point them out in court down
to the identifying tattoos

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.360
on these individuals.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:07.860
Why?

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:09.340
Because he never gave up.

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.816
He was constantly looking.

01:02:10.816 --> 01:02:12.190
Really, there's
nothing I can do.

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:14.320
Yes, I can take this
guy, but I'm not

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.460
going to risk my people.

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.710
And he was OK with that.

01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:19.330
And that's the idea behind it.

01:02:19.330 --> 01:02:20.270
So I just want to
give you an example.

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:22.690
I don't want you to think that
we turn into these super ninjas

01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:23.650
and we always do things.

01:02:23.650 --> 01:02:24.190
No.

01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:26.652
But we're constantly
aware of our surroundings.

01:02:26.652 --> 01:02:27.860
We're aware of the situation.

01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:29.270
Understand how violence works.

01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:32.640
This particular situation,
too much of a risk.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.790
Not worth it.

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:35.510
You know?

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:36.635
And that's the value of it.

01:02:36.635 --> 01:02:38.426
That's the value of
looking at the subject.

01:02:38.426 --> 01:02:40.600
It does not make you
paranoid, I guarantee you.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.250
It doesn't make
you one of these,

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:44.140
like, these prepper
type of guys that

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:48.190
go around totally paranoid all
the time and backs to the wall.

01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:49.600
That's not what I want.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.860
What I want you to do is
just to understand that, hey.

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:54.370
This is how physical
violence works.

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:56.190
This is how they take
advantage of you.

01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:57.680
This is how predators
look at you.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:01.191
And oh, by the way, they're
just as susceptible to this as

01:03:01.191 --> 01:03:01.690
possible.

01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:04.720
And the example I
give on that is, OK.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.160
I have a fire gun.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.940
That guy that had the
gun in the video, OK?

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:16.720
If the bus was going 50 miles
an hour into a concrete pylon,

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.180
does that give
him any protection

01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:22.157
from physical violence, what
happens when that bus hits?

01:03:22.157 --> 01:03:23.740
Is he going to be
any better protected

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:26.020
that anybody else on there
that doesn't have a gun?

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:27.040
No.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.880
The only reason that
works is because he

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:31.930
can operate the tool.

01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:34.525
But as soon as you
injure him, he's

01:03:34.525 --> 01:03:37.150
not going to be able to operate
the tool anymore at that point.

01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:39.108
And I show people, and
I show examples of that,

01:03:39.108 --> 01:03:42.310
people using firearms on people
and also them being injured,

01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:45.100
and they can no longer operate
the firearm at that point.

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:48.190
The firearm itself doesn't
give any inherent power.

01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:50.910
My 25 years plus
of being a master

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:53.276
close combat instructor,
training Tier 1 groups,

01:03:53.276 --> 01:03:54.900
all of these other
groups I've trained,

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.390
amazing people all around
the world, agencies

01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:59.940
you probably haven't
heard of, and soccer moms.

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:01.020
Really great people.

01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:03.206
All that experience, I walk
right out the door here,

01:04:03.206 --> 01:04:04.830
I catch a pipe to
the back of the head,

01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:07.650
I go down just like
everybody else.

01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:10.260
My training doesn't
inoculate me.

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:12.180
But I accept that.

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:17.167
I understand that I'm human, and
this works just as well on me.

01:04:17.167 --> 01:04:18.750
And that's the beauty
of it, you know?

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:21.484
When we understand it like
that, we can take a Vegas event

01:04:21.484 --> 01:04:22.650
and we can make sense of it.

01:04:24.747 --> 01:04:25.580
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:04:28.855 --> 01:04:30.230
AUDIENCE: One more
question here.

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:33.860
So you're talking about all
of the response when there's

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:35.780
basically no plan B anymore.

01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:37.730
So I'm curious about,
either is training

01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:41.330
available to deal
with, I would say,

01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:43.460
medium threatening situations?

01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.069
For example, is it
like something is--

01:04:45.069 --> 01:04:46.610
the reason came up
with this question

01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:48.530
is if something were
to happen to me when

01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:51.080
I came to work
this morning, there

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:57.350
was a man sitting before me
who was making a pot in a bus.

01:04:57.350 --> 01:05:01.770
And the kids [INAUDIBLE] start
talking some nonsense to me.

01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:05.570
So in that case, you
know, for me, there was--

01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:08.120
a little bit threatening.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.000
He's apparently
high to an extent.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.860
How should people respond?

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:16.421
From even after the talk today,
I was [INAUDIBLE] for OK,

01:05:16.421 --> 01:05:18.170
is there a way we can
avert the situation?

01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:21.740
You know, just avoid it
as opposed to fight it.

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:23.660
So just either
training specifically

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:26.120
to deal with this medium
threatening situation where you

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.220
still have a chance to make a--

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:27.540
TIM LARKIN: Yeah.

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.050
When you're talking about an
individual who's probably high

01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:32.600
or on some sort of a heightened
substance or something

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.610
like that, you're
not going to be

01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:36.030
able to rationalize with them.

01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:38.120
And when you're in a closed
environment like that,

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.644
you know, it's kind of rare.

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:41.060
But it still meets
that threshold.

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:43.400
When there's still
communication going on,

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.240
it's still-- it's
anti-social aggression.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.100
We haven't really
talked about that.

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.545
Anti-social aggression
versus asocial violence.

01:05:48.545 --> 01:05:50.660
Asocial violence is
he's not talking at you.

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:53.145
He just literally comes down
and attacks you right away.

01:05:53.145 --> 01:05:54.697
That's the imminent--
you know, now

01:05:54.697 --> 01:05:57.030
we know that I need to respond
with the tool of violence

01:05:57.030 --> 01:05:58.670
to protect myself.

01:05:58.670 --> 01:06:01.100
What you're talking about is
that uncomfortable situation

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.440
where you don't
really have an exit,

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.557
but it's still
anti-social aggression.

01:06:05.557 --> 01:06:08.140
So you have to monitor it, and
you have to make that decision.

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:11.360
At any time if you feel
threatened, you know,

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.200
really physically
threatened for your body,

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.690
you may have to use
the tool of violence.

01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:16.400
You may have to
respond with violence.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.820
But it will always be--

01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:19.850
it'll be a question.

01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:21.500
You know, I don't know
what your threshold is,

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.125
where you feel-- you
know, my threshold

01:06:23.125 --> 01:06:25.400
might be different than
yours and different than his,

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:25.899
you know?

01:06:25.899 --> 01:06:27.650
We all have this
personal threshold.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.090
And so you have to understand.

01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:31.010
Oftentimes what
you're wrestling with

01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:34.295
is the idea that it was
really, really annoying,

01:06:34.295 --> 01:06:37.070
and you really wanted
to do something,

01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:39.840
and you weren't able to because
it wasn't the right time.

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.050
What I can tell everybody
is once you cross

01:06:42.050 --> 01:06:45.590
that physical plane and you
put your hands on somebody,

01:06:45.590 --> 01:06:48.455
you have no idea where
it's going to end up.

01:06:48.455 --> 01:06:50.330
And that's the one
thing-- you have to be OK.

01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:52.100
You have to be OK
with the fact that you

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:56.486
could end up killing a person or
they could end up killing you.

01:06:56.486 --> 01:06:57.860
And then I talk
about in the book

01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:00.087
this idea of the
three-day test, the event

01:07:00.087 --> 01:07:01.170
that you're responding to.

01:07:01.170 --> 01:07:03.189
Well, this event
that just happened,

01:07:03.189 --> 01:07:05.480
you're living your life right
now, three days from now,

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.385
will it matter to you?

01:07:07.385 --> 01:07:08.540
AUDIENCE: Probably not.

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:09.387
TIM LARKIN: Exactly.

01:07:09.387 --> 01:07:10.220
And that's the idea.

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:12.110
I mean, when you're asking me--

01:07:12.110 --> 01:07:15.260
what I ask my clients to do
is the event that bothers them

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:18.290
that they're talking about,
three days from now if you're

01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:21.361
sitting in a jail cell
or you're six feet under,

01:07:21.361 --> 01:07:23.610
will you look at the situation
and say, you know what?

01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:24.735
There's nothing I could do.

01:07:24.735 --> 01:07:26.270
I had to respond that way.

01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:28.069
Very few things
meet that threshold.

01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:30.110
And this is how I'm saying
the behavioral change.

01:07:30.110 --> 01:07:31.568
You're still going
to feel annoyed.

01:07:31.568 --> 01:07:33.920
How do you think I felt
when I was being humiliated

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.580
by this guy who I probably
could have just destroyed

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:39.320
in front of my son?

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.282
You know?

01:07:40.282 --> 01:07:42.740
Oh, by the way, I forgot to
tell you the last part of that.

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:44.073
I was going to train my seminar.

01:07:44.073 --> 01:07:45.590
That's how I opened
up my seminar.

01:07:45.590 --> 01:07:47.570
I want you to understand,
I understand, guys.

01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:49.350
It just happened to me.

01:07:49.350 --> 01:07:51.461
And I put that in,
because I felt--

01:07:51.461 --> 01:07:53.710
even with all my training,
I still feel like, oh, God.

01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:55.550
It would have been
good to respond.

01:07:55.550 --> 01:07:57.920
It would have been
ego-justifying just

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.330
to respond so my son could
sit there and say, wow.

01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:01.720
Dad, that was great, you know?

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:02.930
And then I'm thinking
about that going, really?

01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:04.971
I want my son to see me
beating down on somebody?

01:08:04.971 --> 01:08:08.210
You know, it's these things
that we get caught up in.

01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:09.830
But recognizing that.

01:08:09.830 --> 01:08:12.900
This is a situation where you
felt probably a little bit

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:14.150
like should have taken action.

01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:16.483
You might have felt like the
guy was invading your space

01:08:16.483 --> 01:08:18.260
and threatening
you, and that you

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.760
need to respond to the threat.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.680
But it didn't reach
that threshold,

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.550
and you've got to
be OK with that.

01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:25.220
I have to be OK with
being called names.

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:27.830
I have to be OK with
my ego being bruised.

01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:31.729
I have to be OK
with looking weak.

01:08:31.729 --> 01:08:36.109
I give myself that
permission to do that.

01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:37.939
As soon as it crosses
the point where

01:08:37.939 --> 01:08:40.520
it's imminent danger and
it's grievous bodily harm,

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.859
I'm the first one
to take action.

01:08:42.859 --> 01:08:45.120
But until it gets
to that point, I'm

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.700
not going to pull that trigger.

01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.300
You know, it's just my
personal way of doing it.

01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:49.760
Now there are a lot of
people in my industry

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:50.930
that will talk about bar fights.

01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:52.805
They'll talk about all
this ridiculous stuff.

01:08:52.805 --> 01:08:56.000
And I'm just telling you
right now, any of that stuff

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.360
will literally-- it's
just a ticket to dealing

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.500
with the legal system.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.479
It's just never
worth it, you know?

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:06.620
And I'm shocked at some
of the guys that actually

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.559
propose that kind of stuff.

01:09:08.559 --> 01:09:10.100
You know, that's
why-- how this says,

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:12.220
a very narrow
definition of violence

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:13.550
will save you wear and tear.

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:14.720
It may even save your life.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.303
And that's it.

01:09:15.303 --> 01:09:18.140
You've got to have that narrow
definition of when you'd ever

01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:18.767
do it.

01:09:18.767 --> 01:09:20.600
The de-escalation that
you're talking about,

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.439
it's a verbal technique.

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:22.897
There are a lot of
groups out there

01:09:22.897 --> 01:09:26.020
that'll teach you verbal
engagement, de-escalation,

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:28.090
anger management, all
those types of things.

01:09:28.090 --> 01:09:31.917
And those may be good
things for you to employ.

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:34.000
But as far as the tool of
violence, unfortunately,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.910
we have this really narrow
window when we ever, ever

01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:39.819
want to use it and
still stay citizens,

01:09:39.819 --> 01:09:42.310
so we still stay productive
citizens that way.

01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:45.247
I know it's not the answer you
wanted, but I hope it helped.

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:46.330
AUDIENCE: Actually, just--

01:09:46.330 --> 01:09:47.038
TIM LARKIN: Sure.

01:09:47.038 --> 01:09:49.080
AUDIENCE: I just got a
small follow-up here.

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.191
Would it ever, for example--

01:09:51.191 --> 01:09:53.649
you know, let's say there is
a psychological threshold that

01:09:53.649 --> 01:09:54.760
has been breached.

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:57.250
Would there ever be any
cases where it justifies

01:09:57.250 --> 01:09:59.304
the preemptive action?

01:09:59.304 --> 01:10:00.160
TIM LARKIN: Yeah.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.660
So that's a great question.

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:04.480
And everybody's
justification is there.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.940
If you feel imminent
grievous bodily

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:11.050
harm, if you truly feel your
life is in danger, then yes,

01:10:11.050 --> 01:10:12.500
of course.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.310
AUDIENCE: My question
is that even from, like,

01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:17.050
case's perspective.

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:21.500
What are the odds of
taking preemptive actions?

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:24.550
I mean, it's one thing to think,
OK, you know, it's justified.

01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:27.220
But in reality, it might turn
out to be the other way, right?

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:28.810
TIM LARKIN: The reason
I give the threshold

01:10:28.810 --> 01:10:30.274
that I give is
because when you get

01:10:30.274 --> 01:10:31.690
into the legal
system on something

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:33.460
like that, what
you're talking about,

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:36.130
now you're turning it
over to the legal system.

01:10:36.130 --> 01:10:38.920
What I want to
achieve is that when

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:41.200
the police show up to
whatever the event is

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.900
that you're talking
about that it ends there.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:47.560
That they have the interview
with you, and they feel,

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:48.730
great, you know?

01:10:48.730 --> 01:10:50.320
He You were
absolutely justified,

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.557
and everybody says that.

01:10:51.557 --> 01:10:53.390
Meaning the event that
you're talking about,

01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:55.098
whatever you're thinking
about right now,

01:10:55.098 --> 01:10:59.980
hopefully you have corroborating
witnesses that say, yes, he

01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:00.760
was doing nothing.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:01.960
He was trying to disengage.

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.043
This person kept coming,
kept coming, kept coming,

01:11:04.043 --> 01:11:06.670
was verbally threatening,
was aggressively

01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:09.610
coming and threatening
physical harm at that point,

01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:11.920
and you were totally
justified in what you did.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.421
And that's where
you want to end it.

01:11:13.421 --> 01:11:15.336
But the legal system,
you have to be prepared.

01:11:15.336 --> 01:11:17.110
If I'm going to use
the tool of violence,

01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:20.620
I have to be prepared to
understand that I may face

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:22.970
legal ramifications on that.

01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:24.220
And I have to be OK with that.

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:27.190
That's why it's so important
to have that definition that

01:11:27.190 --> 01:11:30.080
works for you, when it would
ever be appropriate for you.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.080
And the more you
look at the subject,

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.480
the easier it is to
come to that conclusion,

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:38.110
because you start realizing
very few things in your life

01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:40.438
meet that threshold.

01:11:40.438 --> 01:11:41.896
OK?

01:11:41.896 --> 01:11:42.868
Yes, sir?

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:50.410
AUDIENCE: Oh, this is cool.

01:11:50.410 --> 01:11:54.465
So like, similar situation
where someone was threatening--

01:11:54.465 --> 01:11:55.840
I guess my sister's
boyfriend was

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.940
threatening me and my family.

01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:00.520
And he just got too close
to my personal space,

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:04.450
so I felt like I needed to
take action, which I did.

01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:06.430
And his friends
showed up as well,

01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:08.590
and the cops showed up as well.

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:11.590
But they weren't able
to differentiate me

01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:13.710
from my sister's friends.

01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:18.550
So I was assaulted by the
police and my sister's friends.

01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:22.075
So in cases like
those, would you--

01:12:22.075 --> 01:12:25.090
how would you go about handling
those sorts of things when

01:12:25.090 --> 01:12:27.910
your family is in danger, but
then when the authorities do

01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:33.840
show up, they end up taking out
sort of more violence on you?

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.970
Because I couldn't fight back.

01:12:36.970 --> 01:12:40.330
TIM LARKIN: So I'm going to give
you an answer that you probably

01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:43.330
won't like, but it's how
these guys handle it, OK?

01:12:43.330 --> 01:12:45.790
What's really
interesting is my wife

01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:47.320
has told me this numerous times.

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:50.230
And again, you know, I
understand there are bad cops.

01:12:50.230 --> 01:12:51.535
There's all of that.

01:12:51.535 --> 01:12:55.340
And there's no justification
for that at all.

01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:57.100
But the reality is this.

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:58.840
When one of these
guys normally gets

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:00.980
pulled over or
anything like that,

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:03.580
they're completely
compliant right away.

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:07.150
Meaning the younger guys, the
guys coming up and all that,

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:08.470
they don't--

01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:13.000
a guy like the two guys
you heard, their whole idea

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.909
is, my lawyer's going
to take care of this.

01:13:14.909 --> 01:13:17.200
And they're hoping the cops
are going to be aggressive.

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.283
They're hoping the cops
are going to do something,

01:13:19.283 --> 01:13:21.712
because they're two steps ahead.

01:13:21.712 --> 01:13:23.670
They're thinking about
talking to their lawyer.

01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:25.637
They're thinking about
what the situation is,

01:13:25.637 --> 01:13:26.470
and the whole thing.

01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:28.030
So they're going
to endure whatever

01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:29.920
they're enduring right
now, and then they're

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.605
going to let their legal
mouthpiece tell the story.

01:13:32.605 --> 01:13:34.480
And that's the thing I
try to tell everybody.

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.240
There is never a good--

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.282
listen.

01:13:37.282 --> 01:13:38.740
Say it isn't
authorities, you know?

01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:40.870
Say it's third world
countries that I've done.

01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:42.940
I've had Federales
beat the hell out of me

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:44.680
when I was surfing
down in Mexico, when

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.930
I was in high school, you know?

01:13:46.930 --> 01:13:49.090
But we were compliant.

01:13:49.090 --> 01:13:51.322
We realized the situation
for what it was.

01:13:51.322 --> 01:13:52.780
We were able to
get out and we were

01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:55.660
able to take care of ourselves.

01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:59.560
There's never a value in a
situation like that for you,

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.254
unless truly your
life is in danger.

01:14:01.254 --> 01:14:02.920
Meaning they're beating
you to the point

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:05.665
to where you feel like if you
don't fight back, you're dead.

01:14:05.665 --> 01:14:06.574
Then yeah.

01:14:06.574 --> 01:14:07.990
That's where you
would fight back.

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:10.357
But the best approach
that I learned--

01:14:10.357 --> 01:14:11.440
it was really interesting.

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.419
The more I studied these
guys, the more they

01:14:13.419 --> 01:14:14.710
absolutely look at it that way.

01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:16.970
They look at the police as, OK.

01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:19.840
You're just the delivery
system and the legal system,

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.154
and I've got a lawyer
that I'm going to talk to.

01:14:22.154 --> 01:14:24.070
And that's where I'm
going to deal with what's

01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:26.230
going on here at that point.

01:14:26.230 --> 01:14:28.270
And whatever just
happened here, the reason

01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:32.150
you showed up to get me, I'll
deal with these guys later.

01:14:32.150 --> 01:14:34.720
But I'm going to let
my lawyer talk on that.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.900
And when you make that
leap, it's empowering.

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:39.100
It's really empowering.

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:43.570
Because anything
that was unjustified,

01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:47.540
you've done nothing in that
situation to exacerbate it.

01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:49.660
And now you have a
really powerful stick

01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:52.660
if you use it correctly with
the legal aspect of things.

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:55.450
And this is even when
using a public defender.

01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:57.072
You can get that on there.

01:14:57.072 --> 01:14:58.780
It's not the answer
that's right, though.

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:00.030
It's not the justified answer.

01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:01.240
AUDIENCE: No, I get that.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.824
And I get what you're saying,
like, completely be compliant.

01:15:03.824 --> 01:15:05.990
Like, I've been in situations
where, you know, hands

01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.910
on the steering wheel.

01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:09.285
Yes, I'm willing to
comply with whatever.

01:15:09.285 --> 01:15:11.200
They came into this
situation thinking--

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:15.070
because my mom is white,
so they thought we were--

01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:17.290
I didn't really get a
chance to explain what

01:15:17.290 --> 01:15:18.700
was happening to the police.

01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:20.199
TIM LARKIN: They
jumped right into--

01:15:20.199 --> 01:15:23.350
AUDIENCE: And so I'm saying if
you were able to rewind back

01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:25.090
in time and you were
in that situation

01:15:25.090 --> 01:15:26.673
where your family
was being threatened

01:15:26.673 --> 01:15:30.580
on your property, what
actions would you have taken?

01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:32.200
TIM LARKIN: I don't know.

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.700
I would have to
be in that moment.

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.435
I mean, if I truly felt--

01:15:35.435 --> 01:15:37.780
I have to make that
decision ahead of time.

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.680
You know, if I truly
felt that people

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:44.122
are facing that imminent,
grievous bodily harm danger,

01:15:44.122 --> 01:15:46.870
I'm going to be OK being in
that jail cell, you know?

01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:48.970
It's a decision
I've already made,

01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:50.440
but man, it's a high threshold.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:53.930
It really has to be there
before I do anything like that.

01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:57.460
And the one thing I've
learned is also verbally

01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:58.840
not escalating with it.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:02.620
You know, I get really
calm when people go.

01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:06.012
Because the more aggravated
they get, your response there--

01:16:06.012 --> 01:16:07.720
it's this counterintuitive
thing that you

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.679
start doing that really
works on communication.

01:16:09.679 --> 01:16:11.094
People talk about
it all the time,

01:16:11.094 --> 01:16:12.910
but it's really hard
to do in the moment.

01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:15.500
And you have to train
yourself to respond that way.

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:16.570
You know?

01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:18.370
But that's a great
question, you know?

01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:22.834
SPEAKER 1: All right, guys.

01:16:22.834 --> 01:16:24.320
Thank you so much
for coming out.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:24.820
Tim.

01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:25.700
TIM LARKIN: Thank you very much.

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:26.440
I really appreciate it.

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:26.940
I was great.

01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:27.940
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:30.090
Good questions.
