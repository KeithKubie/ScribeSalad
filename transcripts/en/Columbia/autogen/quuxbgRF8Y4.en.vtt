and user driven innovation and I just

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829
and user driven innovation and I just
 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.590
and user driven innovation and I just
want to give you a user-driven because

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600
want to give you a user-driven because

there's a wonderful NGO NGO positive
deviance and they go into communities

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619
deviance and they go into communities
 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.639
deviance and they go into communities
and villages all over the world

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649
and villages all over the world
 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.710
and villages all over the world
particularly in the developing world and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720
particularly in the developing world and
 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.310
particularly in the developing world and
they try to determine what behaviors are

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320
they try to determine what behaviors are
 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.289

everybody else is failing why are some
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.969
everybody else is failing why are some
people the positive deviance and what's

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
people the positive deviance and what's
 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.440
people the positive deviance and what's
interesting is that there are all well

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450
interesting is that there are all well
 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.020
interesting is that there are all well
trained anthropologists so that they're

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030
trained anthropologists so that they're
 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.240
trained anthropologists so that they're
taking their skills their academic

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250
taking their skills their academic
 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.520
taking their skills their academic
skills as anthropologists to observe and

skills as anthropologists to observe and
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.280
skills as anthropologists to observe and
learn from what people are doing and my

learn from what people are doing and my
 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.109
learn from what people are doing and my
favorite vignette and how we came to

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119
favorite vignette and how we came to
 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.969
favorite vignette and how we came to
know them because we do a lot of work in

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979
know them because we do a lot of work in
 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.620
know them because we do a lot of work in
Vietnam is they went into a village

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630
Vietnam is they went into a village
 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.660
Vietnam is they went into a village
Vietnam and they saw a couple of kids

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670
Vietnam and they saw a couple of kids
 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.120
Vietnam and they saw a couple of kids
who were really quite well nourished

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130
who were really quite well nourished
 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.980
who were really quite well nourished
against a background of desperate

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990
against a background of desperate
 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.110
against a background of desperate
malnutrition in the rest of the children

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120
malnutrition in the rest of the children
 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.150
malnutrition in the rest of the children
and so they observed the families and

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160
and so they observed the families and
 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.040
and so they observed the families and
the children of the wet with no

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050
the children of the wet with no
 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.470
the children of the wet with no
apophysis but just wanted to learn from

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480
apophysis but just wanted to learn from
 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.450
apophysis but just wanted to learn from
them you talked about one way having

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460
them you talked about one way having
 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.060
them you talked about one way having
them tell you but they use their

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070
them tell you but they use their
 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.590
them tell you but they use their
anthropological observational skills

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600
anthropological observational skills
 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.630
anthropological observational skills
which is another way and they found that

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640
which is another way and they found that
 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.180
which is another way and they found that
in those families the mothers didn't

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190
in those families the mothers didn't
 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.670
in those families the mothers didn't
wash the little crabs and shrimp that

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680
wash the little crabs and shrimp that
 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.100
wash the little crabs and shrimp that
are in the rice paddies out of the rice

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110
are in the rice paddies out of the rice
 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.500
are in the rice paddies out of the rice
before they cooked it so they were the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510
before they cooked it so they were the
 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.780
before they cooked it so they were the
only kids in the community who were

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790
only kids in the community who were
 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.750
only kids in the community who were
getting protein in what was otherwise a

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760
getting protein in what was otherwise a
 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.930
getting protein in what was otherwise a
completely rice diet then they just

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940
completely rice diet then they just
 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.820
completely rice diet then they just
generalized that to the rest of the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830
generalized that to the rest of the
 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.830
generalized that to the rest of the
community they taught the observation to

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840
community they taught the observation to
 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.930
community they taught the observation to
the others and they began to really

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940
the others and they began to really
 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.660
the others and they began to really
influence the nutritional status of all

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670
influence the nutritional status of all
 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.270
influence the nutritional status of all
of the children in the community not the

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280
of the children in the community not the
 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.510
of the children in the community not the
experts not even with knowledge did they

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520
experts not even with knowledge did they
 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.530
experts not even with knowledge did they
do that when the mothers were

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540
do that when the mothers were
 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.390
do that when the mothers were
interviewed they didn't really think

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400
interviewed they didn't really think
 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.850
interviewed they didn't really think
they were doing it for protein so all of

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860
they were doing it for protein so all of
 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.880
they were doing it for protein so all of
these ideas about observing the people

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890
these ideas about observing the people
 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.940
these ideas about observing the people
observing the users listening to the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950
observing the users listening to the
 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.750
observing the users listening to the
crowd it's very hard we are trained to

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760
crowd it's very hard we are trained to
 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.000
crowd it's very hard we are trained to
be experts and the more well-educated we

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010
be experts and the more well-educated we
 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.820
be experts and the more well-educated we
are the more expert we are and so how do

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830
are the more expert we are and so how do
 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.670
are the more expert we are and so how do
you pull back from that expert model

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680
you pull back from that expert model
 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.730
you pull back from that expert model
when you're in that service mode and

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740
when you're in that service mode and
 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.760
when you're in that service mode and
really learn from the bottom up is kind

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770
really learn from the bottom up is kind
 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.980
really learn from the bottom up is kind
of unlearning some of the skills that

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990
of unlearning some of the skills that
 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.480
of unlearning some of the skills that
we've been taught and that we're

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490
we've been taught and that we're
 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.380
we've been taught and that we're
reinforced for having right yeah right
