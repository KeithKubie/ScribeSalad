00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.740
Ok, so we are going for a ride around the pyramids.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.020
The great pyramid was the tallest man made structure

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.080
for nearly 4000 years.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.980
Only surpassed by a large margin by the Eiffel Tower in 1889.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.660
147 metres high

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.420
You are interested by climbing?

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.520
Yeah! Let's climb it!

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.760
But is not free.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.820
How much?

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.460
What makes the pyramids even more impressive,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.560
is that these structures were built over 4500 years ago,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.520
when Egyptians didn't have wheels or steel.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.980
The only metal available was copper and copper alloys.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.160
It took about 2 million stones to build that pyramid.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.700
Well, I call them stonesâ€”giant rocks.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.260
Somewhere between 1.5 - 3 tons each

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.480
Pyramids took about 20 - 30 years to make.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.240
That's a long time, but if you think about the number of stones,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.980
a couple million stones in every pyramid,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.700
you'd have to be laying a stone roughly once every...

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.520
3 minutes.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.240
If you consider a regular work day, like a 10 hour, 12 hour work day.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.740
Nobody knows how they built it. Still secret.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.440
But a lot of people just try to do the best to give you some information about how they did it.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.620
But we must say it's secret.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.400
The dead and the thing that sealed them.
Nobody knows.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.240
No plans survived to show us how the pyramids were built,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.440
so perhaps it's not surprising that this is the subject of countless conspiracy theories

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.920
involving aliens, time travel, or lost technologies.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.060
But there is a less far-fetched myth which has become widely accepted,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.460
that the pyramids were built by slaves.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.540
But recent discoveries suggest that the pyramid builders were not slaves at all.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.460
They were skilled workers.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.100
Well-preserved tombs near the pyramids suggest that their hard labour and sacrifice were rewarded.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.940
If these workers had been slaves, they would not have received such honourable burials.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.980
But how did they actually manage to build the pyramids?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.400
One of the things I find really interesting is that the Egyptians didn't know about wheels,

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.740
so they didn't really even use rollers, as far as we can tell.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.860
I mean, these rocks would have been carted across the desert on sleds.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.000
There's a famous diagram of this giant statue being pulled by 172 men,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.940
and that, that statue would have weighed somewhere on the order of 68 tons, or something.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.940
This would normally create a lot of friction,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.500
but the sand was wetted in front of the sled.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.380
Experiments show this would reduce the pulling force required by half.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.700
The internal stones of this pyramid are all limestone,

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.280
which is a bit softer and easier to work.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.020
You can imagine them working it with those copper chisels that they had.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.860
Some of these blocks may have been actually sawed through using copper saws.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.720
Now you wouldn't think that copper could really cut the rock,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.200
but if you put an abrasive in there, like a sand, you could actually wear away the stone.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.640
It would probably be a very difficult and labour-intensive job.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.220
Something that you don't really think about is that when you build a pyramid you need to build it on level ground.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.880
You can actually see there how they had to level out that ground.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.540
Well it's speculated that when the Nile flooded,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.100
they put the flood water into a channel and see where the high parts were.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.760
So the inside was made of this limestone. The outside of this pyramid was actually made of granite.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.560
Much harder stone.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.340
I'm at the granite quarry in Aswan

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.280
where they would have quarried the stones that were used in the pyramids at Giza.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.720
Now that is an incredible feat because this is nearly 1000 km away from Giza,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.520
and when the Nile flooded, water would come right through here

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.240
so that they could move all the stones quarried here,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.220
this granite,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.620
they could move this back up to Giza and use it on the pyramids.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.260
These would of had to have been floated down on rafts.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.260
Now quarrying this would have been really hard.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.560
Granite is one of the hardest rocks because it contains quartz,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.280
and quartz on the hardness scale is about a 7, where diamond is a 10.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.820
So how would you dig a massive trench like that?

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.380
Basically the technique was just to smash the dolerite  rock into the granite

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.040
over,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.160
and over,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.160
and over, again.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.260
They would make about 5 mm progress per hour.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.020
So there is no clear account of how the pyramids were actually built,

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.720
but the best guess is that ramps were used.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.720
And in fact some ramps have been found on incomplete pyramids.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.140
But you can't build just a straight ramp, a long straight ramp, and keep putting the rocks up.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.860
I mean the problem with that is the ramp actually ends up taking up more material than the pyramid itself.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.260
I think a ramp which sort of wraps around the pyramids is probably the most likely thing.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.500
The top third of the height of the pyramid actually only accounts for about 4% of all the material in the pyramid.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.040
That's why it's suspected that levers were actually used to finish off the pyramid, to do the top levels.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.600
Now the pyramids have clearly weathered,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.180
but in the past they would have been

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.460
a brighter white because they would have used a white limestone to cover the whole face of that pyramid.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.400
And then the very top may have been covered with electrum,

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.820
which is a mixture of gold and silver,

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.500
so you can imagine, that would be a pretty spectacular sight.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.540
The reason these pyramids are shaped this way

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.500
is so they represent sun rays.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.100
Imagine what that would have looked like when it was first built:

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.620
With a shiny metallic top,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.560
and smooth white finish on all of the sides.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.500
I think that would have been a sight to behold.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.140
Hey! I hope you enjoyed that video,

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.400
I filmed it earlier this year when I was in Egypt.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.360
Now I'm currently in Melbourne, Australia and tomorrow I am flying to the US.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.600
In fact next week I'm actually doing a live show in Alabama with Henry from Minute Physics,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.960
Dustin from Smarter Every Day,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.160
Brady Haran from Numberphile, Periodic Videos, and Sixty Symbols,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.980
and CGP Grey from CGP Grey.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.840
Yes, he will actually be there in person,

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.840
so if you want to come and join us, then checkout the link in the doobly doo.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.400
You know on all of these long flights I always need something to help me pass the time,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.980
and I know what I'm going to be doing tomorrow,

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.740
I'll be listening to the brand new audio book from Bill Nye.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.480
The book is called Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.700
and he actually narrates this book himself,

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.020
so I can't wait to listen to it.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.400
And if you want, you can download this book for free by going to audible.com/Veritasium

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.360
or you can pick any other book of your choosing for a 1 month free trial.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.920
So I really want to thank Audible for their support,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.120
they've helped me go to all of these amazing places,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.460
and they have hundreds of thousands of audio books,

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.180
so if you love audio books you should definitely try them out.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.540
So thank you for watching and hopefully I will see you next week.
