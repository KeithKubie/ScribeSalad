Just like you right hand and left hands, both have 5 fingers but look different,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.456
coordinate systems also have an orientation to them. We need to find a set of

00:00:08.456 --> 00:00:12.062
axes. You also need to specify one other fact, whether the axes are in

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:16.100
right-handed or in left-handed system. Here's an example of a right-handed

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.763
coordinate system. Say, I want to build a building. I define the x-axis as going

00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:25.902
east and the y-axis as going north. Now, my floor plan shows x pointing right, y

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:29.882
pointing up. This is the standard 2D Cartesian coordinate system. If I had to

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:34.106
find altitude as the z-axis with the arrow coming out of the diagram towards the

00:00:34.106 --> 00:00:38.410
viewer, this is a right-handed coordinate system. Why is this right-handed?

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.883
Well, if you place your thumb along the x-axis and the index finger along the

00:00:42.883 --> 00:00:47.500
y-axis, the middle finger is the z-axis and points towards you. You'll notice if

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.965
you try to do the same thing with your left hand, you can't match up all 3 axes,

00:00:50.965 --> 00:00:55.230
at least not comfortably. This is a left-handed coordinate system. The key thing

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.584
to realize is that the left-handed coordinate system is equally valid. It does

00:00:58.584 --> 00:01:02.444
not change the underlying reality of, of the situation. For example, intelligent

00:01:02.444 --> 00:01:06.940
rabbits might agree that x is east and y is north, that's fine. However, they

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.704
might decide that the z-axis points down into the page. The rabbits care more

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:15.184
about how far down a tunnel is dug from ground level and want to say 5 feet,

00:01:15.184 --> 00:01:18.716
instead of negative 5 feet when they're digging. This is a left-handed

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:22.672
coordinate system. The underlying reality is the same in both cases, nothing has

00:01:22.672 --> 00:01:26.948
changed place, just how we and the rabbits refer to location differs. When we

00:01:26.948 --> 00:01:30.672
say 12 meters, the rabbits would say, negative 12 meters and vice-versa. To

00:01:30.672 --> 00:01:34.759
convert between these particular two systems is simply a matter of negating the

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:35.933
z-coordinate value.
