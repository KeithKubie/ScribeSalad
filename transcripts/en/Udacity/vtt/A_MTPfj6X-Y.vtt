00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.520
In this lesson we learned a lot of

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.590
new information about human ancestry and evolution, so let's

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.560
see if we can summarize these concepts into

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.900
seven main points. Point one, genomic sampling from SNV

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.730
or Single Nucleotide Variant regions of the genome is enough for us to trace

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.290
ancestry and evolution. Point two, IBS or Identity By State scores

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.140
use individual SNVs to determine genetic identity. Point three. IBD

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.430
or Identity by Decent scores incorporate SNVs that

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.410
are shared along the length or a segment

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.710
of a chromosome to help us determine genetic

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.000
relatedness. Not genetic identity. Point four. SNV comparisons across

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.080
the genome are really useful to help us

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.810
find close relatives. Or connect us with geographic

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.840
populations. Or even trace our deep ancestry. Point

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.470
five. The Y and mitochondrial chromosomes, our paternal and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.290
maternal lines, actually suggest a human evolution out of Africa. Point six. The

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.940
great human expansion out of Africa experienced

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.320
many genomic bottlenecks at every major point

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.160
of colinization. And point seven. Human chromosome

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.790
two is actually a fusion of two

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.290
smaller chromosomes, shared by all great apes,

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.370
particularly our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees.
