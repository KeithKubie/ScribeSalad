well the primary objective of the World

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179
well the primary objective of the World
 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.810
well the primary objective of the World
Bank is to help developing countries

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820
Bank is to help developing countries
 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.580
Bank is to help developing countries
grow and develop and our main objective

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590
grow and develop and our main objective
 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.340
grow and develop and our main objective
is to help countries reduce poverty so

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350
is to help countries reduce poverty so
 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.900
is to help countries reduce poverty so
the World Bank has a long history of

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
the World Bank has a long history of
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.179
the World Bank has a long history of
working in China on different types of

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189
working in China on different types of
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.970
working in China on different types of
projects that have helped reduce poverty

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980
projects that have helped reduce poverty
 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.710
projects that have helped reduce poverty
but personally I interpret this mandate

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720
but personally I interpret this mandate
 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.380
but personally I interpret this mandate
quite broadly I moved to China three

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390
quite broadly I moved to China three
 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.689
quite broadly I moved to China three
years ago for this assignment and I've

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699
years ago for this assignment and I've
 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.880
years ago for this assignment and I've
come to think that the key challenge the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890
come to think that the key challenge the
 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.889
come to think that the key challenge the
China faces is really Environmental

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899
China faces is really Environmental
 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.139
China faces is really Environmental
Management natural resource scarcity

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149
Management natural resource scarcity
 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.560
Management natural resource scarcity
water energy these key resource issues

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
water energy these key resource issues
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.260
water energy these key resource issues
so i think that the impressive poverty

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270
so i think that the impressive poverty
 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.959
so i think that the impressive poverty
reduction that china has achieved is not

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
reduction that china has achieved is not
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.819
reduction that china has achieved is not
going to be sustainable unless china

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829
going to be sustainable unless china
 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.170
going to be sustainable unless china
really comes to grip with these

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
really comes to grip with these
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.569
really comes to grip with these
environmental challenges so on a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579
environmental challenges so on a
 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.880
environmental challenges so on a
practical level I've you know tried to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890
practical level I've you know tried to
 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.799
practical level I've you know tried to
shift our world bank program to support

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809
shift our world bank program to support
 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.420
shift our world bank program to support
a lot of different environmental

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
a lot of different environmental
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.410
a lot of different environmental
activities in China in the water sector

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420
activities in China in the water sector
 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.510
activities in China in the water sector
developing new energy sources now for

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
developing new energy sources now for
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.789
developing new energy sources now for
example we financed the first big wind

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799
example we financed the first big wind
 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.880
example we financed the first big wind
power wind power station in China and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
power wind power station in China and
 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.740
power wind power station in China and
demonstrated that this is economically

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
demonstrated that this is economically
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.649
demonstrated that this is economically
viable we finance different types of

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659
viable we finance different types of
 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.260
viable we finance different types of
clean energy technologies so I guess I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
clean energy technologies so I guess I
 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.480
clean energy technologies so I guess I
see what I'm doing is working with

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
see what I'm doing is working with
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.460
see what I'm doing is working with
Chinese partners to help them address

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470
Chinese partners to help them address
 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.160
Chinese partners to help them address
some of their key challenges and that

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170
some of their key challenges and that
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.990
some of their key challenges and that
goes beyond environment but a lot of our

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000
goes beyond environment but a lot of our
 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.760
goes beyond environment but a lot of our
work now is focused on the environmental

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770
work now is focused on the environmental
 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.740
work now is focused on the environmental
area

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
 
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.810
