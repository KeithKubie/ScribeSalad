DAVID VAN OSS &gt;&gt; Hi, may name's David Van
Oss from PRTN Management Consultants. I'm

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.740
here in Davos. In regards to whether or not
the economy or the environment will win out

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:21.790
in 2009, I think the answer is that probably
it will. But if economic metrics fully captured

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.250
the cost of the environment, then you would
see some of the contradictions that we face

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.880
disappear.
The other thing that's absolutely critical

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.230
in driving that discussion forward is the
extent to which governments prepare to intervene

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.120
in the enterprise. When you look-if you look
at things like blogging, if you look at things

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.240
like the exploitation of water resources,
if you looked at-ah-countless other environmental

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:51.360
issues, you'd find that-ah-the roll of governments
in producing transferable and tradable-ah-economically

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.530
rational outcomes is critical. Ah-if we can
get that right, then some of these contradictions

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.260
are going to disappear.
