You are listening to radiolab radiolab

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.593
from

3
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.780
W. N. Y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.700
This is radio lab. The podcast at it is, it is almost new years. Actually,

5
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.440
we were recording this a few hours before New Year's Eve. Well, it's not a few.

6
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:29.820
I mean today's Monday, tomorrow night, so 20 hours. We have 50 hours left. No,

7
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.900
any less than that 20 well, whatever. I just, because it's that time of year,

8
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:37.890
I want to tell you a story about a discovery I made it or not me.

9
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:39.390
I just learned about it from other people,

10
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:44.160
but it has made me completely reconsider what a year means and specifically how

11
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:46.770
big a year really is.

12
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.350
How big a year it, what, how big a year really is.

13
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.270
I don't know what, how, how is a year?

14
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.600
How long have you or confused now I think I can confuse you even more.

15
00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:01.500
I'm going to begin this investigation by introducing new two little creature in

16
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:03.210
the sea called a coral

17
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.930
<v 1>corals. Is Shelly animal a little creature? It's a, there's Antiel Schupan.</v>

18
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.950
I'm a paleontologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago,

19
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.500
just like a clam has an animal. Clamshell has an animal inside it.

20
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.120
So if two corals, a little fleshy wormy thing. Exactly.

21
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:21.540
And it wears it skeleton on the outside and because they sit in the same place

22
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:25.410
for their whole life, they're really sensitive to local environmental changes.

23
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.970
Meaning what I think about it this way, let's just just start.

24
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.190
Think about what happens to a creature as it lives its life in the ocean.

25
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.490
The water, which is what these things do. You know,

26
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.190
we live in a world of cycles of cycles on cycles. Temperature rises and falls.

27
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.230
A light rises and falls.

28
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.680
The tides rise and falls several times in the course of a day.

29
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.540
So you think about what that means for creatures living in water.

30
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.540
What it means for corals as Neil is that they're growing.

31
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.580
They're slapping on new skeleton, if you will,

32
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:55.520
new shell in time with these cycles,

33
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.290
<v 0>rise and fall and light and dark, hot and cold. And hello. Hello.</v>

34
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.010
Hi. You can actually see these changes written onto their shells,

35
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.610
maybe into their shells.

36
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.490
And that's why Andy Mills and I called up our pal Emily Grassley,

37
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.700
who's job is a chief curiosity correspondent of the field museum in Chicago.

38
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.140
That's your actual title, the chief curiosity correspondent? Yes, it is you.

39
00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:22.730
You brought some corals, did you? We have many corals.

40
00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:27.260
We have corals all over the a studio task right now. All right.

41
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.430
All right, let's cut. Cut It.

42
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.053
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

43
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.990
<v 0>because when you cut into these shells, oh,</v>

44
00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:41.190
it's warm and a little bit of water. We can spritz it on there to cool it off.

45
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.040
Right off. You can see a pattern.

46
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.450
You see these gray stripes and they're all,

47
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:50.910
I mean they're all different variations of gray,

48
00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:53.550
but some are really dark gray and some are are Tan.

49
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.000
They're like bans running either through or across the chef.

50
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:01.170
They kind of radiate out like the bands of a tree and between the bands there,

51
00:03:01.171 --> 00:03:01.690
there are

52
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.400
<v 3>basis. If you've got a stripe,</v>

53
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.480
then a space stripe and a space striped and space.

54
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.950
<v 0>But when you hold it up close to your eye,</v>

55
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.520
if you look closer in between the stripes you can see of,

56
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.270
<v 4>wow, you can see the wines. Wow.</v>

57
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.620
You can see that the spaces are filled with, with faint little lines.

58
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.880
And that's where the piece of this story is just so fascinating because in 1962

59
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.370
a paleontologist professor John Wells was looking at some corals just like the,

60
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.720
he's, he was just sitting there saying, okay,

61
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:36.670
well what can we figure out from coral shells?

62
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.790
So what he did is he did something really simple. He says, well, I'm Golly Gee,

63
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.960
what am I count

64
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.040
<v 0>the number of little lines between these bands? Just yeah, just to see.</v>

65
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.570
So he starts counting as you know, 100 200 lines,

66
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.490
301 300 ten three hundred and twenty and every time he counted, he got a number

67
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.160
round around 360 365 wait a second.

68
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.410
Familiar number. Now

69
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.300
<v 1>doesn't take a lot of inference that hey,</v>

70
00:04:05.301 --> 00:04:09.050
maybe those individual rings represent, you know,

71
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.400
a daily pattern,

72
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.460
<v 0>meaning each of these little lines actually equaled a day.</v>

73
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.900
And why they're not just making a gray mark after three 65.

74
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.350
What are the gray lines? Well, the,

75
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:24.000
the thicker lines are the times of the year when the coral grows a lot.

76
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.610
But if you've got a summer core, all that, it grows a lot in one summer,

77
00:04:26.611 --> 00:04:29.580
then it goes quiet, then it grows up in next summer. So that's again,

78
00:04:29.581 --> 00:04:32.700
that marks a year that those big bands are kind of like, ah,

79
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.360
<v 5>Eh, and a half</v>

80
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.710
<v 0>happy new year. [inaudible] happy new year. [inaudible]</v>

81
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:41.550
<v 1>happy new year.</v>

82
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.210
They're actually calendars and clocks inside each of these things.

83
00:04:44.211 --> 00:04:47.360
You just have to know how to read them. So this guy, professor wells,

84
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.530
what he did was then, this is the really, um, bold bet I thought,

85
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.910
which is, uh, he then said, well, okay, that's all living Carl.

86
00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.860
Let's look at some fossils. He was after all the paleontologist know.

87
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.420
So here's a Cornell university.

88
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.470
Cornell University is surrounded by a rocks around, you know,

89
00:05:06.471 --> 00:05:09.860
370 or so million years old.

90
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.670
And he collected some Nice Carl's in.

91
00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:14.630
There are a lot of Nice coral fossils known from there.

92
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.520
And he opened up these ancient skeletons and he did the count and the hundred

93
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.520
days, 200 days, he was expecting a hundred days,

94
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.550
360 to 365 [inaudible] 68 then low and behold he found 400 between 404 10

95
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.090
really? Yeah. And he looked lots of specimens.

96
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.410
<v 0>That number, the 400 number kept showing up. What is, what does that mean?</v>

97
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.750
Well that means that it's,

98
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.250
it's now reasonable to think that back in the day, you know,

99
00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:50.570
380 million years ago, there were more days in a year

100
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.970
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

101
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.970
<v 0>and he published a paper saying more or less that. And right away</v>

102
00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.600
<v 1>clam scientist said, well,</v>

103
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:01.820
if that's true for curls and it's gotta be true from my animal,

104
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:03.100
the clam and the oyster people said, well,

105
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.260
it's gotta be true for Oysters and muscle folks. Has gotta be true for Mussels.

106
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:07.960
This paper set off a bit of a,

107
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.110
a cottage industry of folks applying this technique to other species.

108
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.060
In looking at these other species,

109
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:18.050
they found that the general trend is absolutely correct that when you compare

110
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.180
modern animals to ancient animals,

111
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:24.440
you will find they record the old ones more days in here.

112
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:27.200
So you go back to a time period called the Ordovician,

113
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.960
which is about 450 million years ago.

114
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.310
A typical year had about 415 410 days in it.

115
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.810
If you go to the time period I work on in the Devonian about 360 million years,

116
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.020
probably about 400 so what you see is the number of days in a year has declined

117
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:48.350
from over 400 to what we have now, which is three 65 that's feeling so.

118
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:50.650
So we have lost 40 days since, yes.

119
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.170
Since since creatures first started to walk on land. So now comes the obvious

120
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.720
<v 0>question. Why, why would there be more days and then than there are now? Okay,</v>

121
00:06:58.721 --> 00:06:59.790
wait a second, wait a second. Wait. That waste it.

122
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.370
So a year a year is a trip around the sun.

123
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.220
That's a trip if we are trying, and days,

124
00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:08.830
days are when we spin it around and since we're going around the sun. Okay,

125
00:07:08.831 --> 00:07:11.680
so that, so maybe if you want to squeeze more days into a year,

126
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:16.150
maybe it just means the trip around the sun took longer back then. Well,

127
00:07:16.151 --> 00:07:17.830
if you ask astronomers about that,

128
00:07:17.831 --> 00:07:21.220
I asked Chris MP at the University of Arizona and he says,

129
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.930
there's no sense that the length of time it takes the Earth to orbit the sun is

130
00:07:25.931 --> 00:07:29.380
changing because the Earth's orbit around the Sun, this basic physics,

131
00:07:29.381 --> 00:07:32.170
and it hasn't really changed significantly. He's pretty sure of that.

132
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.150
So then what is it? Well, Chris has,

133
00:07:34.151 --> 00:07:38.920
the answer takes us back about four and a half billion years to a time when the

134
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:39.881
earth was very young.

135
00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:44.530
So there was this crazy period of time lasting about 50 million years,

136
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.680
which they called the greet bombardment period.

137
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.440
<v 6>There was still a lot of debris leftover from the formation of the solar system.</v>

138
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.250
So the meteorite impact rate with thousands of times higher,

139
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.720
the earth was still like attacky magma. And so there was,

140
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.290
there was a hale brimstone, endless rain.

141
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.820
I mean the kind of crazy time really.

142
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.660
And a bit of that may him of course we think, uh, gave birth to the moon.

143
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:15.830
<v 1>There was a huge collision and a rock about the size of Mars banged into us,</v>

144
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.600
fung, a hunk of earth, shrapnel into orbit.

145
00:08:18.601 --> 00:08:22.260
And those pieces coalesced and became our moot,

146
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.110
<v 0>which is now sort of parked right next to us.</v>

147
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.920
And so it sort of tugs us around in a kind of hefty way.

148
00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:34.600
And we took to the moon. Oh, it's a, it works both ways. You know,

149
00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:37.720
we tucked the moon and the moon tugs house in the forest is actually equal.

150
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:42.380
So it's kind of like a dance. It's a dance. I tried the moon and the moon today.

151
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.160
<v 6>Exactly. It's a, so last year old waltz,</v>

152
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.430
<v 2>I see the</v>

153
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.810
[inaudible] and

154
00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.000
<v 0>it's that dance,</v>

155
00:08:57.001 --> 00:09:01.530
that waltz that explains why the earth used to have 450 days in a year,

156
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.040
then 400 days in a year. And now only 365 well, I don't,

157
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.250
I don't see how this explains anything. Well, first of all,

158
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:10.320
let's just remember what a day is.

159
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.210
A day is a full spin of the planet from the sun coming up in the morning and

160
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.420
going down, coming up the next morning. So one spin, a total spin equals a day.

161
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:23.280
Yes, we all know that now today we make 365 of these spins as we orbit the sun.

162
00:09:23.281 --> 00:09:26.610
That would be a year, but back when the earth was born,

163
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.930
when it was all by itself, dancing alone, that in those days it spun faster.

164
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.490
It was making more of these spins as it went around the sun.

165
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:37.980
So a year had more days in it.

166
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:42.090
But then along comes the moon to join the dance. And now here's the key.

167
00:09:42.091 --> 00:09:47.091
According to Chris Earth is spinning faster than the moon is orbiting it.

168
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.130
A dance part. It takes a month for gum around us.

169
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.800
We take 24 hours fume,

170
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.920
and you know how it is when you're dancing with a partner who is slower than you

171
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:58.170
are, then you have to, you have to tug them along,

172
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:00.170
which is what has happened here. Gravitational,

173
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.120
we are constantly tugging the moon along.

174
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:05.550
It is constantly dragging us down.

175
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.480
There's a transfer of energy here that over billions of years has caused the

176
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:13.710
earth spin to slow down just a little bit, a teeny, teeny bit.

177
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.790
And as the spin has slowed, well, our days have gotten longer.

178
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.350
And if you do the math,

179
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.790
you calculate that the day is getting longer by 1.7 milliseconds.

180
00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:26.850
Each century, 1.7 millisecond seed century.

181
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:32.030
What this means on a daily basis is that today was 54 billions of a second

182
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.410
longer than yesterday.

183
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.500
<v 4>And the day before that was 54 billionths of a second longer than the day</v>

184
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.333
before.

185
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.450
And the day before that was 50 foot billions of a second longer than the day

186
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.870
before that, which was 54 and if you extrapolate that out over the, you know,

187
00:10:47.871 --> 00:10:51.170
millions of years, people like me, think about, that's Neil Shubin again,

188
00:10:51.171 --> 00:10:54.230
the paleontologist, that becomes quite significant.

189
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.310
[inaudible] you're telling me,

190
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:59.690
you're telling me that today is the shortest day of the rest of my life. Yes,

191
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.700
Andy worries about these things. Well,

192
00:11:01.701 --> 00:11:04.400
you're not going to live longer because of this. I'm sorry to say, but

193
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.500
<v 0>no. So this Moondance does not affect the ticking of time.</v>

194
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:10.620
It just affects what we choose to call a day. And by the way,

195
00:11:10.621 --> 00:11:15.450
one of the consequences of this stances is we lose a little energy to our moon

196
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.630
every year and the wind picks up a little energy from us because these things

197
00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:21.660
are always equal. Think about like when you throw a ball,

198
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:25.080
the more energy you use, the further the ball is away from you.

199
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.280
Well as we add a little more energy to the moon, the moon,

200
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.570
very slyly, who's a little further away from us every year.

201
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:37.860
It's about a couple of inches according to Chris, the length of a warm, really.

202
00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:42.600
So the moon is getting a worm's distance further away from us every year.

203
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.840
And he says, if you go back about 4 billion years,

204
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.460
the moon was originally about 10 times closer than it is now.

205
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.010
Time is close. Imagine the moon looking 10 times bigger than it does now.

206
00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:56.470
That would've been crazy. Also,

207
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.740
the days would have been a six hours long,

208
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.720
six hours long.

209
00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:03.980
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

210
00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:04.850
<v 1>all right. To me,</v>

211
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:10.120
what this says is that everything that we take for granted as normal in our

212
00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.790
world, you know, ice at the Poles seize and certain places,

213
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.780
continents configured the way they are, the number of days in a year.

214
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:25.400
All that is subject to change. And all that has changed.

215
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.530
All that has dramatically changed over the course of the history of our planet.

216
00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.370
And that includes how we measure time itself. So, you know,

217
00:12:34.371 --> 00:12:36.200
when I'm sitting in a hall, in the middle of the Arctic,

218
00:12:36.201 --> 00:12:40.220
digging at a fish fossil, every now and then, you know, I pinch myself and say,

219
00:12:40.221 --> 00:12:41.300
here I am in the Arctic,

220
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.130
digging out of fish pasta that lived in an ancient subtropical environment.

221
00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:46.821
You know,

222
00:12:46.821 --> 00:12:51.500
the juxtaposition between present and past sometimes is utterly mind blowing,

223
00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.970
but it's very informed with about our own age and that we, you know,

224
00:12:55.971 --> 00:12:58.920
we take, we think things are eternal but they're not there.

225
00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.970
Everything is subject to change. Changes is the way of the world.

226
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:12.210
<v 2>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

227
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.860
<v 0>special thanks to Neil Shubin, University of Chicago,</v>

228
00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:19.330
his new book is called the universe within and it describes how you and I are

229
00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:22.390
linking. Oh so many ways to have bones are chemistry.

230
00:13:22.391 --> 00:13:25.990
I cells also to Chris, MP, University of Arizona,

231
00:13:25.991 --> 00:13:30.700
his newest is called shadow world and to Emily Grassley and Paul Mayor of the

232
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.950
Field Museum in Chicago, we called Emily, we said,

233
00:13:32.951 --> 00:13:34.930
find us a paleontologist and a saw

234
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:39.010
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

235
00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.930
<v 0>and before we go, um,</v>

236
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.500
because it's the end of the year and who wants to leave when you've had a good

237
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.690
year and this, you know, and who knows what's gonna happen next year.

238
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.320
So I just want to play you a little bit of a, can we do this?

239
00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:53.430
Can we just add an end to the end? Cause that's what I'd like. Sure.

240
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.750
I was talking to Neil degrasse Tyson,

241
00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:58.090
who's an astrophysicist and who thinks about spin,

242
00:13:58.091 --> 00:14:01.540
which we've just thought about, thinks about the inner solar system,

243
00:14:01.541 --> 00:14:02.710
which we've just thought about.

244
00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:07.711
So here's him and I talking about holding on to time.

245
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.940
<v 7>It's a little goofy, but here it is just for the fun of it.</v>

246
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.230
So if you're on earth and you're walking in, you know,

247
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.910
around Quito on the equator, um,

248
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.140
if you are walking at four miles an hour, you know, your,

249
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:26.020
your day will go of doing the normal way. The Sun will rise behind you,

250
00:14:26.021 --> 00:14:28.840
go overhead and then go down the other side. If you're stationary,

251
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.120
if you're stationed at 24 hours a day, yes. Yeah.

252
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.530
If you started walking on the equator, depending on which direction you walked,

253
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.370
your day will either last longer or shorter.

254
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.950
Okay? So if you walk west, the faster you walk,

255
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.270
the longer your day will become.

256
00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:49.690
You could walk at a pace where you have a 25 hour day of 27 hour day.

257
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.080
There's a speed with,

258
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.860
you can walk on the equator in the earth going West where your day lasts

259
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.100
forever. And that is the rotation rate of the earth.

260
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.440
You would have compensated table,

261
00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:05.130
that would be a jury observable running on a beach ball, a rotating beach ball.

262
00:15:05.131 --> 00:15:07.370
So that would on the top of her of a beach ball.

263
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.520
So that speed for the equator is about a thousand miles an hour.

264
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.740
So the equator moves a thousand miles an hour and that gives,

265
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.380
that gives us the 24 hour a day.

266
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.530
If you want to go a thousand miles an hour in the opposite direction,

267
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.300
you will stop the day.

268
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.780
The Sun will never move in the sky and you'll have it in your,

269
00:15:23.781 --> 00:15:25.730
your day will last. Superman did that once.

270
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:28.370
I think when you had this thing with low superman would is so messed up

271
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:31.250
everybody on earth for having stopped the rotation of the earth,

272
00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:33.020
reversed it and instead of forwarding, yes,

273
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:37.770
he would have scrambled all not anything not bolted to the earth would have been

274
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.440
blown off. Yeah. So at, depending on your latitude and equatorial residence,

275
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.790
if you stop the earth,

276
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.550
they were going at a thousand miles an hour with the earth.

277
00:15:46.551 --> 00:15:48.470
You Stop the earth and you're not seatbelted to the earth.

278
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.640
You will fall over and roll due east a thousand miles an hour in our

279
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.770
mid-latitudes. Where in New York you can do the math.

280
00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:59.330
We are moving about 800 miles an hour due east and stop the earth.

281
00:15:59.331 --> 00:16:02.630
We will roll 800 miles an hour due east and crash into buildings and other

282
00:16:02.631 --> 00:16:06.890
things that are attached to it to, all right, but let's going back to Venus now.

283
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.540
You want to go to Venus? Isn't this enough for you?

284
00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.200
[inaudible] whole pointless to go to Venus because it's so different there.

285
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.680
Yeah, on every way. No,

286
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.620
it's about the same size and about the same surface gravity, but that's it.

287
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.880
It's 900 degrees Fahrenheit. It's a runaway greenhouse effect.

288
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:28.090
It is heavy volcanic activity that repaved the surface periodically.

289
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:32.680
So they're very few craters on Venus. I'm just unpleasant in Gen on place.

290
00:16:32.681 --> 00:16:36.040
It rotates very slowly, but that's why I want to stop SLO.

291
00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:38.900
So how slowly does it really? I don't remember the exact number.

292
00:16:38.901 --> 00:16:40.670
One miles an hour or something like that. Yeah,

293
00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.700
it's some very slow rate at its equator.

294
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.420
Slow enough so that you don't need special.

295
00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:51.890
You don't need airplanes to stop the Sun. You don't need special speed devices.

296
00:16:51.891 --> 00:16:56.270
You could probably trot and stop the Sun on the horizon or wherever the sun is.

297
00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.320
So this guy, guy from Jamaica, what's his name? Hussein bolt.

298
00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:02.180
Hussein bolt like and your,

299
00:17:02.181 --> 00:17:06.980
you happen to be on Venus for a little while and you decide to go for a run.

300
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.920
What happens to Hussein during the run? Okay,

301
00:17:09.921 --> 00:17:13.940
so normally the sun would rise in one direction and set in the other depending

302
00:17:13.941 --> 00:17:16.760
on which direction you chose to run in. You could,

303
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.960
you could reverse your day and have the sun rise and the opposite side of the

304
00:17:20.961 --> 00:17:23.300
sky than it normally would. And,

305
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.830
but I think Venus is rotating slowly enough that you wouldn't have to be Usain

306
00:17:27.831 --> 00:17:29.080
bolt. I'd have to check my numbers.

307
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:33.680
I don't think you would in order to have the sun actually sort of seem to go

308
00:17:33.681 --> 00:17:36.020
backwards as what you're saying is the sudden go backwards.

309
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.650
So you'd be having lunch, Usain bolt and you're going to say,

310
00:17:39.651 --> 00:17:43.820
now I'm going to run and the sun's going backwards towards the mornings horizon.

311
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.060
You can reverse the sun. That's correct. In fact,

312
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:51.150
that is a really good reason to sprint. Um, I think, well,

313
00:17:51.151 --> 00:17:54.720
but who cares about the sun anymore? Me If I were the same,

314
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.660
but I like go up these [inaudible] telling you when to eat lunch.

315
00:17:57.661 --> 00:18:00.930
I don't think so. Your stomach is telling you when to eat lunch.

316
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.040
You're saying okay,

317
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:05.820
Hussein saying you eat breakfast but you want to have lunch real soon run so

318
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:07.260
that the sun is now at the top of the sky.

319
00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:11.250
So now your your you can legally have lunch. No,

320
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.180
you're not buying my poetic a premise at all today.

321
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:20.270
The 21st Century Jack and his son is we we when we wake by alarm clocks,

322
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.730
not by roosters and sunlight. I'm sorry.

323
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.060
I wish I could help you out by thinking. Let's apply.

324
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:33.080
I'm not going to depend on running so that this on Venus to get the sun in the

325
00:18:33.811 --> 00:18:38.490
middle of the sky at my command so that I can have lunch. Okay. All right.

326
00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:41.480
But let's suppose you are a rooster and you like to crow at dawn.

327
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.430
You just a deep feeling you could totally mess with a rooster. This one. Yes.

328
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.710
That's what I want to do. Saying volt carrying a rooster with the same,

329
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:51.570
both carries a rooster on Venus. He does in the remarkably past sprint,

330
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.470
the rooster having started the run in the middle of the day,

331
00:18:55.471 --> 00:18:57.060
well past the crowing period,

332
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.660
fuels a strange compulsion to crow two hours into the run. You,

333
00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:05.100
because he ran backwards to the sunrise rather than he ran forwards.

334
00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:07.050
But the sun went backwards. He went here. Yes.

335
00:19:07.051 --> 00:19:11.400
He ran in the other way to reverse the sun back to sunrise. Yeah.

336
00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:14.160
And then the rooster is going to, will need therapy

337
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.560
<v 8>[inaudible] stuff.</v>

338
00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.710
<v 7>Well, um, I think it's time for us to definitely go down. Yeah.</v>

339
00:19:35.711 --> 00:19:39.370
We should definitely get out. Okay. I'm Chad. I'm Robert. Thanks for listening.

340
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:40.260
[inaudible].
