00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.450
well actually I have a niece who is 13

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460
well actually I have a niece who is 13
 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.249
well actually I have a niece who is 13
years old who is with us here and talked

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259
years old who is with us here and talked
 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.650
years old who is with us here and talked
a little bit about it it turns out that

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660
a little bit about it it turns out that
 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.490
a little bit about it it turns out that
at least in the u.s. children that age

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500
at least in the u.s. children that age
 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.980
at least in the u.s. children that age
know a great deal about biology and they

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990
know a great deal about biology and they
 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.689
know a great deal about biology and they
know what proteins are and I know what

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699
know what proteins are and I know what
 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.480
know what proteins are and I know what
mitochondria are so I'm not sure it's as

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490
mitochondria are so I'm not sure it's as
 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.810
mitochondria are so I'm not sure it's as
difficult to explain as seems to be

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820
difficult to explain as seems to be
 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.700
difficult to explain as seems to be
implied by the question how do you

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710
implied by the question how do you
 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.779
implied by the question how do you
explain it to a 13 year old but one of

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789
explain it to a 13 year old but one of
 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.389
explain it to a 13 year old but one of
the I think the best thing is to take an

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399
the I think the best thing is to take an
 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.100
the I think the best thing is to take an
example of what we were able to do and

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110
example of what we were able to do and
 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.010
example of what we were able to do and
one of the things that make cells work

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020
one of the things that make cells work
 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.959
one of the things that make cells work
is that they have little transport

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
is that they have little transport
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.080
is that they have little transport
systems they have molecules that have

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090
systems they have molecules that have
 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.910
systems they have molecules that have
basically two feet and they walk along

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920
basically two feet and they walk along
 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.020
basically two feet and they walk along
rails which are called microtubules and

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030
rails which are called microtubules and
 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.150
rails which are called microtubules and
they transport things from one end of

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
they transport things from one end of
 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.360
they transport things from one end of
the cell to another and in fact the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
the cell to another and in fact the
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.700
the cell to another and in fact the
Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710
Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology
 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.640
Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology
was given for studying the vesicles the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
was given for studying the vesicles the
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.399
was given for studying the vesicles the
things that these little engines carry

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409
things that these little engines carry
 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.940
things that these little engines carry
from one part to another but they just

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950
from one part to another but they just
 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.100
from one part to another but they just
looked at the top part here for the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
looked at the top part here for the
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.440
looked at the top part here for the
vesicles that are carried and we figured

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
vesicles that are carried and we figured
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.899
vesicles that are carried and we figured
out how a couple of molecules which are

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909
out how a couple of molecules which are
 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.130
out how a couple of molecules which are
basically two globular domains like this

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140
basically two globular domains like this
 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.429
basically two globular domains like this
that are connected by a coiled coil can

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
that are connected by a coiled coil can
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.460
that are connected by a coiled coil can
actually walk and they walk the way we

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
actually walk and they walk the way we
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.350
actually walk and they walk the way we
walk in the sense that they put the left

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360
walk in the sense that they put the left
 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.179
walk in the sense that they put the left
foot taller than the right foot forward

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
foot taller than the right foot forward
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.160
foot taller than the right foot forward
left foot four and the right foot four

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
left foot four and the right foot four
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.280
left foot four and the right foot four
and so that's one example of how

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
and so that's one example of how
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.410
and so that's one example of how
although people had studied that I'm

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
although people had studied that I'm
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.870
although people had studied that I'm
experimentally and had static pictures

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
experimentally and had static pictures
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.539
experimentally and had static pictures
of what they looked like they couldn't

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
of what they looked like they couldn't
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.030
of what they looked like they couldn't
figure out how they moved their feet

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040
figure out how they moved their feet
 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.819
figure out how they moved their feet
they sort of throw their feet forward

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829
they sort of throw their feet forward
 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.039
they sort of throw their feet forward
and it's that what is one application of

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049
and it's that what is one application of
 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.630
and it's that what is one application of
the methods that we developed that it

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
the methods that we developed that it
 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.770
the methods that we developed that it
can teach us how molecular motors as

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780
can teach us how molecular motors as
 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.729
can teach us how molecular motors as
these are called

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
these are called
 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.490
these are called
this is these are called kinesin

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500
this is these are called kinesin
 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.210
this is these are called kinesin
how they work and
