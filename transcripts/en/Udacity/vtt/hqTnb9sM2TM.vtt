The next step is to bring down this x. So down here, for the expression, we're

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:10.790
dividing by x minus 2 next, we're going to have negative 2 x squared plus x. We

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.434
know, though, we only need to look at the first term here and the first term

00:00:13.434 --> 00:00:18.686
here. So, what do we need to multiply x by to get negative 2 x squared? Please

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:20.488
write your answer in this box.
