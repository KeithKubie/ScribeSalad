00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.860
&gt;&gt; So, you may introduce yourself and your
company and what you're going to bring in

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.500
this conference now?
&gt;&gt; TANTOW: Yes, sure. And so, my name is Martin

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.550
Tantow. I'm co-founder and business lead of
3scale Networks. We're originally from Barcelona,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.349
Spain but we just opened an office in Sunnyvale,
actually last year already. So, 3scale is

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:32.759
an API Management Solution. We provide this
is a [indistinct] way. And what we're presenting

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.890
and demoing here at Google I/O is actually
two applications. One is base and one is called

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.620
Appspot Image and is based on Python, hosted
on Google App Engine. And the other one is

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.989
a UN data project written in Java and hosted
on Google App Engine as well.

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.640
&gt;&gt; So, tell me a bit about your decision to
use App Engine for your apps?

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.390
&gt;&gt; TANTOW: Yes, sure. And so, we are actually
quite excited. I think, we think that Google

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.870
App Engine is quite a revolutionary tool.
For us critical is, it is highly scalable,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:18.040
it's reliable. It is also cost effective to
certain limits. And so, it was for us basically

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.969
a no-brainer to look at Google App Engine
and host these two solutions on Google App

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:29.180
Engine. And so far we have been very successful
and very happy with the performance.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.920
&gt;&gt; And so, do you have any particular war
stories you'd like to share or challenges?

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.659
&gt;&gt; TANTOW: Yeah, well, I try to. I have actually
not been the one who had actually developed--but

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.799
synching with our audio Opera team. They were--in
general they were quite happy. However, I

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:53.509
think, especially on the Java site, it seemed
to be not as smooth as they expected. Python

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:04.170
was fine. Except the fixed connection time-out
that they actually had problems with but the--on

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.530
the Java version it was more the data model
that they had problems with but I guess apart

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.150
from that, you know, they--we're quite happy
with the performance.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.659
&gt;&gt; So, are you using App engines for production
now for, has it been bringing in money?

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:28.420
&gt;&gt; TANTOW: Yes, we actually do. We just started
with it. So, our Solution Appspot Image has

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.760
kind of a premium model. And so, there's a
free version but there's also a paid version.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.810
And so, we are actually using our own billing
and payment solution for that. But yes, we

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.760
use Google App Engine for production and for
dollar product.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.110
&gt;&gt; And so, what are your favorite App Engine
features?

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.730
&gt;&gt; TANTOW: Well, we're actually quite impressed
with the Dashboard in general and the graphics

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.470
and Analytics that you get there. In a way
they're quite complementary as well to our

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:11.239
own Analytics and monitoring that we provide
on our API management solution. We also liked

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:17.730
the versioning feature actually quite a bit.
The App Engine Launcher as well which actually

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.890
never failed and was actually quite good.
Man Cash feature to mention as well. And so,

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.349
quite some good features.
&gt;&gt; And so, what advice would you give to someone

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.840
who is a new developer on the just coming
App Engines?

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.290
&gt;&gt; TANTOW: Well, we would say that why would
you use a Google App Engine, why would you

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.280
use 3scale? I think it's certainly something
that works very well together. I would say

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:53.829
if you create applications on Google App Engine
think about having an API, make sure it is

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:59.750
scalable and usable and, you know, you created
it the right way and use App Engine and 3scale

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.010
together with it because our integration for
it actually works and we've tested it here

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.670
and demoed here at Google I/O.
&gt;&gt; And so, can you integrate the App Engine

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.450
with any other product services or websites?
&gt;&gt; TANTOW: Yeah, actually that's what I just

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:21.280
meant. And so, the 3scale service itself is
a soft space solution. It's hosted on other

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.100
services and actually we did that integration
with 3scale and our own API and it actually

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.280
does work very well. And so, yes, we have
done it in that sense.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.340
&gt;&gt; And so, is there anything from I/O that
you're going to take with this on or that

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.440
you got really excited about here?
&gt;&gt; TANTOW: Taking away is a good question

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.660
I guess. Giving us the new G to, you know,
mobile phones. And so, yes, I'm going to take

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.860
something away. It probably means more like
kind of learning and so on. Certainly, yeah,

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:55.639
I mean, this morning Google Wave was certainly
a big hype. I was--I think we were all excited

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.520
when we heard yesterday. We go--we got like
Google phones and there was like, okay, the

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.620
next day it's going to be even better. And
so, the question was what can be better than

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.520
the Google phone, it was Google Wave and I
think it's going to be really, really a big

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.069
thing and we're very excited about that.
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you so much for talking with

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:13.180
us.
&gt;&gt; TANTOW: Thanks a lot.
