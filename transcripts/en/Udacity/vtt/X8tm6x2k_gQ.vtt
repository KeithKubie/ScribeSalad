00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.100
Alright Michael, you ready?

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.819
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:03.540
&gt;&gt; Okay. What's the answer? Walk me through.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.340
&gt;&gt; I will walk you through. Alright. So

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.320
let's, let's do this. Let's write the Euclidean distance.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.180
Well let's write the Manhattan distance, because I don't,

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.440
I don't want to take square root to my head.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.880
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.190
&gt;&gt; Let's write the Manhattan distances next to the Xs.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.230
&gt;&gt; OKay.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.910
&gt;&gt; Or the Ys.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:16.230
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.170
&gt;&gt; Either way.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.680
&gt;&gt; Let's do it next to the Xs. So this is

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.690
the Manhattan distance or MD as the cool kids call it.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.610
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.400
&gt;&gt; Is that true?

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.720
&gt;&gt; Yea.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.840
&gt;&gt; The cool kids called it L one.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.650
&gt;&gt; No, no, no have you ever heard a cool kid ever say something like L one?

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.580
&gt;&gt; Well, to me the cool kids are the people

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.190
at neps who know more math than I do. Yea, do

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.180
you think any of them are going to watch this video?

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.210
Actually I'm afraid all of them are going to watch this video.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.740
&gt;&gt; Now I'm really afraid.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.730
&gt;&gt; Mm-Hm so you better get it right, every ones watching.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.340
&gt;&gt; All right, well let me do, let me complete the Manhattan distances.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.620
So the first one what you do is you take the 1 minus 4.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.143
&gt;&gt; Mm-Hm.

00:00:51.143 --> 00:00:54.700
&gt;&gt; And that's three. And you take the 6 minus 2 and that's 4. And you add the

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.390
two together and you get 7. Which interestingly is

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.380
the same as y, but I think that's a coincidence.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.796
&gt;&gt; Okay. [CROSSTALK]

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:05.821
&gt;&gt; And now I'll do all the rest of them

00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:10.000
'cause I pre-computed them of Four, six, eight, four, six. Alright,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.480
so now we've got it set up so we can do

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.740
one and three nearest neighbor relatively quickly. So, the one nearest

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.520
neighbor, the closest distance, is four.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.340
&gt;&gt; Mm--hm.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.860
&gt;&gt; But unfortauntely there are two points

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.290
that have that two comma four in set

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.350
number one. We have outputs of eight and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.680
50 because they. Almost agree with each other.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.913
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:01:27.913 --> 00:01:32.940
&gt;&gt; Not. And if we take the average of those two things we get 29.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.990
&gt;&gt; Yep. That is correct Michael.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.380
&gt;&gt; Great now in terms of the three nearest neighbors we have the fours and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.910
the sixes.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.038
&gt;&gt; So the four, three nearest neighbors.

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:45.413
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:45.413 --> 00:01:50.970
&gt;&gt; Somewhat awkwardly. And the we have the average of those things which is

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.760
what. Eight, fifty and sixteen and sixty

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.060
eight which gets us thirty five point five.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.640
&gt;&gt; Right. Obviously. [LAUGH] Okay. Alright,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.540
so that was pretty straightforward. And those

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.110
answers aren't too far off from one another. So what about the Euclidean case?

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.930
&gt;&gt; Alright,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.530
so one thing to point out. I, I was worried

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.620
about computing square roots but it occurs to me that

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.020
I actually don't have to compute square roots because that's

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.170
the monotonic transformation, and we only care about the orders.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.240
&gt;&gt; Hm, okay.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.450
&gt;&gt; So for Euclidean distance, or as I like to call him casually, ED,

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.220
&gt;&gt; Mmhm.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.460
&gt;&gt; We can just take the square differences summed up.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.170
&gt;&gt; Okay, so this would be ED squared.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.130
&gt;&gt; Yes, it would be ED squared.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.590
&gt;&gt; Okay, ED.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.040
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.394
So the first one, it'll be the one minus four is three, squared is nine. And the

00:02:37.394 --> 00:02:42.960
6 minus 2 is 4, squared is 16. And 9 plus 16 is 25. So the first one will be 25.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.960
&gt;&gt; And notice the square of 25 is pretty easy to compute.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but the other ones aren't going to be. It just

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.960
so happens that we've got a pythagorean triple on our hands.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.430
&gt;&gt; Mm. I love those.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.006
&gt;&gt; Al right so the remaining ones, the x squared are eight,

00:02:57.006 --> 00:02:59.310
26, 40, ten, and 20.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.310
&gt;&gt; Hm, none of

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.780
those are easily square rootable.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.840
&gt;&gt; Exactly, though 40 feels like it really was trying and failed.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah. An eight over shot and now it's

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.120
a perfect cube. So, eight is the smallest distance.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.400
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.660
&gt;&gt; And again, seemingly, coincidentally, they

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.450
Y value associated with that, is eight.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.460
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.139
&gt;&gt; So an eight, eight is our answer.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.660
&gt;&gt; Good and that's correct.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.480
&gt;&gt; And the three closest are eight, ten and 20.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.620
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.120
&gt;&gt; And if we

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.610
average the Y values for those that's eight, 50 and 68, which gives us

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.910
an average of 42. The meaning of life, the universe. And pretty much everything?

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.820
&gt;&gt; Yes! And that is absolutely correct. So that's kind of That's kind

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.950
of cool that you get completely different answers depending upon what you do.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does seem very different, doesn't it?

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.290
I mean there's like several orders of magnitude spread here.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.280
&gt;&gt; Well, that's.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.940
&gt;&gt; Maybe not orders of magnitude but orders of doubling.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.390
&gt;&gt; Yes, there are orders of doubling spread. Well, you know what

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.260
Michael, I actually had a specific function in mind when I did this.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.400
&gt;&gt; Okay! Let's find out which one is the right one!

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.900
&gt;&gt; Well, the function I had was Y was equal to the

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.780
first dimension squared plus the second dimension. So, let's call that X1

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.010
and X2, and this was actually the function that I had in

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.240
place. So, you square the first term and you add the second.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.460
&gt;&gt; Okay, and

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.200
so like looking at the second last one, for example, seven

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.020
squared is 49 plus one is 50 Oh, [UNKNOWN]. It's very consistent.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you. So what would be the actual answer for four comma two?

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.050
&gt;&gt; Okay so four squared is 16 plus two is 18. Which is close to none of them.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.980
&gt;&gt; Right. So there's a lesson here, there's several lessons

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.700
here. And one lesson I don't want you to take away.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.750
So here's the lesson. So I actually had a

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.540
real function here. There was no noise. It was fairly

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.410
well represented. The proper answer was 18 and basically none

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.810
of these are right. But the first thing I want

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.560
you to notice is you get completely different answers, depending

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.760
upon exactly whether you do one versus three, whether you

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.920
do Euclidean versus Manhattan. And that's because these things make

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.510
assumptions about your domain that might not be particularly relevant.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.250
And this sort of suggests, that maybe this thing

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.090
doesn't do very well. Uh, kNN doesn't do very well because

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.310
none of these are close to 18. That seems

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.380
a little sad. But I've good new for you Michael.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.120
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.970
&gt;&gt; The good news is that, actually kNN tends to

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.980
work really, really well. Especially given it's simplicity, it just

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.150
doesn't in this particular case. And there's really a reason

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.800
for that, and it has to do with this sort of.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.040
Fundamental assumptions in bias of kNN, I happen to pick an example that

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.340
sort of violates some of that bias. So I think it's worth to take a moment

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.500
to think about what the preference bias is for kNN and to see

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.730
if that can lead us to understanding why

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.300
we didn't get anything close to 18 here.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.580
&gt;&gt; Okay that sounds useful.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.620
&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's do that.
