architecture we teach two types of
 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.579
architecture we teach two types of
courses one is a studio course the other

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:37.589

harlem world and and i saw that the book
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.399
harlem world and and i saw that the book
harlem world was on your reading list

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
harlem world was on your reading list
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.340
harlem world was on your reading list
yeah so the show was it kind of took

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350
yeah so the show was it kind of took
 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.139
yeah so the show was it kind of took
that title was called Hollen world

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149
that title was called Hollen world

metropolis is metaphor and I developed

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969
metropolis is metaphor and I developed
 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.679
metropolis is metaphor and I developed
this project in response to the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689
this project in response to the
 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.469
this project in response to the
invitation to participate in the show

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
invitation to participate in the show
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.029
invitation to participate in the show
but then I also developed the project

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039
but then I also developed the project
 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.569
but then I also developed the project
from a paper that I had written earlier

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579
from a paper that I had written earlier
 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.399
from a paper that I had written earlier
which was called black bodies black

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409
which was called black bodies black
 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.580
which was called black bodies black
space awaiting spectacle and that space

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
space awaiting spectacle and that space
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.969
space awaiting spectacle and that space
that that paper dealt with the way that

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979
 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.239
black bodies are positioned in space and

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:05.249
black bodies are positioned in space and
 

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:09.559
black bodies are positioned in space and
how they're they're kind of spectacular

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
how they're they're kind of spectacular
 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.850
how they're they're kind of spectacular
rise so it's a condition of vision one

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860
rise so it's a condition of vision one
 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.760
rise so it's a condition of vision one
where the black body is recognized first

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770
where the black body is recognized first
 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.380
where the black body is recognized first
by sight and then is kind of

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390
by sight and then is kind of
 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.840
by sight and then is kind of
sensationalized as

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850
sensationalized as
 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.380
sensationalized as
result and when I wrote this paper for

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390
result and when I wrote this paper for
 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.870
result and when I wrote this paper for
me as an architect it was very easy to

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880
me as an architect it was very easy to
 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.050
me as an architect it was very easy to
draw off of cultural criticism literary

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060
draw off of cultural criticism literary
 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.190
draw off of cultural criticism literary
criticism post-colonial criticism but it

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200
criticism post-colonial criticism but it
 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.760
criticism post-colonial criticism but it
was hard to draw off of architecture

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770
was hard to draw off of architecture
 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.250
was hard to draw off of architecture
criticism so the paper ended with the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260
criticism so the paper ended with the
 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.640
criticism so the paper ended with the
question of the city the idea of the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650
question of the city the idea of the
 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.710
question of the city the idea of the
black city and that's the project I'll

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720
black city and that's the project I'll
 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.050
black city and that's the project I'll
show okay i'm going to show two things

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060
show okay i'm going to show two things
 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.050
show okay i'm going to show two things
first which which are these demographic

social explorer it's by a professor at

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450
social explorer it's by a professor at
 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.680
social explorer it's by a professor at
Queens College and these are maps that

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690
Queens College and these are maps that
 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.420
Queens College and these are maps that
show the development like migration in

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430
show the development like migration in
 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.740
show the development like migration in
the city over time so this is New York

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750
the city over time so this is New York
 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.410
the city over time so this is New York
this is a map of migrations of the white

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420
this is a map of migrations of the white
 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.210
this is a map of migrations of the white
population in New York from 1910 to 2000

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220
population in New York from 1910 to 2000
 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.870
population in New York from 1910 to 2000
and this kind of map was a resource it

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880
and this kind of map was a resource it
 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.280
and this kind of map was a resource it
draws from census files and then it

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290
draws from census files and then it
 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.580
draws from census files and then it
pictorial eise's movements in space so

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590
pictorial eise's movements in space so
 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.350
pictorial eise's movements in space so
it's a kind of great tool this one is

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360
it's a kind of great tool this one is
 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.790
it's a kind of great tool this one is
the movement of whites and this is the

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800
the movement of whites and this is the
 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.480
the movement of whites and this is the
movement of the black population and

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490
movement of the black population and
 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.360
movement of the black population and
usually with these maps that map black

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370
usually with these maps that map black
 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.610
usually with these maps that map black
and white populations they tend to be

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620
and white populations they tend to be
 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.280
and white populations they tend to be
the inverse so the negative of one is

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290
the inverse so the negative of one is
 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.680
the inverse so the negative of one is
the positive of the other

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690
 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.370
ok so anyway so this kind of is a little

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380
ok so anyway so this kind of is a little
 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.590
ok so anyway so this kind of is a little
bit of a background for the way oops I

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600
bit of a background for the way oops I
 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.890
bit of a background for the way oops I
approach the project i'm going to show

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900
approach the project i'm going to show
 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:59.860
approach the project i'm going to show
the installation and i'll talk over it

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870
 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.810
it's about 12 or 13 minutes this video

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820
it's about 12 or 13 minutes this video
 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.620
it's about 12 or 13 minutes this video
it's called the black city and it's

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630
it's called the black city and it's
 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.400
it's called the black city and it's
cited in harlem but harlem is only one

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410
cited in harlem but harlem is only one
 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.320
cited in harlem but harlem is only one
of the city's the black city could be

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330
of the city's the black city could be
 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.890
of the city's the black city could be
any city in the united states and i

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900
any city in the united states and i
 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:26.170
any city in the united states and i
started with Harlan so the installation

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180
started with Harlan so the installation
 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.040
started with Harlan so the installation
begins with the idea of of the black

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050
begins with the idea of of the black
 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.000
begins with the idea of of the black
city as a kind of psychic phenomenon and

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010
city as a kind of psychic phenomenon and
 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.400
city as a kind of psychic phenomenon and
it moves toward the idea of the black

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410
it moves toward the idea of the black
 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.040
it moves toward the idea of the black
City the reality of it as a physical

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050
City the reality of it as a physical
 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.140
City the reality of it as a physical
phenomenon and the project bridges

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150
phenomenon and the project bridges
 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.990
phenomenon and the project bridges
between the two the the kind of lived

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000
between the two the the kind of lived
 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.680
between the two the the kind of lived
condition and the almost like I don't

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690
condition and the almost like I don't
 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.550
condition and the almost like I don't
know like supra normative condition like

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560
know like supra normative condition like
 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.170
know like supra normative condition like
something that's in the mind or

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180
something that's in the mind or
 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.750
something that's in the mind or
something that's kind of symbolic or

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760
something that's kind of symbolic or
 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.040
something that's kind of symbolic or
even felt so basically I'm not going to

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050
even felt so basically I'm not going to
 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.450
even felt so basically I'm not going to
read the text i'll just talk around the

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460
read the text i'll just talk around the
 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:17.550
read the text i'll just talk around the
text and explain it but i will stop here

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560
text and explain it but i will stop here
 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:23.140
text and explain it but i will stop here
so this is a really important diagram

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150
so this is a really important diagram
 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.300
so this is a really important diagram
for the project which basically explains

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310
for the project which basically explains
 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.950
for the project which basically explains
the whole logic of it and the

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960
the whole logic of it and the
 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.620
the whole logic of it and the
installation unpacks the diagram but

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630
installation unpacks the diagram but
 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.920
installation unpacks the diagram but
i'll just talk about it a little bit

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930
i'll just talk about it a little bit
 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.040
i'll just talk about it a little bit
they're actually two ideas of the city

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050
they're actually two ideas of the city
 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.890
they're actually two ideas of the city
in this project one is the idea of the

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900
in this project one is the idea of the
 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:48.640
in this project one is the idea of the
black city as a as an exploration of the

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650
black city as a as an exploration of the
 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:55.240
black city as a as an exploration of the
dynamics and concepts that are that

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250
dynamics and concepts that are that
 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.560
dynamics and concepts that are that
shape the the reality that black people

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570
shape the the reality that black people
 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.730
shape the the reality that black people
live in so it's that that clear an idea

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740
live in so it's that that clear an idea
 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.980
live in so it's that that clear an idea
of the black city but it's also just a

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990
of the black city but it's also just a
 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.900
of the black city but it's also just a
kind of condition of blackness as

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:08.910
kind of condition of blackness as
 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.360
kind of condition of blackness as
this where you don't have to be black to

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370
this where you don't have to be black to
 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.890
this where you don't have to be black to
inhabit that space and what I've done in

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900
inhabit that space and what I've done in
 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.470
inhabit that space and what I've done in
this project you won't see images

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:18.480
this project you won't see images
 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:24.620
this project you won't see images
because I very much have fought against

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:24.630
because I very much have fought against
 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.620
because I very much have fought against
using images kind of stereotypical

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630
using images kind of stereotypical
 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:32.240
using images kind of stereotypical
images of black people and very often in

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.250
images of black people and very often in
 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.030
images of black people and very often in
architecture projects or other projects

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:35.040
architecture projects or other projects
 

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.240
architecture projects or other projects
a black person is kind of put in the

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:38.250
a black person is kind of put in the
 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.240
a black person is kind of put in the
project to sort of symbolize that

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.250
project to sort of symbolize that
 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.370
project to sort of symbolize that
there's a social sensitivity and it

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380
there's a social sensitivity and it
 

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.900
there's a social sensitivity and it
doesn't necessarily mean that the

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:44.910
doesn't necessarily mean that the
 

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.570
doesn't necessarily mean that the
project is socially sensitive but the

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.580
project is socially sensitive but the
 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.780
project is socially sensitive but the
body they're kind of gives it the aura

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:50.790
body they're kind of gives it the aura
 

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.380
body they're kind of gives it the aura
that it is and so I was very much trying

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:54.390
that it is and so I was very much trying
 

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.830
that it is and so I was very much trying
to work with what was underneath the

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840
to work with what was underneath the
 

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.070
to work with what was underneath the
images so i started with images and i

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080
images so i started with images and i
 

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:06.160
images so i started with images and i
was trying to get at the the operative

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.170
 

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:10.220
elements below the images so the black

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:10.230
elements below the images so the black
 

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.500
elements below the images so the black
bodies in this project are represented

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:12.510
bodies in this project are represented
 

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.900
bodies in this project are represented
by census statistics and the statistics

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:16.910
by census statistics and the statistics
 

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:21.110
by census statistics and the statistics
kind of are showing at different scales

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120
kind of are showing at different scales
 

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.500
kind of are showing at different scales
so there's a scale of the world to the

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:24.510
so there's a scale of the world to the
 

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.260
so there's a scale of the world to the
united states united states to New York

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:27.270
united states united states to New York
 

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.350
united states united states to New York
New York to Harlem and the project is

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360
New York to Harlem and the project is
 

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:36.850
New York to Harlem and the project is
about zooming in to Harlem looking at

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:36.860
about zooming in to Harlem looking at
 

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:43.130
about zooming in to Harlem looking at
the the sort of systems that that it's a

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.140
the the sort of systems that that it's a
 

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.840
the the sort of systems that that it's a
part of

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:46.850
 

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:52.660
so I should let it play more right so

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:52.670
so I should let it play more right so
 

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.530
so I should let it play more right so
this is basically an idea that the black

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:56.540
this is basically an idea that the black
 

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.530
this is basically an idea that the black
city is framed within statistics and is

00:08:59.530 --> 00:08:59.540
city is framed within statistics and is
 

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.960
city is framed within statistics and is
affected by policies which are implicit

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:01.970
affected by policies which are implicit
 

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.389
affected by policies which are implicit
and explicit things like laws or

00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399
and explicit things like laws or
 

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:18.790
and explicit things like laws or
cultural codes or or mores and then this

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800
cultural codes or or mores and then this
 

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.629
cultural codes or or mores and then this
this image is just really about whoops

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:22.639
this image is just really about whoops
 

00:09:22.639 --> 00:09:27.460
this image is just really about whoops
where I started so the project started

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:27.470
where I started so the project started
 

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.189
where I started so the project started
with the literary idea of the black city

00:09:30.189 --> 00:09:30.199
with the literary idea of the black city
 

00:09:30.199 --> 00:09:32.259
with the literary idea of the black city
and these are all the different names

00:09:32.259 --> 00:09:32.269
and these are all the different names
 

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:36.430
and these are all the different names
for Harlem that I could find in literary

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:36.440
for Harlem that I could find in literary
 

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.210
for Harlem that I could find in literary
work so they're kind of they present

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:40.220
work so they're kind of they present
 

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.290
work so they're kind of they present
this mythic image of Harlem from the

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:44.300
this mythic image of Harlem from the
 

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.319
this mythic image of Harlem from the
positive to the negative and then these

00:09:47.319 --> 00:09:47.329
positive to the negative and then these
 

00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:50.139
positive to the negative and then these
are this kind of statistical image of

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:50.149
are this kind of statistical image of
 

00:09:50.149 --> 00:09:54.699
are this kind of statistical image of
Harlem which is very dry and it's it's

00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:54.709
Harlem which is very dry and it's it's
 

00:09:54.709 --> 00:09:57.870
Harlem which is very dry and it's it's
all based on data so it has to do with

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:57.880
all based on data so it has to do with
 

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:03.069
all based on data so it has to do with
demographics statistics that that kind

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:03.079
demographics statistics that that kind
 

00:10:03.079 --> 00:10:06.850
demographics statistics that that kind
of map the development of different

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:06.860
of map the development of different
 

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.800
of map the development of different
groups of people and compare them

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:08.810
groups of people and compare them
 

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:15.600
groups of people and compare them
relative to each other so i was using

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:15.610
relative to each other so i was using
 

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.939
relative to each other so i was using
GIS statistics which is geographical

00:10:18.939 --> 00:10:18.949
GIS statistics which is geographical
 

00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:22.870
GIS statistics which is geographical
information systems that are tied into

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880
information systems that are tied into
 

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.100
information systems that are tied into
the census statistics to give an image

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:27.110
the census statistics to give an image
 

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:31.179
the census statistics to give an image
to the data so when you fill out a

00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:31.189
to the data so when you fill out a
 

00:10:31.189 --> 00:10:33.639
to the data so when you fill out a
census because you have an address all

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:33.649
census because you have an address all
 

00:10:33.649 --> 00:10:36.420
census because you have an address all
of the data is keyed into the address

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:36.430
of the data is keyed into the address
 

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:40.389
of the data is keyed into the address
but again I was not really wanting to

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399
but again I was not really wanting to
 

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:43.990
but again I was not really wanting to
show geography everything is shown more

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000
show geography everything is shown more
 

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.139
show geography everything is shown more
abstract so it's just on a grid what

00:10:47.139 --> 00:10:47.149
abstract so it's just on a grid what
 

00:10:47.149 --> 00:10:49.360
abstract so it's just on a grid what
these are our the census tables that I

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:49.370
these are our the census tables that I
 

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.460
these are our the census tables that I
actually used for the different areas to

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:53.470
actually used for the different areas to
 

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.210
actually used for the different areas to
visualize

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:55.220
visualize
 

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.019
visualize
the concepts these are concepts of the

00:10:59.019 --> 00:10:59.029
the concepts these are concepts of the
 

00:10:59.029 --> 00:11:04.150
the concepts these are concepts of the
black city and this one deals with the

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160
black city and this one deals with the
 

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:11.369
black city and this one deals with the
concept of minorities and typically in

00:11:11.369 --> 00:11:11.379
concept of minorities and typically in
 

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.749
concept of minorities and typically in
statistical charts minorities are

00:11:13.749 --> 00:11:13.759
statistical charts minorities are
 

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:16.449
statistical charts minorities are
represented with pie charts and so part

00:11:16.449 --> 00:11:16.459
represented with pie charts and so part
 

00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:18.360
represented with pie charts and so part
of what I'm doing is playing with the

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:18.370
of what I'm doing is playing with the
 

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:22.150
of what I'm doing is playing with the
representation of the statistics at the

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160
representation of the statistics at the
 

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:28.030
representation of the statistics at the
same time that I'm visualizing them so

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.040
same time that I'm visualizing them so
 

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.530
same time that I'm visualizing them so
I'm trying to spatial eyes the

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:29.540
I'm trying to spatial eyes the
 

00:11:29.540 --> 00:12:15.140
I'm trying to spatial eyes the
statistics

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:15.150
 

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.560
okay so actually part of the show is

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:18.570
okay so actually part of the show is
 

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.940
okay so actually part of the show is
missing but what you're seeing here is

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:21.950
missing but what you're seeing here is
 

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:27.410
missing but what you're seeing here is
the concept of white flight and the

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.420
the concept of white flight and the
 

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.810
the concept of white flight and the
corresponding concept black belt which

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:29.820
corresponding concept black belt which
 

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.420
corresponding concept black belt which
do deal with the migration of blacks and

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:32.430
do deal with the migration of blacks and
 

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:37.220
do deal with the migration of blacks and
whites so similar to the social explorer

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:37.230
whites so similar to the social explorer
 

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.440
whites so similar to the social explorer
maps that I showed in the beginning that

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:39.450
maps that I showed in the beginning that
 

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.690
maps that I showed in the beginning that
kind of show the movement of people

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:41.700
kind of show the movement of people
 

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.110
kind of show the movement of people
across the United States that's what

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120
across the United States that's what
 

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.140
across the United States that's what
what these are our mapping and they end

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:48.150
what these are our mapping and they end
 

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:53.960
what these are our mapping and they end
up being inverses of each other so when

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:53.970
up being inverses of each other so when
 

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:58.640
up being inverses of each other so when
I started this project I I kind of began

00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:58.650
I started this project I I kind of began
 

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.840
I started this project I I kind of began
in a way from a social sciences

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:01.850
in a way from a social sciences
 

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.280
in a way from a social sciences
perspective but without really having

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:04.290

that you're seeing are very abstract and
 

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:42.980
that you're seeing are very abstract and
kind of even for architecture abstract

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:42.990
kind of even for architecture abstract
 

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.810
kind of even for architecture abstract
they don't look like shapes that you've

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:45.820
they don't look like shapes that you've
 

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.200
they don't look like shapes that you've
seen and I was trying very much to not

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.210
seen and I was trying very much to not
 

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.440
seen and I was trying very much to not
have it look like shapes that I knew to

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:52.450
have it look like shapes that I knew to
 

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.169
have it look like shapes that I knew to
not make it look like buildings because

00:18:55.169 --> 00:18:55.179
not make it look like buildings because
 

00:18:55.179 --> 00:18:58.230
not make it look like buildings because
it's not forming buildings its forming

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240
it's not forming buildings its forming
 

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.739
it's not forming buildings its forming
the forces behind the buildings the

00:19:01.739 --> 00:19:01.749
the forces behind the buildings the
 

00:19:01.749 --> 00:19:15.150
the forces behind the buildings the
forces behind the social structure

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:15.160
 

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.090
so my project in doing this is actually

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.100
so my project in doing this is actually
 

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:24.390
so my project in doing this is actually
the black city squared which is the

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400
the black city squared which is the
 

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.180
the black city squared which is the
inversion or interruption and reframing

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:27.190
inversion or interruption and reframing
 

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:31.410
inversion or interruption and reframing
of the black city in the hopes that in

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:31.420
of the black city in the hopes that in
 

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.590
of the black city in the hopes that in
the process there might be new new

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600
the process there might be new new
 

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.480
the process there might be new new
techniques which could be architectural

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:36.490
techniques which could be architectural
 

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:41.400
techniques which could be architectural
or urban techniques that could like from

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:41.410
or urban techniques that could like from
 

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.470
or urban techniques that could like from
an architect's perspective that could

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.480
an architect's perspective that could
 

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.920
an architect's perspective that could
help help reframe an architectural

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:46.930
help help reframe an architectural
 

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.440
help help reframe an architectural
discourse or an architectural practice

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:49.450
discourse or an architectural practice
 

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.560
discourse or an architectural practice
so the images you see are like to me

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:52.570
so the images you see are like to me
 

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.050
so the images you see are like to me
science fiction fantasy images and

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:55.060
science fiction fantasy images and
 

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.240
science fiction fantasy images and
that's a large part of it but it's this

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:57.250
that's a large part of it but it's this
 

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.600
that's a large part of it but it's this
idea of different things not different

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:00.610
idea of different things not different
 

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.880
idea of different things not different
but very specific things coming together

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:02.890
but very specific things coming together
 

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.930
but very specific things coming together
like for instance in the studio that I

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:06.940
like for instance in the studio that I
 

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:12.720
like for instance in the studio that I
taught this is the end of the images the

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:12.730
taught this is the end of the images the
 

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:16.080
taught this is the end of the images the
students looked at not just Harlem they

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:16.090
students looked at not just Harlem they
 

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:21.650
students looked at not just Harlem they
looked at Miami Chicago New Orleans

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660
looked at Miami Chicago New Orleans
 

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.320
looked at Miami Chicago New Orleans
different cities and we analyzed the

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:25.330
different cities and we analyzed the
 

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.140
different cities and we analyzed the
dynamics of those cities and things that

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:28.150
dynamics of those cities and things that
 

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:29.640
dynamics of those cities and things that
the students were looking at were much

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:29.650
the students were looking at were much
 

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:31.800
the students were looking at were much
more specific than what I looked at so I

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:31.810
more specific than what I looked at so I
 

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.990
more specific than what I looked at so I
had done this project and it became a

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000
had done this project and it became a
 

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.260
had done this project and it became a
base that the students worked off of so

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:37.270
base that the students worked off of so
 

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.350
base that the students worked off of so
a student in New York was looking at red

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:40.360
a student in New York was looking at red
 

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.280
a student in New York was looking at red
hook and she looked at the red lining

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:44.290
hook and she looked at the red lining
 

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:49.230
hook and she looked at the red lining
process of you know mortgage mortgage

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240
process of you know mortgage mortgage
 

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.870
process of you know mortgage mortgage
lending in the city and the development

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880
lending in the city and the development
 

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.080
lending in the city and the development
of neighborhoods based on unlike

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:55.090
of neighborhoods based on unlike
 

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.800
of neighborhoods based on unlike
redlining or redistricting for voting

00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:58.810
redlining or redistricting for voting
 

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.750
redlining or redistricting for voting
and the way that people are kind of

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:00.760
and the way that people are kind of
 

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.730
and the way that people are kind of
positioned in the city and sort of

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:02.740
positioned in the city and sort of
 

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.060
positioned in the city and sort of
restricted from moving or allowed to

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:06.070
restricted from moving or allowed to
 

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:10.500
restricted from moving or allowed to
move based on these types of policies so

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:10.510
move based on these types of policies so
 

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:11.730
move based on these types of policies so
working with the students it was

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:11.740
working with the students it was
 

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.710
working with the students it was
actually really interesting because they

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720
actually really interesting because they
 

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.140
actually really interesting because they
while I wanted the project to be much

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:16.150
while I wanted the project to be much
 

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.960
while I wanted the project to be much
more abstract they wanted things to be

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:18.970
more abstract they wanted things to be
 

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.640
more abstract they wanted things to be
more concrete so so we worked with very

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:22.650
more concrete so so we worked with very
 

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.710
more concrete so so we worked with very
like it was actually very helpful for me

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720
like it was actually very helpful for me
 

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.650
like it was actually very helpful for me
we worked with much more

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:27.660
we worked with much more
 

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.950
we worked with much more
concrete realizations of of like say the

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:31.960
concrete realizations of of like say the
 

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.510
concrete realizations of of like say the
the idea of migration or or of policing

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:36.520
the idea of migration or or of policing
 

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.650
the idea of migration or or of policing
a student looked at policing in terms of

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:39.660
a student looked at policing in terms of
 

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.180
a student looked at policing in terms of
surveillance cameras in the city and

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:42.190
surveillance cameras in the city and
 

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.010
surveillance cameras in the city and
where you can get maps of where

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:44.020
where you can get maps of where
 

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.620
where you can get maps of where
surveillance cameras are and what she

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:46.630
surveillance cameras are and what she
 

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:49.770
surveillance cameras are and what she
found which was a surprise to her was

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:49.780
found which was a surprise to her was
 

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.100
found which was a surprise to her was
that the cameras are actually trained

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:53.110
that the cameras are actually trained
 

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:57.000
that the cameras are actually trained
more on objects than people and that

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.010
more on objects than people and that
 

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.800
more on objects than people and that
based on the way that the cameras are

00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:58.810
based on the way that the cameras are
 

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.720
based on the way that the cameras are
positioned in the city it's obvious that

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:00.730
positioned in the city it's obvious that
 

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:04.460
positioned in the city it's obvious that
our culture values objects over people

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:04.470
our culture values objects over people
 

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:07.740
our culture values objects over people
so I don't know so it's kind of an

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:07.750
so I don't know so it's kind of an
 

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.620
so I don't know so it's kind of an
interesting process where sometimes

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:10.630
interesting process where sometimes
 

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.720
interesting process where sometimes
you're surprised by the result that you

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:12.730
you're surprised by the result that you
 

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.300
you're surprised by the result that you
get and other times you you sort of know

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:15.310
get and other times you you sort of know
 

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.880
get and other times you you sort of know
what you're going to get um you know

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:17.890
what you're going to get um you know
 

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:39.120
what you're going to get um you know
when you begin in any way thank you

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:39.130
 

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:45.220
um doorways and actually the

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:45.230
um doorways and actually the
 

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.590
um doorways and actually the
neighborhood's they were trained on the

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600
neighborhood's they were trained on the
 

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.140
neighborhood's they were trained on the
neighborhoods where the money was so

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:50.150
neighborhoods where the money was so
 

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.180
neighborhoods where the money was so
they weren't where I think what she

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:52.190
they weren't where I think what she
 

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:57.570
they weren't where I think what she
expected was that they were they were

00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:57.580
expected was that they were they were
 

00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:01.029
expected was that they were they were
crime prevention measures you know that

00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039
crime prevention measures you know that
 

00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:03.460
crime prevention measures you know that
that they would be there to sort of map

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:03.470
that they would be there to sort of map
 

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:07.500
that they would be there to sort of map
the people who were I don't know

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:07.510
the people who were I don't know
 

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.090
the people who were I don't know
susceptible to to be criminals or

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:10.100
susceptible to to be criminals or
 

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.570
susceptible to to be criminals or
whatever but but actually it was much

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:13.580
whatever but but actually it was much
 

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.149
whatever but but actually it was much
more about where the money was and and

00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159
more about where the money was and and
 

00:23:16.159 --> 00:23:20.080
more about where the money was and and
sort of securing it and so in places

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.090
sort of securing it and so in places
 

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:22.210
sort of securing it and so in places
where the crime rate was high there

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:22.220
where the crime rate was high there
 

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.159
where the crime rate was high there
weren't necessarily cameras in those

00:23:24.159 --> 00:23:24.169
weren't necessarily cameras in those
 

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:26.980
weren't necessarily cameras in those
places there were cameras in places that

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:26.990
places there were cameras in places that
 

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:30.760
places there were cameras in places that
were safer than like the high-risk

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:30.770
were safer than like the high-risk
 

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:44.399
were safer than like the high-risk
places

00:23:44.399 --> 00:23:44.409
 

00:23:44.409 --> 00:23:46.560
said you were trying to get away from

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:46.570
said you were trying to get away from
 

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:51.499
said you were trying to get away from
shapes of buildings

00:23:51.499 --> 00:23:51.509
 

00:23:51.509 --> 00:23:54.330
yeah that's a good question i'm one of

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:54.340
yeah that's a good question i'm one of
 

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.110
yeah that's a good question i'm one of
the limits this of this model is that

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120
the limits this of this model is that
 

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:03.840
the limits this of this model is that
the shapes but i had a kind of model in

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:03.850
the shapes but i had a kind of model in
 

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:10.259
the shapes but i had a kind of model in
mind there's a there's an MIT science

00:24:10.259 --> 00:24:10.269
mind there's a there's an MIT science
 

00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:14.389
mind there's a there's an MIT science
model that looks at phenomena like

00:24:14.389 --> 00:24:14.399
model that looks at phenomena like
 

00:24:14.399 --> 00:24:21.720
model that looks at phenomena like
boiling or it looks at it looks at like

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:21.730
boiling or it looks at it looks at like
 

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:26.249
boiling or it looks at it looks at like
the flow dynamic flows flows of people

00:24:26.249 --> 00:24:26.259
the flow dynamic flows flows of people
 

00:24:26.259 --> 00:24:29.749
the flow dynamic flows flows of people
flows migrations like flocking of birds

00:24:29.749 --> 00:24:29.759
flows migrations like flocking of birds
 

00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:33.659
flows migrations like flocking of birds
it it's this kind of software that maps

00:24:33.659 --> 00:24:33.669
it it's this kind of software that maps
 

00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:38.220
it it's this kind of software that maps
flows and I kind of used that as a model

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:38.230
flows and I kind of used that as a model
 

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:43.909
flows and I kind of used that as a model
for how I could realize these dynamics

00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919
for how I could realize these dynamics
 

00:24:43.919 --> 00:24:48.720
for how I could realize these dynamics
and then so that was one idea this the

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:48.730
and then so that was one idea this the
 

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:52.200
and then so that was one idea this the
software but then as it got realized i

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:52.210
software but then as it got realized i
 

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:56.519
software but then as it got realized i
was using a software called Maya and so

00:24:56.519 --> 00:24:56.529
was using a software called Maya and so
 

00:24:56.529 --> 00:24:59.759
was using a software called Maya and so
the images are actually limited by the

00:24:59.759 --> 00:24:59.769
the images are actually limited by the
 

00:24:59.769 --> 00:25:04.259
the images are actually limited by the
limitations of the software and now I

00:25:04.259 --> 00:25:04.269
limitations of the software and now I
 

00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:06.899
limitations of the software and now I
think I could use a different software

00:25:06.899 --> 00:25:06.909
think I could use a different software
 

00:25:06.909 --> 00:25:09.149
think I could use a different software
and sort of you know make slightly

00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:09.159
and sort of you know make slightly
 

00:25:09.159 --> 00:25:11.820
and sort of you know make slightly
different images but that's a problem

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:11.830
different images but that's a problem
 

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:19.360
different images but that's a problem
with us

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:19.370
 

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:24.070
um yeah well the movements that's a good

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080
um yeah well the movements that's a good
 

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.540
um yeah well the movements that's a good
question all the movements occur on a

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:28.550
question all the movements occur on a
 

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:31.470
question all the movements occur on a
grid and so the way that the techniques

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:31.480
grid and so the way that the techniques
 

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.140
grid and so the way that the techniques
which are what I started with were

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:35.150
which are what I started with were
 

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.990
which are what I started with were
designed was that they started with the

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000
designed was that they started with the
 

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.560
designed was that they started with the
definition of the word so appropriate go

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:41.570
definition of the word so appropriate go
 

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.930
definition of the word so appropriate go
to Oxford English Dictionary look up the

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:43.940
to Oxford English Dictionary look up the
 

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:47.680
to Oxford English Dictionary look up the
word appropriate and when you look up

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:47.690
word appropriate and when you look up
 

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:51.400
word appropriate and when you look up
the meaning of the word actually I've

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:51.410
the meaning of the word actually I've
 

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.650
the meaning of the word actually I've
done a few projects like this with the

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:53.660
done a few projects like this with the
 

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:57.100
done a few projects like this with the
word and words and I look for the verb

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:57.110
word and words and I look for the verb
 

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.890
word and words and I look for the verb
form of the word because it's an action

00:25:59.890 --> 00:25:59.900
form of the word because it's an action
 

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.410
form of the word because it's an action
so the action is something that can be

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:02.420
so the action is something that can be
 

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.549
so the action is something that can be
translated into an action in

00:26:05.549 --> 00:26:05.559
translated into an action in
 

00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:08.640
translated into an action in
three-dimensional software programming

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:08.650
three-dimensional software programming
 

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:13.510
three-dimensional software programming
so I move from a cultural definition to

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520
so I move from a cultural definition to
 

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.870
so I move from a cultural definition to
something which is more of an

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880
something which is more of an
 

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.120
something which is more of an
mathematical definition because it's an

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:19.130
mathematical definition because it's an
 

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:22.120
mathematical definition because it's an
action and so then I program that into

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:22.130
action and so then I program that into
 

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.780
action and so then I program that into
the computer and so the way it moves is

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:25.790
the computer and so the way it moves is
 

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:30.460
the computer and so the way it moves is
actually a result of the action of the

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:30.470
actually a result of the action of the
 

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:36.669
actually a result of the action of the
word yeah so on the grid each of the

00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679
word yeah so on the grid each of the
 

00:26:36.679 --> 00:26:39.870
word yeah so on the grid each of the
squares has a value and things happen

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:39.880
squares has a value and things happen
 

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.940
squares has a value and things happen
you know the value shift depending on

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:42.950
you know the value shift depending on
 

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:51.170
you know the value shift depending on
the action

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:51.180
 

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:56.670
yes

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:56.680
 

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.200
compared to slide down the first one is

00:26:59.200 --> 00:26:59.210
compared to slide down the first one is
 

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:06.539
compared to slide down the first one is
black signifying

00:27:06.539 --> 00:27:06.549
 

00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:10.539
yeah okay so um the idea of black

00:27:10.539 --> 00:27:10.549
yeah okay so um the idea of black
 

00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:13.959
yeah okay so um the idea of black
signifying I really got from the essay

00:27:13.959 --> 00:27:13.969
signifying I really got from the essay
 

00:27:13.969 --> 00:27:20.019
signifying I really got from the essay
the signifying monkey and looking at you

00:27:20.019 --> 00:27:20.029
the signifying monkey and looking at you
 

00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:22.359
the signifying monkey and looking at you
know just the the kind of tales of the

00:27:22.359 --> 00:27:22.369
know just the the kind of tales of the
 

00:27:22.369 --> 00:27:27.039
know just the the kind of tales of the
signifying monkey on the one hand but

00:27:27.039 --> 00:27:27.049
signifying monkey on the one hand but
 

00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:30.279
signifying monkey on the one hand but
then also the patois example um is the

00:27:30.279 --> 00:27:30.289
then also the patois example um is the
 

00:27:30.289 --> 00:27:36.249
then also the patois example um is the
other where we're through a kind of

00:27:36.249 --> 00:27:36.259
other where we're through a kind of
 

00:27:36.259 --> 00:27:39.369
other where we're through a kind of
gamesmanship um there's there's this

00:27:39.369 --> 00:27:39.379
gamesmanship um there's there's this
 

00:27:39.379 --> 00:27:43.239
gamesmanship um there's there's this
game of like one-upmanship so I say

00:27:43.239 --> 00:27:43.249
game of like one-upmanship so I say
 

00:27:43.249 --> 00:27:45.549
game of like one-upmanship so I say
something you say something that kind of

00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559
something you say something that kind of
 

00:27:45.559 --> 00:27:48.759
something you say something that kind of
like you know raises the stakes on what

00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:48.769
like you know raises the stakes on what
 

00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:52.719
like you know raises the stakes on what
I say kind of like makes me rethink what

00:27:52.719 --> 00:27:52.729
I say kind of like makes me rethink what
 

00:27:52.729 --> 00:27:56.639
I say kind of like makes me rethink what
I say or kind of turns it over and

00:27:56.639 --> 00:27:56.649
I say or kind of turns it over and
 

00:27:56.649 --> 00:28:00.699
I say or kind of turns it over and
reforms what I say and that's kind of

00:28:00.699 --> 00:28:00.709
reforms what I say and that's kind of
 

00:28:00.709 --> 00:28:03.609
reforms what I say and that's kind of
the idea behind the techniques in the

00:28:03.609 --> 00:28:03.619
the idea behind the techniques in the
 

00:28:03.619 --> 00:28:05.919
the idea behind the techniques in the
black city so it's the idea that there

00:28:05.919 --> 00:28:05.929
black city so it's the idea that there
 

00:28:05.929 --> 00:28:07.690
black city so it's the idea that there
might be techniques that could be

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:07.700
might be techniques that could be
 

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.989
might be techniques that could be
employed that could if you don't have

00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:10.999
employed that could if you don't have
 

00:28:10.999 --> 00:28:12.909
employed that could if you don't have
very much power that could be employed

00:28:12.909 --> 00:28:12.919
very much power that could be employed
 

00:28:12.919 --> 00:28:16.239
very much power that could be employed
to empower you you know as a way of

00:28:16.239 --> 00:28:16.249
to empower you you know as a way of
 

00:28:16.249 --> 00:28:20.680
to empower you you know as a way of
subverting a dominant order the reason I

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:20.690
subverting a dominant order the reason I
 

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:24.549
subverting a dominant order the reason I
I kind of moved in that direction was

00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559
I kind of moved in that direction was
 

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:29.159
I kind of moved in that direction was
that in architecture there's always

00:28:29.159 --> 00:28:29.169
that in architecture there's always
 

00:28:29.169 --> 00:28:31.629
that in architecture there's always
there's a discourse in architecture

00:28:31.629 --> 00:28:31.639
there's a discourse in architecture
 

00:28:31.639 --> 00:28:34.199
there's a discourse in architecture
about blackness and architecture and

00:28:34.199 --> 00:28:34.209
about blackness and architecture and
 

00:28:34.209 --> 00:28:39.339
about blackness and architecture and
what where black architects are first of

00:28:39.339 --> 00:28:39.349
what where black architects are first of
 

00:28:39.349 --> 00:28:42.879
what where black architects are first of
all said to not exist um and they do and

00:28:42.879 --> 00:28:42.889
all said to not exist um and they do and
 

00:28:42.889 --> 00:28:47.079
all said to not exist um and they do and
they have for some time so they don't

00:28:47.079 --> 00:28:47.089
they have for some time so they don't
 

00:28:47.089 --> 00:28:50.589
they have for some time so they don't
exist there's no precedent they have no

00:28:50.589 --> 00:28:50.599
exist there's no precedent they have no
 

00:28:50.599 --> 00:28:54.430
exist there's no precedent they have no
history and this this kind of discourse

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:54.440
history and this this kind of discourse
 

00:28:54.440 --> 00:29:02.379
history and this this kind of discourse
is often combated with a kind of retreat

00:29:02.379 --> 00:29:02.389
is often combated with a kind of retreat
 

00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:05.049
is often combated with a kind of retreat
to aesthetics but it's in my mind is

00:29:05.049 --> 00:29:05.059
to aesthetics but it's in my mind is
 

00:29:05.059 --> 00:29:07.749
to aesthetics but it's in my mind is
somewhat shallow retreat to aesthetics

00:29:07.749 --> 00:29:07.759
somewhat shallow retreat to aesthetics
 

00:29:07.759 --> 00:29:12.520
somewhat shallow retreat to aesthetics
on the the basis of surfaces

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:12.530
 

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:16.640
so some practitioners try to make things

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:16.650
so some practitioners try to make things
 

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:20.660
so some practitioners try to make things
that look black or look african and i

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:20.670
that look black or look african and i
 

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:22.190
that look black or look african and i
think you can see that i was very much

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200
think you can see that i was very much
 

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.790
think you can see that i was very much
trying not to do that maybe to a fault

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:25.800
trying not to do that maybe to a fault
 

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.890
trying not to do that maybe to a fault
trying not to do that so what I was

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:30.900
trying not to do that so what I was
 

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.840
trying not to do that so what I was
interested in in signification is that

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:32.850
interested in in signification is that
 

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:36.320
interested in in signification is that
it's a strategy it's it's like a it's

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:36.330
it's a strategy it's it's like a it's
 

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:39.490
it's a strategy it's it's like a it's
not a form it's something that you could

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:39.500
not a form it's something that you could
 

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:45.530
not a form it's something that you could
employ it's not a form it's a method and

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:45.540
employ it's not a form it's a method and
 

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.440
employ it's not a form it's a method and
I was looking for methods because

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:48.450
I was looking for methods because
 

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.450
I was looking for methods because
methods you can they can take any shape

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:50.460
methods you can they can take any shape
 

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:54.140
methods you can they can take any shape
and so so it wouldn't just be about what

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:54.150
and so so it wouldn't just be about what
 

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:55.730
and so so it wouldn't just be about what
something look like and you know

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:55.740
something look like and you know
 

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.040
something look like and you know
whatever that was could change it would

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:58.050
whatever that was could change it would
 

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:02.560
whatever that was could change it would
be about how it acted how it performed

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:02.570

00:36:17.499 --> 00:36:17.509
 

00:36:17.509 --> 00:36:19.319
so you have a kind of neo-colonial

00:36:19.319 --> 00:36:19.329
so you have a kind of neo-colonial
 

00:36:19.329 --> 00:36:23.109
so you have a kind of neo-colonial

the kind of image of Harlem as a kind of

black mecca's like somewhat shifting

00:36:51.189 --> 00:36:51.199
black mecca's like somewhat shifting
 

00:36:51.199 --> 00:36:54.899
black mecca's like somewhat shifting
because the reality is is that it's um

00:36:54.899 --> 00:36:54.909
because the reality is is that it's um
 

00:36:54.909 --> 00:36:59.379
because the reality is is that it's um
mixing a lot more yes so the ownership

00:36:59.379 --> 00:36:59.389
mixing a lot more yes so the ownership
 

00:36:59.389 --> 00:37:02.409
mixing a lot more yes so the ownership
is actually living there as opposed to

00:37:02.409 --> 00:37:02.419
is actually living there as opposed to
 

00:37:02.419 --> 00:37:05.109
is actually living there as opposed to
living elsewhere that's right well you

00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119
living elsewhere that's right well you
 

00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:08.109

have puppies and gentrification yeah and

00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119
have puppies and gentrification yeah and
 

00:37:08.119 --> 00:37:23.559
have puppies and gentrification yeah and
everything else any final questions

00:37:23.559 --> 00:37:23.569
 

00:37:23.569 --> 00:37:30.579
and was this that kind of grid with yeah

00:37:30.579 --> 00:37:30.589
and was this that kind of grid with yeah
 

00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:34.120
and was this that kind of grid with yeah
well um yeah that was a kind of

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:34.130
well um yeah that was a kind of
 

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:41.170
well um yeah that was a kind of
catalogue of values and it that's sort

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:41.180
catalogue of values and it that's sort
 

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:44.259
catalogue of values and it that's sort
of the part that I'm still working on

00:37:44.259 --> 00:37:44.269
of the part that I'm still working on
 

00:37:44.269 --> 00:37:46.509
of the part that I'm still working on
it's the idea that there are infinite

00:37:46.509 --> 00:37:46.519
it's the idea that there are infinite
 

00:37:46.519 --> 00:37:50.140
it's the idea that there are infinite
values and that values are many things

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:50.150
values and that values are many things
 

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:53.949
values and that values are many things
like um they could be it's a way that

00:37:53.949 --> 00:37:53.959
like um they could be it's a way that
 

00:37:53.959 --> 00:37:57.699
like um they could be it's a way that
surfaces are marked tag right but

00:37:57.699 --> 00:37:57.709
surfaces are marked tag right but
 

00:37:57.709 --> 00:38:00.130
surfaces are marked tag right but
materially so they're they're kind of

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:00.140
materially so they're they're kind of
 

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.400
materially so they're they're kind of
that that matter has cultural

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:03.410
that that matter has cultural
 

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:07.329
that that matter has cultural
significance but that depending on where

00:38:07.329 --> 00:38:07.339
significance but that depending on where
 

00:38:07.339 --> 00:38:09.549
significance but that depending on where
it's placed it might be read differently

00:38:09.549 --> 00:38:09.559
it's placed it might be read differently
 

00:38:09.559 --> 00:38:14.349
it's placed it might be read differently
so so the idea of of that catalog is

00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:14.359
so so the idea of of that catalog is
 

00:38:14.359 --> 00:38:18.459
so so the idea of of that catalog is
that there would be a bank of surfaces

00:38:18.459 --> 00:38:18.469
that there would be a bank of surfaces
 

00:38:18.469 --> 00:38:21.969
that there would be a bank of surfaces
that could be applied in the city and

00:38:21.969 --> 00:38:21.979
that could be applied in the city and
 

00:38:21.979 --> 00:38:24.849
that could be applied in the city and
depending on where they were they might

00:38:24.849 --> 00:38:24.859
depending on where they were they might
 

00:38:24.859 --> 00:38:33.940
depending on where they were they might
be valued differently so thank you
