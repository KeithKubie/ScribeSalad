00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.270
Now that you've decided how to
structure your data, it's time to write

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.530
the code that will write these shopping
list items into the correct location and

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.900
read them as well.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.620
Okay, so on our shopping list page we
currently have a useless button for

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.400
adding more items.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.980
When I click Add Item here it
doesn't really do anything.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.510
Here's what I want you to do.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.780
When you click the fab and you enter
the name of the item, and you press

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.440
Add Item, what it should do is it should
see what shopping list you're on.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.120
Go to a node called shopping list items.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.260
Use the push ID for the shopping
list that you're currently on, and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.450
create an item under that push ID.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.770
Did you catch all that?

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.410
Let me show you a quick example.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.460
Say I've got a shopping list
with the push ID, 1234.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.630
When I want to add a new item,
such as bacon to this shopping list,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.410
it'll go to this node
shopping list items,

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.020
make a node with the same key
as the shopping list up here.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.890
And then put the bacon item there.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.330
If I wanted to add lettuce and tomato
to the same list, with the key 1234,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.010
they would also be added to the node
shopping list items, with the child one,

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.600
two, three, four.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.670
Now, you might have noticed that I
didn't tell you what the keys for

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.910
these would be.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.750
What you want to make these keys
is up for you to figure out.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.700
And just to drive what's going on home,
let's say that I have another list

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.360
with the push key 1999, and
I wanted to add cooking oil.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.780
That would look like this.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.340
Instead of adding it onto
the list of items in 1234,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.460
you would go to the list 1999 and
make a new item there.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.620
Getting the data to add in the correct
place is the trickiest part of this

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.670
exercise.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.310
Remember that you should
have saved the list ID in

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.100
a member variable called mListID.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.640
Just like when we started to
have multiple shopping lists,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.550
start by just getting the data to
appear in the Firebase back end.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.520
Once you've got the data correctly
adding itself in the back end, then you

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.180
should set up a Firebase list adaptor
that will display your items here.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.440
This actually really isn't much
different than when we added

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.730
the Firebase list adaptor in
the shopping list fragment.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.230
So you can refer to that if you need to.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.990
I'll send over the spec now.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.450
And finally, sorry, before I forget.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.070
You should remember also that when you
delete a list, using this Remove dialog,

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.640
that it should also delete all the items
that are associated with the list.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.270
Okay, good luck.
