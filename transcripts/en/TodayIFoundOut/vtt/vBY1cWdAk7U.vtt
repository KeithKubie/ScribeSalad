00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.500
For thousands of years, Mohave tribes dotted
the land in and around what is now the modern-day

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.330
city of Las Vegas.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.230
Sometime in the 1770s, Spanish missionary
Francisco Gracias became the first foreigner

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.840
to encounter the tribes.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.899
As he detailed in his travel notes, their
meeting was quite friendly.

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:31.829
In 1826, the first English-speaking explorer,
Jedediah Smith, came upon this land and the

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:32.829
tribes.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.680
In a letter he wrote to General William Clark,
the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.710
US, he described his peaceful encounter,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.730
After traveling 300 miles in that direction
through a country somewhat fertile, in which

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.329
there was a great many Indians, mostly naked
and destitute of arms, with the exception

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.679
of a few bows and arrows and what is very
singular amongst Indians, they cut their hair

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.319
to the length of three inches; they proved
to be friendly; their manner of living is

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:01.289
on fish, roots, acorns and grass.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.730
Only three years later, the Mexican trader
Antonio Armijo was traveling with his company

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.990
through the area (though a bit to the north)
to forge a trade route from New Mexico to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.150
Los Angeles.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.219
They were thrilled to find the valley to be
somewhat fertile and wet, unlike most of their

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:17.219
desert travels.

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.750
So, they named it “Las Vegas,” meaning
“fertile plains.”

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.630
The great explorer John Fremont, appointed
by President John Tyler, led a company of

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.590
surveyors and scouts through the valley and
beyond in 1844.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.070
He went on to publish his report that ended
up being the guide for settlers in years to

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.460
come, entitled “Report of the Exploring
Expedition to the Rocky Mountains 1842 to

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.170
Oregon and Northern California in 1843-44.”

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.090
In it, he describes “gushing springs”
that were great to swim in.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.000
Within ten years, the Las Vegas Valley had
been settled by a variety of explorers, settlers,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.259
traders, and missionaries.

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.939
In 1854, the US Congress commissioned it be
a regular stop on the monthly mail service

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.450
route between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles
while appropriating $25,000 (about $638,000

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.689
today) for military and mail roads.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.580
Among the missionaries settling down in Vegas
were Mormons.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.440
In fact, Brigham Young in spring 1855 called
for thirty men to make their permanent home

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.780
in the Las Vegas Valley with the assignment
to “build a fort there to protect immigrants

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.100
and the United States mail from Indians.”

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.530
For the next fifty years, settlements in the
Las Vegas Valley continued as not much more

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.630
than train stops, sporadic mining towns, and
trading posts.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.660
According to Robert McCracken’s book “Las
Vegas: The Great American Playground,” May

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.470
15, 1905 was when all that changed and Las
Vegas at least began to resemble the town

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.530
we now know today.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.450
On that day, three thousand speculators arrived
mostly from LA and Salt Lake City and were

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.720
given a chance to bid on lots of land along
the railroad.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.780
The man who initiated this owned the land
near the railroad and figured to make a tidy

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.130
profit from the sales.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.680
This man was US Senator William Andrews Clark,
whom the county that Las Vegas currently resides

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.950
in is named after – Clark County.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.560
Directly thereafter, businesses and establishments
that catered to the railway traveler and worker

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.560
were built.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.350
Downtown Las Vegas was born.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.970
Completely counter to modern Vegas, it was
technically a “temperance town” during

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.811
its early years, meaning that “no liquor
clauses” were written into the deeds of

00:03:23.811 --> 00:03:24.811
the lots.

00:03:24.811 --> 00:03:26.360
But there were exceptions.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.360
Many of them.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.000
Drug stores, doctor offices, and restaurants
that served food were all allowed to sell

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
alcohol.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.040
Additionally, after much push back, establishments
in Block 16 and Block 17, between first and

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.430
third street on Ogden and Stewart Streets,
were given the green light to serve.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.590
This became known as the “red-light district”
of old Las Vegas.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.790
Bars, saloons, hotels, and brothels populated
the area with the Arizona Club being the biggest

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.790
of them all.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.910
Despite this, in 1910, gambling was officially
made illegal.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.830
At least in theory.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.210
For the rest of the country, the Eighteenth
Amendment was ratified in January 1919 and

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.260
went into effect the following January.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.100
Prohibition was official in the United States.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.010
Las Vegas, according McCracken’s book, “resisted
compliance with the national laws to the best

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.330
of its abilities.”

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.910
City officials would let business owners know
when they would be visited by federal agents

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.120
far in advance.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.930
Arrests were few and far between.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.530
Fines were more frequent, but even those were
quite nominal, mostly as a punishment for

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.160
not being discreet enough.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.010
Although many big cities had speakeasies and
a prosperous bootlegging industry, Las Vegas

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.150
was nearly lawless in the matter.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.690
Along with prostitution being legal at this
point, it was around this time that Las Vegas

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.310
earned its nickname “Sin City.”

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.880
The Twenty First Amendment went into law in
December 1931 and Prohibition was officially

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.290
repealed across the country.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.380
But it was actually a completely different
kind of government intervention that caused

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.150
the population of Las Vegas to boom.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.150
Construction began on the Boulder Dam (later
called Hoover Dam) in 1931, fifty miles from

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.150
Vegas.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.070
As thousands upon thousands of young, able
bodied men descended upon the giant public

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.070
project, the government attempted to keep
them in a dry and “wholesome” community

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.930
nearby called Boulder City.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.130
It didn’t work.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.560
The population of Las Vegas, a place where
tired workers could drink, fraternize, and

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.280
frequent prostitutes to their monies’ content,
quadrupled in the first year of construction

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.540
of the Boulder Dam.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.380
The influx of people brought immediate growth
in every avenue.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.370
More saloons, bars, brothels, and hotels were
constructed.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.060
Casino gambling was legalized by the Nevada
legislature in December 1931.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.120
In order to keep up with the demand, more
city projects were begun, including paved

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.010
roads, a sewer system, and police stations
(to keep up with the increase in crime).

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.810
Tourists coming from all over the country
to witness the man-made marvel of Boulder

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.520
Dam being built also made sure they stopped
in Las Vegas.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.260
From the beginning of the project in 1931
to 1939, the online Nevada Encyclopedia states

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.740
that $70 million more came into the city of
Las Vegas than was spent on the Hoover Dam.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.840
The Las Vegas Club, Apache Hotel, and Northern
Club were the first hotels to get their casino

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.840
licenses.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.450
They were all located on Fremont Street.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.830
Construction slowed during World War II, but
in December 1946, on what is now known as

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.560
the Strip, the Flamingo opened.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.650
This hotel and casino with its 105 rooms was
known as “The World’s Greatest Resort

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.650
Hotel.”

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.860
Named after a nickname of the girlfriend of
the majority owner (due to her long skinny

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.669
legs), this would be what every Vegas Hotel
&amp; Casino would be modeled after going forward.

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:45.540
That majority owner was reputed Los Angeles
gangster and criminal Bugsy Siegel.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.140
And so began, Las Vegas’s famous ties to
the mob.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.110
The Las Vegas we now know today may be full
of buffets, glamorous live entertainment,

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:58.010
24/7 gambling, and poolside drinks, but the
beginnings of “Sin City” dates all the

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.720
way back to when there were no streets, neon
signs, or even railroads.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:16.980
It was just a fertile plain located in 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.360
the Mojave Desert.
