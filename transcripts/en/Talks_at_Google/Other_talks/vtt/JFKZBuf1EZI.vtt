[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.140
ERIC: Welcome Joel Primack.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.765
JOEL PRIMACK: Thanks, Eric.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.410
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.330
I'm going to talk
about, basically,

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.350
an introduction to modern
cosmology and the simulation

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.730
game.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.990
And I'm going to mention
that the ideas we used

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.250
to have about how
galaxies form and evolve

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.800
were basically wrong.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.720
When we actually got to see
what the galaxies look like,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.330
starting with the installation
of a new camera that

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.760
gave us infrared capability on
Hubble Space Telescope in 2009,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.790
we actually saw what galaxies
look like when they start,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.070
and we were all shocked.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.640
But our simulations look
a lot like these images

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.350
that we're now
getting from Hubble,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.790
so we're beginning
to figure it out.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.210
And one of the ways
that we're hoping

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.140
to improve our understanding is
using deep learning technology.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.330
So to start with--

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.100
just to get the
terminology understood--

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.440
we live in the solar system.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.880
Earth is eight minutes--

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.530
eight light minutes
from the sun.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.060
Jupiter is 40 light minutes.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.160
Saturn's 80 light minutes.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.420
The entire solar system is
less than a light day across.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.434
The Milky Way, our home galaxy,
is 100,000 light years across--

00:01:29.434 --> 00:01:30.850
the visible part
of the Milky Way,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.120
and we live about a quarter of--

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.810
well, about half of the way
out, about 25,000 light years

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.920
away from the center.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.560
Our galaxy is part of
what we call the local,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.250
or the Virgo, SuperCluster, the
nearest 10,000 or so galaxies.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.620
There's a cluster called
the Virgo Cluster, which

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.940
is the densest group of galaxies
in a 100 million light years

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.740
around.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.620
But this is a fairly small
part of the universe.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.830
On the really large scale
of billions of light years,

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.660
we've surveyed the
universe and we

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.930
discovered that the universe
has a lot of structure.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.730
So the other thing we've learned
is that the visible universe

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.420
is just a tiny fraction
of the universe that's

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.280
really out there.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.990
What we see represents
about half of 1%.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.380
So most of the universe, as
far as the energy and matter

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.520
content, is dark
energy, about 70%.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.060
About 25% is a
mysterious stuff that we

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.600
call cold dark matter, a
theory that, as Eric said,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.650
I helped to create and develop.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.290
We don't know what it is,
but we know how it behaves.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.790
"Cold" means that
it was moving very

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.320
sluggishly in the
early universe.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.903
And, of course, that
term "sluggish"--

00:02:51.903 --> 00:02:54.495
which my collaborator
George Blumenthal, now

00:02:54.495 --> 00:02:57.280
a chancellor of UC Santa
Cruz, and I always use--

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.610
is a call out to our mascot at
Santa Cruz, the banana slug.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.670
All the atoms are about 5%.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.720
The invisible atoms are
about 4 and 1/2 percent.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.570
The visible stuff, the stars
and glowing gas clouds,

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.600
is about half a percent
of cosmic density.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.390
And the stuff we're
made of, all other atoms

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.700
besides hydrogen and helium,
is about a hundredth of 1%.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.980
So we and Earth are
extremely rare parts

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.100
of the universe that
are not typical at all.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.570
So we call this the Double
Dark Theory or, technically,

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.650
Lambda CDM.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.240
Lambda-- Einstein's
representation for dark

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.440
energy--

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.020
and cold dark matter.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.890
So dark matter and dark energy.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.340
Imagine the entire universe
is an ocean of dark energy.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.410
On that ocean sail
billions of ghostly ships

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.250
made of dark matter.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.500
But we don't see the ocean
and we don't see the ships,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.160
we just see the lights on
the tops of the tallest

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.980
mast of the biggest ships.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.710
Those are the galaxies.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.214
Now, how do we know
that this is true?

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:08.630
And the answer is,
the theory made

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.880
all kinds of predictions
that were subsequently

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.640
confirmed in fantastic detail.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.529
For example, the green curve
is the predicted distribution

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.649
of fluctuations in temperature
in the cosmic background

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:22.470
radiation.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.070
This is the map of
the whole sky as seen

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.730
by the Planck satellite, our
latest instrument for this.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.950
And every one of these
little red points

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.380
is an independent measurement.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.350
And the agreement is
absolutely spectacular.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.950
And this is the temperature
polarization data,

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.840
the polarization
polarization data.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.770
And also, for the large scale
distribution of the galaxies

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.640
it's a similar story.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.190
As we look out in space
we're looking back in time,

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.370
because we see light
that left longer ago when

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.060
we look farther out.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.050
So we're seeing those galaxies
as they were longer and longer

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.980
ago.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.700
Nearby galaxies, like
our own Milky Way,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.830
we see on the scale
of 100,000 years ago,

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.740
nearby stars a few years ago.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.470
As you look further
out this first sphere

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.500
represents the period
when the earth and the sun

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.800
formed, about 4 and
1/2 billion years ago.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.630
And the next sphere
represents when

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.880
big galaxies like the Milky
Way took, more or less,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.150
their present shape.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.470
So these galaxies look
like nearby galaxies.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.010
They're not very different.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.150
But if you look beyond--

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.566
that's about 10
billion years ago.

00:05:30.566 --> 00:05:32.586
If you look beyond
that, the galaxies

00:05:32.586 --> 00:05:33.710
look very different indeed.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.882
These are all images from
Hubble Space Telescope.

00:05:35.882 --> 00:05:37.340
And one of the
things you'll notice

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.790
is that they're not very round.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.470
And that's turned out to be
the common understanding.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:53.342
And beyond the visible galaxies
is this cosmic dark ages,

00:05:53.342 --> 00:05:55.550
where galaxies haven't yet
formed enough stars for us

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.010
to see them.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.890
We'll start to see a
little further into this

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.760
when James Webb Space Telescope
gets launched next year.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.440
Then the cosmic
background radiation,

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.000
this colorful sphere,
and The Big Bang itself.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.800
Now, simulations allow
theorists to make

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.120
metaphorical or real movies
of how the universe evolves.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.672
The astronomers basically
just give us snapshots.

00:06:19.672 --> 00:06:22.130
We don't get to see how galaxies
evolve because they evolve

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.620
on a time scale of hundreds
of thousands of years

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.790
to hundreds of millions
or even billions of years.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.680
Cosmological dark
matter simulations

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.140
show large-scale structure
and the properties

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.440
of the lumps of dark
matter that we call halos,

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.410
and then we can try to
put galaxies into those.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.980
If you look at a galaxy,
the part that you see

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.970
is just a tiny little
fraction of the full galaxy

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.840
that's actually there.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.270
So this is a dark matter halo
of a galaxy like the Milky Way,

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.390
with these big lumps
hosting satellites

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.520
and the smaller lumps invisible.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.460
But maybe having effects
that we can see, for example,

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.140
on gravitational lensing.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.900
How does this fit into
the large scale structure?

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.750
More or less like this.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.200
So this is a slice from
one of our big simulations

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.780
that we ran next door
at NASA Ames Research

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.770
Center on the biggest
NASA computer, which

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.880
is called Pleiades.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.950
This one took about
two months using

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.760
about 14,000 cores on Pleiades.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.220
And we've run a bunch of
these big simulations.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.990
So let's zoom in on a little
piece of this big simulation.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.701
It's only about a thousandth
of the size of the simulation

00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:44.200
itself.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.241
So this is what the distribution
of dark matter halos

00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:50.740
looks like.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.400
What you see is a rich
cluster, a cluster

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.500
with thousands of
galaxies, would

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.150
be hosted by this big
lump of dark matter.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.680
The white areas are regions
with a lot of dark matter.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.650
And these big clumps form
where these filaments cross.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.740
The dark matter is
spread out along

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.590
these long, linear structures
that we call filaments,

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.870
and galaxies really are
distributed primarily

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.340
in these long,
linear structures,

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.100
just as the theory predicts.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:30.710
Now, how did this massive
cluster halo form?

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.840
We keep track when we
run the big simulations

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.960
of every single particle,
many billion particles,

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.120
and every dark matter halo.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.419
And all of the
things you see here,

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.100
the thousands of
halos-- each of which

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.770
will be hosting galaxies
or maybe several galaxies--

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.210
are going to end up in that one
structure, the big central one.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.950
Notice that they're
not spherical.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.970
They're elongated.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.880
The earlier they form and
the more massive they are,

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.562
the more elongated they are.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.542
As these halos accrete
they change their shape,

00:09:08.542 --> 00:09:10.000
and what we're
doing is playing you

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.790
the video based on storying
about 200 time steps

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.330
as the big simulation ran.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.710
So that's the dark matter halo.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.540
Of course, all of
that substructure

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.140
continues to exist inside
that halo and the galaxies.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.460
So we try to
understand in detail

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.040
how stars form in galaxies.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.720
A couple years ago--
last year, I guess,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.190
is when they finally came out--

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.710
we published this
paper suggesting

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:48.820
that maybe the way the dark
matter halos accrete matter

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.940
is what's really controlling
star formation in at least many

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.090
of the dark matter halos,
hosting star-forming galaxies.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.630
We called this Stellar Halo
Accretion Rate Co-evolution,

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.160
or SHARC for short.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.130
There's a kind of
model that theorists

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.900
make that we call bathtub
models of galaxy formation

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.680
and, of course, I put
the SHARC in the bathtub.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.500
So we came up with
that clever name

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.900
so people would remember it.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.650
And I need to tell you,
to explain this story, two

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:18.300
basic facts about galaxies.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.110
And this will also,
I think, give you

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.020
an idea of some regularities
that we're learning

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.740
about how galaxies work.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.390
So one is, the stellar
mass to halo mass ratio

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.890
as a function of halo mass.

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:33.730
The Milky Way is about a 10
to the 12 solar mass object.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.190
So Milky Way is
right around here.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:40.840
And that means that about 2% or
3% of the mass of the Milky Way

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.470
is stars.

00:10:45.934 --> 00:10:48.530
You might have
thought it was more.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.880
But that's as much
as you ever get.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.160
Lower-mass galaxies and
higher-mass galaxies

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.460
have an even smaller fraction
of their mass in stars.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.380
And also, it's pretty much
independent of redshift.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.130
These are values of
different redshifts.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.580
Redshift corresponds
to time back

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.110
in the history of the universe.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.590
But it's a strong
function of the mass.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.510
Now, the other thing
is that galaxies

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.610
form stars in a
rate that's largely

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.510
governed by the stellar mass
of the galaxy and the redshift.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.910
So this is what it is
for nearby galaxies,

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.890
and more distant galaxies.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.850
This is the stellar mass of the
galaxy and the star formation

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.470
rate, number of stars
formed per year,

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.140
stellar mass formed per year.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:34.060
And what you see is that, at
least at the lower-mass end,

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.520
we're pretty much proportional
to this plot, which

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.090
is the star formation rate just
growing linearly with the mass.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:43.300
So the rate at which galaxies
form stars is largely

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.730
regulated by the stellar
mass of the galaxy,

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.410
and it's a little
bit higher at high

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.370
redshift than at low redshift.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.690
About an order of magnitude
higher at redshift 2 and 1/2.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:56.050
So two basic facts
about how galaxies work.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.920
And what we noticed when we
looked at these big simulations

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.560
is that the dispersion-- so
we notice that the accretion

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.090
rate grows like this.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.760
So it grows by about
this order of magnitude

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.030
as you go out in redshift,
and the dispersion

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.360
is independent of mass and
independent of redshift.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.870
And the dispersion in the star
formation rate of galaxies

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.640
is known to be about 0.3 dex.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.740
In other words, a
factor of 2 up or down.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.150
Most of the stars
in the universe

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.890
form at rates that are really
controlled by the stellar mass

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:28.180
of the galaxy.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.410
And there's a simple derivation
that shows that the rate

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.890
at which stars form, as long
as there isn't much change

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.880
in the that plot that I showed
you a minute ago-- this plot,

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.030
which is stellar mass
versus halo mass--

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.230
as long as there isn't much
change with redshift, then

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.330
it's going to be
governed by this term.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.520
So the star formation
rate, the MstarDT,

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.880
is DMstar, the
Mhalo, the MhaloDT.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.650
That's the accretion rate.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.640
And that allowed us to predict
what the star formation

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.590
rate should be across more
than an order of magnitude

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:09.589
in stellar mass, and back to
redshift four, and even higher.

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:11.630
So back over most of the
history of the universe.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.030
And it actually works
remarkably well.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.800
Now I want to move
on to understanding--

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.091
so that's something about
how the large-scale structure

00:13:18.091 --> 00:13:20.345
of the universe relates
to star formation

00:13:20.345 --> 00:13:22.820
in individual galaxies.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:27.630
This is an astronaut installing
this amazing instrument

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.910
in Hubble Space Telescope.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:32.310
They took out an old instrument
that doesn't work anymore,

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:35.345
or that wasn't working so
well, Wide Field Camera 2,

00:13:35.345 --> 00:13:37.790
and they replaced it
with Wide Field Camera 3.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.310
Which, for the
first time, gave us

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:44.390
these huge Hubble images,
sharp from edge to edge,

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.280
in the infrared.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.090
And before Wide Field
Camera 3 was installed

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.940
we only had images like
this of forming galaxies.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.440
All we were seeing
was ultraviolet light,

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.334
which is emitted by the stars
that have just recently formed.

00:13:58.334 --> 00:14:00.375
You've got a few very
massive stars which put our

00:14:00.375 --> 00:14:02.041
a lot of their light
in the ultraviolet,

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:05.450
and then that gets redshifted
so that Hubble could see it

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.580
in visible wavelengths.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.680
But to see the full
stellar populations

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.360
you have to see the infrared.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.770
And that's what we now could do.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.635
These are the same galaxies.

00:14:16.635 --> 00:14:18.760
And you can see that, with
the infrared capability,

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.590
we're seeing a lot more.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:25.210
So that's the basis of
my saying that now we

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.390
can see what galaxies look
like when they were forming.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:34.540
Back to redshifts 2.3 for red
light and 3 for blue light,

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.110
that's about 10 to
12 billion years ago.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:40.870
So we can see the
galaxies-- of course,

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.810
the universe starts at 13.7
to 13.8 billion years ago,

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.579
so the first couple
of billion years

00:14:46.579 --> 00:14:48.620
we're going to have to
depend on James Webb Space

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:53.400
Telescope, which goes up
next year, to illuminate.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:59.270
So the CANDELS program was
the program that succeeded--

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.370
there was a big
competition and we at Santa

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.370
Cruz were part of
the winning team--

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:09.080
My colleague, David Kou, is an
astronomer, I'm a theorist--

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.360
who are part of
the CANDELS team.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.230
And that's Cosmic Assembly
Near-infrared Deep

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.820
Extragalactic Legacy Survey.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.370
I think David first came
out with the CANDELS acronym

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.862
and then came up with a--

00:15:20.862 --> 00:15:22.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:22.850
Anyway.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.280
So we're focusing on
this period when stars

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.370
mostly formed in the universe,
the first 5 billion years

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.690
or so.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.020
That's redshift 2, about 3
billion years after the Big

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.260
Bang.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.500
Redshift 3, less than 2 billion
years after the Big Bang.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.450
That's the peak
of star formation.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:44.040
That's when the
galaxies really formed.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.500
So to understand
galaxy formation

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.600
we do what we call
hydrodynamics simulations where

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.360
we follow the gas and
not just the dark matter.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.250
And the gas turns into stars.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:56.220
Some of the gas ends up as
supermassive black holes

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.619
at the centers of the galaxies.

00:15:57.619 --> 00:15:59.160
And, of course,
there's a huge amount

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.110
of energy output by the stars.

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:02.490
Sometimes they explode.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:03.780
More energy output.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.210
The supermassive black
holes-- as they accrete,

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.620
a lot more energy output.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.250
And we're trying to follow how
all this stuff is happening.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.230
There's basically
two approaches.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:16.680
Low-resolution
approaches, kiloparsec.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.160
That's about 3,000 light years.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.380
Small compared to
the size of a galaxy,

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.030
but very large
compared to the regions

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.940
where stars actually form.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.420
And then much higher-resolution.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.920
Tens of parsecs.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.010
So that's 100 elements
compared to these.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.440
And that's 100
cubed because it's

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.450
100 in each of the
three dimensions.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.670
So these are much more
expensive simulations.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.380
These simulations cost
100,000 to a million CPU hours

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.790
per galaxy.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.660
These simulations cost 10
or 20 million CPU hours,

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.780
and you get tens of
thousands of galaxies.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.680
But at much lower resolution.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.900
And we're actually
using both of these

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.050
to compare to the observations.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.109
I tend to emphasize
these because we

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:07.680
try to be as self-consistent as
possible in these simulations.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.150
So these are examples
from our simulations.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.920
That's a face-on image.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.210
You're seeing the gas.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.010
And there's the stars.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.470
This is what it would
look like to a telescope.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.540
This is the same
galaxy seen edge-on.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.710
So you see it's really a disk.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.550
And there it is, edge-on.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:31.740
And this is that same
galaxy, edge-on and face-on.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.350
And these are two
different observed galaxies

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:37.075
at redshift 2, about
10 billion years ago,

00:17:37.075 --> 00:17:38.700
and you're supposed
to notice that they

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:43.620
look a lot like the
simulated galaxies.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.020
Notice that they
are very clumpy.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.450
We've run the simulation
several times.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.370
We run, typically,
35 simulations

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.340
at a time, each one
costing between 100,000

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.580
and a million CPU
hours per simulation.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.920
I get tens of
millions of CPU hours

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.850
from Google and-- from
NASA Ames and other places.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:07.350
So this is some simulations that
we don't like so much anymore

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:10.890
because it turns out that the
galaxies really are elongated

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:14.790
and they don't have as many
stars as these simulations did

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:15.720
at the same redshift.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.007
These are a better match
to the observations.

00:18:18.007 --> 00:18:20.340
This is what these would look
like if you could see them

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.330
close up.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.760
This is what Hubble
would see, and these

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.810
are the infrared images.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:32.610
So Hubble has seen three
different phenomena.

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:34.380
We have interpreted
the Hubble images

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.790
to see these three
different phenomena.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:41.490
So one is that galaxies
start down here.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.920
Star formation rate is
increasing downward,

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.750
and the compactness
of the galaxy

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.100
is increasing to the right.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.210
So they start not very compact.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.820
Some of them become very
compact, very, very dense, very

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.930
rapidly-moving stars and gas.

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.250
And then they also
have-- a large fraction

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.680
of these galaxies have
active galactic nuclei

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.300
quasars, supermassive black
holes accreting like crazy.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.730
And after only a few
hundred million years,

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.300
which is a short time for
galaxies, they quench.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.820
That is, they stop
forming stars.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.580
So the star formation
rate goes way down--

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.070
which is up in this diagram--

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.500
And then they grow a
little bit in size.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.230
A lot of other galaxies are
what we call the "slow track."

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.470
We called this the fast track
in this paper published in 2013.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.710
There have been a number
of follow-up papers.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:36.960
And those are
galaxies that never

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.530
entered this compact
rapidly-star-forming part

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:41.610
of the diagram.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:46.160
They just slowly grow
in size, but fade out.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.480
In our simulations we
have some slow track,

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.530
we have some fast track.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:53.460
These are organized the
same way as the picture.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.370
We can follow in the
individual simulations--

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:59.310
this is the inner part of
the galaxy, the very center

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.530
part of the galaxy,
and we notice

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.450
that the center
part of the galaxy

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.940
is mostly dark matter
until what we call

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.230
a "compaction event" occurs.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.330
A lot of gas flows
into the center--

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.520
there's the gas flowing
into the center--

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.260
and it becomes stars.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.430
And so the rapid conversion of
gas into stars depletes the gas

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:19.620
and then also it
drives some gas out,

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.980
all these energetic processes
in the center including

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.170
the supermassive black hole.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.309
And unfortunately
we couldn't include

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:29.350
the supermassive black
holes in these simulations

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:33.690
so we haven't figured out enough
about how they really work.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:37.680
So gas flows in and
then it flows out.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.430
And in the inner
region of the galaxy

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.810
this is what's happening.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.700
In the whole galaxy--

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.400
that's pretty much
the whole galaxy.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:52.390
That's out to
30,000 light years,

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.040
so bigger than the
size of the Milky Way.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.360
Further out than we are, anyway.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.330
So you see that the dark
matter still dominates.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:07.809
The stars grow, although they're
not growing in the center.

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:09.600
The stellar mass is
constant in the center.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.540
But in the larger galaxy,
the stars continue to grow.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.560
So how does this work
when we actually look

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.810
at our individual simulations?

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:22.470
So this is going to show you how
a simulation evolves, and we're

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.860
going to track the dark
matter, the stars in red

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.900
and the gas in blue.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.180
And this is in the
inner five kiloparsecs,

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.790
so that's about this big.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.590
And this is the
inner kiloparsec.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.320
That's about just that
very central region.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:43.160
So this is stars
and gas, face-on.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.670
Gas and stars, edge-on.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:48.130
Here it goes.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:52.690
So you see that
there's a compaction

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.380
event about to occur.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:58.130
A bunch of gas just
flowed into the center,

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:03.030
and the center is now
becoming much rounder.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.747
It was elongated before.

00:22:05.747 --> 00:22:07.330
And now you're seeing
this nice spiral

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:10.810
structure and a nice disk.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:14.550
Now, the observer's,
when they looked at--

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:18.330
this CANDELS program-- when
we looked at the distribution

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:20.730
of the access ratio--

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:23.970
so on the sky you can
see an image that's

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.130
got a long axis and
a short axis and you

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.780
can take the ratio, short
axis over long axis.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.250
And if you plot the
histogram it looks like this.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:37.110
This is for galaxies between
redshift 1 and 1/2 and 2,

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:41.070
so that's going back--
redshift 2 is about 10 or 11

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.700
billion years ago.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.740
Redshift 1 and 1/2 is a couple
of billion years closer.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.700
So this is very much the period
when galaxies are forming.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:55.980
And what you see is
that the distribution

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.080
for these lower-mass
galaxies and also

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.590
intermediate-mass
galaxies is an inverted

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.000
V. It peaks at around 0.3.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.360
So axis ratio 0.3.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.750
So basically long axis,
more than three times

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:11.830
longer than the short axis.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:16.380
And there are very
few up here near 1.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.102
Now, a spheroid is going to
look like an axis ratio of 1

00:23:20.102 --> 00:23:21.310
no matter how you look at it.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.590
You're going to catch
galaxies in every orientation.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:28.350
A disk is going to look like
axis ratio close to 1 face-on.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:30.570
It'll be a 0.2 or
something, whatever

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:32.640
the thickness of the
disk is, edge-on,

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.520
and everything in between
more or less equally-likely.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.100
We're just not catching
very many near 1.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.110
So that means that
a majority have

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:43.360
to be these elongated objects.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.740
And very few are
spheroidal and not

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.260
a very large fraction are disky.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.570
They're mostly these
elongated objects.

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:54.400
So we used to think that
galaxies are a mixture of disks

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.560
and spheroids, like
nearby galaxies,

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.010
sometimes with a
spheroid in the middle.

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:02.290
But actually when they start
galaxies look like pickles.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.640
And our simulations are showing
exactly that same phenomenon.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.050
There's the dark matter.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:13.049
There's the stars aligned
with the dark matter.

00:24:13.049 --> 00:24:15.090
This is from the paper
that we published on this.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:18.150
So the paper that
really established

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.730
that this is what the
images looked like

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:25.350
was led by a CANDELS
astronomer, published in 2014.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:28.620
And our theory paper explaining
it, the first of our papers,

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.350
came out in 2015.

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:34.000
So there's the stars and
dark matter highly-aligned.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.610
This is looking down the long
axis, so now they look round.

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:42.570
And again, the dark matter
and stars are very aligned,

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.660
and they're elongated.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.000
On the left-hand
side of this diagram

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.310
the stellar mass is less
than the dark matter mass

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.050
in the center of the galaxy.

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:54.660
On the right-hand
side the stellar mass

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.030
is the dominant part,
the more star-dominated.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.740
More dark-matter-dominated
on this side.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.590
And when it's star-dominated
you see that the galaxies

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:02.790
are becoming round.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:05.100
These are round,
these are elongated.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:10.290
So that's just like
what the images showed.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:13.500
And we published a much
more-detailed paper led

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:19.620
by a post-doc, [? Michaeli ?]
[? Tomasetti. ?]

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.810
And what we found was
that, essentially,

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:25.270
all galaxies go through
this elongated phase.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:29.530
So the ones we saw out to
redshift 2 and 1/2 or 3

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:34.919
with Hubble were just galaxies
that ended up a little smaller

00:25:34.919 --> 00:25:35.710
than the Milky Way.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:37.751
The Milky Way would have
gone through that stage,

00:25:37.751 --> 00:25:40.771
we think, at redshifts
between 3 and 4.

00:25:40.771 --> 00:25:42.520
And that's what James
Webb Space Telescope

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.478
is going to let us see.

00:25:43.478 --> 00:25:46.150
So we're predicting that the
vast majority of galaxies

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:49.030
that James Webb lets us see
out at the higher redshift

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:51.520
are going to be these
elongated things.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.410
We don't know if that's true.

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.810
We'll find out in
about a couple years.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:00.460
So I'm now near
the end of the talk

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.130
and I'm going to talk a
little bit about the way we're

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:05.740
using deep learning.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:09.940
So Sander Dielman, who was
then a graduate student

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.880
at the University
of Guelph in Belgium

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.910
and is now at Google
DeepMind in London--

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.390
he used a deep learning
code to predict

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:23.620
how GalaxyZoo, a
citizen science project,

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.810
classified nearby galaxy images.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:31.050
And he was able to predict
the GalaxyZoo classification

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:33.730
with 99 percent accuracy.

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:37.390
And he won a Kaggle competition
in the machine learning

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:40.750
community in 2014.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:44.200
Marc Muertas-Company
used Dielman's code

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.070
to classify CANDELS galaxies.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.370
So these are our galaxies
out in the period

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.160
when galaxies are forming.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.590
About 8,000 of them
had been classified

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:57.160
by a team of about
65 astronomers,

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.700
and that was used as a
training set in order

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.935
to get enough to be
a useful training set

00:27:03.935 --> 00:27:11.850
and not over-fit the data.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:19.230
He had to rotate them and also
change the colors a little bit

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.420
to get about 60,000.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:26.410
And so Marc Muertas-Company
also had to do something similar

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:30.100
with the CANDELS galaxies.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.800
And he's published
a big catalog.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.130
So only one of the fields--

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.200
CANDELS's five different
fields, only one

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.950
of the different regions of
the sky that CANDELS used had

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:45.020
the galaxies classified.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:48.680
And so once the machine was
able to classify the galaxies as

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:53.600
well as any astronomer,
Marc was able to classify

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.720
all of the galaxies,
and then he was

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.760
able to study how
the galaxies have

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:02.090
changed in their appearance
since redshift 3.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:05.150
So that paper was
published last year.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:09.740
With support from Google, Marc
Muertas-Company has visited

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.100
UCSC last summer,
briefly last spring,

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.040
and will again be
back this summer,

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.170
and his grad student
Fernando Caro--

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.080
Fernando, would you
raise your hand?

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.360
So he's been visiting
us since March

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:28.220
and will be through
mid-august this summer.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.650
And we're working
together to try

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:35.010
to understand galaxy formation
better using deep learning.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:40.080
And the people whose names are
in blue here are here today.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.660
And then we have two other
deep learning projects

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.890
that I'll tell you about.

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:46.630
Trying to understand better
the galaxy environment out

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.860
at fairly large redshifts,
so the more distant galaxies,

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.890
where we mostly only have very
rough estimates of how far

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.380
away the galaxies are.

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.960
And also looking
for the big clouds

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.740
of neutral hydrogen in Sloan
Digital Sky Survey spectra.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:09.150
So this is just a short summary
of what Sander Dielman did.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:16.770
It's based on his sort
of blog entry here.

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:19.140
"My solution for the
GalaxyZoo challenge."

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:23.490
So this was a flowchart
of how GalaxyZoo works.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.520
People are given an
image and they're

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:33.780
asked to classify it into
disky or more roundy.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.740
And then, if they answer this
then they go down this part.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.010
If they answer this way
they go down this part.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.020
If you count all the
different boxes here

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.610
there's a total of 37.

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:48.070
So they get 37 possible choices,
although it's a decision tree

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.010
so they only go down one side.

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:53.210
And the game in the
Kaggle competition

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:57.370
was to predict all 37 as
accurately as possible.

00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:58.230
So they were given--

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.140
I forget-- 100,000
images or something.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.520
And they could use some
of them as a training set

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.160
and then some of them
as a confirmation set.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:13.710
And what Sander Dielman did was
to construct a deep learning

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:15.510
network.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:20.862
He actually constructed
16 different ones,

00:30:20.862 --> 00:30:22.320
training them
slightly differently,

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.010
and then he polled them
to get the best estimate.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:30.660
And he ended up actually
getting 99% right.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.180
So it was really quite amazing.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:38.010
And, although he's a
machine learning guy,

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.590
he published a nice
paper along with Willett,

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:44.012
who's the leader of
this GalaxyZoo project,

00:30:44.012 --> 00:30:46.470
in "Monthly Notices of the
Royal Astronomical Society," one

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.650
of the two leading
astronomy journals.

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:55.650
So it was basically the same
sort of deep learning code

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:59.250
that Marc Muertas-Company used
to classify the CANDELS galaxy

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.850
images.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.030
So, "we mimic human
perception with deep learning

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.760
using convolutional
neural networks trained

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.920
to reproduce the CANDELS
visual morphological

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.920
classification based
on the 65 classifiers,

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.400
and it is then released to
the astronomical community."

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.190
So this is the sort
of standard game.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.470
Once we figured out how
to do all these things,

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:23.440
then it becomes the
property of all astronomers,

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.760
very quickly released.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:28.320
CANDELS, as a matter of
policy and also NASA rules,

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.960
releases everything
very, very quickly.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.910
So all astronomers
are able to use it.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.810
So this is a little bit of
detail on how this worked.

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:42.200
And then Marc published this
second paper, "Mass assembly

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.300
of morphological transformations
since redshift 3 from CANDELS."

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.890
We quantified the evolution of
star forming quiescent galaxies

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:50.890
as a function of morphology.

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:54.850
Our main results are at redshift
2, 10 billion years ago.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:57.230
80% of the stellar mass density
of star forming galaxies

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:01.930
is in irregular systems,
not disks and not spheroid.

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:03.730
These elongated
things are things

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:05.060
that are hard to classify.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.500
However, by redshift
about 0.5, that's

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.740
about 4 billion years
ago, irregular objects

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.740
only dominated solar
masses below 10

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.830
to the ninth solar masses.

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:16.455
Much smaller than
the mass of the Milky

00:32:16.455 --> 00:32:21.430
Way, which is about 6 or
7 times 10 to the tenth.

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.930
Quenching.

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:23.680
We confirm the galaxy
is reaching a seller

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.570
mass of about 10 to
the 10.8, so a little

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.540
over the mass of the
Milky Way, tend to quench.

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.820
Also, quenching implies
the presence of a bulge.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.580
The abundance of massive red
disks-- in other words galaxies

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.679
without a bulge,
red means quenched--

00:32:37.679 --> 00:32:38.970
is negligible at all redshifts.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:40.770
So this is the kind
of thing you can

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:44.610
say when you have access to
these classifications of all

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.300
of these galaxies.

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:50.340
So that's how the machine
learning made it possible

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:53.720
for us to summarize
evolution of galaxies

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.370
in this sort of grand way.

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:59.550
Now, what we're
trying to do is--

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:02.800
what we want to do
is, ultimately--

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.110
I mean, this is our big goal.

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:06.910
We have these
high-resolution simulations

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:09.490
where we know exactly what's
happening to the galaxies.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:14.620
We know if a merger event
or maybe a flyby event--

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.050
another galaxy comes past
the galaxy, interacts

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:19.270
with it gravitationally
but doesn't merge with it--

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:22.000
or some other event that
leads to a big inflow of gas

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.140
in the galaxy.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.726
We know those things are
happening in the simulations,

00:33:25.726 --> 00:33:27.850
so what we're going to do
is tell the deep learning

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:30.670
code what's happening in
the simulations and show it

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:34.000
images, realistic images that
we make from the simulations.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.430
And we're making images at
20 different orientations,

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:39.070
most of them random,
at many, many times

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:40.885
steps as these galaxies evolve.

00:33:40.885 --> 00:33:42.760
So the idea is, we'll
gives the deep learning

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.310
code all that
information and then

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:48.550
see if it can be
trained to recover

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:51.945
that sort of information
from realistic images.

00:33:51.945 --> 00:33:53.320
And, of course,
if it works we'll

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.180
apply it to the real images.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.937
And we've already
made 100,000 images

00:33:56.937 --> 00:33:59.020
that we think are typical
of what James Webb Space

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:03.820
Telescope is going to be showing
us, according to our theory.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:05.680
So as soon as that
data comes in we'll

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.960
be all set to analyze
it if this all works.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:13.909
So this was a test
to see if we were

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:15.710
able to get something right.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:23.449
So Marc Muertas-Company trained
three deep learning codes

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:28.055
to recognize a bulge in a
galaxy, a bulge in a disk

00:34:28.055 --> 00:34:30.110
to see if we can get
a better fit that way,

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:32.810
and just a pure disk
without a bulge.

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:38.489
And so we looked, as
the Galaxy evolved--

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:40.380
so each of these is
showing the evolution

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:47.320
of a galaxy across time
from higher redshift

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:54.370
to lower redshift, and so this
is showing where a bulge is--

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:58.720
the code says, yeah, that
galaxy's probably got a bulge.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.540
And that corresponded
to a compaction event

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:06.220
where the gas flowed in, a lot
of stars formed in the center.

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:11.100
So that's redshift
about 3.7 or something.

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:14.250
And that's consistent with this.

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:18.240
And here bulge with
disk came down--

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:21.710
so more bulge, less disk--

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:23.650
and at that same
redshift, pure disk.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:26.030
Hardly at all.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:32.050
And then near redshift 1,
about 7 billion years ago,

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:34.930
there's this big jump
in [INAUDIBLE] stars.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:37.295
That means that another galaxy
merged with this galaxy.

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:43.940
And so that merger
event corresponds

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:47.360
to this big increase in the
bulge plus disk fraction.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:53.010
And anyway, by looking at
this we're concluding--

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:56.430
this was also done
for 35 simulations.

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.070
And we concluded that
the deep learning

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.260
code is sort of working.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.430
It's not nearly as good
as we hope to end up with,

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:05.740
but this is a step
along the way.

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.520
Another example.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.920
So we start with the
zoom-in simulations.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.050
We looked to see if
there's a merger,

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:15.240
and we looked in a
very trivial way, just

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.600
to see if there's a big jump
in the dark matter content.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.120
And so we used that.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:25.380
We use the images together
with merger or no merger

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.240
to train the deep learning code.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.420
So this was an example
of one simulation.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:34.740
Merger here, no merger here,
merger here, no merger there.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:38.610
And this is what the code did,
looking at 20 images at each

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:40.230
of many different time steps.

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.734
So it got this merger.

00:36:41.734 --> 00:36:43.150
It thought there
was some chance--

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:44.147
this is 50%.

00:36:44.147 --> 00:36:46.230
It thought there was some
chance of a merger here,

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:47.510
when there wasn't.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:53.370
It picked up this merger, and it
correctly says no merger here.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:56.820
And this is applied
to the simulations.

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:01.380
And this is 100% merger,
this is the number,

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:04.110
and this is basically
saying that it's

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:08.490
crossing over at
about 50% probability

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:10.050
of getting the mergers right.

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:16.090
So it's not great, but it's sort
of beginning to pick things up.

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:18.810
Now, this is a completely
different project

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:20.710
that we're working on.

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:22.640
So this is from a paper that--

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.240
it's a pre-print
that I'm a co-author

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:29.640
of along with Nicholas
Tejos, who is now

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:33.590
a professor in Chile, and
Aldo Rodriguez-Puebla,

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:36.750
my former post-doc who's now
a professor back in Mexico

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:40.320
City at UNAM, the
national University.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:46.320
And what we did is we took
a bunch of real redshifts

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:52.770
from our big simulation, we
divided them into about 20%

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:56.670
that we basically used
exactly the same redshift.

00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:02.400
So this is RA, the angle
on the sky across--

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:07.110
it's like longitude, and
it's a thin latitude slice,

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:09.000
a thin declination slice.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.120
And so here you see there's
a void, a cosmic void,

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.100
a cosmic wall or a filament.

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:21.350
And with only 20% you don't
see them quite so clearly,

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:24.020
but all the numbers
are exactly the same.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.550
For the photo-z's,
what we did is

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:28.580
we greatly degraded
the resolution.

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.980
If all you have is how
bright the galaxy is

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.480
at a bunch of
different wavelengths,

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.760
you can estimate
what its redshift is,

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.690
but it's pretty inaccurate.

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:39.580
So this is the
photometric redshift

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.170
versus the true redshift,
and you see this big spread.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.250
Equality would be this line.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:49.990
And this is what came out after
we applied an algorithm that we

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:51.880
call "sort."

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:57.780
And so what we did is we
used the nearby spectroscopic

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.400
redshifts to guess what the
correct photometric redshifts

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.380
were, and you can see
we did a lot better.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.760
This is true.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.660
This is how well we did,
taking these and improving

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:14.430
them using the small fraction
of spectroscopic redshifts.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:18.580
This is basically the
count of pairs of galaxies.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:22.260
And we basically are getting
it right at 4 megaparsecs

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:27.000
with this and with
the photo-z's,

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.770
the imprecise redshifts.

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:31.380
We don't even get it
right at 40 megaparsecs.

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:35.730
So this is one particular
scheme that we cooked up.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.920
And we show that it
works pretty well,

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.010
but it's certainly not optimal.

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:43.080
And what we're hoping is
that, with deep learning

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.910
we can come up with schemes
that will be much more optimal.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:49.200
Now, we're building a fantastic
telescope in the southern

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.030
hemisphere-- it's
going to be in Chile--

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.360
called the Large Synoptic
Survey Telescope, LSST.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:57.600
LSST is going to take a
movie of the southern sky.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.530
Every two nights it will
cover the entire southern sky.

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.990
We discover about 3,000
supernovas per year

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:06.110
with all the telescopes
in the world.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:09.190
LSST will discover 10,000
supernovae per night.

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.390
It's 15 terabytes of
data per night, which

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:17.130
has to be analyzed on the fly.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:18.890
It's sent up to
three supercomputer

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:21.170
centers in the United States.

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:22.599
If one of them is
down another one

00:40:22.599 --> 00:40:24.140
has to be able to
step in because you

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:29.270
can't allow this kind of
data to become too old.

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:32.240
So that's going to be
several billion galaxies

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.810
for which we're going to have
good photometric redshifts.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:36.620
The fraction of galaxies--

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.510
we're going to
have a few million

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.250
spectroscopic redshifts.

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:43.040
So being able to use
photometric redshift

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.730
data in a more efficient
way is going to be critical.

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:49.430
And that's why this is a
very important project.

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:52.160
And then the last
project is finding

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:56.270
damped Lyman alpha systems,
DLAs, in the Sloan Digital Sky

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:57.710
Survey data.

00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:01.280
And these are the big
lumps of neutral hydrogen

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.740
in the universe, the
amount of hydrogen

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:05.900
in the disk of a
star-forming galaxy.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.530
About 2 times 10 to the 20
atoms of neutral hydrogen

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:12.200
per square centimeter
along the line of sight.

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.690
And you see these not
because they emit--

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:16.640
they don't emit very
strongly at all--

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:20.180
but because they absorb light,
especially the N equals 1 to N

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.670
equals 2 transition, the
Lyman alpha transition

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:24.350
in neutral hydrogen.

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:27.740
So a quasar gives
us lots of light,

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:30.010
and so we look in the
spectra of quasars.

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:34.540
And about 100,000 quasar
spectra were analyzed by hand,

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.160
by many astronomers.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:40.480
And then the most
recent project,

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.250
run out of Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory,

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:47.740
called BOS, provided another
270,000 of these spectra.

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:51.400
And so Shawfeng Dong, who's
here in the audience--

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.200
raise your hand Shaw--

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:59.620
and David Park in Santa Cruz,
and Professor X. Prochaska,

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:05.930
and Zheng Cai, have
created a deep learning

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:12.290
code that analyzes the
spectra and finds these gaps,

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:14.690
these places where the
light from the quasar

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:16.940
has been strongly absorbed.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:19.740
And those are these damp
Lyman alpha systems.

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:26.210
And so this is basically linear
data-- it's not an image--

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:30.040
and they analyze it
in a sliding window.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.590
And they've caught a number of
these double damp Lyman alpha

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:33.550
systems.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:36.127
So this is going
to greatly expand

00:42:36.127 --> 00:42:37.210
the data that's available.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:38.530
And they're just
finishing their paper,

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:40.279
and they're going to
make all of this data

00:42:40.279 --> 00:42:43.510
publicly available to the
world-wide astronomy community.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.120
So this is a huge
expansion in the amount

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.780
of data that's available.

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:51.310
And so that's the third
use of deep learning.

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:54.190
So those are the topics
I wanted to talk about,

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:57.510
and I think I've allowed
plenty of time for questions.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:58.010
ERIC: OK.

00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:59.884
Let's thank Joel for a
very interesting talk.

00:42:59.884 --> 00:43:01.235
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:01.235 --> 00:43:03.490
JOEL PRIMACK: Of course I'm
glad to answer questions

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:04.350
about any of this.

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:06.540
ERIC: I've got a mic here
I can bring around in case

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:08.450
anyone wants to ask a question.

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:11.800
AUDIENCE: So, I know this isn't
the focus of your research,

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:16.720
but in these elongated
galaxies, what's

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.320
the motion of the stars
like in those galaxies?

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.320
JOEL PRIMACK: It's largely
along the long axis.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:26.290
There's hardly any
rotation at all.

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:29.400
The dark matter in
these long filaments--

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.600
remember I showed you the
picture of the filaments--

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.140
the dark matter is supported
largely by anisotropic velocity

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:35.740
dispersion.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.350
In other words, there's a
lot more random velocity

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:44.300
in this direction than in the
two perpendicular directions.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:48.440
So the stars are
doing the same thing.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.550
They're moving randomly
in the long axis.

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:55.690
And also suppose that a
merger of two galaxies

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:59.470
occurs-- this fairly frequently
happens-- along the filament.

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:02.267
The stars are what we
call non-collisional.

00:44:02.267 --> 00:44:04.600
Stars are so small compared
to the distance between them

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.880
that they essentially never hit.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.520
So they don't
actually scatter off

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.260
each other very
much, unlike the gas

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:14.360
molecules in this room which,
of course, have a pressure.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.620
So that's why the stars also,
like the dark matter particles,

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:21.130
can support this anisotropic
velocity dispersion.

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:24.730
So that was actually a very
thoughtful question, because--

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:28.690
so, we predict that these
things are not rotating.

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:31.990
And with spectra we're
going to be able to tell.

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:36.370
Hubble Space Telescope has only
limited spectral capability,

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:37.930
but James Webb
Space Telescope is

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:39.890
going to have superb
special capability.

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:42.130
It's going to be able
to get multiple spectra

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:45.600
in the same direction
at the same time.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.790
So we're making
detailed predictions.

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:51.700
Meanwhile, our same code
makes detailed predictions

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.550
for what the spectra will
look like on the ground.

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:56.860
Of course, on the
ground the seeing

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.200
is much worse because
of the atmosphere.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:04.610
But with adaptive optics using
laser guide stars, for example,

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:06.200
you can improve the seeing.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.920
And so there's a limited amount
of high-resolution spectral

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.840
data from the ground.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:16.480
But because of the atmosphere
being so noisy in the infrared

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.090
and not transmitting
all of the infrared,

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:22.020
James Webb is going to
be a complete revelation.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.210
So we can't wait
to see what we're

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:26.520
going to learn from James Webb.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.040
The first proposals for
use of James Webb time

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:32.920
are already being requested.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.520
So the time is going to
be allocated very soon.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:38.010
So from the point of view
of the astronomy community,

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:40.350
James Webb is almost here.

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:45.210
AUDIENCE: You talk
about stars and gas

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:47.410
and that a very small
percentage of the universe

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:52.000
is stars and gas and
atoms and whatnot.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.450
What exactly is dark
matter and dark energy?

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:56.949
Is it subatomic particles or--

00:45:56.949 --> 00:45:58.740
I'm just not that
familiar with the theory.

00:45:58.740 --> 00:45:59.705
JOEL PRIMACK: We don't know.

00:45:59.705 --> 00:46:00.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:00.490
AUDIENCE: Ah.

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:00.750
OK.

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:02.874
JOEL PRIMACK: So I was the
one who first proposed--

00:46:02.874 --> 00:46:04.890
along with the
late Heinz Pagels--

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:08.810
that the favorite theory of
theorists in particle physics

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:11.729
to go beyond our
current understanding

00:46:11.729 --> 00:46:13.770
would also be the explanation
of the dark matter.

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:17.160
So the standard picture
of particle physics

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.990
is called the "standard model."

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:22.230
And back when I was a graduate
student and my first post-doc--

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:23.882
my post-doc at Harvard--

00:46:23.882 --> 00:46:25.590
I actually wrote some
of the basic papers

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:28.650
on what we call the "standard
model of particle physics."

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.179
It's the theory of the
electroweak interaction.

00:46:31.179 --> 00:46:32.970
Now we know the weak
interaction is closely

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:34.950
associated with
electromagnetism,

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:36.720
and also the strong
interaction, which

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:42.990
is a similar kind of theory,
non abelian gague theory.

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:44.580
And the trouble
with that theory is,

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.740
although it beautifully
describes all the results

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.480
at particle
accelerators, there's

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.210
no room in it for dark matter.

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:54.600
And, moreover, we have no idea
where the theory came from.

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.781
I mean, we can write it
down, but why does it

00:46:56.781 --> 00:46:58.530
have the particular
structure that it has?

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.270
We don't understand.

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:02.820
So we're looking
for a bigger theory

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:06.390
that this theory will just be
a part of, the standard model.

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:10.350
And the best candidate
is supersymmetry.

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:12.910
And supersymmetry is the
basis for string theory.

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:14.320
It's actually
superstring theory.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.010
So if you heard of that,
that involves supersymmetry.

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:19.770
So in supersymmetry
all of the particles,

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:23.340
all the fundamental particles--
the quarks, the leptons,

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.835
the force particles, the
photon and its partners,

00:47:26.835 --> 00:47:30.150
the W and Z bosons,
and the gluons--

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:33.900
all of those particles
have partner particles

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.150
whose properties,
except for their masses,

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:37.770
are totally predicted
by the theory.

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:40.680
Their interactions
are totally predicted.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.980
The masses arise from what
we call "symmetry breaking,"

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:45.730
and we don't know
how that works.

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:48.330
So the masses
can't be predicted.

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:50.490
But we know that the
masses must be much higher

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:52.406
than the masses of all
the ordinary particles,

00:47:52.406 --> 00:47:54.810
because we haven't made
them yet at accelerators.

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:55.950
So that's supersymmetry.

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:58.460
Now, in most versions
of supersymmetry

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:00.990
the supersymmetric particles
have a different quantum

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:04.560
number, called "R-parity,"
"negative R-parity."

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:07.230
All the ordinary particles,
positive R-parity.

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:08.980
And parity is conserved.

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:13.050
So the lightest R-parity
odd particle must be stable,

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:15.810
and so it should
be the dark matter.

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:18.720
That was what we
pointed out 1982.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.420
And that led to the
cold dark matter theory.

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:24.270
So that's a plausible story.

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:26.205
It hasn't yet been
ruled out, but we also

00:48:26.205 --> 00:48:27.330
haven't found the particle.

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:29.570
If it exists we should
start making these particles

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:32.280
at the Large Hadron
Collider in Geneva.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.810
And they've been turning
up the intensity,

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:37.560
and they may, in fact,
be able to increase

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.810
the energy a little bit.

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:43.350
We're on a big run and
much higher intensity.

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:46.609
Maybe we'll actually
start to see something.

00:48:46.609 --> 00:48:48.150
My colleagues at
Santa Cruz were part

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:51.270
of the team that built the inner
tracker for the Atlas detector

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:53.520
at the Large Hadron
Collider, but they

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.823
don't tell us anything.

00:48:54.823 --> 00:48:55.630
[CHUCKLES]

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:59.160
They're over in Geneva, and
they're working on the thing.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.290
But when they discovered
the Higgs boson

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:03.930
we learned about it just
like everybody else did.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:06.130
We didn't learn
about it from them.

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:07.900
So they may even
have some results,

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.500
but if so they haven't told us.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:12.940
We're also looking for these
particles deep underground.

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:16.140
If you go deep underground
to shield from cosmic rays--

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.930
the most sensitive
detector until recently

00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:21.120
was the LUX detector,
Large Underground Xenon,

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:26.190
in the Homestake gold
mine in South Dakota.

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:27.800
My wife and I--

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.550
we've written popular
books on this stuff.

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:31.383
Those images from the
beginning of my slides

00:49:31.383 --> 00:49:32.520
were from our books.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:36.210
And we were the speakers
at the South Dakota place.

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:38.760
In fact, we gave a National
Public Radio interview deep

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.860
in the mine.

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.330
That was a couple of years ago.

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:46.262
And they announced--
when they introduced us,

00:49:46.262 --> 00:49:47.970
the Department of
Energy people announced

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:52.830
that they had made a commitment
to drastically expand the LUX

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:54.010
detector.

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:59.670
So LUX was 300 kilograms
of liquid xenon gas,

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:03.840
and they're expanding it
to 8,600 kilograms, 8.6

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.320
metric tons.

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:09.000
Which will be an increase in the
sensitivity of a factor of 100.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.430
So if the dark
matter particle is

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:12.990
what we suggested--
which is often

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:14.700
called a WIMP,
weakly-interacting massive

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.870
particle-- they
should detect it.

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:18.690
If they don't they'll
rule out the theory.

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:20.490
Meanwhile, a 1,000
kilogram detector

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:25.090
is going into operation
in Italy this year.

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:28.226
So it'll be steps along the way.

00:50:28.226 --> 00:50:29.850
If these particles
are the dark matter,

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:32.899
they should annihilate
sometimes in gamma rays.

00:50:32.899 --> 00:50:34.440
There's a signal of
gamma rays coming

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.520
from the center
of the Milky Way,

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.382
but it's not clear
if that's due--

00:50:38.382 --> 00:50:39.840
it's distributed
just the way you'd

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:43.455
expect it to be if it's coming
from dark matter annihilation.

00:50:43.455 --> 00:50:45.720
The dark matter
particles annihilate.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:49.980
Two of them have R-parity
even, so they can annihilate

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:52.750
into ordinary matter.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:55.350
But there are other
possible explanations.

00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:58.680
So the assumption is
that the dark matter

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.690
is some kind of particle.

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:03.196
Sorry for all that introduction,
but partly because I'm

00:51:03.196 --> 00:51:04.320
responsible for part of it.

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.256
I sort of live this
stuff all the time.

00:51:07.256 --> 00:51:08.880
Of course, I'm hoping
that it turns out

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:09.838
to be what I predicted.

00:51:09.838 --> 00:51:11.700
But, you know, we don't know.

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.790
As far as the dark energy,
it's even more mysterious.

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:19.470
Einstein, in 1916, applied his
theory of general relativity--

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:21.750
which he'd finished
at the end of 1915--

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:22.824
to the universe.

00:51:22.824 --> 00:51:24.240
And he discovered
the universe has

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.590
to be expanding or contracting.

00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:27.840
It can't be static.

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:29.902
And he asked his
astronomy colleagues,

00:51:29.902 --> 00:51:31.860
so is the universe is
expanding or contracting?

00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:33.750
And they basically
said, we don't know.

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:36.416
They didn't even know there were
galaxies outside the Milky Way.

00:51:36.416 --> 00:51:37.560
That was controversial.

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:41.610
It wasn't until Hubble, in
1924, showed that the Andromeda

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:43.140
Galaxy is far
outside the Milky Way

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:45.730
that we knew that galaxies
are an external phenomenon.

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:48.030
And then in 1929
Hubble discovered

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:50.580
that the more distant the
galaxy the faster it's

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:53.520
moving away from us, so the
universe is actually expanding.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.800
In 1916 nobody
knew these things.

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.290
But Einstein was motivated
to try to come up with a way

00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:00.270
to make his theory static.

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:02.437
So he realized you could
change the equations

00:52:02.437 --> 00:52:04.020
by adding an extra
term that he called

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:07.110
the cosmological constant,
represented by lambda,

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:11.610
the Greek letter, and that
would be a repulsion of space

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:13.830
by space that he
thought could counteract

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:16.800
the attraction of mass and
could make a static universe.

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.460
It turns out it doesn't work.

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:22.280
But when we discovered that
the universe is actually

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:25.070
accelerating the expansion--

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:29.750
using type 1a supernovae, the
Nobel Prize a few years ago--

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:32.480
that basically resurrected
the cosmological constant,

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.550
or some other form
of dark energy.

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:36.980
We realized that we can add
this to Einstein's equations.

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:39.710
It's perfectly consistent.

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:43.830
Is it some fundamental
new aspect of nature?

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:46.211
Is it a consequence
of something else?

00:52:46.211 --> 00:52:47.960
There are ways that
you could construct it

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.760
so it's a consequences
of something else.

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.990
We don't know.

00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:54.500
So one of the biggest
projects in astronomy today

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:58.730
is the dark energy survey and
the dark energy spectroscopic

00:52:58.730 --> 00:52:59.300
instrument.

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:04.550
And these things are led partly
by people here in this area.

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:06.410
My former graduate
student, Risa Wechsler,

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:08.720
is the spokesperson for the
Dark Energy Spectroscopic

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.990
Instrument, DESI, at Stanford.

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:14.296
So this is big astronomy.

00:53:14.296 --> 00:53:15.920
And the Large Synoptic
Survey Telescope

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.340
that I mentioned that's going
to go into operation in Chile--

00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:22.280
the southern sky
every two nights--

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:26.090
that's largely funded by
the Department of Energy.

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:28.880
Mike Turner, an
astronomer at Chicago,

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:33.200
coined this term "dark energy,"
and it was a brilliant term

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.560
because the Department of
Energy has taken on funding.

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.514
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:38.514 --> 00:53:40.430
Unless left the Trump
administration kills it.

00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:43.359
Because they want to,
basically, drastically curtail

00:53:43.359 --> 00:53:44.900
science and the
Department of Energy.

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:46.010
So, I don't know.

00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:48.670
AUDIENCE: They should
rename it "fake energy."

00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:51.045
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:52.945 --> 00:53:55.320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.480
AUDIENCE: So what's the
evidence that black holes--

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.110
you're for or against
that black holes

00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:05.660
are, in fact, dark matter,
primordial or otherwise?

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.670
JOEL PRIMACK:
Primordial black holes

00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:11.930
could form in certain
versions of cosmic inflation

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:14.450
theory, sort of the early
stages of the Big Bang,

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:17.070
but it's very, very tricky.

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.370
The danger is, you
make too many and then

00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:21.230
it wrecks the whole universe.

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:22.346
They have to be--

00:54:22.346 --> 00:54:24.470
they can't be too small or
we'd see them exploding.

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:26.820
It turns out black
holes explode.

00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:30.920
And so they have to be in
a very certain mass range.

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:32.270
They can't be exploding.

00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:34.260
We would have seen that.

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:37.400
And if they're as
massive even as earths

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.310
we would have seen the
effects because they

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:43.470
would have amplified the
light from supernovae

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:46.070
and they would have given us a
tail of extra-bright supernovae

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:47.770
that we don't see.

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:52.160
So there's strong constraints
on the mass of any dark matter

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:57.010
candidate that's a
massive sort of object.

00:54:57.010 --> 00:54:59.420
MCHOs is one of the names
people call these things,

00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:01.484
Massive Compact Halo Objects.

00:55:01.484 --> 00:55:02.900
One of my former
graduate students

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:04.880
introduced that terminology.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.780
But that's been
largely ruled out.

00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:09.920
So it's very unlikely, I
think, that the dark matter

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.150
is black holes.

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:14.510
Also-- well, I
can go on on that.

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:18.050
So there's two kinds of black
holes we are quite sure exist,

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:22.740
the kind that form at the ends
of the life of massive stars,

00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:25.500
and the kind that we see
at the centers of all

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:29.070
the massive galaxies, which we
call supermassive black holes.

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:30.970
There's no question they exist.

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:33.600
And, of course, the best
proof that there really

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:38.040
are these massive black holes
that are in the stellar mass

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:42.180
range was this discovery a
couple of years ago by LIGO--

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:45.630
Laser Interferometry
Gravity-wave Observatory--

00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:48.870
of two merging
30-solar-mass black holes.

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:51.900
And the pattern of gravity
waves was exactly what

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:53.790
Einstein's theory predicted.

00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:56.580
And we had previously been
testing Einstein's theory

00:55:56.580 --> 00:56:00.210
at scales in the solar system.

00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:03.030
The velocity of the sun
is 30 kilometers a second.

00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:06.374
The speed of light is 300,000.

00:56:06.374 --> 00:56:07.790
When those two
black holes merged,

00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:09.165
they were going
around each other

00:56:09.165 --> 00:56:10.980
at essentially the
speed of light.

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:13.610
So we were testing general
relativity at the limit,

00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:15.650
and it was bang on.

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:18.680
Incidentally, two 30-mass
black holes merged

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:21.440
and we got a
58-solar-mass black hole.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:24.920
2 solar masses-- two times
the mass of the sun--

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:26.890
was gravity waves.

00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:30.500
And now they're
detecting a lot more.

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.950
There's going to be a public
talk by Gabriella Gonzalez,

00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:39.140
the spokesperson for LIGO, in
Santa Cruz this Thursday night,

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:40.850
June 1st.

00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:44.150
And she's a wonderful
speaker, incidentally.

00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:46.220
You guys should
invite her if you

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:49.090
want to have a wonderful talk.

00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:53.710
And they're now
souping up LIGO so they

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:58.870
can detect about a
third the intensity

00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:00.610
that they detected before.

00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:04.400
That will let them look
three times farther out--

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.740
and that's three times
in every direction.

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:11.547
So that's about 27
times the signal rate.

00:57:11.547 --> 00:57:13.130
We've been getting
about one detection

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:15.080
a month when they
have the thing on,

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:17.960
and that's going to
turn it into one a day.

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:21.090
So we're going to learn a
lot more about black holes.

00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:23.330
But I don't see
any evidence at all

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:25.520
that black holes
are the dark matter,

00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:28.550
and we're going to learn
much more about black holes

00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:31.880
both on the stellar
mass scale and then also

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:35.150
if we can put a
detectors in space--

00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:37.546
LISA was the name.

00:57:37.546 --> 00:57:39.170
The Europeans want
to go ahead with it.

00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:42.110
If the US will join we
could do it much faster.

00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:46.370
And so that'll let
us detect merging

00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:48.290
black holes of the
masses that we find

00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:50.520
in the centers of galaxies.

00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:53.030
And that will give us a
much better census on those.

00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:54.990
Anyway, the whole
black whole story

00:57:54.990 --> 00:58:00.530
is very much a hot research
topic, especially with LIGO.

00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:03.334
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
where the dark matter is,

00:58:03.334 --> 00:58:05.000
or how it's spread
across the Milky Way.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.930
Because you said there is a
massive halo of dark matter.

00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:10.610
How is it that we
don't see the effects

00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:12.290
of this dark matter
or dark energy

00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:13.910
on things like the solar system?

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:16.170
The [INAUDIBLE] that
we see probably,

00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:17.720
would they match
the mass of the sun?

00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.178
So does that mean
that either there

00:58:19.178 --> 00:58:21.620
is no dark matter
in the solar system

00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:24.710
or does it mean that part of
the sun's mass is dark matter

00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:27.170
or dark energy or
something else?

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:28.740
JOEL PRIMACK:
Wonderful questions.

00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.440
Those are all subjects
of many articles

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.200
in the scientific literature.

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:37.920
So the basic story is that
the dark matter is not

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:40.350
the dominant component
of mass in the inner part

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:41.684
of the solar system.

00:58:41.684 --> 00:58:43.350
If you remember those
pictures I showed,

00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:46.130
in the early stages
of galaxy formation

00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:49.660
the dark matter is dominant
all the way to the center.

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:52.240
Then gas flows in,
turns into stars,

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.880
and the dark matter is only
dominant on large scales.

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:56.860
So on the scale of
the solar system,

00:58:56.860 --> 00:59:00.550
ordinary matter is by far
the main source of mass.

00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:04.100
The solar system is enormously
more-concentrated mass

00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:06.700
than you find just
spread out-- if you

00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:10.210
look at the mass on large
scales, even in the Milky Way.

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:13.630
Little planetary systems like
ours are very, very dense

00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:14.720
compared to the average.

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:17.356
So the dark matter would
make very little difference

00:59:17.356 --> 00:59:18.730
on the scale of
the solar system.

00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:21.550
We've worked that out.

00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:25.480
So the amount of dark
matter is about a third

00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:29.090
of a hydrogen atom
per cubic centimeter.

00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:32.110
That's about the mass of
dark matter in the Milky Way

00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:34.690
at our distance from the
center of the Milky Way.

00:59:34.690 --> 00:59:37.990
So that's less than
a very high vacuum.

00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:42.230
The solar system has a
lot more stuff than that.

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:44.380
But as you go out to
the edges of galaxies

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:47.560
it becomes the
dominant form of mass.

00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:50.350
So very little effect
on the solar system,

00:59:50.350 --> 00:59:53.960
but it's possible that the
sun and the earth and Jupiter

00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.960
and so forth will have
accreted a certain amount

00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.460
of dark matter.

00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:00.190
If so, that dark matter
would end up in the center.

01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:03.790
It would occasionally
collide with atoms

01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:06.280
and lose energy and
end up in the center,

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.790
and the dark matter would
started annihilating,

01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:10.880
if it's the kind
that I predicted,

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.090
and there should
be neutrinos coming

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:14.609
from the center of the sun.

01:00:14.609 --> 01:00:16.900
And we've looked for them
and we haven't seen them yet,

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.910
but we haven't looked
with very high precision.

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:21.670
So this is one of the
ways that people are

01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:23.080
looking to detect dark matter.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.160
It's very lively.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.695
And so all of those
issues that you raised,

01:00:27.695 --> 01:00:30.070
the questions you raised, are
exactly the kinds of things

01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:32.620
that we've been thinking
about very hard for decades.

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:34.420
ERIC: Let's thank Joel again.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:37.770
