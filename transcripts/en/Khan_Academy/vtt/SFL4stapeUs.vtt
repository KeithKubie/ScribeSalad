00:00:00.494 --> 00:00:02.910
What I want to do in this video
is discuss a special class

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.096
of triangles called
30-60-90 triangles.

00:00:06.096 --> 00:00:07.970
And I think you know
why they're called this.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.580
The measures of its angles
are 30 degrees, 60 degrees,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.567
and 90 degrees.

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:14.400
And what we're going
to prove in this video,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.680
and this tends to be a very
useful result, at least

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.100
for a lot of what you see
in a geometry class and then

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.970
later on in trigonometry
class, is the ratios

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.530
between the sides of
a 30-60-90 triangle.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.970
Remember, the hypotenuse is
opposite the 90-degree side.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.470
If the hypotenuse
has length x, what

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.930
we're going to prove is that
the shortest side, which

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.920
is opposite the 30-degree
side, has length x/2,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.880
and that the 60 degree
side, or the side that's

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.060
opposite the 60-degree
angle, I should say,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.360
is going to be square root
of 3 times the shortest side.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.915
So square root of 3 times x/2,
that's going to be its length.

00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:56.040
So that's where we're going
to prove in this video.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.510
And then in other videos,
we're just going to apply this.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.218
We're going to show
that this is actually

00:00:59.218 --> 00:01:00.510
a pretty useful result.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.730
Now, let's start with a triangle
that we're very familiar with.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.410
So let me draw ourselves
an equilateral triangle.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.220
So drawing the triangles
is always the hard part.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.760
This is my best shot at
a equilateral triangle.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.600
So let's call this ABC.

00:01:21.104 --> 00:01:22.520
I'm just going to
assume that I've

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.080
constructed an
equilateral triangle.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.460
So triangle ABC is equilateral.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.070
And if it's equilateral,
that means all of its sides

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.530
are equal.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:41.010
And let's say equilateral
with sides of length x.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.100
So this is going to be
x, this is going to be x,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.560
and this is going to be x.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.580
We also know,
based on what we've

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.730
seen from equilateral
triangles before,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.630
that the measures of
all of these angles

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.980
are going to be 60 degrees.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.410
So this is going
to be 60 degrees,

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.820
this is going to be
60 degrees, and then

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.187
this is going to be 60 degrees.

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:01.770
Now, what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.230
to drop an altitude from this
top point right over here.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.230
So I'm going to drop
an altitude right down,

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.550
and by definition, when I'm
constructing an altitude,

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.751
it's going to intersect the base
right here at a right angle.

00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:14.250
So that's going to
be a right angle,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.245
and then this is going
to be a right angle.

00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:17.870
And it's a pretty
straightforward proof

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.610
to show that not only
is this an altitude,

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.361
not only is it
perpendicular to this base,

00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:23.985
but it's a pretty
straightforward proof

00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:25.430
to show that it
bisects the base.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.162
And you could pause it, if you
like and prove it yourself.

00:02:28.162 --> 00:02:29.620
But it really comes
out of the fact

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.786
that it's easy to prove
that these two triangles are

00:02:31.786 --> 00:02:32.510
congruent.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.620
So let me prove it for you.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.620
So let's call this
point D right over here.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.890
So triangles ABD and BDC, they
clearly both share this side.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.740
So this side is common to
both of them right over here.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.010
This angle right over here
is congruent to this angle

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.040
over there.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.680
This angle right over here
is congruent to this angle

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.700
over here.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.040
And so if these two are
congruent to each other,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.030
then the third angle has to
be congruent to each other.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.560
So this angle right
over here needs

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.170
to be congruent to that
angle right over there.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.680
So these two are congruent.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.140
And so you can use
actually a variety

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.040
of our congruence postulates.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.610
We could say,
side-angle-side congruence.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.640
We could use
angle-side-angle, any of those

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:32.550
to show that triangle ABD is
congruent to triangle CBD.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.290
And what that does for us,
and we could use, as I said,

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.960
we could use angle-side-angle
or side-angle-side,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.790
whatever we like
to use for this.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.430
What that does for
us is it tells us

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.150
that the corresponding
sides of these triangles

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.160
are going to be equal.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.832
In particular, AD is
going to be equal to CD.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.500
These are corresponding sides.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.750
So these are going to
be equal to each other.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.310
And if we know that they're
equal to each other,

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.851
and they add up to
x-- remember, this

00:04:04.851 --> 00:04:06.880
was an equilateral
triangle of length x--

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.477
we know that this side right
over here, is going to be x/2.

00:04:10.477 --> 00:04:11.810
We know this is going to be x/2.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.410
Not only do we know
that, but we also

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.579
knew when we dropped
this altitude,

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.630
we showed that this angle has
to be congruent to that angle,

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.550
and their measures
have to add up to 60.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.860
So if two things are the
same and they add up to 60,

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.010
this is going to be
30 degrees, and this

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.530
is going to be 30 degrees.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.140
So we've already shown one
of the interesting parts

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.750
of a 30-60-90 triangle, that if
the hypotenuse-- notice, and I

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.000
guess I didn't point this out.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.100
By dropping this
altitude, I've essentially

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.410
split this equilateral triangle
into two 30-60-90 triangles.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.260
And so we've already shown
that if the side opposite

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.780
the 90-degree side
is x, that the side

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.270
opposite the 30-degree
side is going to be x/2.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.090
That's what we showed
right over here.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.850
Now we just have to come up with
the third side, the side that

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.610
is opposite the 60-degree side.

00:05:06.664 --> 00:05:08.830
I'll just use the letters
that we already have here.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.280
This is BD.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.600
And we can just use the
Pythagorean theorem right here.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.530
BD squared plus this
length right over here

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.860
squared plus x/2
squared is going

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.040
to be equal to the
hypotenuse squared.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.669
So we get BD squared
plus x/2 squared--

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.960
this is just straight out of
the Pythagorean theorem.--

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.500
plus x/2 squared is going to
equal this hypotenuse squared.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.720
It's going to equal x squared.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.190
And just to be clear, I'm
looking at this triangle right

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.690
here.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.106
I'm looking at this triangle
right over here on the right,

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:41.190
and I'm just applying
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.950
This side squared
plus this side squared

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.110
is going to equal the
hypotenuse squared.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.140
And let's solve now for BD.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.312
You get BD squared
plus x squared over 4.

00:05:52.312 --> 00:05:57.360
x squared over 4 is
equal to x squared.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.242
You could view this
as 4x squared over 4.

00:05:59.242 --> 00:06:01.200
That's the same thing,
obviously, as x squared.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.460
If you subtract 1/4 x
squared from both sides,

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.520
or x squared over
4 from both sides,

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.950
you get BD squared is
equal to-- 4x squared

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.780
over 4 minus x squared over 4 is
going to be 3x squared over 4.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.300
So it's just going to
be 3x squared over 4.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.390
Take the principal
root of both sides.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:30.556
You get BD is equal to the
square root of 3 times x.

00:06:33.407 --> 00:06:34.990
The principal root
of 3 is square root

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.660
of 3. the principal root
of x squared is just x,

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.710
over the principal
root of 4 which is 2.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.580
And BD is the side opposite
the 60-degree side.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.430
So we're done.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.430
If this hypotenuse
is x, the side

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.450
opposite the 30-degree
side is going to be x/2,

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.370
and the side opposite
the 60-degree side

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.035
is going to be square
root of 3 over 2 times x,

00:06:55.035 --> 00:06:57.010
or the square root of
3x over 2, depending

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.420
on how you want to view it.
