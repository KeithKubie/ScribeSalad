JAMES JERLECKI: Hi, my name
is James Jerlecki.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.590
I'm the product manager
for TextPlus.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.070
I manage the iOS and Android
engineering teams and also

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.710
participated in the new design
of our Android application.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.340
TextPlus is a free texting and
calling application that

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.800
allows you to text for free
anywhere in the United States

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.570
and Canada.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.940
Because at the end of the day,
that's what TextPlus is.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.760
It's a way for you to send your
emotions to your friends

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.250
and family and the people
that you love.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.260
So one of the things I like best
about Google Play is the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.290
Reply to Review feature.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.860
As a product manager and someone
who runs the client

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.510
team, it's been a great avenue
for me to one, be able to talk

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.550
to our users.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.600
But also incorporate their
feedback into the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.550
application--

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.550
whether that is features or
whether that's bugs, anything

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.500
to give you more information
to do my job better.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.830
The Reply to Reviews feature has
essentially given me that

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.905
direct line that I didn't
have before.

00:00:57.905 --> 00:01:00.750
So something else that's
really critical to user

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.810
reviews is we make our
engineering teams actually

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.680
spend time looking through
and even replying to

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.020
the reviews at times.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.890
It really allows the team to
see what the user's saying

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.690
about the product they spend
all of their time building.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.720
And we really feel it gives
them extra initiative to

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.870
improve the product.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.790
So that's something we love
doing, and we'll do it once a

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.021
week or every other week.

00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:27.250
And it really just gives the
engineers insight into what

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.540
the users are saying.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.490
And also something the Reply
to Reviews has helped us

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.710
manage, since we've had access
to this feature, we've

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.760
increased daily installs
by roughly 40%.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.240
So it's really key to us to
maintain our overall rating.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.590
So this has allowed us to
monitor the reviews and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.190
respond to customer concerns
quickly and provide feedback,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.810
if they're having an issue
that we can immediately

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.150
resolve the user from.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.260
This is a perfect example
of user feedback being

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.680
incorporated into the roadmap.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.810
So something that we see in the
reviews almost daily is

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.710
personalization.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.680
Sometimes it's tough
being a designer.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.520
You want things to look a
specific way, and you're very

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.030
particular about, I want
this background

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.630
or I want this asset.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.190
But we've seen it over and over
again, the users have

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.220
said, I want customization.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.670
I want to make TextPlus look
how I want it to look.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.350
So something that is coming very
soon and very quickly is

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.100
the ability for users to
customize the look

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.230
and feel of the app.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.980
So essentially they will be able
to change the background,

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.310
change the chat level color,
change the accent color.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.020
So it's truly giving the users
something they want entirely

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.000
based on feedback that we
saw in the reviews.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.920
So in Google Play, TextPlus
continues to do very well.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.570
It's actually completely
shifting our business to more

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.690
Android first.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.880
And we've increased
our daily installs

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.800
roughly 40% since August.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.950
So we're continuing to move in
a very positive direction on

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.200
Google Play.
