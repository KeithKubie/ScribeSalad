00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.720
Will some ancient messages just never be read.

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.640
No matter how hard we try.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.413
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.880
<v 0>history's got something to hide from you.</v>

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.050
That's okay because the last time we armed you with a new skill decipherment

6
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.940
you're ready to go. Just point you in a direction. But what to deciphered?

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.910
Oh, I really wish I could remember the book,

8
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:28.911
but in a librarian Ithica there is or there was some book with a neat graph that

9
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:34.140
breaks down the problem for us. Bloop down a chart with two axes. Yep.

10
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.860
A chart.

11
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.210
We're getting into this now look at a script and ask yourself two simple

12
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:43.440
questions. Can I read the graphemes and do I know the language?

13
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.130
If you know how to read the writing system but not the language,

14
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.450
you can learn the language.

15
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:52.020
If you have enough samples and some way of reading into those samples.

16
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.660
A little translation here,

17
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.150
familiar name there just to crack open the doorway for you.

18
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.970
A good example is north Piscean.

19
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.710
These ancient northern Italians carved their language into the Novi Laura Stele

20
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.960
and we can read it. Sort of what I mean is we can sound out the graphemes,

21
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.520
but practically,

22
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:15.900
since there aren't many north pricing texts lying around for us to learn from,

23
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.230
we don't know what the says. Don't cry.

24
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.460
Think about known languages with known writing systems. They're easy.

25
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.270
If you can already read the graphemes and the language. It's simple.

26
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:29.970
Recognition task. Oh, that's Swahili.

27
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:34.140
Written in the Latin alphabet and there Swahili written in the Arabic object.

28
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.580
Wow. We really need to cover these writing terms. What about languages?

29
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:41.070
We don't know. Written in writing systems,

30
00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:46.071
we can't read who possibly impossible with enough of the right kinds of

31
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:47.341
examples.

32
00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:50.880
We can figure out a language from a script or a script from a language,

33
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.280
but if we're missing both this square bricks, last times model of decipherment,

34
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.870
we're left with one lone box, known language,

35
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.760
unknown writing system. This is our box in this box.

36
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:10.530
We find all of the decipherment of the past and those taunting mysteries still

37
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:11.700
waiting to be cracked.

38
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.120
This is the realm of brilliant hunches that made history and crank theories that

39
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:22.020
went nowhere. Stay tuned and subscribe for tales of decipherment.
