really hurt me and then you think well
I'll just do that to them it's like

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610
I'll just do that to them it's like
 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.730
I'll just do that to them it's like
that's that's that's a that's a good

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.060
that's that's that's a that's a good
theory it's very sophisticated so

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070
theory it's very sophisticated so
 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.220
theory it's very sophisticated so
anyways so okay so what happens Adam and

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230
anyways so okay so what happens Adam and
 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.900
anyways so okay so what happens Adam and
Eve wake up they weren't supposed to do

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
Eve wake up they weren't supposed to do
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.370
Eve wake up they weren't supposed to do
this God told them that they are gonna

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
this God told them that they are gonna
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.349
this God told them that they are gonna
be sorry if they did that but they did

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359
be sorry if they did that but they did
 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.790
be sorry if they did that but they did
it anyways because that's what people

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800
it anyways because that's what people
 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.240
it anyways because that's what people
are like and because we always learn

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250
are like and because we always learn
 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.580
are like and because we always learn
things that that knock us out of our

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590
things that that knock us out of our
 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.650
things that that knock us out of our
present paradises right we're curious

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
present paradises right we're curious
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.330
present paradises right we're curious
and we won't leave things alone and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340
and we won't leave things alone and
 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.090
and we won't leave things alone and
maybe things are not so bad and then you

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100
maybe things are not so bad and then you
 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.610
maybe things are not so bad and then you
you know ask some questions that maybe

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
you know ask some questions that maybe
 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.590
you know ask some questions that maybe
you're not so happy about asking once

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600
you're not so happy about asking once
 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.569
you're not so happy about asking once
you find the answer and you fall out of

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579
you find the answer and you fall out of
 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.340
you find the answer and you fall out of
your little paradise into history and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
your little paradise into history and
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.990
your little paradise into history and
you got to work to set things right

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000
you got to work to set things right
 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.440
you got to work to set things right
again and anyways God gets wind of this

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450
again and anyways God gets wind of this
 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.400
again and anyways God gets wind of this
and and he chases Adam and Eve out of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
and and he chases Adam and Eve out of
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.810
and and he chases Adam and Eve out of
the Garden of Eden but he says some

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
the Garden of Eden but he says some
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.310
the Garden of Eden but he says some
interesting things when he chases them

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320
interesting things when he chases them
 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.380
interesting things when he chases them
out he says all right now you know

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390
out he says all right now you know
 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.000
out he says all right now you know
what's the consequence of that and he

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010
what's the consequence of that and he
 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.850
what's the consequence of that and he
says to Adam you're gonna have to work

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860
says to Adam you're gonna have to work
 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.620
says to Adam you're gonna have to work
now that's cool that's really cool well

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
now that's cool that's really cool well
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.039
now that's cool that's really cool well
he is God after all you know also he he

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
he is God after all you know also he he
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.200
he is God after all you know also he he
knows what he's talking about

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210
knows what he's talking about
 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.330
knows what he's talking about
he says you're gonna have to work so why

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
he says you're gonna have to work so why
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.219
he says you're gonna have to work so why
would you have to work now that you knew

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
would you have to work now that you knew
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.530
would you have to work now that you knew
you were vulnerable well the answer that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
you were vulnerable well the answer that
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.060
you were vulnerable well the answer that
is well if you know you're vulnerable

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070
is well if you know you're vulnerable
 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.980
is well if you know you're vulnerable
that stretches out into the future you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990
that stretches out into the future you
 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.450
that stretches out into the future you
know you're going to die you know that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460
know you're going to die you know that
 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.210
know you're going to die you know that
you're fragile it's like maybe all your

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220
you're fragile it's like maybe all your
 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.679
you're fragile it's like maybe all your
problems are solved right now you're all

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689
problems are solved right now you're all
 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.060
problems are solved right now you're all
sitting here you're safe you're not

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070
sitting here you're safe you're not
 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.859
sitting here you're safe you're not
hungry you don't want anything to drink

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
hungry you don't want anything to drink
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.800
hungry you don't want anything to drink
it cetera but what about tomorrow what

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
it cetera but what about tomorrow what
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.719
it cetera but what about tomorrow what
about next week or next month or 10

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729
about next week or next month or 10
 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.039
about next week or next month or 10
years from now it's like just because

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049
years from now it's like just because
 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.660
years from now it's like just because
you got all your problems solved for

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
you got all your problems solved for
 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.980
you got all your problems solved for
this second doesn't mean you've got them

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
this second doesn't mean you've got them
 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.889
this second doesn't mean you've got them
solved for the rest of your iterations

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899
solved for the rest of your iterations
 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.010
solved for the rest of your iterations
through time so you got to work and the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
through time so you got to work and the
 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.870
through time so you got to work and the
work is the sacrifice of the present for

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
work is the sacrifice of the present for
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.270
work is the sacrifice of the present for
the future and so that's exactly right

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280
the future and so that's exactly right
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.789
the future and so that's exactly right
you have to work now you think see

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799
you have to work now you think see
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.289
you have to work now you think see
what's interesting about that this is

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299
what's interesting about that this is
 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.819
what's interesting about that this is
the theory that I was going in it of

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829
the theory that I was going in it of
 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.429
the theory that I was going in it of
course God tells that Eve well you've

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
course God tells that Eve well you've
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.950
course God tells that Eve well you've
really you know screwed things up too

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960
really you know screwed things up too
 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.170
really you know screwed things up too
you're gonna have these big brain babies

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180
you're gonna have these big brain babies
 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.479
you're gonna have these big brain babies
and and that's a big problem you're

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489
and and that's a big problem you're
 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.540
and and that's a big problem you're
gonna suffer in childbirth and then

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550
gonna suffer in childbirth and then
 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.589
gonna suffer in childbirth and then
they're going to be dependent on you

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599
they're going to be dependent on you
 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.800
they're going to be dependent on you
forever and because of

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810
forever and because of
 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.330
forever and because of
you're gonna be dependent on this man

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340
you're gonna be dependent on this man
 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.100
you're gonna be dependent on this man
that you just woke up and that's not

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110
that you just woke up and that's not
 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.570
that you just woke up and that's not
gonna be very pleasant for either of you

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580
gonna be very pleasant for either of you
 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.900
gonna be very pleasant for either of you
but tough luck and so that's it that's

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910
but tough luck and so that's it that's
 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.750
but tough luck and so that's it that's
the curse in some sense and it's exactly

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760
the curse in some sense and it's exactly
 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.460
the curse in some sense and it's exactly
right but the thing is there's a theory

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470
right but the thing is there's a theory
 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.559
right but the thing is there's a theory
in there there's an interesting theory

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569
in there there's an interesting theory
 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.660
in there there's an interesting theory
of suffering that's implicit in that

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670
of suffering that's implicit in that
 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.430
of suffering that's implicit in that
story and the theory of suffering is

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440
story and the theory of suffering is
 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.960
story and the theory of suffering is
that suffering is built into this

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970
that suffering is built into this
 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.750
that suffering is built into this
structure of self-conscious being it's

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760
structure of self-conscious being it's
 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.210
structure of self-conscious being it's
built right into the structure so if

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220
built right into the structure so if
 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.530
built right into the structure so if
you're a self-conscious being that's

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540
you're a self-conscious being that's
 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.790
you're a self-conscious being that's
your lot it isn't someone else's fault

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800
your lot it isn't someone else's fault
 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.250
your lot it isn't someone else's fault
it isn't a consequence of sociological

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260
it isn't a consequence of sociological
 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.430
it isn't a consequence of sociological
oppression

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440
oppression
 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.800
oppression
it isn't that a consequence of the fact

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810
it isn't that a consequence of the fact
 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.420
it isn't that a consequence of the fact
that our society isn't organized

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430
that our society isn't organized
 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.090
that our society isn't organized
properly it's just part of being alright

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100
properly it's just part of being alright
 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.949
properly it's just part of being alright
so that's a big deal because that's a

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959
so that's a big deal because that's a
 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.570
so that's a big deal because that's a
that's an important theory because one

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580
that's an important theory because one
 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.309
that's an important theory because one
of the questions is well well you know

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319
of the questions is well well you know
 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.630
of the questions is well well you know
why is there suffering what are you

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640
why is there suffering what are you
 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.820
why is there suffering what are you
gonna do about it and it's a big it's a

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830
gonna do about it and it's a big it's a
 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.309
gonna do about it and it's a big it's a
lot different if it's just the way it is

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319
lot different if it's just the way it is
 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.100
lot different if it's just the way it is
for you and if it's actually your fault

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110
for you and if it's actually your fault
 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.990
for you and if it's actually your fault
that he's suffering those are or maybe

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000
that he's suffering those are or maybe
 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.210
that he's suffering those are or maybe
it's the group's fault that you're

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220
it's the group's fault that you're
 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.509
it's the group's fault that you're
suffering those are major those theories

fault this terrible thing waited at the

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780
fault this terrible thing waited at the
 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.189
fault this terrible thing waited at the
door and you let it in and then you

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199
door and you let it in and then you
 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.260
door and you let it in and then you
entered into a creative union with it

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270
entered into a creative union with it
 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.000
entered into a creative union with it
and you produced something as a

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010
and you produced something as a
 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.460
and you produced something as a
consequence and that's this tormented

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470
consequence and that's this tormented
 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.740
consequence and that's this tormented
spirit that you have now and it's

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750
spirit that you have now and it's
 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.480
spirit that you have now and it's
polluting your relationship with reality

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490
polluting your relationship with reality
 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.879
polluting your relationship with reality
and that's why things aren't working so

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889
and that's why things aren't working so
 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.420
and that's why things aren't working so

just exactly what's wrong with the
structure of reality and Cain isn't very

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080
structure of reality and Cain isn't very
 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.690
structure of reality and Cain isn't very
happy about that because really is that

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.100
right like you have more misery than is
necessary because you really didn't put

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110
necessary because you really didn't put
 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.159
necessary because you really didn't put
your act together and you know it and

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169
your act together and you know it and
 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.250
your act together and you know it and
you've done it creatively and so Caden

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260
you've done it creatively and so Caden
 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.310

the first story in the judeo-christian

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360
the first story in the judeo-christian
 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.719
the first story in the judeo-christian
canon let's say about actual human

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729
canon let's say about actual human
 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.760
canon let's say about actual human
beings because Adam and Eve were made by

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770
beings because Adam and Eve were made by
 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.560

God so they don't really count Cain and

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570
God so they don't really count Cain and
 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.230
God so they don't really count Cain and
Abel were born and so that's something

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240
Abel were born and so that's something
 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.420
Abel were born and so that's something
so there's a reaction to suffering right

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430
so there's a reaction to suffering right
 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.250
so there's a reaction to suffering right
the necessity of sacrifice and the

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260
the necessity of sacrifice and the
 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.659
the necessity of sacrifice and the
consequence of the necessity of

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669
consequence of the necessity of
 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.089
consequence of the necessity of
sacrifice is that some sacrifices work

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099
sacrifice is that some sacrifices work
 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.310
sacrifice is that some sacrifices work
and others don't and then if your

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320
and others don't and then if your
 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.800
and others don't and then if your
sacrifices aren't met with the with the

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810
sacrifices aren't met with the with the
 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.990

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650
fratricide and then the next story is
 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.950
fratricide and then the next story is
the flood and that's not an accident

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960
the flood and that's not an accident
 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.230
the flood and that's not an accident
there's nothing in those stories is an

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240
there's nothing in those stories is an
 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.839
there's nothing in those stories is an
accident okay so now you've got two

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:00.849
accident okay so now you've got two
 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:02.339
accident okay so now you've got two
different theories about the nature of

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:02.349
different theories about the nature of
 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:04.740
different theories about the nature of
suffering you've got the one I just laid

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750
suffering you've got the one I just laid
 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.710
suffering you've got the one I just laid
out it's called the foundational story

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720
out it's called the foundational story
 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.200
out it's called the foundational story
of suffering and malevolence and you

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210
of suffering and malevolence and you
 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.510
of suffering and malevolence and you
have the Marxist story which is well

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520
have the Marxist story which is well
 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.129
have the Marxist story which is well
there's oppressed people and the reason

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:14.139
there's oppressed people and the reason
 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:15.330
there's oppressed people and the reason
they're oppressed and suffering is

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:15.340
they're oppressed and suffering is
 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.100
they're oppressed and suffering is
because the oppressors are oppressing

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110
because the oppressors are oppressing
 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.080
because the oppressors are oppressing
them those are not the same theories

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.090
them those are not the same theories
 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.839
them those are not the same theories
right and there's a utopianism that's

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:21.849
right and there's a utopianism that's
 

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:24.480
right and there's a utopianism that's
implicit in Marxism which is if you

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.490
implicit in Marxism which is if you
 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.369
implicit in Marxism which is if you
could just get the damn oppressors to

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:26.379
could just get the damn oppressors to
 

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:29.129
could just get the damn oppressors to
stop oppressing the oppressed then the

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:29.139
stop oppressing the oppressed then the
 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:32.040
stop oppressing the oppressed then the
Utopia would arrive and so not only are

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.050
Utopia would arrive and so not only are
 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.080
Utopia would arrive and so not only are
the oppressors responsible for the

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.090
the oppressors responsible for the
 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.480
the oppressors responsible for the
suffering of the poor they're also

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:36.490
suffering of the poor they're also
 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.209
suffering of the poor they're also
responsible for the fact that the Utopia

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:39.219
responsible for the fact that the Utopia
 

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:41.700
responsible for the fact that the Utopia
isn't here for everyone and so how

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:41.710
isn't here for everyone and so how
 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.830
isn't here for everyone and so how
reprehensible can you get well then that

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:46.840
reprehensible can you get well then that
 

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.010
reprehensible can you get well then that
certainly justifies that degree of

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020
certainly justifies that degree of
 

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.480
certainly justifies that degree of
malevolence justifies pretty much

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:51.490
malevolence justifies pretty much
 

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.960
malevolence justifies pretty much
anything you'd like to do to them
