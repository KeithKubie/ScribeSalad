00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.160
- [Instructor] We've talked about the idea

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.440
of standard form of a linear
equation in other videos,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.300
and the point of this video
is to clarify something

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.340
and resolve some differences
that you might see

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.090
in different classes in terms
of what standard form is.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.090
So everyone agrees that standard form

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.520
is generally a linear equation

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.530
where you have some number times x

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.530
plus some number times y
is equal to some number.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.950
So things that are in
standard form would include

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.300
things like three x plus
four y is equal to 10,

00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:47.100
or two x plus five y

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.010
is equal to negative 10.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.590
Everyone would agree that
these are standard form,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.970
and everyone would
agree that the following

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.280
are not standard form.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.810
So if I were to write three x is equal to

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.130
negative four y plus 10.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.230
Even though these are
equivalent equations,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.650
this is just not in standard form.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.650
Similarly, if I wrote that y is equal to

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.950
three times x plus seven, this
is also not in standard form.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.750
Now the place where some
people might disagree

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.960
is if you were to see something like

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.960
six x plus eight y is equal to 20.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.170
Now why would some folks argue

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.610
that this is not standard form?

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.470
Well, for some folks, they
would say standard form,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.420
the coefficients on x and
y and our constant term,

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.510
so our A, B and C, can't
share any common factors.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.510
Here, six, eight and 20,
they're all divisible by two,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.510
so some folks would argue that
this is not standard form,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.380
and to get it into standard form,

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.390
you would divide all of these by two,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.730
and if you did, you would
get this equation here.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.090
Now that's useful because
then you only have

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.140
one unique equation, but on Khan Academy,

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.700
we do not restrict in that way,

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.940
and that is also a very popular
way of thinking about it.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.710
We just want you to think
about it in this form,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.930
Ax plus By is equal to C.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.500
When you do the exercises
on the Khan Academy,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.870
it's not going to be checking
whether these coefficients,

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.740
A, B and C are divisible,
have a common factor.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.440
So for Khan Academy purposes,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.130
this is considered standard form,

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.690
although don't be surprised
if you encounter some folks

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.290
who say, no, we would rather
you remove any common factors.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.330
Now another example
would be something like

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.330
negative three x minus four
y is equal to negative 10.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.810
So some folks would argue
that this is not standard form

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.650
because they want to see
this first coefficient

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.860
right over here, the A,
being greater than zero,

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.500
while here it is less than zero.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.730
For our purposes on Khan Academy,

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.680
we do consider this standard form,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.760
but I'm just letting you know,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.160
because some folks might not because

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.670
this leading coefficient
is not greater than zero.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.180
Now another example that
some people might be

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.750
on the edge with would be something like

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.677
1.25 x plus 5.50 y

00:03:29.587 --> 00:03:31.004
is equal to 10.5.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.670
The reason why some people
might not consider this

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.240
standard form is that A,
B and C are not integers.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.820
Some folks would say
to be in standard form,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.840
A, B and C need to be integers,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.790
and you could multiply
both sides of the equation

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.170
by some value that will give
you integers for A, B, and C,

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.000
but for Khan Academy purposes,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.880
we do consider this to
be in standard form.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.940
We think this is important,

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.130
actually not just being
able to have non-integers

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.760
as A, B or C, but also being able to have

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.410
a negative A, right over there,

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.680
because negative three is our A,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.790
and also having coefficients,
having our As, Bs and Cs

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.240
having shared factors, we
thing all of that's important

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.330
because sometimes the
equation itself has meaning

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.420
when you write it that way.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.300
We'll see that when we
do some word problems,

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.870
when we actually go into some real life

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.590
and we try to construct equations,

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.370
and based on the
information in the equation,

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.410
it's easier to understand
if you keep it in this form.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.170
So for Khan Academy purposes,
this is all standard form,

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.590
but it's good to be aware
in your mathematical lives

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.670
that some folks might want
to see the restriction

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.390
of no common factor between A, B and C,

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.330
that A is greater than zero,

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.730
and that A, B and C
need to all be integers,

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.880
but Khan Academy does
not hold you to that.
