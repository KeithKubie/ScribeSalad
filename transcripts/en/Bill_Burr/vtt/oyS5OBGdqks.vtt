00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.040
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:07.800
Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.300
And I just checking in on Ya.

4
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:15.180
I'm just checking in on you seeing how your weeks go.

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.500
And that's all I'm doing here.

6
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:21.120
Just running my fucking freckled Yap for another 30 minutes of my God damn life.

7
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:21.721
And you know what?

8
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:25.830
You're going to sit there and listen to it unless you don't want to.

9
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:30.090
Then you can always hit stop. You can find another website.

10
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:34.740
You know, watch some porn at work. Pretend you're working,

11
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:38.640
put your right or left hand and your slacks, your action slacks. You know,

12
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:43.530
rub one out. Tell people later you got to lay off the glazed donuts.

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.140
Oh, come on bill that, that early in Jesus Christ.

14
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.670
You go with the, just joke that fucking early in this,

15
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.640
this does not show a lot of promise that was in under a minute.

16
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.560
The first just joke. You know what I mean?

17
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.970
That's like when you watch one of the, you know, quickest knockouts, you know,

18
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.060
and you're looking at the other guy like why the fuck did you even show up?

19
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.490
You know, I could've done that.

20
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:11.970
I could've gone in there with no fucking training whatsoever. What so,

21
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.830
and I could've got my fucking ass knocked out in less than a minute, you know,

22
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.580
although I wouldn't have the balls to then go try to figure out what I did wrong

23
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:22.890
and then come back to potentially have it again.

24
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.660
And that's what separates the audience member from the professional fighter that

25
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:29.970
gets knocked out in a minute. You know,

26
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:33.150
whenever you see that there's always that guy do it. I could have fucking done

27
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.050
really. You could have gotten top physical condition.

28
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.640
You Tub of Shit fucking sitting here. Who eats fried dough in a boxing match?

29
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:42.660
I didn't even know they sell it.

30
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.170
They steady know they sold that shit at a boxing match. You Fat. Fuck.

31
00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:47.910
What do you think? What w what'd you find that? Huh?

32
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.490
He's like some fucking food whale. You know like when, when the, when the, um,

33
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.410
degenerate gamblers show up and they get flown in and they get this giant sweet,

34
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.540
they'll let go fucking bellies, you know,

35
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:03.900
they roll out the red carpet fuck head. You already paid for it.

36
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.740
They're looking for you to buy another jet. You know,

37
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.530
they probably do that with people who are really fat. You know what I mean?

38
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:13.770
When they show up, hey, just to let you know, fet,

39
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.160
Frank's showing up and he's going to the box match,

40
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.380
so let's bring in some extra chefs and add to the menu.

41
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.140
Who gives a fuck if no one else eats fried though,

42
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:26.940
this guy will eat enough fried dough to justify it, you know? No. All right,

43
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:29.720
whatever. Yeah, got to just joke. I'm making fun of fat people. This,

44
00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:33.240
this isn't good. Oh, this is what you're probably thinking chief's bill.

45
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:36.570
Your energy's a little bit high for Thursday afternoon,

46
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.520
or maybe you're not thinking that.

47
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:42.000
Maybe I'm saying you think in that and I'm getting in your fucking head, right,

48
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.140
that we advertise this fill that they do. If they show one every five seconds,

49
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.600
rather than just getting annoyed on Internet, the Internet,

50
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:52.540
you're going to be like, Oh, you know what? I think I will fucking book.

51
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.860
I never watch him, which is really hypocritical because I have,

52
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.930
I have advertising on this podcast,

53
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.030
but you guys also have the option of just fast forwarding it, you know,

54
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.240
just still a pain in the ass. What I like about youtube, it's like,

55
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.330
you must watch this.

56
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.670
So what I always do is I hit fucking mute and then I just scroll down and I read

57
00:03:10.671 --> 00:03:13.430
some of the comments and I just, just at the top of the screen,

58
00:03:13.431 --> 00:03:17.540
I could see that things slide across and then I know it's fucking, oh,

59
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.730
you know why is about 20 years ago I was in a bar in,

60
00:03:22.731 --> 00:03:26.630
this woman was in advertising that I met and she kept telling me that it works.

61
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.680
I'm gonna go, it doesn't work. Sometimes it annoys me and it makes it, she goes,

62
00:03:30.681 --> 00:03:34.310
no, but it's in there. It works. It totally works. She just kept saying, no,

63
00:03:34.311 --> 00:03:37.610
it works. It's just like, and I was so young and dumb. It's like, Bill,

64
00:03:37.611 --> 00:03:40.520
this is the industry she's in. Okay,

65
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.640
why don't you just go tell somebody that their religion is wrong, you know?

66
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.490
Of course she's going to defend it. What she going to do? Say? Yeah,

67
00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:48.920
it doesn't work. And then she's going to go to work in the morning.

68
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.840
But I was younger, you know, full head of fucking orange, red hair,

69
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.040
doing my best. Talking to the ladies down on Newbury Street. Right?

70
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.880
What do you say? They have fucking all black dress.

71
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.800
They're fucking goth looking chick. That's all I remember from back then.

72
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.440
All those fucking Goth,

73
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.510
look at chicks just fucking walking around down on Newbury Street,

74
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.100
that doc Martins and all that shit. He'd go over to daisy Buchanan's.

75
00:04:16.101 --> 00:04:19.100
That was the meat market, right? That was the chicks that went to the gym.

76
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.420
Unlike the golf ones that were on Newbury street, there were all fucking sad,

77
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.690
you know, taking the weight of the world on their shoulders.

78
00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:29.150
Those whores and days of you can is they didn't give a fuck.

79
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.250
They still don't give a fuck, you know,

80
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.240
and it made fucking starfish tattooed above the butt crack.

81
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.870
Just walking around. They didn't give a fuck. Um,

82
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.870
I walk in there with my fucking waist length leather jacket, my driving gloves.

83
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.190
Little did they know I stepped out of an 83 Ford fucking radar.

84
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.340
Two wheel drive, the extra log bed vinyl seats.

85
00:04:55.341 --> 00:04:58.400
Five speed had a radio,

86
00:04:58.401 --> 00:05:02.480
but somebody smashed the window and took it. Oh yeah ladies,

87
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.080
that's what your fucking your dream boat is arrived.

88
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

89
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.620
<v 0>Seinfeld like white sneakers, you know the high tops coming in.</v>

90
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

91
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.040
<v 0>You know dad jeans that were considered cool back then.</v>

92
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.460
Maybe a sweatshirt that said a spirit or whatever the fuck his spirit. I Dunno.

93
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.880
It's a bad fucking image, but it's a true one.

94
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.440
I'll tell you what isn't a bad image. Did you guys watch a,

95
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.270
well I guess it is a veer of Dallas Stars Fan. Did you guys watch games?

96
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.370
Seven seven, seven seven. The St Louis Blues. Oh,

97
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.370
meet me in St Louis. Louis.

98
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.370
See You at the western conference finals.

99
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.620
Don't tell me the blues are choking. This is a different year.

100
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.260
Fucking St Louis Blues. I'm a repeat this.

101
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.920
The St Louis Blues had a seven in somebody else's building and not only did they

102
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:03.850
win, they gave them the old right. Damn Fred,

103
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.810
five to one. They were up five to nothing.

104
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.380
At one point they were leading the series three to two and they got to have

105
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:18.080
fucking, they got their lunch serve to them. They got their hats handed,

106
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:21.230
whatever you want to say in game six. Alright,

107
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.490
couldn't close them out and then they were going down to Dallas and I don't give

108
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:28.970
a fuck how big of of a St Louis Blues Fan you are,

109
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.570
you know God damn well you've been slapped in your, in your,

110
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.630
your fucking sports fan face too many times by the St Louis Blues is Dick.

111
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.710
Okay. They do it to every fucking year they get you excited. You Go, oh my God,

112
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.310
here we go. The playoffs right in the face and then it's fucking over.

113
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.390
You know what? Right.

114
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.160
So you probably thinking that they were going to fucking blow it against the

115
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.740
Black Cox and Holy Shit, they came back and they did it right.

116
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.330
So now they get another game, seven against the Dallas Stars.

117
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:01.790
And as much as you will say in your affair and you believe,

118
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:05.750
and you got your little trinkets and you sitting in your lucky chair in the back

119
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:07.910
of your head, you know what you go, and these are the blues.

120
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.260
They're going to fucking blow this.

121
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.980
And Jesus Christ did they give you guys an easy ride? Huh?

122
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.180
Three to nothing after one, then four to nothing.

123
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.320
And I know God damn well when you're rooting for a perennial fucking loser,

124
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.470
right? That always breaks your heart. You need five goals.

125
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.830
You need five goals to feel comfortable. You know,

126
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.030
I remember all of this shit back before we started winning every champion that

127
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.830
championship that exists. Um, yeah,

128
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.340
fucking red socks. I was comfortable with like a 12, 13 run lead,

129
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.650
but not if we were playing the Yankees.

130
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:47.150
And it was only the eighth inning prior to 2004. I was not comfortable with it.

131
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:50.960
So, um, what a fucking,

132
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.200
they just, they just went down and they just fucking,

133
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.940
just everything they throw out the net fucking went in.

134
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:03.230
Even what terrorists Sankoh's that weird his goal ever. He's trying to pass it.

135
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.130
He's almost parallel with the net and it did like the magic bullet JFK thing and

136
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:11.540
somehow went into the fucking back in the net and they took that away and I was

137
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:14.500
like, Oh God. And the fucking stars are flying up and down the hours.

138
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.520
They're stars at night, a big and Bright

139
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.610
Dallas right there. Fuck sorry. They're flying all over the fucking ice.

140
00:08:22.611 --> 00:08:25.070
And I'm like, watch this. Here come the stars.

141
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.670
They're going to get the fucking equalize up right.

142
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.400
And then it's going to change the whole fucking shape of the game.

143
00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:33.800
And then the fucking blue scare gave him the all right there, Fred,

144
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:36.260
two more fucking times, if I remember correctly.

145
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.740
And then all of a sudden it was fucking three to nothing and then four enough

146
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.180
and then five to nothing. And then the fucking stars scored a goal and I said,

147
00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:46.910
our shit donate. Don't even tell me.

148
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.830
But then I just started doing the math going like, all right,

149
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:51.140
there's 10 minutes left. They need four goals.

150
00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:52.490
They'd have to score one every two.

151
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:56.280
And a half fucking minutes and then like two and a half minutes went by and then

152
00:08:56.281 --> 00:09:00.510
it's like I'm not doing the math. This is, this game is fucking over. And um,

153
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.990
I said the game was over when it was five to nothing.

154
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:09.410
But even though I said that I wouldn't have left like most of the fucking Douche

155
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.970
bag fans that were along the boards. Did you see how many fucking fans left?

156
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.170
They're not even fans.

157
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.790
Those are all the hookup costs that just went out to some VIP place afterwards.

158
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:22.950
They really made, they always make the, the,

159
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:27.300
the fans of the team look bad because I know the upper deck was still packed and

160
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.010
when the stars lost five to one,

161
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:32.040
everybody was left with standing on their feet applauding them.

162
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.280
I'm just letting stars Fan. I'm not judging your fan base by those fucking,

163
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.330
the hookup cons, the ones who know the people at the radio station,

164
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.320
the fucking whores that are then going to go to a steak house and try to bank

165
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:46.560
some 90 year old guy and fucking get his ATM pin number.

166
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.940
I'm not judging you guys by then. You know when the game's over,

167
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:53.580
they should pan up to the upper deck and see all the fucking diehards,

168
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.600
but I'm sad to see the stars go.

169
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.130
Obviously if they got some net minder problems in seg and didn't play the whole

170
00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:05.460
fucking, he didn't play the whole playoffs and I'll tell you right now.

171
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:07.550
That's why the Bruins, that's why the Bruins got rid of them.

172
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.490
I'm going to make myself feel better. That's why we got rid of him. We know we,

173
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.850
oh yeah. He'll get you 30 40 goals during the regular season.

174
00:10:14.851 --> 00:10:18.210
Where is he in the playoffs? Huh? What happened to him?

175
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.251
What happened to them?

176
00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:24.780
Did he sprain one of his abs dancing with his shirt off and some fucking one of

177
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:26.250
those coyote ugly bars.

178
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.500
That's what the fuck he was doing when he was playing with us.

179
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:31.503
<v 2>Oh,</v>

180
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.790
<v 0>that's true. That's what the rumor was. All right, here we go.</v>

181
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:36.590
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

182
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:41.240
<v 0>Well, let me see here. Yeah, Tyler Sagan injury.</v>

183
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:42.703
What happened to him?

184
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.390
Well then if I can never going to say he's got a lower body in the waist area.

185
00:10:47.391 --> 00:10:51.230
Injury, injured stars, Tyler Sagans makes progress, but not enough.

186
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.260
A lower body and Jew, they always say that it's always a lower body body injury.

187
00:10:56.261 --> 00:10:58.930
That means you fucked up your shoulder. You know,

188
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.790
cause if they say what it is in these fucking animals, we'll actually uh,

189
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.680
actually go after Itso. Yeah. Tyler Sagan was a fucking no-show.

190
00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:11.020
Tell you right now, Mark Messier. He would've got his ass out on the ice.

191
00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:15.160
Oh yeah. You know that ty was saying, you know,

192
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.980
he's just a little fucking underwear model.

193
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.110
<v 2>Okay.</v>

194
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:25.060
<v 0>I'm fucking with you. Well, my kid, I've been one time ice.</v>

195
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:30.140
I fucking blocked a wrist shot and pick up hockey and I was limping for like

196
00:11:30.141 --> 00:11:32.750
fucking 10 days. All right. That's the level of pussy I am.

197
00:11:32.751 --> 00:11:35.070
So I'm just fucking around with Dallas Star fans here. Uh,

198
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.440
but congratulations to the blues tonight. Um, predators,

199
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.640
San Jose shot game seven,

200
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.700
and I don't know who I want to win. I like,

201
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.750
I love the predators cause I don't know, I just liked it. Fucking Unis and uh,

202
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.370
squish him, whatever. Get the into fucking hockey.

203
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.090
And there's something about this,

204
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.340
just something funny about the sharks choking every year and I don't know why,

205
00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:05.260
but I just do not respect San Jose is a sports town. I just can't do it.

206
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.550
You know, I don't respect it cause none of you have the balls to live downtown.

207
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.260
Y'All live outside,

208
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.120
you know when your safe little high little houses on the high end are all made

209
00:12:16.121 --> 00:12:20.950
out of ticky tech and more afraid to go downtown.

210
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.930
Oh my God. Is that a trolley?

211
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.840
You have a fucking trolley going through the center of town.

212
00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:29.170
How much more quaint that they have to make it, I'm just fucking with you.

213
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.050
Downtown San Jose is no joke. Um,

214
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.500
in fact I remember a, the comedy club died,

215
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.590
somebody got shot and killed was fucking hilarious.

216
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:42.500
And then the comedians like F, I forget who the fuck it was that we put it.

217
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.780
They took the picture and they had like the whole Improv,

218
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.250
like marquee out front with the name of million, but the comedian, you know,

219
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.350
probably had some wacky photo there and then they just have a body with like a,

220
00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.520
you know, God damn blanket over it. Um,

221
00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.250
so I understand that. Um,

222
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.760
but then I was thinking what would be cool is if the sharks and the blues play

223
00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:04.210
each other,

224
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:09.210
then somebody will finally sort of break their curse to get to the finals.

225
00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.300
Um, I don't know if the sharks I've ever made a final,

226
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.870
and I don't know if the blues, I don't,

227
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.860
I can't remember the last time the blues did.

228
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:23.770
The last one I remember was the f was against the fucking Boston Bruins.

229
00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:27.400
And I wasn't even a little really old enough to even have watched that.

230
00:13:27.401 --> 00:13:30.880
They might've done it sometime in the nineties or, or in the two thousands,

231
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:35.170
but I was doing so much standup. I missed a lot of hockey back then.

232
00:13:35.171 --> 00:13:38.800
So let's look this up saying Louis Blues

233
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:44.650
last finals. Yeah,

234
00:13:44.651 --> 00:13:48.730
I don't think they've been in it in forever. Last finals appearances. All right.

235
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.800
Saint Louis Blues Financial Problems in playoff streak. 1970 1987 let's see,

236
00:13:58.801 --> 00:14:02.100
list of blue seasons. I don't need this sheds too much here.

237
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.970
Stanley Cup champions. That's a big goose egg conference champion.

238
00:14:05.971 --> 00:14:09.270
I think that's a goose egg too. No, it isn't because they've been to the finals

239
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.590
conference champion Stanley Cup champion. They won't have it. Come on.

240
00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:18.470
You know what? Somebody just texted me this cause I don't want to fucking,

241
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:19.870
<v 1>okay.</v>

242
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.870
<v 0>This is year by fucking years. Somebody actually looks at the shit.</v>

243
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.490
Well actually aren't you looking at,

244
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.320
Oh this isn't what the fuck I wanted to look at.

245
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:31.690
Season was shortened due to strike in 94 95 to [inaudible].

246
00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.210
You know, I thought I answered to ask the question pretty fucking clearly.

247
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.390
You know Saint Louis Blues Blues History.

248
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.110
Do I have to hit pause?

249
00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.133
<v 1>Okay,</v>

250
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.960
<v 0>does so and so going to smack a bitch. Remember that from fucking</v>

251
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.550
Stanley Cup finals record. Here we go.

252
00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.480
Saint Louis Blues Stanley Cup. Well, you know, I'd go fuck yourself. Fuck you.

253
00:15:00.481 --> 00:15:01.590
Internet every once in a while.

254
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.040
And I thought you had all the answers or at least somebody making an attempt to

255
00:15:05.041 --> 00:15:08.670
give me one. Isn't that how it works? So whatever.

256
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.250
I think I'm,

257
00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:18.190
I think I almost want the sharks to win tonight because, uh, I dunno.

258
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.160
Just don't know how they do it with the fucking crazy Baird, you know,

259
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.750
like that'd be fun to watch. Oh, back and forth. They're blues predators.

260
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.500
He know. I don't know. That's almost like a subway series of a southern cities.

261
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.420
St Louis is a southern city.

262
00:15:31.421 --> 00:15:34.570
They try to act like they're fucking from the Midwest. Yeah.

263
00:15:34.571 --> 00:15:37.090
Go there and talk to some people. Jesus Christ.

264
00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.590
Everybody there has got overalls. It's fucking unbelievable. You know,

265
00:15:41.591 --> 00:15:45.550
and they got a Budweiser right in that little fucking pocket. I'm kidding.

266
00:15:45.551 --> 00:15:49.660
They don't. All right. Um, oh by the way,

267
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.660

I'm going to get my fucking ass in shape here cause I am in writer's room shape

274
00:16:12.691 --> 00:16:16.810
right now and I'm dealing with CIA. Uh,

275
00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.050

276
00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:24.400
Um, I'm uh,

277
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.450
taking my antiinflammatory drugs and doing all these fucking stretches at an

278
00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:32.790
even. I have to go to a chiropractor. Um, but maybe I'll go,

279
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.910
I don't need it keeps telling me to go, so maybe I'll go. But anyways,

280
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:40.890
I got my fucking, um, I got my fucking atomic holds,

281
00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:45.050
you know, I got my, uh, Mike Pegboard,

282
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.430
I've got a speed bag for Nia.

283
00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:49.783
<v 1>Um,</v>

284
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:55.100
<v 0>and then I got a, I got a bench, I get a fucking squat rack,</v>

285
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:59.210
I get a pull up bar, I get a dip thing. And then I also got my climbing rope.

286
00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:00.523
So there we go.

287
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.890
And all I got to do is take my dog for a walk around the block from my cardio.

288
00:17:03.891 --> 00:17:08.660
Nothing fucking crazy that beaten up the knees of the feet, you know,

289
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:13.430
eat a salad every day. Like some fucking Yoga instructor, right?

290
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:18.800
Lay off the booze. That ain't happening. Lay off the cigars. That might happen.

291
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.320
I have a,

292
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.910
I'm smoking two in June and then I think I'm done until October.

293
00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:30.710
And if I do that, then I'll only have smoked 10 for the year. And a,

294
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:33.950
I even think that's too many. I just think it's too many. I'd like to be,

295
00:17:33.951 --> 00:17:38.180
I'd like to smoke six a year. This is what I'm going to do next year. All right.

296
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:42.410
It's gonna be, I'm smoking New Year's Day at the Rose Bowl.

297
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:46.400
I'm going to smoke with the Superbowl then I'm not smoking until my birthday in

298
00:17:46.401 --> 00:17:50.550
June. And then I'm going to smoke once a year. I to a big college football game.

299
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.040
I'm going to smoke then. And then that sad. I smoked for a year.

300
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.620
I fucking enjoy this shit out of it, but I don't blow out my jaw,

301
00:17:56.621 --> 00:17:59.010
my tongue on my throat or any of that stuff. I don't need that.

302
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.750
I don't need that my fucking life. So, um, speaking of which,

303
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.060
you should probably ask yourselves at this point. So bill,

304
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.570
what is the big college football game you go into this year? Tell you right now

305
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:18.030
Florida gators taken on the LSU taggers within brand new head coach.

306
00:18:18.031 --> 00:18:22.430
You will it fucking walk or whoever the fuck he is. I don't know who he is. Um,

307
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:28.060
I'm beyond excited to go down there to the swamp. Um,

308
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.160
I actually really like love both those um, programs.

309
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.430
I mean I liked the Florida gators way back.

310
00:18:35.431 --> 00:18:37.560
I would still wish that that orange helmet with the blue shirt,

311
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.900
which just fucking was the shit. Um,

312
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.450
somewhere along the line moving out to Los Angeles,

313
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.290
college football coming on so early and I had the time to watch it instead of

314
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:50.820
driving at gigs on Saturday, I, uh, got into LSU with the mad hatter,

315
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:55.830
his coach, and um, I don't know. That's going to be a tough one.

316
00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.270
I don't know who to root for in that one. I want to go LSU,

317
00:19:00.271 --> 00:19:00.811
but I don't want to be,

318
00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:04.620
that contact goes to somebody's stadium and fucking roots against the home team.

319
00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:08.610
I mean know it's not like I'm that fucking emotionally invested, um,

320
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.800
to be a Douche bag, you know,

321
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:13.810
I'm just going to go there and just hope it's a good game anyways. So, um,

322
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.580
I don't know where I'm going to be performing, but somewhere in that area, uh,

323
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.100
that area and um,

324
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.740
really fucking looking forward to that. So, um, I don't know.

325
00:19:25.741 --> 00:19:30.300
So two more cigars in June and then I'm going to be done for awhile. Allegedly.

326
00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.730
Yeah. Right. Belt. Like you're going to go to fucking Europe.

327
00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.440
They're going to just have any Cuban cigar you want,

328
00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:37.820
you're not going to go in and smoke one,

329
00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:43.730
but if I'm over there for 10 days and I just smoke one, that's okay. Right. Um,

330
00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.200

so out here, you know, in La, they show everything live on the news,

442
00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:40.640
except now when they think somebody's gonna die. So you know,

443
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:44.120
cause a long time ago they showed guy who was trying to kill

444
00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.680
<v 2>himself and he tried to light himself on fire and like a Suzuki Samurai,</v>

445
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.210
it didn't work. And then he got out of the fucking car,

446
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:53.330
he had a fucking 12 gauge shotgun, he got on his knees,

447
00:26:53.331 --> 00:26:56.410
put it under his fucking Chin and blew his fucking head off on TV.

448
00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.920
And like kids were home from school.

449
00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.020
It happened at like three 30 in the afternoon. So like,

450
00:27:00.021 --> 00:27:02.300
we can't do that shit anymore. Right?

451
00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.300
So what do we do?

452
00:27:05.301 --> 00:27:09.950
We put on periscope and God knows there's people fucking filming this shit and

453
00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.810
um, the dudes up there, so immediately, by the way, he did, he doesn't die.

454
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.430
I wouldn't be doing this if the guy died. He's fucking up there. Right.

455
00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:21.410
And, um,

456
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:26.150
which I think is all a big sign saying that Kevin Durant is going to come to the

457
00:27:26.151 --> 00:27:30.020
Celtics. He's leaving Oklahoma. All right.

458
00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.950
He's had enough of you wholesome, racist people out there.

459
00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:38.660
He would like to perform in front of some unwholesome racist people in Boston.

460
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:41.120
That's what I feel. Um, anyways,

461
00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:46.730
so the guys climbed up the Katy La Tower, they're trying to get them down.

462
00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.730
They've got a couple of fucking air mattresses or whatever the fuck they put

463
00:27:49.731 --> 00:27:54.380
down there. And he climbs up and over the five. And it was amazing.

464
00:27:54.381 --> 00:27:58.020
The guy was up there for three fucking hours and I gotta tell Ya,

465
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.880
I'd be lying to you if I didn't start thinking about survivor because it really

466
00:28:01.881 --> 00:28:04.700
seemed like one of their challenges where you always have to stand on like a

467
00:28:04.701 --> 00:28:08.750
fucking, I dunno, like a bamboo pole with one foot, you know,

468
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.580
balance in a tea cup on your head. It kind of seemed like that after awhile.

469
00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.760
Like how the fuck would somebody stay up there that long?

470
00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.540
And he was up there smoking cigarettes and taking phone calls and shit.

471
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.970
And I'm all I could think was okay.

472
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.630
<v 0>I was, if I was going to kill myself, I would never jump off something.</v>

473
00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.753
You know what I mean?

474
00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:32.230
There's too much time to think about what you just did on the way down.

475
00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:37.780
Right. This just, and it's just no way I even know it's right.

476
00:28:37.781 --> 00:28:42.180
The old right there, Fred. It's just immediately fucking over. It's just the,

477
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:47.350
the, the, the fucking mess. You know? It's like, come on man. You know?

478
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:49.060
<v 2>Okay.</v>

479
00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.990
<v 0>Basically not something, he's got to clean it. That's,</v>

480
00:28:50.991 --> 00:28:52.320
that's the last thing you do.

481
00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:57.480
Everybody said that you're dead and then you leave a giant fucking mess.

482
00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:02.340
Somebody's got to come over there with a fucking wet vac and try to clean up the

483
00:29:02.341 --> 00:29:05.130
Goddamn Stina. God knows, you know when you jump off of something,

484
00:29:05.131 --> 00:29:07.800
it's usually not your house. You know, it's,

485
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.790
nobody really has a house big enough to jump off of them. Die.

486
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:15.780
They usually land in the grass, right?

487
00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:19.320
So all you do is just break your fucking legs with some shit and separate your

488
00:29:19.321 --> 00:29:20.490
fucking shoulder.

489
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.890
I'm not saying you can't jump off a house and die,

490
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.740
but I'm just saying, you know, you want to make sure you die,

491
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.350
which means you're going to go to someplace that's a little higher up,

492
00:29:31.351 --> 00:29:36.270
some sort of public structure with concrete, and there's people walking by,

493
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:39.750
right? They just, it's just such a selfish fucking way to do it, right?

494
00:29:39.751 --> 00:29:43.960
People coming up the Goddamn street, you know, hey,

495
00:29:43.961 --> 00:29:48.850
I'm so excited to go see, um, everybody wants some,

496
00:29:48.851 --> 00:29:52.810
I wasn't alive in the 80s, but I'd like to see Hollywood's version of it, right?

497
00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.150
It just like these last two weeks, it's just been so wonder if the,

498
00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:02.110
it's just all over the fucking place. So anyway,

499
00:30:02.111 --> 00:30:05.720
I just get home. And then the worst part is if you jump in,

500
00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.290
you actually fucking live. You know what I mean? And then you have,

501
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.720
your feet are pointed in every fucking direction except the way they're supposed

502
00:30:11.721 --> 00:30:15.590
to, you know, and then you've got to go around being the inspirational speaker,

503
00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:20.150
you know, with a specially designed fucking wheelchair, you know,

504
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:23.680
for somebody who has feet, you know, that point in every fucking duro.

505
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.110
I don't know, some sort of, I think he, at that point they just said yes,

506
00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.770
they will. Yan like Hannibal Lecter. And then you gotta be like,

507
00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.660
just standing there, you know, with your custom sneakers,

508
00:30:35.661 --> 00:30:39.560
talking to some fucking group of people about, you know,

509
00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.630
why you have so much Deloitte,

510
00:30:41.631 --> 00:30:45.140
a fucking way to find out that he got so much to live for. Um,

511
00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.700
it's never the fucking answer. You know what I mean?

512
00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:52.003
Cause it's bad.

513
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:56.480
Think about somebody depressed in St Louis is bad as their fucking life is

514
00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:00.950
the Saint Louis Blues made the Western Conference fucking finals. I mean, yeah,

515
00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.130
if you killed yourself, you wouldn't have seen that. You know?

516
00:31:05.131 --> 00:31:06.660
And then you can't go down to the bar.

517
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:08.820
Everybody's in a good mood and all of a sudden,

518
00:31:08.821 --> 00:31:12.660
some hot chick with the St Louis Blues t-shirt tied off at the fucking navel

519
00:31:12.661 --> 00:31:17.580
comes over, gives you a hug. You're like, oh wow. That's what life's all about.

520
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:22.500
Getting a hug from a hot chick and going home and rubbing one out to her. Ah,

521
00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:26.280
I can't believe I almost jumped off that fucking distillery.

522
00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:32.010
You know what I'm trying to say is don't fuck. I can always don't kill yourself.

523
00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:35.040
All right, this has been a public service announcement.

524
00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.800
I'm going to lie to you if I didn't fucking look up.

525
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.360
Worst ways to kill yourself.

526
00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:44.610
I've found this fucking website and the unfortunate thing was the person tried

527
00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:47.010
to be funny rather than just presenting them.

528
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:52.200
They tried to put their own funny spin on it like I'm about to write. Um,

529
00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:56.430
alright. Seven most unusual ways to kill yourself.

530
00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.970
Um, all right. Number one, this guy tried to kill himself by eating a bible.

531
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:04.250
The doctor said, uh,

532
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:08.840
I was not strong enough to pull the object out of the guy's throat. Um,

533
00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:14.020
I don't believe that that's true. I don't believe somebody ate a Bible.

534
00:32:14.021 --> 00:32:18.360
I think that's one of those, uh, not the creationists,

535
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:22.300
the other fucking people. What's the other people there? I don't fucking know.

536
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:27.340
If you don't believe in creationism, you believe in what a big bang ism person.

537
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.050
I don't fucking know. Anyways, the next one,

538
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:34.420
a guy killed himself in prison by stuffing toilet paper down his throat.

539
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:39.010
That's how bad prison is. You know what I mean? And, uh, you know,

540
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.690
if you have a solid Shawshank redemption, that seems like the, the,

541
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:46.220
it seems the better way to go in a more pleasing thing to have in an orifice.

542
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:52.220
Uh, sorry, number five,

543
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:56.120
this guy in Singapore worked at the zoo wanting to kill himself.

544
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:57.800
Natural Way to do it.

545
00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:01.430
Why take a bunch of sleeping pills and go peacefully when you can walk into the

546
00:33:01.431 --> 00:33:05.780
tiger cage. I bet that's nice and quick to, you know, I've always wanted a pet,

547
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:06.381
a tiger too,

548
00:33:06.381 --> 00:33:09.380
so I think he could get one quick petted before he fucking grabbed you by your

549
00:33:09.381 --> 00:33:11.850
throat. Gave you a nice shake. You just go to,

550
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.540
it's like getting put into the sleeper Holt by one of the UFC guys,

551
00:33:14.541 --> 00:33:19.040
except they would do it with their mouth. Um, number four,

552
00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:24.290
uh, this woman drank Draino and p. That's disgusting. That's not a funny one.

553
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:27.260
Here's the one. A guide to capitated himself.

554
00:33:27.261 --> 00:33:30.860
He got into an Austin Martin tied a rope around his neck, you know,

555
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.840
did a burnout. Woo. That's it.

556
00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:39.920
Um, I guess he was trying to get revenge on his wife.

557
00:33:39.921 --> 00:33:42.860
I don't know how that works. You know what I mean?

558
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:44.810
Cause it was a lot of the cleaners today. I don't,

559
00:33:44.811 --> 00:33:47.160
you could literally bleed out in a car like that and they can,

560
00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:50.390
they can get me enough. You ever see that pimp my ride.

561
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.570
They could take that Austin Martin down there in a fucking day.

562
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.800
They had all the materials. They could take that interior,

563
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:59.270
put it back in and no one would ever know that you ripped your fucking head off.

564
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.810
Although I wonder what happened to the car. So he just kept going.

565
00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.471
That's another one.

566
00:34:03.471 --> 00:34:05.900
Now what if someone was coming up the street doing the fucking paper route?

567
00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:10.040
No one does a paper anymore. It's an adult job. All right.

568
00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:13.340
I'm just, one guy tried to kill himself.

569
00:34:13.341 --> 00:34:16.160
He had to shoot himself three fucking times. That's not funny.

570
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:18.860
Then another guy went out into the woods.

571
00:34:18.861 --> 00:34:22.490
He handcuffed himself to a tree and then threw the fucking key away and then

572
00:34:22.491 --> 00:34:24.710
they could tell that he struggled to try to free himself.

573
00:34:24.711 --> 00:34:26.000
See that's why you never do it.

574
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:32.120
Nobody ever fucking killed themselves except for a guy in jail. We just like, I,

575
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.320
I might just spend the rest of my life fighting off fucking people trying to

576
00:34:35.321 --> 00:34:38.740
stab me and fuck me. I mean, that's when you got it. That's what God's like.

577
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.520
All right, I get it. I get it. No worries. Die. You don't got to explain it.

578
00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:46.930
Come on in. Come on at. Um,

579
00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:51.280
you did your time. All right. I can't end on suicide. All right,

580
00:34:51.281 --> 00:34:56.170
let's go with a prediction here. Alright. Um,

581
00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:01.440
tonight having watched zero predators or San Jose sharks games this year,

582
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:06.790
having watched maybe three minutes of that entire series,

583
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.620
I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt,

584
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.940
no, I can't pay. I've not seen that. I know.

585
00:35:14.941 --> 00:35:19.830
I'm trying to close my eyes and see the winner that I believe that the winner of

586
00:35:19.831 --> 00:35:24.780
tonight's gay, it's gonna be

587
00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:26.603
<v 1>okay.</v>

588
00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:28.890
<v 0>I'm going to say the predators.</v>

589
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:33.390
And the whole reason why I'm saying the president predators is because the St

590
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:38.390
Louis Blues were the away team and they want in a two home gonna lose a game

591
00:35:38.761 --> 00:35:42.960
seven on back to back nights. Okay?

592
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:45.960
And that's the type of philosophy right there.

593
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:50.730
Why Vegas always wins because there's not an ounce of intelligence in what I

594
00:35:50.731 --> 00:35:55.500
just said. All right. I'm picking the predators. That's it. All right. Oh,

595
00:35:55.501 --> 00:36:00.180
freckles is test to go to the a as to go to work. And uh,

596
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.840
my Jim's going to be finished tomorrow, so starting Saturday,

597
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:10.250
all Billy beefcake will be coming to be coming to a town near you with my

598
00:36:10.411 --> 00:36:15.350
overdeveloped freckled pecks right. All of that type of shit.

599
00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:19.040
My sciatica is going to be cured by then. Uh,

600
00:36:19.041 --> 00:36:21.840
I just don't sit down anymore. You know, the,

601
00:36:21.841 --> 00:36:26.190
of course that's going to lead to some sort of feet problem. But, um, anyways,

602
00:36:26.191 --> 00:36:29.310
thank you for listening as always. And um,

603
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.800
thank you for all the great emails I got on Monday.

604
00:36:31.801 --> 00:36:36.750
I'm glad you guys enjoy when my wife comes on and fucking shits on me.

605
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.440
You know, I, I actually like it too. It makes me laugh.

606
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.730
I enjoy it even though she's a pain in the ass. Uh, all right, that's it.

607
00:36:44.731 --> 00:36:46.770
So please enjoy the music and we'll get,

608
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.270
give you another half hour of a classic podcast from a,

609
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.940
from a year gone by in a place, I can't remember.

610
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.073
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

611
00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.960
<v 0>Hey, what's going on? It's still okay.</v>

612
00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:13.320
<v 4>It's the Monday morning podcast that I am doing on a Tuesday at 1120 in the</v>

613
00:38:14.261 --> 00:38:15.820
morning, east coast time.

614
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:21.220
Fucking believe that was on me slipping. You know,

615
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:23.750
no excuse. Actually, I do have an excuse.

616
00:38:23.751 --> 00:38:26.190
It was my girlfriend's birthday yesterday. So, uh,

617
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:27.490
I was being a great boyfriend,

618
00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:32.830
paying attention to her and someone had to suffer. You know what I mean?

619
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:38.740
It's like a, someone always feels left out, man.

620
00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:40.510
How much you try to pay attention.

621
00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:45.310
My kid and I never had a threesome before. I couldn't have one once.

622
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.810
I think twice.

623
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.950
The first time I didn't realize that it was going down.

624
00:38:50.951 --> 00:38:55.930
I was so young and stupid. I was actually sitting there and I was thinking,

625
00:38:55.931 --> 00:39:00.400
why won't her roommate leave? You know, the fuck.

626
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.920
And it wasn't until like literally seven years later I went, oh wait a minute.

627
00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:08.140
She wasn't leaving cause fuck.

628
00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:10.750
And then the other time, uh,

629
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.390
it was right there on the table and, uh,

630
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:17.710
one girl was absolutely gorgeous and the other one,

631
00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:22.750
uh, was not gorgeous. Let's put it that way,

632
00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:27.670
was so not gorgeous that she eclipse the beauty of the other one,

633
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:34.470
you know, so, so they, you'd go, hey,

634
00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.980
you learned something about me right off the damn bat. Okay.

635
00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:43.210
Oh well this is what we're going to do this week on the podcast.

636
00:39:43.211 --> 00:39:46.960
If you guys are new to this shit. A new to my page. Um,

637
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:53.600
I didn't want to use every God damn week and people asked me questions and I try

638
00:39:53.601 --> 00:39:55.960
to answer them. And other than that, I babble.

639
00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:01.030
I give you information about my life and uh,

640
00:40:01.031 --> 00:40:04.990
and that's it. I'm fucking out of it. All right. I drank last night. Okay.

641
00:40:04.991 --> 00:40:07.500
I was celebrating connection,

642
00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:12.540
went to this God damn restaurant in New York who went to Bible and I'm a big fan

643
00:40:13.091 --> 00:40:17.110
of Mario Batali, but I like Lupa better. Baba was just too,

644
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:21.220
it was too, uh, what, uh,

645
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.850
my palate was not sophisticated enough. Alright.

646
00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:26.740
I'll take the blame chooses Christ.

647
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:31.600
It was like regular dishes with shit you'd never eat.

648
00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:37.210
I had beef cheek, Ravioli. Yeah.

649
00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:40.870
We want you to fucking take that in for a minute. All right. And they had,

650
00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:45.140
you know, they had like pheasants face fucking Lasagna, you know,

651
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:50.920
it was always like half what you would heard of like goose liver,

652
00:40:50.921 --> 00:40:55.720
a fucking souffle. So I dunno,

653
00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:00.820
it was, they was good. But a Lupa is the shift.

654
00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:04.240
That's the one that I liked that's got like a fucking, you know,

655
00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.370
regular animals,

656
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:10.990
body parts that you eat mixed in with fucking a Rigatoni.

657
00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.030
Oh, what the fuck are you going to do? You know, you try shit.

658
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.680
You know, she wanted to go there. I fucking took her there. And uh,

659
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:26.610
that's what happened. I had two cupcakes for breakfast.

660
00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:27.533
What you think about that?

661
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.210
It was sitting there leftover from the party and I said,

662
00:41:31.211 --> 00:41:32.590
that's a great way to start my day.

663
00:41:32.591 --> 00:41:37.591
Let me give myself 9,000 calories of straight sugar was unreal.

664
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:39.860
It was like I did an eight ball.

665
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.560
That's where I ate the two cupcakes for 20 minutes.

666
00:41:42.561 --> 00:41:45.880
I was just sitting there thinking, how fucking great I wasn't. I'm like,

667
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:49.080
I'm fucking awesome. I could do anything.

668
00:41:49.081 --> 00:41:51.240
I want a fucking the greatest.

669
00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:55.260
And 20 minutes later when the sugar started wearing off, oh my God.

670
00:41:55.261 --> 00:42:00.260
I started pulling the drapes closed, laying in here like, uh, I dunno.

671
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:06.280
I Dunno. Don't ever start your day with fucking two, two cupcakes.

672
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:08.560
After had a beef.

673
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:13.980
She fucking Ravioli beef cheek. I was like, cheek like the ass.

674
00:42:13.981 --> 00:42:18.590
You being cute. They're like, no, they actually know what,

675
00:42:18.591 --> 00:42:20.210
I didn't have the fucking balls to ask him.

676
00:42:20.211 --> 00:42:24.230
I didn't want to know how I was eating somebodies face meeting. A Yak face.

677
00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:28.970
Yeah. Let me get the Yak taint a red goon. Um,

678
00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:34.580
let's continue with the, uh, the continuing story of American Airlines.

679
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:38.210
If you listened to my, uh, my podcast last week, uh,

680
00:42:38.211 --> 00:42:41.750
these cheap ass motherfuckers at American Airlines, uh, you know,

681
00:42:41.751 --> 00:42:46.370
they allegate around the fucking food up in first class. You know what I mean?

682
00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.720
They had 20 people in First Class and they made five omelets.

683
00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:55.190
And next thing you know, I was eating a bowl of total open Nebraska.

684
00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.250
Actually, no, that's not what happened. Just to give you the quick synopsis,

685
00:42:58.251 --> 00:43:00.920
I said, Fuck you and your honeycomb cereal.

686
00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.770
This is first class and I don't get a Goddamn Mama. I don't want anything.

687
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:07.490
I said all of that with a little less anger and no curses.

688
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.910
So a few seconds later the guy came back, all of a sudden he magically,

689
00:43:10.911 --> 00:43:13.310
he has an Omelette and I'm like, where did you get that?

690
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:17.000
And he informed me that the pilots said he already ate so I could have his

691
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.400
omelet. And I was like, I don't want his fucking Omelet. I want my omelet.

692
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:25.010
All right. I don't want to starve. And pilot, you know,

693
00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:29.990
passing out up there, seeing bogeys leaning forward on the Goddamn yoke,

694
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:31.910
whatever you call it. All right.

695
00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:38.740
So I sent them a letter and this is the letter that they sent back to me and I

696
00:43:39.321 --> 00:43:40.101
swear to God, you know,

697
00:43:40.101 --> 00:43:45.101
back in the day if something like this ever happened and you actually wrote a

698
00:43:45.471 --> 00:43:48.970
letter, you prefer at least they give you a free airline ticket. And I'm,

699
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:50.180
when I say back in the day,

700
00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:54.590
I mean like 2005 2006 now they don't give a shit.

701
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.750
They just keep apologizing profusely.

702
00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.270
This is this dumb ass letter they sent back to me.

703
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.930
I'm only going to read you part of it because they just keep saying the same

704
00:44:02.931 --> 00:44:05.870
thing over and over again. Okay. Let me, I got the hiccups.

705
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:09.950
I think I have sugar hiccups from stuffing down to cupcakes.

706
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.100
Hang on a second. As from service. Hello? Yeah,

707
00:44:16.101 --> 00:44:18.680
I'm going to check out about a like 15 minutes. Okay.

708
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:24.470
Thank you Jesus. They didn't say anything. She said hello?

709
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:27.620
I said, yeah, I'm going to check out 15 minutes. At which point she could,

710
00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:31.710
could've said okay for older Ley, you know, but no,

711
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:33.540
she just closes the door.

712
00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.370
<v 5>Okay.</v>

713
00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:39.900
<v 4>All right. Okay. Here's the fucking, uh, oh. What do we got here? This is the,</v>

714
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.790
okay. This isn't, this is the letter that American Airlines sent me. Okay,

715
00:44:42.791 --> 00:44:46.270
dear Mr. Burke, thank you for contacting American Airlines.

716
00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:50.470
It's our privilege to respond to your message. Okay? First of all,

717
00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:54.130
right there. They already pissed me off. Okay. Don't,

718
00:44:54.131 --> 00:44:57.820
don't start with off with your fucking stock line,

719
00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:03.940
like your Jackie Gleason, you know, thank you for writing us in a way we go,

720
00:45:03.941 --> 00:45:07.270
you know, a little shoving off the buffalo. Uh, okay.

721
00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:11.230
I'm very sorry to hear of your disappointment with us and regret that you did

722
00:45:11.231 --> 00:45:14.800
not receive your preferred entree when you traveled with us in the first class

723
00:45:14.801 --> 00:45:16.360
cabin. Uh,

724
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:20.530
CLS soulless assists because we want your travel experience or improving premium

725
00:45:20.531 --> 00:45:22.780
cabins to be truly something special.

726
00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:28.200
We do our best to cater our entree selections so that we can serve each customer

727
00:45:28.601 --> 00:45:32.890
the entree they prefer. This is the part which is just complete bullshit.

728
00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:37.630
Okay. They want to make sure that they serve the entree that I prefer. You know?

729
00:45:37.631 --> 00:45:40.420
Yeah. You can do that. Bringing up fucking eggs on the flight.

730
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:43.760
This is what they write to do.

731
00:45:43.761 --> 00:45:47.090
So we determine which entrees are selected most often.

732
00:45:47.091 --> 00:45:51.990
It's often and provision accordingly. That's,

733
00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:56.180
that's such fucking bullshit. I mean,

734
00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.600
but then they watched Jurassic Park when Jeff Goldbloom did his little rant

735
00:45:59.601 --> 00:46:00.740
about chaos theory.

736
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:06.620
You think cause you take 10 flights or a hundred flights and you figure out,

737
00:46:06.621 --> 00:46:08.600
oh you know seven people want the Omelet

738
00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:13.670
and you know nine people want something else. That's such bullshit.

739
00:46:13.671 --> 00:46:15.740
First of all, nobody wants to fucking cereal.

740
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:19.220
Someone wants cereal in first class. Okay,

741
00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:24.270
you fucking dropped $1,500 or whatever the hell is 800 $1,500 on ticket.

742
00:46:24.271 --> 00:46:28.280
You want something of substance. I'm sick of bitching about this.

743
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:29.420
Oh I know it was in the end of it.

744
00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:34.310
I ended up flying fucking a middle seat to fucking Dallas and all I got was $150

745
00:46:34.311 --> 00:46:37.430
voucher which will pay for one third.

746
00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:40.400
They didn't give me anything Mr. Barrier,

747
00:46:40.401 --> 00:46:43.700
we are not unmindful of the inconvenience of you. Well,

748
00:46:43.701 --> 00:46:46.220
how the fuck would you be on mindful? I wrote you a God damn letter.

749
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.840
As hard as we are trying to deliver on respecting your time by operating our

750
00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:54.800
flights as scheduled, it just wasn't possible this time. Again,

751
00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:59.810
we apologize for the disruption of your travel plans. We're not giving you shit.

752
00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:01.850
Please slide with us again soon.

753
00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:07.220
We'll do our best to get you to your destination as planned.

754
00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:10.040
Really, you're going to do your best. That's what you can give me.

755
00:47:10.041 --> 00:47:13.490
American Airlines. Well, Gee, you know, we're going to try.

756
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.440
That's a comforting attitude to have when they're going to be flying it fucking

757
00:47:18.441 --> 00:47:23.150
36,000 feet off the goddamn ground. Oh, do I sound like a client this week?

758
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.390
So that's basically it. That's, that's the, uh,

759
00:47:27.391 --> 00:47:30.730
the next level that they've taken it to where it used to be like, okay,

760
00:47:30.731 --> 00:47:34.600
we fuck you over. And the stewardess gives you a hand job. You know,

761
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:39.190
that was 1975. And in the 80s, it was, you know,

762
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:43.780
we'll give you a free ticket and a skinny Michael J. Fox tie. But those things,

763
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:44.260
you know,

764
00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:48.940
when you had the little spiked out mullet and they had lasted for a good 20

765
00:47:48.941 --> 00:47:52.930
years and somewhere in the last four or five years, it became a,

766
00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.780
we're going to fuck you over and back. Go Fuck Yourself.

767
00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:58.030
What do think about that? Go Fuck Yourself.

768
00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:00.140
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

769
00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:04.460
<v 4>299 other people on the plane that didn't fit in complaint. What do you do?</v>

770
00:48:04.461 --> 00:48:08.030
Take the train. It's going to take him nine days to get to New York.

771
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:11.390
Go Fuck Yourself. Do you know you're coming back? It's just eggs.

772
00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.510
You know of yourself. Know what?

773
00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.420
They got me over God damn barrel sons of bitches. What am I going to do?

774
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:21.050
Fly ATA, you know Nina fucking

775
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:22.640
<v 5>okay.</v>

776
00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.990
<v 4>Yeah, I dunno what in a goddamn chicken. I'm actually,</v>

777
00:48:25.991 --> 00:48:28.000
I think ATA recently went out of business.

778
00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.480
You have a flying airline and then you know, you're like, Eh, you know,

779
00:48:31.481 --> 00:48:34.100
it was kind of weird flight and you know, there was a crack in the uh,

780
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:38.140
inner window actually that happened to be on ATA. One of the windows, you know,

781
00:48:38.141 --> 00:48:41.690
they got like the, they got the, the double pane of glass, they got the,

782
00:48:41.691 --> 00:48:42.700
the one on the outside,

783
00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:47.290
the outside of the plane and then they have the one on the inside,

784
00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.620
the extra level one. And that one was cracked.

785
00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:53.870
And I believe it was a little bit of water in there. And I said to the, uh,

786
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:56.830
to the students, I was like, a woman,

787
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:59.920
there's a fucking crack in the God damn window over here.

788
00:48:59.921 --> 00:49:04.030
I'm afraid I'm going to get sucked out once we get above 6,000 feet. She said,

789
00:49:04.031 --> 00:49:06.560
it's like [inaudible] class,

790
00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:11.390
you know, so I didn't feel bad when they went out of business.

791
00:49:11.391 --> 00:49:14.090
Now I kind of feel bad because now there's no, there's no other option.

792
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:15.500
I guess that's my other option.

793
00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:20.060
Do I sit there and I take it on American Airlines and they go, go fuck yourself.

794
00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.970
All right, we're going to give you a brand muffin.

795
00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.280
I hope you brought some water.

796
00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.570
Or I fly another airline when their inner window was cracked and no one thinks

797
00:49:29.571 --> 00:49:33.440
it's a concern. Painter winters crack. Well, that's,

798
00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.450
that's why we got two of them. All right.

799
00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.420
This podcast is just a cluster. Fuck.

800
00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:45.110
Let's get to some podcast questions that I didn't even,

801
00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:48.200
I didn't even have the time to fucking look at this week. Actually.

802
00:49:48.201 --> 00:49:50.720
That's not true. I went to look at them and somebody,

803
00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:52.670
I don't know what's going on with my myspace page.

804
00:49:52.671 --> 00:49:55.030
I don't know if anybody else has had this problem. But, uh,

805
00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:59.660
I ended up able to really add anybody for about a year, you know,

806
00:49:59.661 --> 00:50:02.930
every couple of days they'll get about 45 requests, I'll accept them.

807
00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:08.360
And then a day later I have 47 people taken off my page. And it's like,

808
00:50:08.361 --> 00:50:13.160
really? We're all those people spammers. I don't know what's going on. So, uh,

809
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:16.970
I'm having somebody look into my account. The only question I can remember,

810
00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:21.700
I can't even remember if it was something about fucking, uh,

811
00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:28.050
you know, what movies do I find scary? Um, well, you know what,

812
00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:30.810
<v 5>if you turned my flight on American Airlines into a movie,</v>

813
00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:35.370
I would've found that fucking scary. Um, what movies do I find scary?

814
00:50:35.371 --> 00:50:39.180
Anything that involves a crazy woman? Um,

815
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:44.190
I think the scariest movies when I first got cable in the early eighties,

816
00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.730
when I had a tight jeans and, uh,

817
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:53.100
pony high tops that just met the bottom of my jeans and no one complained

818
00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:58.960
because somehow you could get away with that back then. Um, I remember, uh,

819
00:50:58.961 --> 00:51:02.190
the first Friday the 13th, when Jason came up out of the lake,

820
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:07.050
that scared the shit out of me. And there was another one. Here's,

821
00:51:07.051 --> 00:51:10.440
here's one for you. Okay. I've got a podcast question for you guys.

822
00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:16.340
There was a movie I saw late night cable and I can't remember what the fuck it

823
00:51:18.481 --> 00:51:19.314
was,

824
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:25.660
but it somehow there was somebody skating across the pond in slow motion with an

825
00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:31.050
ax. And I believe for some reason the, uh,

826
00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:36.750
the monster I'm picturing is, is from that. I know this isn't it,

827
00:51:36.751 --> 00:51:39.550
but the picture in my mind is, uh,

828
00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:44.370
what does that monster book where the wild things that I remember what those

829
00:51:44.371 --> 00:51:46.260
monsters look like in my memory.

830
00:51:46.261 --> 00:51:51.090
That's what the monster look like skating across the fucking lake. Uh,

831
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:54.360
and I know it isn't that, but I know somebody, what do you,

832
00:51:54.361 --> 00:51:59.361
what am I 14 listeners out there has to be a fucking horror or a film,

833
00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.740
uh, whatever. The,

834
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:05.460
what do you call someone's really in a horror films like Geek. Yeah, exactly.

835
00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:09.720
A horror film. Fucking Dick. There was that one and a,

836
00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:13.860
there was another one I was just thinking of and I just sat up and I can't

837
00:52:13.861 --> 00:52:16.020
remember it. I'm getting a fucking age.

838
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:19.080
I literally just moved my brain a little bit. The thought just went away.

839
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:23.970
Wait a second. What the fuck was I just thinking? Let me lay back down.

840
00:52:23.971 --> 00:52:25.490
Let me see what would come back to me. Okay.

841
00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.740
I was talking about we got to go back in time. You know I was talking. Okay.

842
00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:32.160
The lake, while things are,

843
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:37.790
<v 4>see that's how my brain works. It works linear. Once I go past the moment, I,</v>

844
00:52:37.791 --> 00:52:40.940
I can't go back. It's like a fucking traffic jam.

845
00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:45.800
What the fuck was I trying to think of? Ah,

846
00:52:45.801 --> 00:52:50.270
Shit. I don't know. Oh, I got it. Bam. There we go. Um,

847
00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:56.450
dark night or the scare crow. I liked the old horror movies.

848
00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:01.360
Okay. This is what, you know what I don't like about new horror movies fit they,

849
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:04.360
that CGI shit. They,

850
00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:09.520
they can do so much insane stuff with computers that they forgot how to build

851
00:53:10.851 --> 00:53:15.050
suspense. The old ones they used, they used to build it up.

852
00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:19.790
They used to build up the moment where the monster was going to jump out at you

853
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:25.210
because they had to because it was just a guy in a rubber fucking suit.

854
00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:29.550
You know what I mean? But now that they can, they can,

855
00:53:29.551 --> 00:53:32.670
you know they can make it look like God still is stepping on New York.

856
00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:35.250
They forgot how to build, dispense.

857
00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:39.180
That's what I don't like about fucking horror movies now. And that's a,

858
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.920
I think Japanese,

859
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:45.090
I dunno everybody over in Asia seems to know how to fucking do that.

860
00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:48.690
But nobody over here does even like, like, like thrillers,

861
00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:54.420
whatever the fuck it, whatever a goddamn thriller is like take that,

862
00:53:54.421 --> 00:53:58.800
that movie a perfect storm. They had that goddamn big wave.

863
00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.480
That's all they showed in the trailer.

864
00:54:00.481 --> 00:54:04.260
So everybody goes out to run out and see it and then they don't develop any of

865
00:54:04.261 --> 00:54:08.580
the goddamn characters because the point that I don't give a fuck about anybody

866
00:54:08.581 --> 00:54:11.370
in the movie. So by the end of the movie,

867
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:14.430
I'm actually praying for the wave.

868
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:19.860
I can't wait for them to kill George Clooney and Mark Walberg and all those

869
00:54:19.861 --> 00:54:20.430
other guys.

870
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:23.100
Cause I don't give a fuck about their characters cause if they haven't done

871
00:54:23.101 --> 00:54:24.630
anything to make me give a fuck,

872
00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:29.190
they just had a couple of people speaking Boston accent and you stick them on a

873
00:54:29.191 --> 00:54:30.780
tugboat and I'm supposed to give a shit.

874
00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:36.530
They gonna die trying to get lobster. Um,

875
00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:43.030
I'm just in a bad mood. I'm in a bad fucking mood today. I'm like,

876
00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:43.521
you know what it is,

877
00:54:43.521 --> 00:54:46.770
is the gun and don't ever start your day with two fucking cupcakes.

878
00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.040
It seems like such a great, you know, it's such a great idea, you know, like,

879
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.560
oh, I'm eight years old. This is what you'd want to do.

880
00:54:52.561 --> 00:54:57.360
But your parents never loved you, you know? And now I'm 39 and 51 weeks.

881
00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:01.980
And finally the dream that I thought was going to happen,

882
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:07.860
you know, oh it did happen. And then it doesn't play out. Right. Oh my God.

883
00:55:07.861 --> 00:55:08.910
How did I forget this shit?

884
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:12.210
I know I forgot it because I have fucking two cupcakes with the sugar in my

885
00:55:12.211 --> 00:55:16.680
brain. I actually had a crazy week. How crazy was it bill?

886
00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:22.010
Um, I flew into New York on Wednesday. I did okay. And Anthony Opening,

887
00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:25.260
Anthony Opie and Anthony show Thursday morning.

888
00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:29.310
Then I did my show at Caroline's in New York Thursday night.

889
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:33.090
I got up Friday morning, got on a plane, flew back to la.

890
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:38.540
I did the guys' choice awards on a SPITV men,

891
00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:42.570
all these famous people. They were all cool. I had a great time.

892
00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:44.040
I met Nikki six,

893
00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:49.310
I was way more thrilled and the after party was at the fucking playboy mansion.

894
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:54.510
And I know what you're thinking. Oh my God, playboy is fucking mentioned.

895
00:55:54.511 --> 00:55:57.990
That must've been unbelievable. Um, I quickly realized when I got there,

896
00:55:57.991 --> 00:56:00.780
there's two kinds of parties at the playboy mentioned. There's the,

897
00:56:00.781 --> 00:56:05.781
your famous and you can come by Wednesday afternoon and actually meet the broads

898
00:56:06.211 --> 00:56:07.320
that are in the magazine.

899
00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:11.910
And then there's the one that I went to where it's like, yeah,

900
00:56:11.911 --> 00:56:14.640
why don't you guys all just stand on my, in my backyard?

901
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:21.620
I literally thought I was going to show up to the mansion, right.

902
00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:24.820
Was going to be like me and eight other people. And just, you know,

903
00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:28.720
for playboy bunnies eats just rubbing on my chest. Hey there, big boy.

904
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:34.750
I heard you're a comedian now. They just had, they had the,

905
00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:39.550
it was definitely the beat team, a playboy bunny, you know,

906
00:56:39.551 --> 00:56:41.820
they had little bunny suits on and the rabbit ears, the,

907
00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:43.660
let me tell you something. They were, uh,

908
00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:48.940
they were grade a hooter girls and he could tell there was three of them who

909
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:51.460
were clearly being paid to frolic in the pool.

910
00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:56.940
And any girl with bunny ears had like nine guys around her was a fucking sausage

911
00:56:57.401 --> 00:57:01.360
fest. And this is the funny thing. Nobody was hitting on them.

912
00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:04.840
They was standing there with the fucking cameras out,

913
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:07.720
taking pictures like, uh,

914
00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:11.260
like they were Disneyland and they ran into Donald Duck or something.

915
00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:16.690
It was pathetic. And uh, you know, you have no,

916
00:57:16.691 --> 00:57:20.860
was roped off with his three fucking girlfriends, 83 years old man guy.

917
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.260
It was the shit that was the only thing I wanted to do.

918
00:57:23.261 --> 00:57:26.590
I just want to go in there and shake his hand and, uh,

919
00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:31.570
then immediately stick my hand in bleach to get the unbelievable smell of 50

920
00:57:31.571 --> 00:57:36.460
years of pussy off of my hand. And, uh, then fly back.

921
00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:41.590
But he was busy. I understand. He had to meet, uh, famous fucking people.

922
00:57:41.591 --> 00:57:46.150
So, uh, but still still was shit. And then I flew back the next day,

923
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:51.190
six in the fucking morning. I landed in New York at about four 30. I got my bag,

924
00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:55.290
I went over to Caroline's and I did three fucking shows, you know,

925
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:57.280
and then I went out drinking afterwards.

926
00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:01.330
And that's the kind of thing that leads you to be in a country mood on a Tuesday

927
00:58:01.331 --> 00:58:05.530
morning. You know, I did all of that and then I ate two cupcakes. All right.

928
00:58:05.531 --> 00:58:10.210
So don't even question my fucking mood. All right. So, um,

929
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:14.050
so there you go. That was my week, Huh? Went to a party at the playboy mansion.

930
00:58:14.051 --> 00:58:18.640
I did stand up on my first award show. When is it going to be at you? Ask why.

933
00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:31.960
most of the crowd was a pay crowd, you know, good looking people,

934
00:58:31.961 --> 00:58:35.190
hot chicks texting each other. And I, God, what,
