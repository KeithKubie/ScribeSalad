00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The problem is we have these extra--these characters,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
this quote and this angled bracket--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that shouldn't be allowed in our .

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now we can check for that, and there's a couple of ways to go around this.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But the nicest way to fix this is through a method called "Escaping"--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
hence, the title of this page.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
HTML allows you to Escape certain characters

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or change them so that when the user types in (")

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we can still show the quote in the text box.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What we do is, instead of returning (") in our HTML,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
we include this other string.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Instead of including a ("), we convert it to (&amp; quot;)

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and we can also Escape angled brackets.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We'll convert the closing angled bracket

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
into (&amp; gt--which stands for greater than--;)

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and we've got some other Escapes we can do as well.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We can convert the Less Than symbol--the opening tag--

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
into (&amp; lt;)

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and we conclude the ampersand--or we can Escape the ampersand itself

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
into "&amp; amp;"

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So if we conclude these in our HTML,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
what will appear are these symbols--

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.233
but they're not actually HTML.
