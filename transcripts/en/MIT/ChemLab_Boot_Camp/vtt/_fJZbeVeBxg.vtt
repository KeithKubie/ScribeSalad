JASON: I can still
smell it on me.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.270
I took two showers.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.582
JULIE: I don't think I ever
smelled bad, so you must have

00:00:06.582 --> 00:00:08.672
something really wrong.

00:00:08.672 --> 00:00:40.910
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.370
GUEST SPEAKER: Last time on
5.301, the students made seven

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.290
slightly different versions
of penicillin.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.370
Today and tomorrow, they'll be
testing which one is best at

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.070
killing bacteria.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.710
They do this by adding seven
different amounts of

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.980
penicillin to a constant
number of E.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.320
coli in seven tubes.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.760
The bacteria will be incubated
for 24 hours, and then the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.730
students will measure how much
bacteria is left in each tube.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.510
They'll plot a graph of
bacterial concentration versus

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.300
penicillin concentration.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.030
This is called a
killing curve.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.350
The steeper the killing curve,
that better the antibiotic.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.350
GUEST SPEAKER: Don't
sneeze or anything.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.830
ETHAN: 7.0 milligrams of
this, and I don't want

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.430
to lose any of it.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.715
LINA: I think we're
doing really well.

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:30.140
We're being so careful.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.435
Everything's working
out perfectly.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.350
GUEST SPEAKER: After a bitter
battle over the biggest

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.120
crystal, Jason and Julie
have made up.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.800
JASON: She did it.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.780
She probably spilled it so like,
OK, I have an excuse to

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.142
clean up this and get
away from Jason.

00:01:48.142 --> 00:01:50.632
I didn't say anything.

00:01:50.632 --> 00:01:51.950
JULIE: What did he just
say about me?

00:01:54.728 --> 00:01:56.580
JASON: She hates me.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.740
She loves me!

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.260
Well, she didn't want
me to say that.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.370
LEALIA: I think we're
almost done.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.250
YI-SHIUAN: We're done.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.370
ANTHONY: You're an
awesome partner.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.780
TENGFEI: So tomorrow, we're
going to see which tube the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.370
bacteria grows and which
tube the bacteria dies.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.740
If they grow, the culture
will become cloudy.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.920
GUEST SPEAKER: The next day, all
the students have to do is

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.340
measure how many bacteria
are in each tube.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.010
PROFESSOR: This is how, when you
make a drug candidate, you

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.880
can gauge how effective your
drug candidate is.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.580
GUEST SPEAKER: To do that, they
use a spectrophotometer,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.050
which shoots light through the
sample at a detector on the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.020
other side.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.130
If there are a lot of bacteria,
most of that light

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.340
is scattered in random
directions and never reaches

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.620
the detector.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.510
If there are very few bacteria,
most of the light

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.760
makes it through.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.300
GUEST SPEAKER: Trying to
find the line that

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.740
fits the data well.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.810
LINA: It feels great, because
I actually know what some of

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.090
these things are.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.760
At the beginning I had no idea,
so I was asking around

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.710
the entire time.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.354
So I've learned something
during three weeks.

00:03:06.354 --> 00:03:10.130
ANTHONY: 0.45.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.950
GUEST SPEAKER: The students plot
the results on the white

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.001
board and discuss whose
penicillin is best.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.070
GUEST SPEAKER: How
are the results?

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.872
ANTHONY: Did I win?

00:03:20.872 --> 00:03:24.648
GUEST SPEAKER: You
tell me who wins.

00:03:24.648 --> 00:03:25.602
GUEST SPEAKER: I win!

00:03:25.602 --> 00:03:27.033
GUEST SPEAKER: Which
is the best?

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:28.650
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah,
Anthony's.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.700
ANTHONY: Mine.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.810
GUEST SPEAKER: Today is the
students' last day in the lab.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.730
Tune in to the next episode
to see how 5.301 wraps up.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.090
GUEST SPEAKER: Just imagine if
you had a president that was a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.850
bachelor, or if you had a
president with no kids.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.870
I think that we're going to have
a gay president before we

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.890
have one that doesn't
have a spouse.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.670
Unthinkable.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.920
[MUSIC PLAYING-"HAIL
TO THE CHIEF"]

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.375
GUEST SPEAKER: Wait, was he?

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:55.780
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, he was.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.674
GUEST SPEAKER: He didn't
have a wife?

00:03:56.674 --> 00:03:57.520
GUEST SPEAKER: Nope.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.960
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh my
god, I'm so stupid.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.400
I should definitely fact-check
before I talk.
