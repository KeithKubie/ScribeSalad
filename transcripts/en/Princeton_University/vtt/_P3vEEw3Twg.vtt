00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.000
JOE MARGOLIES: Thank you for joining me on a tour of Princeton University's eating clubs.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.300
I'm Joe Margolies, the president of the
Interclub Council and also the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.500
immediate past president of Quadrangle
Club. The clubs are one of the most

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.520
popular dining and social options for
Princeton students. In their junior and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.050
senior years, about 70 percent of
Princeton upperclassmen join one of the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.730
11 clubs that are located on or near
Prospect Avenue, which students call

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.730
the Street.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.420
NATALIE HEJDUK: Chefs are always really accommodating. You can always go to the chefs during

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.479
lunch to get a grilled option if you
want. You can really ask them if you like

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.259
something, can you just make that for me again? Do you have any extra of that?

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.700
Yeah, they're always really accommodating if you have allergies or anything like that.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.350
JOE MARGOLIES: The clubs provide members with meals, study spaces, a home-away-from-home

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.000
atmosphere, and the opportunity to
participate in social events, intramural

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.640
sports, and community service activities.
Each club has an officer responsible for

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.720
organizing community service activities
throughout the year. In the spring, all of

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.130
the clubs work together to host an interclub fundraiser called Truckfest, a food

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.679
truck event for the University and the
community.

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.039
MALLORY BANKS: I'm in here like almost all the time. I think most people are like, Mallory do

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.039
you do work? Like do you go back to your room? Like where do you sleep?

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.610
Just because I feel so at home here. I
feel like the atmosphere is so warm and

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.259
open and loving, and it's something that
I really looked for in an eating club,

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.700
that I would consider my family.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.340
JOE MARGOLIES: In 1855,
faced with a lack of campus-sponsored

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.119
dining options and a prohibition on
fraternities, Princeton students began

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.890
dining in boarding houses in town. Twenty-four years later, a group of students rented a

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.360
building on Mercer Street and began a
more formal kind of eating club.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.860
The process of becoming a club member has evolved over the years. Today any student

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.090
who wants to join can become a member of a club. The clubs are very diverse, and

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.319
all of the clubs are co-educational. Five
of the clubs are open for any student to

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.000
join, and six have a selection process to
admit members. Students are eligible to

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.800
join a club in the second semester of
sophomore year.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.319
DANNY ZIRKEL: Being a member of the

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:41.670
club, it's definitely like being a
part of a family and you feel

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.690
like you're an integral part of the
family, that your voice matters and you

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.300
can shape the culture of the club and
the direction that the club takes moving forward.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.220
JOE MARGOLIES: The dining and social fees for each club vary but are generally higher

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.690
than the University dining contract. The
University's financial aid plan provides

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.569
students on financial aid with an
allowance to help cover the additional

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.360
costs of joining a club. The size of each
club varies from about 100 to 250

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.350
members. Each club is small enough that
members get to meet many new friends

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.180
with different interests and backgrounds.
Each club is a private entity managed by

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.680
a board of trustees and student officers.
The presidents of all 11 of the clubs

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.880
are members of the Interclub Council.
The purpose of the ICC is to provide a

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.570
forum for the clubs to collaborate on
issues that affect them collectively and

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.200
to ensure that the clubs provide an
enjoyable, responsible and safe

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.910
atmosphere for all members. The ICC works with the University to support its

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.400
policies and educate members on issues
of conduct and safety. Membership leads

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.960
to long-lasting bonds of friendship. Many
members return as alumni for Reunions

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.760
and other events during the year,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.450
reconnecting with each other and meeting new members. The clubs are a place where

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.900
generations of Princetonians come
together to share memories and great

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.900
times.
