00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.120
The first thing we want to share
with you is the number one piece of

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.150
feedback we get from new
students in the program.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.330
And that's that these classes
can be really, really difficult.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.050
And many students come to this program
from other online experiences like MOOCs

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.360
or other online programs.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.140
And they're surprised to see how
difficult these classes can be.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.710
But these are real Georgia Tech classes
taught by the same instructors,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.730
graded by the same graders,
and using the same tests and

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.510
assessments as any class on campus.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.690
So they can be very difficult.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.450
So towards that end, one thing we
recommend is that your first semester in

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.720
the program, take only one class.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.650
That first semester, you're going to
be learning about being in the program

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.600
as you are learning
the material of that class.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.310
So take only one class in order
to set yourself up for success.
