00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Best thing about Matt's
story is that it stays with you long after

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
you read it.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.251
So it's one of those stories that, when the
next time the world is beating you down and

00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:12.320
you're facing a challenge that you don't think
you can overcome, Matt's story will remind

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.839
you to get from the long journey from 'I can't
and I won't' to 'I will'.

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.849
Matt could be speaking to a group of hundreds
of people right now at the New York City Marathon

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.830
Expo at the Javits Center but he's here talking
to us today.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.640
So let's give him a warm Google welcome.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.710
Ladies and gentlemen, fellow Googlers, Matt
Long.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.740
We're going to start with a quick video.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.740
[music]

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.740
&gt;&gt; [singing]

00:00:36.740 --> 00:01:06.170
&gt;&gt; Female news announcer: A city firefighter
riding to a bike work was hit by a bus this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.180
morning.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.640
39-year-old Matthew Long is in critical condition.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:22.369
&gt;&gt;Mayor Bloomberg on video: His condition
is grave, and I ask you all to pray for him.

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.030
&gt;&gt; Doctor on video: He was basically impaled
by the bicycle seat.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.859
He lost his blood volume -- people would estimate
four to five times over.

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:34.689
So, if we took all the blood out of his body,
gave it back four or five times, that's about

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.149
how much blood he lost in about ten, eleven
hours.

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.479
&gt;&gt; Mike Long on video: They said that it was
serious and that he had about one percent

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.740
chance to survive.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.020
[end of video]

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.490
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Matt, thanks so much for coming.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.329
It's great to have you here at authors at
Google.

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:02.499
For those of you who don't know, this is the
book The Long Run by Matt long with Charles

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:06.140
Butler a great writer from Runner's World.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.750
So, for those of you who don't know your story
-- and I'm guessing most of the folks in this

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.750
room do, but maybe some folks will be seeing
this on YouTube who don't know this story

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.060
-- tell us about those terrible events that
happened all the way back on December 22nd,

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.060
2005.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.950
&gt;&gt; Matt: Well, if you lived in New York in
2005, it was very cold winter.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.810
And it happened to be a time during Christmas
when the city is at its peak for tourists

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.280
and just people shopping and the like.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.390
But the transit authority went on strike.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.390
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Oh, yeah.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.640
I haven't forgotten that.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.320
&gt;&gt; Matt: It was day three of the transit strike
and ironically my last day at my detail at

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.860
the fire academy.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.370
So I had no way to get to work.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.950
Actually, I could have gotten to work but
I couldn't get home if the strike didn't end.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.370
So I rode my bike.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.020
I got four blocks from my New York City apartment.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.100
And a private bus that was hired to bring
their workers down below the restrictions

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.900
that the mayor put in place an illegal right
turn and ran me over.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.270
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Just ran you over.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.270
&gt;&gt; Matt: Ran me over.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.920
Whenever I tell people I was run over by a
bus.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.380
They're like, "Nah, c'mon.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.380
Yeah, you look fine.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.380
You are hit by the bus?

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.830
What happened, it knocked you down?

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.640
" I said, "Look believe it or not, for some
reason, I was not I didn't bounce off the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.640
bus.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.390
I was taken under the chassis of the bus

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.450
&gt;&gt; Presenter: You were basically crushed.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.450
&gt;&gt;Matt: Crushed.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.820
&gt;&gt; Presenter: I'm going to read off some of
the injuries.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.820
This is from your book.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.400
&gt;&gt; Presenter [reading]: compound fracture
of the femur and tibia.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.400
Broken left foot.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.570
Broken right shoulder.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.150
The seat post of your bike it basically ripped
right from between your legs and your body.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.150
&gt;&gt; Matt: Ouch.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.780
Do you have to there?

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.780
[laughter]

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.680
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Even now, it must feel painful.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.440
You've probably heard this story a million
times and it's still painful to say.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.950
Oh, and by the way, you're bleeding to death.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:06.950
&gt;&gt; Matt: Yes.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.110
&gt;&gt; Presenter: And you now have less than 5
percent chance of living, perhaps even just

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.040
a 1 percent chance of living.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.680
&gt;&gt; Presenter : It's really hard to fathom.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.490
It almost doesn't sound real.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.130
You needed 68 units of blood.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.810
&gt;&gt; Matt: In the first ten hours.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.850
&gt;&gt; Presenter: In the first ten hours alone
and the doctor said you were losing four,

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.870
five times your normal amount of blood.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.010
&gt;&gt; Matt: One of the interesting things about
that day.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.320
I think the mind is just incredibly powerful
thing and as soon as I got hit, I don't remember.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.080
&gt;&gt;Presenter: You don't remember any of this,
do you?

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.092
&gt;&gt;Matt: I don't remember any of it because
I think the mind said, "listen if this guy

00:04:41.092 --> 00:04:47.500
is going to survive, he doesn't need to have
that memory because he won't survive mentally."

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.420
So I've gotten told all these stories from
different people that were involved.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:59.100
And one of the stories while I was under the
bus and the police from the ESU and the rescue

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.500
fire department guys were trying to lift the
bus and get me out.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.320
They were having such a hard time doing it
because of my blood.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.941
They were slipping and sliding on my blood
on the street.

00:05:10.941 --> 00:05:19.560
One of the police officers totally broke protocol
and reached into my thigh and held my femoral

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.560
artery shut because it was severed.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.101
And he needed to slow the bleeding down and
he did it with his bare hand which was total

00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:31.330
no no in emergency service protocol; you know
we just don't do that anymore.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.330
You have to be gloved.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.330
You have to be protected.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.600
You have to take care of yourself.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.771
I'm grateful for that guy.

00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:36.771
&gt;&gt;Presenter: And that saved your life.

00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:39.310
&gt;&gt;Matt: That was the first step of saving
my life, for sure.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.830
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Prior to the accident, you're
pretty darn good athlete.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.850
You ran the New York City marathon.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.800
Qualified for the Boston marathon, something
probably less than 1 percent of all athletes

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.930
get to do who take to marathon running.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.480
Had some iron man under your belt.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.139
So another thing that probably saved your
life according to doctors was the fact that

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.450
you were in such amazing shape at this time.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.580
&gt;&gt;Matt: I remember my mom telling me the doctors
came out.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.580
I can't believe.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.010
That would be the worst part about being trauma
doctors going out to the waiting room telling

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.590
the family the person you're working on may
not make it through the night.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:21.280
My mom was told that, the doctors basically
"he has a 1 percent chance to make it through

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.630
the night."

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.070
And my mom said, "Doc, you don't understand.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.120
He's got to make it through the night.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.639
He just qualified for Boston marathon.

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:29.639
He's running in April."

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.960
[laughter] So I think it's that Irish Catholic
stubbornness.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.970
"No, no, no, he's not going anywhere."

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:35.970
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Of course.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.590
And it was that stubbornness, --whether you
were conscious or not--, that probably saved

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.590
you.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:41.590
&gt;&gt; Matt: Yeah.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:42.600
And the doctor said, flat out, once he realized--.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.720
He was a runner, too, my trauma surgeon.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.590
Once he realized that I was that fit to do
a 3:13.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.969
Then maybe there's a better chance that he
could make this.

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:59.400
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So this was a real tough time
for your family, those close to you and whatnot.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.920
They kept by your bedside and saw you through
it.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.620
&gt;&gt;Matt: For five months.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.900
My family -- there was constantly a family
member at the hospital.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.940
There was fire department family at the hospital.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:19.810
And then, my triathlon running group, Asphalt
Green, they were there as well.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:20.870
So it was kind of funny.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:21.870
My family.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.120
We talk about it now because it's funny now.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.860
I'm here.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.430
I don't look too bad without my shirt on.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.120
[laughter] I have an ego they said when they
introduced me.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.289
&gt;&gt; Presenter: That was Murphy.

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:38.669
&gt;&gt; Matt: My family jokes about it now because
the fire department cooked for me for five

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:40.340
months and my family.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.100
I wasn't eating food for two.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.950
But they were cooked for every night.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:49.020
So Monday through Friday, you got chicken
parmesan, spaghetti, pasta.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.580
Everything was large quantities.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.580
Comfort food.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.130
Saturday and Sunday, the triathlon crew came
in and you got vegetables.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.290
[laughter] Healthy foods.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.580
My parents are "this is great; we'll get ready
for Monday night."

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.840
[laughter]

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.820
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Nice. [chuckles] What do you
remember when you woke up?

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.259
What's the first thing that happened when
you woke up from this?

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:10.690
It was almost like being in a coma.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.070
&gt;&gt; Matt: Yeah, I basically was out for like
five or six weeks.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.070
Much like sitting on this stage.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.449
I woke up and there was this big white light
in my eye.

00:08:18.449 --> 00:08:21.699
And I asked, "where am I?"

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:23.990
This is not a PG show?

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.990
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Uh, no.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:25.990
It's ok.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.330
&gt;&gt;Matt: I tell you what my first word was.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.330
My first word was, "Fuck.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.330
I'm hungry."

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.330
[laughter]

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.849
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Firemen don't like eating, do
they?

00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:33.849
[laughter]

00:08:33.849 --> 00:08:36.360
&gt;&gt; Matt: And my dad looked at the nurse and
apologized.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.960
[laughter]And then said I think he might make
it.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.070
So that was his story for me to tell me that
was my first words.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:50.840
My first memory was my brother, Jim, coming
and telling me that I was, you know, run over

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.930
by a bus and I kind of looked at him like
-- but I really couldn't move that well.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:09:01.220
And I was in the bed and I had a stabilizer,
an external fixator coming out of my abdomen

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.240
and my legs.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.770
I was just looking around grabbing this metal.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.970
He's like, "you know sit tight.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.020
You're going to be okay.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.020
They're taking care of you."

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.880
I was, "like nah nah when can I go home?"

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.370
And that was my first question.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.370
"When can I go home?"

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.689
They were just like, "You're going to be here
quite a while."

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:22.649
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Before the accident, if I can
say, you were kind of like the single guy

00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:26.440
Manhattan, bit of a lady's man.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.440
In shape.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.279
[laughter] You own a couple bars.

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:30.279
You're living the life.

00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:35.160
And now you wake up from this accident; you
literally couldn't move.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.930
So that was I'm sure really really tough for
your psyche not just the physical pain.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:44.580
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yeah, I mean, my life was turned upside
down.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.100
And I was, I guess, the consummate bachelor,
I guess you want to call it.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.100
I had three bars.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.100
I was firefighter.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.449
&gt;&gt; Presenter: You were living the life.

00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:54.610
&gt;&gt; Matt: Living the life.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:59.190
[laughter] If I was an overnight guest, I
didn't have to get up early and leave.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.190
I didn't work a regular schedule.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:01.190
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Nothin' wrong with that.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.190
&gt;&gt;Matt: Make the bed.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.190
Make breakfast.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.970
Go ahead, honey.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.759
[laughter] That happened once in awhile.

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:07.759
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Never.

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:09.071
Your parents going to be watching this?

00:10:09.071 --> 00:10:10.071
This is definitely not a PG talk

00:10:10.071 --> 00:10:11.620
&gt;&gt; Matt: They don't know how to get on YouTube
[laughter]

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.500
&gt;&gt; Matt: My father said, "what's Google by
the way?"

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.520
&gt;&gt;Presenter: He did?

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.210
&gt;&gt;Matt: He said "what's Google?"

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.570
I said, "Nah, Talk to you later"

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:20.570
[laughter]

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.380
&gt;&gt; Presenter: You're going to tell them about
this later?

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.130
Can we set him up with like a Google Plus
account or something?

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:26.550
It'd be great.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.550
&gt;&gt; Matt: AARP?

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.370
Do you have that with Google?

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.370
All right.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.730
We'll work that out.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.279
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So fast forward a bit.

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:35.370
Rehab, recovery.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:40.700
How many surgeries did you need just to live
just to sort of get yourself out of the hospital?

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:46.990
&gt;&gt; Matt: In 14 months I went through 42 different
surgeries.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:53.230
It was kind of -- you know, I remember like
later on after leaving the hospital I think

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.649
the count was up to like 33.

00:10:55.649 --> 00:10:59.839
And I knew I had three more surgeries to come.

00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:03.100
And every time I went into the operating room.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.100
You sign.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.950
You go in and they prep you for surgery and
you sign your releases.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.440
And I remember one not so funny moment.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.770
I was just so frustrated.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.160
Get deeper and deeper into depression.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.540
When they came to sign the release I wrote
DNR on it.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.279
And the nurse was like, "No, no that's not
what we want."

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:21.279
And my mother's like "What are you doing?"

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:23.670
Had to get another release and sign it.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.200
There was always two releases.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.840
This is the release for what we hope will
happen when we open up.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.709
And this is the worst case scenario, what
we might do and then there will be another

00:11:33.709 --> 00:11:34.709
surgery.

00:11:34.709 --> 00:11:37.240
And every time I went in, I'd wake up.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.430
I'd feel another hose or connection to my
body.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.430
. This didn't happen.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.990
So I got to come back.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.779
So 42 surgeries in about 14 months.

00:11:44.779 --> 00:11:46.260
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Wow.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.260
Wow.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.570
So just to be the able to walk and be released
from the hospital was a very lengthy process.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.459
&gt;&gt; Matt: Yeah, when I left the hospital, I
was walking maybe 50 feet.

00:11:54.459 --> 00:11:56.130
And not unassisted.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:01.800
I was on those Canadian crutches you saw in
the video.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.970
Pretty much in and out of a wheelchair.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.360
My younger brother, who I call Number 9.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.899
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Meaning you have a family of
nine kids.

00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:12.200
&gt;&gt; Matt: Nine kids; 7 boys and 2 girls.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.600
It's funny when you look at a family picture.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.910
It starts off pretty tall and number 9 is
is a little short.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:23.839
It was he was the fastest long but he didn't
get a lot of food, on Friday nights there.

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:26.529
[laughter] The little duckling gets kicked
out.

00:12:26.529 --> 00:12:29.670
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So you're out of the hospital.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.370
You're trying to re-acclimate to life.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:36.950
And it was obviously a tough time as you just
said.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:41.890
In fact, I remember there was a -- we're both
graduates of Iona college.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:46.490
And every year Iona sponsors a wonderful race
called the Dolan Run in honor of a friend

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:49.680
of yours, Kenny Dolan.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.480
I remember seeing you in previous years.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:56.279
Actually, let me clarify I remember seeing
the back of your NYPD or FDNY jersey as you

00:12:56.279 --> 00:12:58.180
passed me on your way to the finish line.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.480
&gt;&gt; Matt: Thanks for clarifying.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.920
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Of course, of course.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:07.399
2006, you're there but you're in a wheelchair.

00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:09.010
You didn't even look like yourself.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.140
I remember that.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.410
There was a great band there and they played--.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:13.850
There was this--.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:17.209
"Long May You Run", I think, and they played
that in honor of you.

00:13:17.209 --> 00:13:18.300
&gt;&gt;Matt: Neil Young.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.769
"Long May You Run".

00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:21.589
It's Hell or High Water.

00:13:21.589 --> 00:13:23.220
They've been friends of mine for years.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:29.630
And they donate their time for that race every
year and that race is probably 18 years now.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.200
&gt;&gt; Presenter: In the book, you describe saying,
maybe to your brother or a buddy of yours,

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.149
you said you didn't have the heart to be there.

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.760
It just wasn't you.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.589
In previous years you would have been up there
maybe accepting a prize for winning your age

00:13:41.589 --> 00:13:45.310
group or something along those lines and then
maybe having a beer and a burger after listening

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.310
to the band.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.660
You just wanted to get out of there.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.970
&gt;&gt;Matt: I did.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.000
I remember my brother called me up saying,
"Hey, today's the Dolan Run."

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.890
And I was only out of the hospital--, it's
the first Sunday in June at Prospect Park.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:01.480
I'm out of the hospital two weeks.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.480
I got out May twenty-second.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.160
Two or Three weeks, I said, "yeah, you know,
let's go.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.290
Let's see what happens."

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.860
Because the Dolan family was great to me.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.980
And I just thought it would be good to show
up.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:23.260
When they wheeled me into the -- after party
for the race, listen to them play the song.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.170
I was just like I got to get out of here.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:27.170
I just wanted to be involved.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:28.460
&gt;&gt; Presenter: And that was kind of a theme
in your life.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.930
It was hard to be out socially be out with
your usual group of friends.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:37.610
&gt;&gt; Matt: You know, probably -- obviously,
you're in the hospital five months, you're

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:43.339
not a happy person and no one was really faulting
me for not being myself.

00:14:43.339 --> 00:14:50.390
But it wasn't until I got home and there was
not that bell at the side of the bed when

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.830
I need something from a nurse.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:57.000
Now, it's about "this is your life."

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.420
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So you were depressed.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.569
Majorly depressed.

00:15:00.569 --> 00:15:02.009
&gt;&gt; Matt: And getting worse.

00:15:02.009 --> 00:15:03.920
&gt;&gt; Presenter: And who brought you out of it.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.860
&gt;&gt; Matt: Mom.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:11.870
I went in for a doctor's appointment and you
know at this point in my life I was making

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.230
deals with God.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:16.500
I was constantly just fix this.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.380
Just take care of this and I'll deal with
the limp and I'll deal with a cane.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.450
I'll get through.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.550
Just give me this one thing.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:28.019
And when I went to this doctor's appointment
the doctor said to me, "Mr. Long I don't think

00:15:28.019 --> 00:15:32.269
we're going to be able to help you.

00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:35.430
You just had too much muscle damage and nerve
damage."

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.910
So we left.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:41.480
And I just talked to my mom and dad.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:47.381
Listen I'm so glad that you guys prayed for
me and your prayers were answered and I lived.

00:15:47.381 --> 00:15:51.019
But I wish you would have prayed for me to
die.

00:15:51.019 --> 00:15:55.520
&gt;&gt;Presenter: That must be so hard for a mom
for a son to say something like that.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.050
&gt;&gt; Matt: You never want to say that to your
mom.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.050
I was crying.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:01.050
She was crying.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.380
And I expected her to reach across the table
and hug me, you know "This is when you hug

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.380
me; I need you right now".

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.870
I'm hitting the button for the nurse; hey,
where's the nurse And she just put her hands

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:14.320
down on the table and said, "enough is enough."

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.750
She said, "you know, you have to think about
all the things you've done before this accident

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:25.049
and you need to pick up the pieces and live
your life the best you can."

00:16:25.049 --> 00:16:27.590
&gt;&gt; Presenter: It's tough love at a time when
you needed it the most.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:32.920
&gt;&gt; Matt: I was just like, you know, I was
so taken aback.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.390
She just basically said if you're going to
do this; if you're gonna be a miserable SOB

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.910
for the rest of your life, do it by yourself.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:40.450
Leave us out.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.000
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Smart woman

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.139
&gt;&gt;Matt: That jump start the whole train..

00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:52.360
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So at this point you say to
yourself all right I want to be an athlete

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.360
again.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:59.350
And you went through a lengthy additional
rehab recovery process, went to Arizona, worked

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.470
with some great trainers out there.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:05.130
Tell us what it was like just to be able to
run one mile.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:09.459
This is a guy who could run a marathon in
well under 3 hours and 15 minutes before now

00:17:09.459 --> 00:17:12.589
you're struggle to run just one mile.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:17.880
&gt;&gt;Matt: What really happened is I didn't say
I wanted to be an athlete again.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.429
I started to say I will be an athlete again.

00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:25.319
That's when the training kicked in and I went
to Arizona.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:26.319
I was e-mailing.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.530
I wanted to get away from New York, that was
the first thing.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:29.760
Mentally, I need to be out of here.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.920
I talked to my friend, Frank Carino.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.660
I talked to my friend, Noel Flynn.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.450
I was like, "I hope you guys don't mind.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:39.630
I hope this isn't like I'm bailing out on
my support system, but I need a change in

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:40.630
scenery."

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.080
I need to forget about everything.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.850
Even the homeless guy outside Starbucks.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.090
When I'd walk with my crutches, he'd say "hey
you're the bus guy".

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:50.270
And I was like everyone knows me.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.549
I need to get out of New York.

00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:53.650
&gt;&gt; Presenter: And the sunshine helps.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:54.710
&gt;&gt; Matt: And the sunshine helps, yeah.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.620
So I e-mailed a couple of warm weather facilities.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:04.130
A couple people e-mailed me back saying amazing
story; you've been through so much.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:08.430
We'd help you but you should have realistic
expectations.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:14.350
And I was like, "how can this person tell
me to have a realistic expectation without

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.179
even seeing me or knowing me."

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:20.140
So I was just delete, delete.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.419
And then I found via Google.

00:18:22.419 --> 00:18:23.419
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Of course.

00:18:23.419 --> 00:18:24.660
[audience chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Matt: You know?

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.890
How else would you search the web.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.059
I found the place called the Functional Performance
Center in Tempe.

00:18:31.059 --> 00:18:32.059
Very small.

00:18:32.059 --> 00:18:36.240
Smaller than this room and a young guy who
went to Iowa.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.140
Either Iowa or Iowa State, I'm not sure.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.140
He e-mailed me back.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.140
He was a runner.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.340
He said, "First of all, I would never tell
anyone they couldn't run again."

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.140
&gt;&gt;Presenter: And that's what you needed to
hear, I'm sure.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.549
&gt;&gt;Matt: I moved down there three days later.

00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:50.380
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Wow
&gt;&gt;Matt: Frank Carino had just had his second

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.970
child.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.830
I haven't flown since my accident.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:54.830
I don't know what to expect.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:55.830
I need help.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:56.830
He came with me.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:57.830
Got an apartment.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.010
And I lived there three months.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:04.190
The first day I said how is all this going
to help me run.

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.910
He said well, let's strengthen your body and
one day we're just gonna do it.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:13.620
After three months, I went in and they were
like "let's go; today's the day".

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.980
And I was scared.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.720
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Probably scared you were going
to topple right over.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.830
&gt;&gt; Matt: Topple right over.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.380
It was like oh, you didn't prep me for this.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.679
Last night I could have been thinking about
it.

00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:29.670
If you're doing an endurance race, the night
before you visualize your race.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:30.670
What can go wrong?

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.900
How am I gonna fix it.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.920
I didn't have any visualization for a mile.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.920
And we did it.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:40.490
We did it in 18 minutes, 24 seconds I think.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.840
And we stopped at the half mile turn around
point.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.260
I was like okay.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.840
Then we tried to work on my gait a little
more.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.820
When I finished, we went into therapy.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:56.110
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So, in a lot of ways, the same
way you had to learn to be a good endurance

00:19:56.110 --> 00:20:00.460
athlete the first time around, you had to
learn it a second time, really.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:07.120
&gt;&gt; Matt: Yeah, I dig the mechanics of running
-- things you take for granted.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.160
When was the last time you got out of your
chair and thought about walking?

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.050
We just do it.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:15.080
And I had to do that.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.130
I had to think about even taking a step.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.130
And it's very, very odd..

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.750
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So now you've completed one
step in your recovery.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:27.070
You've actually successfully gone for a run,
maybe a few runs.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:30.010
Now, you tell your doctors I want to run in
the New York City marathon.

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.769
What do they say?

00:20:31.769 --> 00:20:36.100
&gt;&gt; Matt: One doctor said I'm crazy but then
he said all you guys are crazy.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:41.130
[laughter] Why would you want to run a marathon?

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:46.710
They didn't tell me not to try, but they said
I would tear myself up pretty good.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.330
And I said, "I needed it."

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:51.330
You know?

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:52.440
I needed it for my head.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.990
I needed it for the mental recovery.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:21:01.730
You know, I just needed to see that finish
line to know that this was -- a part of my

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:08.049
life that will never, ever be behind me because
of how I am now but the come back is over.

00:21:08.049 --> 00:21:09.049
I'm here.

00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:10.049
Like that kind of thing.

00:21:10.049 --> 00:21:11.049
&gt;&gt; Presenter: You wanted your life back.

00:21:11.049 --> 00:21:12.049
&gt;&gt; Matt: I wanted my life back.

00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:15.760
&gt;&gt; Presenter: And running, one of the biggest
-- along with your family-- probably one of

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.559
the the biggest your past and your present
life.

00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:20.559
&gt;&gt; Matt: Absolutely.

00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:25.590
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Tell us about marathon day when
you finally came back.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:29.110
&gt;&gt;Matt: My -- so I had the fire department
drive me to the start.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:33.270
I got a 3 hour head start with the Achilles
Track Club.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.320
I got a great story about the start of the
marathon.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.660
They picked us up in a van, myself, Noel,
and Frank 'cause I had 2 buddies.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.520
I figured 40,000 runners are going to be coming
from behind me.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.929
Maybe I just need two people to make them
go wider.

00:21:47.929 --> 00:21:49.080
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Why not?

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.770
I mean Lance Armstrong had it.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:51.980
&gt;&gt;Matt: He had about 8.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.140
[whispers] Sissy.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:57.000
[regular voice] I'm sorry [laughter] That's
later in the book.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.059
Later in the book we get to Lance

00:21:59.059 --> 00:22:00.620
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Actually, let's pause one second.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:05.161
You got to meet Lance Armstrong after you
-- little bit after you -- about a year after

00:22:05.161 --> 00:22:06.679
you had gotten hurt.

00:22:06.679 --> 00:22:09.370
Can you share that story real quick?

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.390
I love that story.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.600
&gt;&gt;Matt: Obviously the marathon a big part
of my day.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.840
This weekend, the energy level is so great.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:20.060
So the guys in the fire department thought
it would be great to take me to the 2006 start.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.060
So they pick me up.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.080
I was still in a wheelchair part-time.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.170
But I went with my crutches and Lance was
running.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:30.870
It was his premier marathon.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:36.900
And they got me to the start and they kept
tapping one of Lance's entourage on the shoulder

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.900
saying "hey, you got a minute?

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.900
Can Lance say hello.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.539
This guy got hurt on his bike; he got hit
by a bus".

00:22:43.539 --> 00:22:46.670
Lance had his sweat suit on.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.350
Ipod in his ear.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.200
He's just getting tuned into the race.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.470
Meanwhile all the pros are kind of on the
line in their shorts and tank tops freezing,

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.500
but Lance had his swim jacket on.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.230
Two minutes, Lance, and another piece came
off and he's getting ready.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.230
So they begged him.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:04.750
My boss is a big Italian guy.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.000
He says, "Aw, screw this".

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.049
He pushes on of Lance's guys and says "hey
Lance.

00:23:08.049 --> 00:23:09.049
Get over here.

00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:10.049
Talk to this guy."

00:23:10.049 --> 00:23:11.049
[laughter] So he comes over to me.

00:23:11.049 --> 00:23:12.740
And I said, "Lance c'mon.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.260
They gave you 50 percent chance.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.580
They gave me 1.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.500
You got a minute?"

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.760
[laughter] At that moment he was taking his
thing off, "what'd you say"?

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.760
And I got the picture.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.840
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So that really got his attention.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.160
&gt;&gt;Matt: That got his attention.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.250
In his books and when people talk about him,
people say you can't break his face.

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:30.309
I broke him.

00:23:30.309 --> 00:23:32.540
[laughter] I knew I got him right there..

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.260
&gt;&gt;Presenter: You can take some credit for
him breaking three hours.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.260
Barely

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.260
&gt;&gt; Matt: Barely.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.260
I think he did 2:58.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:39.260
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Right around there.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.700
&gt;&gt;Matt: He doesn't have to get his own water.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.470
[laughter] They were handing him water.

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:44.470
&gt;&gt;Presenter: That's true.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:45.700
He got the star treatment.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:46.700
&gt;&gt;Matt: C'mon.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.700
Like Alberto Salazar.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:48.700
&gt;&gt;Can't get a better pacer than that.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.520
&gt;&gt;Matt: If he'd got me my water when I was
running, I would have went well under 3:13.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.520
[laughter]

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.309
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Two years later you're doing
this.

00:23:55.309 --> 00:23:56.490
You're running the race.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:00.429
You got your buddies along with you to ensure
your safety.

00:24:00.429 --> 00:24:02.340
You get to mile 3 and your family is there.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.490
What was that like.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:04.690
&gt;&gt; Matt: Let me go back.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:06.120
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Oh sorry.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.960
&gt;&gt;Matt: [laughter] Is this my interview or
yours?

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.020
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I'm pretty sure the book is by
Matt Long.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.880
&gt;&gt;Matt: I don't know this was going to be
a comedy set but this is pretty good.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.809
Let me go back to mile 1 because this is a
great story in the book.

00:24:15.809 --> 00:24:18.360
My buddy, Frank Carino, is next to me.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.330
The cannon goes off; they wish us well.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.730
There's about 35 challenged athletes.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:29.120
Single leg, double leg, single arm, maybe
a blind runner and boom, cannon goes and off

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.120
we go.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.370
The first mile is uphill.

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.140
And I'm looking in front.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:39.610
I'm like about 29 athletes just crested the
and I'm back with Frank and Noel.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:42.150
Am I in last place?

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.150
Already?

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.490
Like we're not even at mile one.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:46.490
[laughter]

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:47.490
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Wow

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:50.580
&gt;&gt;Matt: And I can't really turn; my balance
is really off.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.340
So I'm like, Frank, serious, just tell me,
am I in last place?

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.600
."Matt, don't worry about it.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.600
Keep going.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.400
We've got a long day ahead of us."

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.970
"Frank just turn around and tell me if I'm
in last place."

00:24:58.970 --> 00:24:59.970
Now we're bickering.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.010
He's like my man wife.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.159
[laughter] We're fighting there right on mile
one.

00:25:04.159 --> 00:25:07.070
He turns around and he goes, "Matt you are
not in last place."

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:08.070
"Great.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.070
Let's go."

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:10.070
So we got our pace we're going.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:15.250
All of a sudden I hear this clicking noise.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.890
It's getting louder and louder.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:18.220
What's that?

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.890
Frank's like, "Oh no".

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:25.720
[laughter] He knew what he saw when he turned
around and this Japanese runner, double leg

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:32.210
amputee just swinging himself on the crutches
that I was using just six months ago to walk,

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:33.750
passes me.

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.429
Frank goes, "now you're in last place."

00:25:36.429 --> 00:25:40.200
[laughter] I'm like, "it's going to be a long
day."

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.080
That was mile 1.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.179
Mile 3 is when I had my first stop plan.

00:25:46.179 --> 00:25:51.070
I said to my family -- I said this when I
did a 3:13.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.450
You guys can really come out and be on the
marathon course.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.740
It would be great to see you but please know
I'm trying to qualify for the Boston and if

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:01.080
I run by you at 7 minutes pace, don't be mad
that I didn't stop to say hello and you've

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.870
been freezing waiting for me to come by.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:03.870
I'm just not doing it.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:07.360
In this race, I knew I'd be out there for
about 8 hours.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.690
You're going to be at multiple spots.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:13.400
Mile 3 is the only time I'm stopping.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.710
They were outside the church where I grew
up in Brooklyn; the whole family.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:18.870
So I stopped.

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:21.679
Got rid of whatever I did after warming up
for three miles.

00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:27.020
Got rid of a shirt or something went on my
way and it was great to see them out there.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.670
&gt;&gt; Presenter: But you still had 23 miles ahead
of you.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:30.670
&gt;&gt; Matt: 23.2.

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:33.600
&gt;&gt; Presenter: 23.2 to be exact.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:39.110
Obviously, this took a great deal of mental
will.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.980
Physical strength just to get through it.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.429
Just to -- not knowing if you might not finish.

00:26:43.429 --> 00:26:49.410
Not knowing if you might fall over but you
did it And it took you what, about 7 hours?

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:50.730
&gt;&gt;Matt: 7:21.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:53.380
7 hours 21 minutes.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:58.020
You're allowed to clap.
[laughter and applause]

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.159
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Probably a wonderful day for
you.

00:27:01.159 --> 00:27:04.520
Wonderful step in your recovery, but this
wasn't enough.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.520
You weren't done.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.850
You still had another act.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:09.809
What did you tackle next as an endurance athlete?

00:27:09.809 --> 00:27:11.030
&gt;&gt; Matt: I wanted to become the Ironman again.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:12.030
man again.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.030
I wanted to hear Mike Reilly say "you're the
man again.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:14.030
I wanted to hear mike say you're the an again.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:19.110
I wanted to hear mike say you're the again.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.110
I wanted to hear mike say you're the Ironman"
again.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:24.450
I didn't know how I was going to do it because
running hurt.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.430
Not that it doesn't hurt anyone that does
it.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.550
It just hurt me a hell of a lot more.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:33.560
And basically during my training for the marathon
I only got up to 14 miles.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.750
Frank and Noel had run that.

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:38.240
Frank and Noel are both sub three hour marathoners.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:43.840
So to ask a guy who can run a 3 hour marathon
to run for 7.5 or 8 hours, it takes a lot

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:48.140
out of a person.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:54.600
I said to them, "you know, if I run three
miles in Central Park takes me 45 minutes

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.429
and then I can't do anything for two more
days.

00:27:57.429 --> 00:28:03.460
So how am I going to train for 140.6 mile
day as an Ironman.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.970
So I just switched it and did it all on the
bike.

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:10.929
250-300 miles on the bike and maybe a mile
on Saturday.

00:28:10.929 --> 00:28:15.049
And then you know, but I knew.

00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:20.560
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Was it hard to ride a bike after
what you'd been through?

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.159
&gt;&gt; Matt: Yeah.

00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:25.450
You know, I had two choices.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:29.090
I had a bike custom made for me because I
had a leg length difference.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:33.120
Some weaknesses so balance was an issue.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.470
So I went to this guy, Paul Levine at Signature
Cycles and he built me a bike.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.510
When he called me and told me it was ready.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.309
I was sitting in my apartment.

00:28:42.309 --> 00:28:45.060
You know, now I have a bike.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.260
It's always this big thought.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.940
I'm going to run a marathon do this.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.110
I have a bike now I just have to go get it.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:57.440
So I got in my car and I said if I go over
to the west side to pick up the bike and put

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:01.060
it in my car, I'm going to look at it in my
apartment for a couple days.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:05.850
Instead I got dressed to cycle and hailed
a cab.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:07.900
So I was forced to get on the bike.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:12.039
And I went like corner to corner looking.

00:29:12.039 --> 00:29:14.109
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Real gingerly.

00:29:14.109 --> 00:29:16.180
&gt;&gt; Matt: It was mentally tough.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:21.309
The toughest part about it was when a bus
went by and I'd be standing on the corner

00:29:21.309 --> 00:29:27.670
looking at that 8-inch space between the chassis
and the street and go how the hell did I get

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:28.670
under there?

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:33.670
Then I look at the scar under my stomach and
I know how I got under there, they stuffed

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:34.670
me.

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.270
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So just to ride through New
York City streets.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:38.909
&gt;&gt; Matt: I road through the streets.

00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:39.909
Got into Central Park.

00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:42.020
Took one lap and went home.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.409
I knew I had a lot of work ahead of me because
I was exhausted.

00:29:44.409 --> 00:29:49.159
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So for those of you who aren't
familiar with the Ironman distance, it's 2.4

00:29:49.159 --> 00:29:50.320
mile swim.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.980
112 mile bike ride followed by a full marathon.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.279
So this was what?

00:29:54.279 --> 00:29:55.279
2009?

00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:56.279
Back in Lake Placid.

00:29:56.279 --> 00:29:57.279
&gt;&gt; Matt: 2009.

00:29:57.279 --> 00:29:58.279
Lake Placid.

00:29:58.279 --> 00:29:59.279
And you have 17 hours to finish.

00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:04.980
17 hours and 1 second, they pat you on the
back and say "come back next year".

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.059
No medal; no t-shirt.

00:30:06.059 --> 00:30:07.609
&gt;&gt; Presenter: One second off, you're not an
Ironman.

00:30:07.609 --> 00:30:09.800
&gt;&gt; Matt: That's why it's called Ironman.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.960
Firm believer that it's ok to have a cut off.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:20.159
I didn't think I would be anywhere near 17
hours.

00:30:20.159 --> 00:30:22.080
I thought I would be 15, 16 hours.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:29.490
I was 12 minutes slower on my swim; about
a half hour slower on my bike.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:33.340
I knew I had a long day ahead of me in the
marathon because I only did a 7:21 in New

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.340
York.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:38.220
There's all sorts of people going around "well,
if you could do a 3 hour marathon then you

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.770
should be able to do a 3:30, 3:35, 3:40 in
the Ironman."

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:45.750
There's a lot of different equations you can
mentally put together for yourself.

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:53.249
I wound up running 7 hours and 30 minutes
and finished in 16:58:06.

00:30:53.249 --> 00:30:56.080
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Just made it.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.080
&gt;&gt; [Applause].

00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:03.360
&gt;&gt; Matt: Best part about it, they were giving
me my medal.

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.820
They wanted to interview me and they started
saying "Wait, wait, there's one more out there."

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.440
And at 17 hours on the button, this guy comes
in.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.690
He'll be forever known as Last Man Paul.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:12.690
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Last Man Paul.

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:13.690
I love it.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:15.299
&gt;&gt;Matt: And he comes in give and they go,
"Give him his medal; give him his medal.

00:31:15.299 --> 00:31:16.330
This is unbelievable."

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:18.630
Because I was the guy they were following
with the camera all day.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:23.570
And they were like, at mile 23 the guy from
Ironman came out and said, "Matt, I'm JD from

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:24.570
Ironman.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:25.570
I'm here to make sure you get in".

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:26.570
He had GPS.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:28.179
He could tell me how fast I had to run at
this moment.

00:31:28.179 --> 00:31:31.020
So I was the everyday hero.

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:35.020
So I said to JD, I said, "JD have you ever
had a hero go to zero in less than 17 hours?

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.380
[laughter] He said, "nope".

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.760
I don't want to be the first.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.779
Let's get moving."

00:31:39.779 --> 00:31:41.130
&gt;&gt;Presenter: He's your motivation.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:42.700
&gt;&gt;Matt: So Last Man Paul finishes.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.820
I put the medal over his neck and I say, "What
happened to you?

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:46.820
He said, "what?"

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:47.830
I said, "what happened to you?"

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:51.130
He said, "what are you talking about?"

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:55.000
[laughter] He's just been out there 17 hours
and he's confused.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.260
"I just got run over by a bus.

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.700
What happened to you?"

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.529
He's like nothing.

00:32:01.529 --> 00:32:03.030
[laughter] I was like "yes."

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:06.809
I was afraid maybe he'd say double decker
bus.

00:32:06.809 --> 00:32:09.841
The cameras would go right off of him.

00:32:09.841 --> 00:32:11.430
I would be here, Paul would be

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:15.610
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Go to YouTube and just type
in Matt Long Lake Placid.

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:17.820
A really cool clip comes up.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.200
It's grainy; it's a little wobbly.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.960
The noise is deafening from the crowd.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.730
You'll have to turn your speakers way down.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:25.190
It's a really inspiring clip.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:26.429
You can see Matt finish.

00:32:26.429 --> 00:32:30.500
&gt;&gt; Matt: That's my brother, Frank, screaming,
"Love you!"

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.500
[laughter]

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.669
&gt;&gt; Presenter: And then you do see last man
Paul just before the clip ends.

00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:36.730
It's pretty cool..

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:42.610
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Speaking of YouTube, how have
you been able to, you know, utilize technology,

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:50.530
social media, to sort of, you know, really
get the word out about you and about your

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:52.210
cause -- the I Will foundation?

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:59.549
&gt;&gt;Matt: You know, I'll tell you a story about
my -- one of my, I guess, mentors who helped

00:32:59.549 --> 00:33:01.710
me recover.

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:07.020
When I was home in my apartment and wasn't
able to get around by myself.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.250
My brother Eddy Number 9.

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:10.679
I was trying to give him his space.

00:33:10.679 --> 00:33:12.220
Get out.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.720
I had a big box of cards and letters that
I got written to me.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.039
Give me that box.

00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:18.390
Put it by the couch.

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:20.350
I'm going to start reading some of these.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:23.120
You go out for the day.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:28.809
And when I opened up one of the cards a newspaper
article slid out and kind of went away from

00:33:28.809 --> 00:33:30.000
me so I couldn't reach it.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.340
And I went through and through and through.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.140
Later when my brother comes home, I said,
"Hey give me that article" but now I have

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.400
no idea who sent it to me.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:40.549
I read this article about a gentleman cyclist
in Massachusetts six years prior to my accident.

00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:42.580
But a mirror image.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:48.240
By reading his, you can just put my name where
his name was same broken bones.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.809
He's from Massachusetts.

00:33:49.809 --> 00:33:52.110
I'm from New York so I trumped him a little
bit.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.490
[laughter] He had 17 surgeries, I had 42.

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:57.160
He spent 3 months in the hospital, I spent
5.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.440
He got 20 units of blood, I got 69.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.990
I got you a little bit.

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:06.740
[laughter] But through the Internet, I found
this guy.

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:09.649
You know, this is a 6-year-old article.

00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:13.539
And I just went crazy on Google.

00:34:13.539 --> 00:34:18.119
Putting his name in taking that article apart
his doctors, where he worked I called the

00:34:18.119 --> 00:34:21.000
bike shop he worked at 15 years ago.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.729
Yeah, we know him.

00:34:22.729 --> 00:34:24.859
He's still in the area.

00:34:24.859 --> 00:34:30.270
I go I'm going to send you a link to who I
am because I don't want you to think I'm crazy.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:33.829
And I would never give out someone's phone
number to a stranger.

00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:35.929
I'm going to send you a link.

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:40.579
Can you read it and realize the urgency why
I need to speak to this man.

00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:43.389
We have never met in person still to this
day.

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:44.419
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Complete strangers.

00:34:44.419 --> 00:34:47.500
&gt;&gt;Matt: We e-mail; we talked on the phone.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.809
And I said to him.

00:34:48.809 --> 00:34:55.509
His name is Fabio Selvig.

00:34:55.509 --> 00:35:00.459
You helped me and I'll do my best to help
others.

00:35:00.459 --> 00:35:01.459
I need you.

00:35:01.459 --> 00:35:02.720
Like you've been there.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.599
No one else could come into my house and say
"hey, I was hit by a bus last week and I'm

00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:07.749
doing jumpin' jacks now".

00:35:07.749 --> 00:35:09.029
He was back to cycling.

00:35:09.029 --> 00:35:10.029
Back to living his life.

00:35:10.029 --> 00:35:12.910
He was married with kids.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.079
Happy.

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:17.799
He basically said to me all the best things
in his life happened after his accident.

00:35:17.799 --> 00:35:19.170
And that was like my light.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:20.609
All right.

00:35:20.609 --> 00:35:22.769
This is great.

00:35:22.769 --> 00:35:23.769
So he did.

00:35:23.769 --> 00:35:29.869
He helped me and then once it was over, I
said I need to be more accessible.

00:35:29.869 --> 00:35:34.660
I can't take two or three days on the Internet
to find Fabio or the next person doesn't need

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:35.660
to do that for me.

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.599
So I started the I Will Foundation.

00:35:37.599 --> 00:35:39.170
And I put it on the Internet.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:43.069
And I just figured that it would be an inspiring
story.

00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:44.499
Hey, I'm having a tough time.

00:35:44.499 --> 00:35:45.839
I got hurt and this and that.

00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:46.839
I found this guy.

00:35:46.839 --> 00:35:47.839
He did it I could do it.

00:35:47.839 --> 00:35:49.109
Then it just turned into bigger.

00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:50.509
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So you started the Foundation.

00:35:50.509 --> 00:35:55.690
Tell us about what sort of folks benefit from
the I Will Foundation?

00:35:55.690 --> 00:36:01.430
&gt;&gt; Matt: Our mission is to help people who
have suffered life altering illnesses or traumatic

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.509
injury like myself.

00:36:04.509 --> 00:36:08.089
We want to help them get back into life.

00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:09.369
You don't have to be an Ironman.

00:36:09.369 --> 00:36:10.869
You don't have to be a marathon runner.

00:36:10.869 --> 00:36:16.420
But just live your life -- not feel like you're
secluded like I felt those months when I was

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:19.960
depressed.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:24.420
The first girl we helped -- well, the first
guy I ran the Ironman for was John Gleeson;

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.000
he lived on Long Island.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.230
Cyclist; hit by a car.

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:32.479
After 120 mile bike ride, finished with two
of his buddies and all he had to do is cross

00:36:32.479 --> 00:36:35.970
the street and a car plowed him when he was
crossing the street.

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:40.259
And he's got a phenomenal attitude John.

00:36:40.259 --> 00:36:42.249
Had some complications.

00:36:42.249 --> 00:36:43.380
We helped him with equipment.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.380
We helped him with training.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:48.709
we sent him to California for an aggressive
stroke rehabilitation plan.

00:36:48.709 --> 00:36:53.190
Because he had a stroke during one of his
surgeries.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:56.140
He ran a 5k without telling anyone last week.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:58.430
He called me up and told me "I just ran my
first 5k".

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:00.739
He didn't care about the time.

00:37:00.739 --> 00:37:03.140
He and his wife side by side.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:04.140
We helped him.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:10.079
He helped the girl who had a stroke at 33
years old become an Ironman She was a national

00:37:10.079 --> 00:37:14.759
ranked swimmer and they told her she couldn't
swim anymore because she couldn't turn her

00:37:14.759 --> 00:37:16.489
neck.

00:37:16.489 --> 00:37:20.829
Within a year of having the stroke, she did
an Ironman in 11 hours 30 minutes.

00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:24.289
And now we're helping a guy, a phenomenal
guy, you'll see all over Youtube as well.

00:37:24.289 --> 00:37:29.910
After I did the Ironman, the bike company,
they were so impressed they made another bike

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:30.910
for me.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:35.700
And I wish I would have had it at the Ironman
because all modern technology, electronic

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.700
gear shift.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:37.700
This is great.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.829
So I shipped the bike to Florida for a training
trip with some of my friends.

00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:43.079
The bike shop down there says you got to meet
this guy, Hector.

00:37:43.079 --> 00:37:44.079
They knew my story.

00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:50.680
And I met a guy who about 15 years ago was
electrocuted.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.859
Blew both of his arms off; one at the elbow,
one at the shoulder.

00:37:54.859 --> 00:38:00.480
And he modified his own mountain bike and
would be able to brake with his knee.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:05.099
But he couldn't change gears -- no hands.

00:38:05.099 --> 00:38:08.220
So I brought him up to New York with the foundation.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.710
And we had Paul from Signature build him a
bike.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:17.469
And he puts the stump of his elbow which is
just a big muscle mass now.

00:38:17.469 --> 00:38:22.809
He has so much control of the muscle he can
hit the buttons to change gears and he's cruising

00:38:22.809 --> 00:38:24.760
by people on the bike now at the races.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:29.770
He's going to do the first Ironman in New
York next year.

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:31.319
That's part of what we're doing.

00:38:31.319 --> 00:38:32.319
&gt;&gt; Presenter: That's fantastic.

00:38:32.319 --> 00:38:36.400
You're really starting to see the fruits of
your labor with the I Will Foundation in action.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:41.479
&gt;&gt; Matt: You know, what I'm really -- I know
really why this accident happened to me after

00:38:41.479 --> 00:38:42.479
years.

00:38:42.479 --> 00:38:47.540
Or even months where I talked to a family
priest.

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.950
And you know I know why now.

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:52.059
You know I know why I got in that shape.

00:38:52.059 --> 00:38:53.059
I know why I survived.

00:38:53.059 --> 00:38:57.289
And I found I got a purpose to just inspire.

00:38:57.289 --> 00:39:00.009
&gt;&gt; Presenter: You're inspiring helping others.

00:39:00.009 --> 00:39:02.940
It's great.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:06.819
When word got out to the office that you were
going to be coming the Daily Show clip from

00:39:06.819 --> 00:39:09.630
earlier this summer was circulating.

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:12.380
You and John Stewart having it out for a few
minutes.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:18.019
You mentioned that you were competing in the
World Police and Fire Games.

00:39:18.019 --> 00:39:20.349
What's next for you as an athlete.

00:39:20.349 --> 00:39:22.719
What are your plans?

00:39:22.719 --> 00:39:28.459
&gt;&gt; Matt: Well, I I'm going to try out for
the Paralympic cycling team.

00:39:28.459 --> 00:39:33.299
The Paralympics are in August in London in
2012.

00:39:33.299 --> 00:39:38.700
I went out to Augusta, Georgia, for the Paranationals
in June.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:44.200
I'm a class 3 Paralympic National Champion.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.450
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Congratulations.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:50.459
&gt;&gt; Matt: Before you clap, there is an asterisk.

00:39:50.459 --> 00:39:54.319
[laughter] I was the only class 3 that showed
up at the race.

00:39:54.319 --> 00:39:56.970
And when I realized that I told the guy.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:58.480
They had the podium set up.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:03.109
As much as I really want to be on that top
box, I'm like I'm the only one that showed

00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:04.109
up.

00:40:04.109 --> 00:40:06.869
The guy's like it's not our fault if they
didn't show up; you're a national champion.

00:40:06.869 --> 00:40:08.430
All right I'll get up on the box.

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:09.430
[laughter]

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:11.510
&gt;&gt; Presenter: And you're a competitor once
again.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:15.829
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So I want to open this up to
questions from the folks here from the Google

00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:17.049
New York office.

00:40:17.049 --> 00:40:22.559
Some of you might be running your first marathon
on Sunday perhaps and you've got a great resource

00:40:22.559 --> 00:40:23.559
here.

00:40:23.559 --> 00:40:29.569
If you just want to step up to one of the
microphones, we'll open up questions to Matt.

00:40:29.569 --> 00:40:33.029
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Thanks so much Matt for coming.

00:40:33.029 --> 00:40:34.849
You're an incredible story.

00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:39.150
I ran my first marathon in New York last year
and I remember reading your book right before

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:40.210
it.

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:43.130
Huge inspiration to me.

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:48.369
A lot of us here at Google and around in New
York obviously still commute on bikes to work.

00:40:48.369 --> 00:40:57.709
And you know, it's still a pretty big problem
as far as safety and regulations.

00:40:57.709 --> 00:41:02.660
What do you think is the best solution as
far as awareness or as far as things the city

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:06.170
can do both cyclists and drivers can do.

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:12.219
&gt;&gt; Matt: You know, I don't want to get in
trouble with the Mayor, my friend Mr. Mike.

00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:18.140
But personally I think the bike lanes they're
putting in are just wrong.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:24.640
You know, I don't think they're thinking it
through for the commuter -- the cyclist, you

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.640
know?

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.279
First of all as a cyclist you're told when
you go to the park if it's raining, the first

00:41:28.279 --> 00:41:31.539
thing you do is stay off the white painted
line because it's slippery.

00:41:31.539 --> 00:41:34.109
And they paint the four foot bike lane all
green.

00:41:34.109 --> 00:41:36.749
Just doesn't make sense to me.

00:41:36.749 --> 00:41:38.800
But that's my opinion.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.190
You know, New York is a busy place.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:47.390
And the cyclists all have to really -- let's
face it, if you have an accident, we're the

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:49.089
ones who are going to get hurt.

00:41:49.089 --> 00:41:51.650
The car may get dented but nothing's going
to happen to the car or the bus.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:56.089
That bus was still working the next day and
I was in the hospital for five months.

00:41:56.089 --> 00:42:01.559
A cyclist -- people who want to commute on
a bike, you got to really just make sure you're

00:42:01.559 --> 00:42:04.530
visible and make sure you obey the traffic
laws.

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:08.819
I cheated a light here and there but you have
to try your best because you want to get to

00:42:08.819 --> 00:42:10.089
where you're going.

00:42:10.089 --> 00:42:11.809
If you're late, so be it.

00:42:11.809 --> 00:42:15.259
Better be late than not show up at all.

00:42:15.259 --> 00:42:19.180
&gt;&gt; Male #2: So thanks very much for coming
today.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:23.289
Yeah, I was thinking about something you said
in the beginning which is the mind is extremely

00:42:23.289 --> 00:42:24.390
powerful.

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:29.039
It's almost as much as the body, I think if
I'm quoting you right.

00:42:29.039 --> 00:42:32.299
Just after the accident and I was just trying
to think how I would react.

00:42:32.299 --> 00:42:34.329
Of course I have no perspective.

00:42:34.329 --> 00:42:38.729
There's certainly a lot of people you could
have blamed for this happening.

00:42:38.729 --> 00:42:39.729
Transit union striking.

00:42:39.729 --> 00:42:40.729
Bus driver.

00:42:40.729 --> 00:42:41.729
Whoever it was.

00:42:41.729 --> 00:42:47.030
So there's got to be a bitter resentment in
the beginning especially causing you to have

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:48.759
that depression that you described.

00:42:48.759 --> 00:42:49.759
How do you get over that?

00:42:49.759 --> 00:42:53.380
How do you stop blaming everyone else and
get over that to the place that you are today,

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:54.380
which is amazing?.

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:55.380
&gt;&gt; Matt: Don't get me wrong.

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.799
I did blame them.

00:42:56.799 --> 00:43:03.220
[laughter] And you know, I wouldn't have been
on my bike that day if the strike didn't happen.

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:05.279
So that's the way I look at it.

00:43:05.279 --> 00:43:12.130
And if I ever saw Roger Toussaint who called
the strike, which, I would tell him that.

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:15.960
But you can't hang on to that.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:20.289
If you want to move forward in life, you can't
hang on to the anger.

00:43:20.289 --> 00:43:25.480
You can't constantly tell or use an excuse
that someone else is holding you back from

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.660
getting where you want to be.

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:31.329
And when I was depressed and when I was not
moving forward in life.

00:43:31.329 --> 00:43:34.049
There's key words I like to use when I talk
about it.

00:43:34.049 --> 00:43:35.359
I wasn't dreaming anymore.

00:43:35.359 --> 00:43:39.609
I wasn't setting goals anymore and I was just
thinking about all the things that were taken

00:43:39.609 --> 00:43:42.119
from me because of that day.

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:47.699
Once I let go of that, those were the anchors
that are holding me back.

00:43:47.699 --> 00:43:52.490
Once I let go of that, the mind took over
with a positive attitude and I started to

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:54.529
change and I started to see my strength.

00:43:54.529 --> 00:43:58.509
I mean, in that picture, I was 128 pounds.

00:43:58.509 --> 00:44:05.009
You know, it was -- once I got rid of those
anchors, I started to see the strength come

00:44:05.009 --> 00:44:06.009
back.

00:44:06.009 --> 00:44:07.509
I started to see, "hey I went into a surgery.

00:44:07.509 --> 00:44:08.509
I woke up.

00:44:08.509 --> 00:44:10.339
Hey wait a minute.

00:44:10.339 --> 00:44:12.119
I got the one I was supposed to get?"

00:44:12.119 --> 00:44:17.809
And I really believe the mind was now in control
of that.

00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:21.690
And it was going to be up to me to do what
I did.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:25.119
And you know, I had the will power to do it.

00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:30.109
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Thanks
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Any other questions?

00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:34.559
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Thanks For being here.

00:44:34.559 --> 00:44:37.170
I'm really excited to read your book next
week.

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:40.920
I am running on Sunday and I'm emotional,
nervous wreck.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:41.920
So.

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.739
&gt;&gt; Matt: Don't read it yet.

00:44:43.739 --> 00:44:45.649
Wait till Sunday night.

00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:46.649
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:44:46.649 --> 00:44:49.099
What gets you through some of these races
and long runs?

00:44:49.099 --> 00:44:51.619
Do you have like a mantra you repeat to yourself?

00:44:51.619 --> 00:44:53.420
Something you visualize?

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:56.700
What gets you through those 7 hours or 16
hours?

00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:03.249
&gt;&gt; Matt: Before my accident, I just fed off
the crowd, the energy of the crowd.

00:45:03.249 --> 00:45:09.809
I was lucky enough to race with good people
and good friends that were faster than me.

00:45:09.809 --> 00:45:10.809
Men and women.

00:45:10.809 --> 00:45:15.859
So I pushed myself to, you know, get closer
to them in a race.

00:45:15.859 --> 00:45:21.430
I remember in one half Ironman I did with
my friend, Vicky, and Frank Carino, again

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:23.739
you hear those names all the time in the book.

00:45:23.739 --> 00:45:27.640
It's when I just started my run and was really
coming around.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.449
And we start in different waves.

00:45:30.449 --> 00:45:33.650
So you see each other at different parts of
the course but I passed Vicky for the first

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:37.529
time in my life on the run course and she
was like "whoa".

00:45:37.529 --> 00:45:40.690
And I was like "where is he" because frank
was faster than both of us.

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:41.839
And she was like what?

00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:44.049
We're in the middle of a half Ironman.

00:45:44.049 --> 00:45:49.990
70.3 miles He just turned the corner up there.

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:52.500
He was lieutenant in the fire department at
the time.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.720
I yelled out, "Lieutenant, I'm coming".

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:58.440
And you know Vicky was like "you're crazy"
and so I just took off.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.660
That was what motivated me before was the
crowd.

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:02.259
Pick a person in front of you.

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:03.259
See that purple shirt?

00:46:03.259 --> 00:46:05.599
I want to stay with that purple shirt.

00:46:05.599 --> 00:46:09.279
Mile 5, I want to pass that purple shirt and
that will motivate you to keep moving.

00:46:09.279 --> 00:46:16.559
After the accident, no matter how hard I try,
i I'm a 16, 17 minute mile.

00:46:16.559 --> 00:46:21.240
It's really, what I say to myself is "I will".

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:27.069
A good friend gave me some advice about a
marathon and Ironman.

00:46:27.069 --> 00:46:31.920
Every once in awhile ask yourself what can
I do right now to make myself have a better

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.210
day?

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:35.289
To make this race better?

00:46:35.289 --> 00:46:36.839
And it could be the next water stop.

00:46:36.839 --> 00:46:39.589
I'm going to get my cup of water and I'm going
to walk.

00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:42.699
You're not going to win the race, you know?

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:48.940
So five seconds instead of taking that paper
cup and splashing the water in your face and

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:53.180
getting just a couple drops and now you're
soaking wet, pull over to the side drink it

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:57.609
like a lady, [laughter] throw it in the garbage,
and run again.

00:46:57.609 --> 00:47:02.719
Whatever it is at that moment to help yourself
have a better day do it and you'll just enjoy

00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:03.719
it.

00:47:03.719 --> 00:47:05.799
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Thanks so much.

00:47:05.799 --> 00:47:06.819
&gt;&gt; Matt: Welcome.

00:47:06.819 --> 00:47:08.661
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Thanks very much for being here.

00:47:08.661 --> 00:47:10.220
This is very inspirational.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:15.569
I'm curious -- this may be a bit technical
but you talk about having a change in mechanics.

00:47:15.569 --> 00:47:19.759
The pictures suggest that there's a lot of
metal going on in your body.

00:47:19.759 --> 00:47:23.089
[chuckles] How does it change the technique
and mechanics.

00:47:23.089 --> 00:47:24.170
What did you have to work on?

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:29.449
How is running that mile different today than
it was five years ago?

00:47:29.449 --> 00:47:34.509
&gt;&gt; Matt: So I said I have a leg length discrepancy.

00:47:34.509 --> 00:47:37.030
My legs are the same length, okay?

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:41.439
But my pelvis was shattered so badly that
the doctor the best they could do is kind

00:47:41.439 --> 00:47:45.349
of like the right side is close to an inch
higher.

00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:49.579
And there's like a 9-inch titanium screw that
holds that there.

00:47:49.579 --> 00:47:55.160
I remember going he apologized he said if
it was a painting I wouldn't sign it.

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:59.740
It's not my best pelvis repair.

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:01.239
I said, "oh, okay."

00:48:01.239 --> 00:48:05.670
He goes," but, I had the screw ready to drill
it in and you were dying.

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:07.239
So do it now fix it."

00:48:07.239 --> 00:48:10.789
So I said okay I'm not upset, Doc, I'm here.

00:48:10.789 --> 00:48:13.439
So I have special shoes made.

00:48:13.439 --> 00:48:17.079
So I, you know, it took me awhile to find
a running shoe company that would make it

00:48:17.079 --> 00:48:22.599
for me but this company Zoot Sports, they're
a triathlon, multisport company.

00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:24.089
I sent them what I was doing.

00:48:24.089 --> 00:48:27.279
Basically I was taking a running shoe to a
cobbler and he was putting a piece of rubber

00:48:27.279 --> 00:48:32.259
on it that would make one shoe weigh about
2 pounds and the other shoe about 8 ounces.

00:48:32.259 --> 00:48:34.039
So I would drag it.

00:48:34.039 --> 00:48:39.849
With that lightweight foam whatever they built
an inch lift on a running shoe for me.

00:48:39.849 --> 00:48:42.759
So that helps that helps me stay level.

00:48:42.759 --> 00:48:48.670
But as far as my muscle mechanics go, my right
side a lot of my stabilizer muscles and the

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:53.630
big muscle groups for running -- hamstring
-- they didn't come back to full strength.

00:48:53.630 --> 00:49:00.439
So what I've learned is that, you know, the
body wants to be healthy.

00:49:00.439 --> 00:49:02.180
You know, people talk about, "oh, I can never
do this.

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:03.180
I have a bad back."

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:06.789
Well, you probably have a bad back because
you're not active.

00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:08.859
You don't have, technically, a bad back.

00:49:08.859 --> 00:49:13.589
Your back hurts when you get off the couch
because you're not treating your body right

00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:15.289
and your body wants to be healthy.

00:49:15.289 --> 00:49:19.670
So when I was going through therapy in New
York with the performance guys, when I was

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:24.020
planning for the marathon they would tell
me, "Listen don't worry about your weakness

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:27.939
in this hamstring because the muscles around
it are going to pitch in because the body

00:49:27.939 --> 00:49:29.900
wants to do right.

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:30.900
And so it did.

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:34.539
I just had to talk to different muscles to
keep moving.

00:49:34.539 --> 00:49:37.249
That's basically how I had to keep those mechanics
going.

00:49:37.249 --> 00:49:41.140
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Well, Matt, I know this is really.

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.140
Oh sorry.

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.140
&gt;&gt; Matt: Let's go.

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:44.140
I have all day.

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.450
You don't want to go back to work do you?

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:46.450
It's Friday.

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:47.970
Google stops at 12 o'clock?

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:48.970
[laughter]

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:50.630
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Super inspirational story.

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:54.450
I heard you speak at Ironman Lake Placid this
year when I was doing it.

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:57.349
I had crashed my bike seven weeks beforehand.

00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:59.309
So I just want to kind of get your feeling.

00:49:59.309 --> 00:50:03.689
I'm still really tentative on the bike from
the crash from the Half Ironman before Lake

00:50:03.689 --> 00:50:04.689
Placid.

00:50:04.689 --> 00:50:11.880
How did you get your mind to go screaming
down key when you're worried about everything

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.099
else and having been hit by the bus.

00:50:14.099 --> 00:50:17.409
How did you work your mind around that?

00:50:17.409 --> 00:50:19.579
&gt;&gt; Matt: Yeah, which is great.

00:50:19.579 --> 00:50:22.160
I that was the best part of the race 6 miles
downhill.

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.430
I got my bike up to 50 miles an hour.

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:28.410
I can't do it in aero position like some people
do it.

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:32.049
I hold on for dear life.

00:50:32.049 --> 00:50:34.140
I think it's like anything else.

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:38.219
You have to kind of think back to being a
kid.

00:50:38.219 --> 00:50:43.539
And kids try everything, try anything, fall
down, get back up, do it again because they're

00:50:43.539 --> 00:50:44.819
not afraid.

00:50:44.819 --> 00:50:47.259
So you have to try to lock that out.

00:50:47.259 --> 00:50:52.369
Bring back that child inside you and say,
"granted you have to keep in mind the risk

00:50:52.369 --> 00:50:53.900
and the reward.

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:54.900
Go with precaution.

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:58.670
I know a guy who's a phenomenal cyclist but
after he's married and has kids, he's on the

00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:03.529
brakes that whole time and he used to just
fly down.

00:51:03.529 --> 00:51:06.849
You have to keep it realistic for yourself.

00:51:06.849 --> 00:51:10.319
Find that inner kid in you.

00:51:10.319 --> 00:51:14.619
If this happened when I was 12, once the cast
is off, I'm back out there.

00:51:14.619 --> 00:51:16.390
So same kind of thing we have to do.

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:19.890
As we get older, recovery time is what we
don't have.

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:21.319
That's why I don't try snow board.

00:51:21.319 --> 00:51:24.059
I remember trying to snow board and I fell
like six times.

00:51:24.059 --> 00:51:27.539
The next day I was like I can't move.

00:51:27.539 --> 00:51:28.539
I just learned how to ski.

00:51:28.539 --> 00:51:29.539
I'm going to keep skiing.

00:51:29.539 --> 00:51:30.559
I'm okay with that.

00:51:30.559 --> 00:51:34.559
As you get older, you can't recover as fast.

00:51:34.559 --> 00:51:36.800
Find that inner child in you get rid of that
fear.

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:37.800
You'll be all right.

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.889
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Thanks so much.

00:51:39.889 --> 00:51:47.569
&gt;&gt; Female #2: I'm wondering how you view yourself
now versus how you thoughtful yourself before

00:51:47.569 --> 00:51:48.569
the accident.

00:51:48.569 --> 00:51:52.059
You know, we all have a pretty good sense
of ourselves.

00:51:52.059 --> 00:51:56.799
And then, when something like that happens,
your spirit's broken and you know, that's

00:51:56.799 --> 00:51:59.529
why you went through that phase.

00:51:59.529 --> 00:52:04.140
And some of the things that define us before
something like that happens and they're taken

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:07.769
away from us causes us to think differently
of ourselves afterwards.

00:52:07.769 --> 00:52:10.720
How do you view yourself now?

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:16.029
&gt;&gt;Matt: As Mr. Murphy said, I have a little
bit of an ego.

00:52:16.029 --> 00:52:21.750
[laughter] I was always a confident person
before the accident.

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:30.259
That 2-year journey where it was kind of sucked
out of me, I guess, without sounding too cocky,

00:52:30.259 --> 00:52:37.619
you know, I realize that I'm tough son of
a bitch.

00:52:37.619 --> 00:52:39.180
Basically that's it.

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:41.309
I got that from my parents.

00:52:41.309 --> 00:52:47.630
I was put through an awful lot and I wouldn't
want my worst enemy to go through what I went

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:51.119
through.

00:52:51.119 --> 00:52:56.099
But I know for a fact now that you don't do
things by yourself.

00:52:56.099 --> 00:53:00.739
You know, if it wasn't for my mom and dad,
my brothers and sisters my fire department

00:53:00.739 --> 00:53:06.369
friends and family, Vicky, Frank, and Noel,
the triathlete group that I trained with,

00:53:06.369 --> 00:53:09.959
if it wasn't for that support group, I'm a
huge country fan.

00:53:09.959 --> 00:53:13.369
Kenny Chesney has a song, I didn't get here
alone.

00:53:13.369 --> 00:53:16.150
I didn't get to this point alone.

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:20.249
I know that now more than ever that I relied
on those people and those friendships to get

00:53:20.249 --> 00:53:21.390
me where I am.

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:24.859
And to make this recovery and this comeback
possible.

00:53:24.859 --> 00:53:28.910
But I'm still tough son of a bitch.

00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:30.630
&gt;&gt;Presenter: There's your mantra.

00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:36.900
[chuckles] Well, Matt, your story has been
tremendously inspirational to me personally

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:40.529
and to a lot of the folks here at the Google
New York City office.

00:53:40.529 --> 00:53:43.579
I know this was a busy week for you with the
New York City marathon being Sunday.

00:53:43.579 --> 00:53:47.141
So for you to take some time out of your schedule,
we really appreciate it.

00:53:47.141 --> 00:53:48.141
Thanks so much for coming back.

00:53:48.141 --> 00:53:49.141
&gt;&gt; Matt: Thank you.

00:53:49.141 --> 00:53:50.141
Thank you.

00:53:50.141 --> 00:53:50.142
[Applause]
