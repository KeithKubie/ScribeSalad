Let's talk about tunnel vision when it
comes to your job search. My name is

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.870
Martin McGovern, with Udacity, and
recently I was chatting with a job

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.070
seeker who had a really hyper focused
view of the company that they wanted to

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.039
work at. They sent me a message saying, "I applied many times at Google, but they

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.779
just don't respond back. So, I'm trying to
make my resume as good as possible

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.000
because I want to get in to Google.". Now I understand their desire, and maybe one

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.550
day they will work at Google, but the
truth of the matter is everyone wants to

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.510
work at Google. So, we're in a position
where we need to open up the world of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.800
possibilities when it comes to their job
search. We chatted back and forth, and I

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.270
shared this message with them. "You
shouldn't get hyper focused on any

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.170
single company. Maybe you'll get into
Google someday, but by focusing on only

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.250
one company right now you're missing out
on all the other opportunities that

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.109
might come your way. Also, you never know
what job or contract you might pick up

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.030
in the meantime, that is one step away
from Google, if only you jumped at it.".

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.390
They agreed, and expanded their search to
include both Microsoft and Amazon. Saying,

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.770
"Slowly slowly, I will increase my search
to more companies, but these companies

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.210
focus on quality, which is what I really
like about them.". Now they're on the right

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.409
track. They not only know what it is
about these companies that they like, but

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.189
they've expanded the number of companies
that they're looking at. This is a great

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.000
start but I want to challenge them, and
even you, if you feel like you have

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.670
tunnel vision, to go even further. Here
are four steps that you can take to make

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.869
sure that you are expanding your options
while still keeping your eye on the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.680
prize. Step number one: Pick your favorite
company. Step number two: Look up all of

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.470
their competitors and put them down on
paper. Step number three: Look up every

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.110
company that that company partners with.
And number four: Create a web of all

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.509
these companies and find your way in.
Your first gig might not be with your

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.860
dream company, but you can get close by
expanding your focus

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.980
thank you for watching. If you have any
other career questions that you'd like

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.270

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.270
about them. We look forward to bringing
