00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So what is this mysterious SAT problem?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So SAT stands for Boolean satisfiability,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of course, that also doesn't tell you very much,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but I'll soon get into what Boolean satisfiability is.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You have to just note that SAT is one of the

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
most famous and most studied problems in theoretical computer science,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and it's the bases of many marked results,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
so it's always a good idea to familiarize yourself with what SAT is about

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and why SAT can be so hard to solve.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So what is the Boolean satisfiability problem?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The input for SAT is a so called Boolean formula,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and that actually sounds much more intimidating than it is

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
because Boolean formulas are very simple structures.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
They consist of only 4 building blocks.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
As any kind of formula, we have variables,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and those variables I'll write in this course usually as X1, X2, X3, and so on.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And the nice thing about these variables is

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
so in a normal formula whenever you have

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
X that can take a number of different values,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but in a Boolean formula,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
a variable X can only take 2 different values.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It can either be true, which is sometimes also written as a 1

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
or it can be false, which is sometimes also written as a 0.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The second thing you can have in a Boolean formula is

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
an operator called not.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And how you write that is, if you say,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
have a variable X1, then this here would be not X1

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
or if you have X2, this here would be not X2,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and what the not does is it turns a true into a false,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and vice versus, so it also turns a false into a true.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So for example, if X1 equals true,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
then not X1 equals false.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So it basically just flips that variable.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Then you have another operator, and that one is called and.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And this and is usually written like this,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and it works on 2 variables, so you have X1 and X2

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
or any other variable.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And the way it works is that

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
this expression here, X1 and X2

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
is true only if X1 is true

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and X2 is true.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Otherwise, it's always false.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So I'm going to write this as 1s and 0s here just to make it a bit shorter,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
but you know that 1 stands for true and 0 stands for false,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
so it's the same.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So 0 and 0 equals 0,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
0 and 1 equals 0,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
1 and 0 equals 0,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and only 1 and 1 equals 1.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And the final component of a Boolean formula

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
is another operator called or,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and or is written just the other way around,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
so it's written like a flipped and.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So it's X1 or X2,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and as the name already suggests,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that is set to true or set to 1

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
if at least 1 of these variables here is set to true,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
so 0 or 0, that will still be 0,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
but 0 or 1 will be 1,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
1 or 0 will be 1,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and 1 or 1 is also going to evaluate to 1.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So let's practice this in a little quiz.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Let's say you have the following Boolean formula.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:55.000
X1 or not X2 or X3 and not X1 or X2,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and we're going to have that X1 is equal to true or 1,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
X2 is equal to true,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and X3 is also set to true or 1.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Is this whole formula equal to true or is it equal to false?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So please select this button here if you

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
think the whole formula is equal to false or 0,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and please select this one here if the whole

00:04:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
formula is equal to true or 1.
