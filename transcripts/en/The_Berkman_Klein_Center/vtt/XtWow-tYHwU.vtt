00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.020
 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.710
The cases we've considered
thus far involved

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.210
defendants who operate sites, dance
halls, flea markets, and so forth,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.860
in which third parties engaged
in copyright infringement.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.640
Somewhat different,
and more difficult, are

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.780
cases in which the defendant sells
a product, or provides a service,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.950
that its customers sometimes employ in
ways that violate the copyright laws.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.380
And sometimes employ
in ways that do not.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.350
As I mentioned earlier,
such cases have come

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.580
to be known as "dual
use technology cases."

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.910
There have been four major cases
of this sort in the United States.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.540
The Sony, or Betamax case,
which I discussed in connection

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.681
with the fair use doctrine
in lecture number nine.

00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:06.660
A set of rulings concerning the
Napster file sharing service.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.150
A decision by the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.020
involving one of the successors
to Napster, known as Aimster.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.260
And a second decision by the
Supreme Court in the Grokster case.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.335
I'll briefly describe the facts
and holdings of those decisions.

00:01:23.335 --> 00:01:26.410
 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.920
In the Sony case, as you already
know, the defendant prevailed.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.640
In all three of the file sharing cases,
by contrast, the defendants lost.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.380
However, the ways in which
they lost varied considerably.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.990
Put differently, the
courts adjusted and then

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.210
readjusted the law of
secondary liability

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.920
to address the changing structure
of the file sharing systems.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.960
A charitable interpretation
of this sequence of cases

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.980
would depict it as an
illustration of the flexibility

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.590
and wisdom of common law adjudication.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.210
An uncharitable
interpretation would see it

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.190
as a manifestation of what is
sometimes called result orientation.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.810
In other words, a determination by the
courts to suppress a social practice

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.380
they saw as pathological,
and a willingness

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.140
to contort the law to achieve that end.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.910
Which is the more apt
interpretation, I leave to you.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.430
The basic facts of the Betamax
case, as you'll recall,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.660
are that the film studios
licensed television networks

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.330
to broadcast their films to
viewers with the expectations

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.260
that the viewers would
watch the embedded ads,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.210
and then buy some of the
products promoted by those ads.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.460
The advertisers in turn would pay
the TV networks fees, some of which

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.350
the networks paid to the studios
in the form of license fees.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.680
This longstanding business
model was disrupted by Sony

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.710
when it began manufacturing and
selling VCRS, which among other things,

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.030
enabled the viewers to avoid
watching the embedded advertisements,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.265
thus endangering the flows of
revenue through the system.

00:03:07.265 --> 00:03:09.140
Because the viewers were
using their machines

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.720
to make verbatim copies
of the studios' films,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.990
the studios might have brought
suit against the viewers.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.930
But the impracticability
of that approach

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.100
prompted the studios,
instead, to bring suit

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.540
against Sony, the manufacturer of the
devices the viewers were employing.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.710
In the end, as you know, the studios
lost in the Supreme Court, barely.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.180
The two interlocking rulings that
enabled Sony to escape liability

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.010
are set forth on your screen.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.130
The second ruling, that time
shifting constitutes a fair use

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.570
and is thus a lawful use of a VCR,
we discussed in lecture number nine.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.150
Our concern here is
with the first ruling.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.420
The manufacturer of a device that can
be used to violate the copyright laws

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.580
is liable for contributory
infringement, if and only

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.630
if the device is not capable of
substantial non-infringing uses.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.160
The key phrase comes
at the end, "capable

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.339
of substantial non-infringing uses."

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:20.079
Using the first letters of
those words as an abbreviation,

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.630
this dimension of the Sony decision
might be called the COSNU defense.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.660
 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.520
This standard for
secondary liability, which

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.070
the court adapted from a loosely
analogous aspect of patent law,

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.760
is quite generous to defendants.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.460
Taken literally it means that
the manufacturer and distributive

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.250
of a dual use technology does not
need to show that his product is often

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.840
used for legal purposes, or even that
it is ever used for legal purposes,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:00.110
but merely that it is capable of being
used for substantial legal purposes.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.980
Sony of course, easily passed that test.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.714
Because as we've seen,
time shifting, which

00:05:05.714 --> 00:05:08.130
the Supreme Court for the
reasons we've already considered

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.680
determined to be lawful, was
the most common use of VCRS.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.130
But the way in which the court
phrased the COSNU defense

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.930
seemed to offer an escape
hatch to defendants

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.170
whose products were much
less often employed legally.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.680
 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.230
The relationship between the COSNU
defense announced and applied

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.570
in the Betamax case, and the overall
doctrine of secondary liability,

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.780
is not entirely clear.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.340
But it appears that the way
in which the defense engages

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.820
with the standard requirements is by
negating the element of knowledge,

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.710
which as you know, is
one of the requirements

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.120
of contributory infringement.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.510
More specifically,
the fact that a device

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.670
is capable of substantial
non-infringing uses

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.970
prevents the plaintiff,
in the court's words,

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.170
from showing that the
defendant "has sold equipment

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.180
with constructive knowledge of
the fact that its customers may

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:12.150
use that equipment to make unauthorized
copies of copyrighted material."

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.200
Now in theory the studios could
have overcome that impediment

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.670
if they could have shown that
Sony had actual knowledge

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.600
that a particular customer was
using her machine illegally.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.500
For example, that a particular customer
was using her machine for librarying,

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.120
which even the majority of the
Supreme Court seemed to assume

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.730
did not qualify as a fair use.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:40.220
The studios did not make such a showing,
and probably could not have done so.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.850
But this possibility, as we will see,
played a role in some later cases.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.130
Another ambiguity in
the Betamax opinion,

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.180
concerns whether the
COSNU defense applies

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.110
only to claims of
contributory infringement,

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.660
or also to claims of
vicarious infringement.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.850
Almost all the court's opinion
focuses on contributory infringement,

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.880
but in one cryptic footnote,
specifically footnote number 17,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.700
the court observed that "the lines
between contributory infringement

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.660
and vicarious liability
are not clearly drawn.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.410
And that recent analysis of respondent's
unprecedented contributory infringement

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.830
claim necessarily entails consideration
of arguments and case law,

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:28.830
which might also be forwarded
under other labels."

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.910
The court thereby left
open the possibility

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:37.210
that its ruling applied to
vicarious liability as well.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.130
Again, this possibility
didn't much matter in

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.700
the Betamax case itself,
because in any event,

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.380
the studios could not show that
Sony had the right and ability

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:51.020
to supervise the ways in which
it's customers used its machines.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.720
And so could not establish
vicarious liability,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.210
even if the COSNU defense were
inapplicable to such claims.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.730
But it would make a difference
in some subsequent cases.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.296
So that's where things stood as of 1984.

00:08:06.296 --> 00:08:11.350
For the next 15 years, the COSNU
defense, announced in the Betamax case,

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:16.470
stood as a powerful bulwark for firms
developing products and services that

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:20.010
were sometimes used to engage
in copyright infringement.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:25.900
What destabilized this doctrinal
structure was the rise of file sharing.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.020
The next three cases in
the sequence struggled

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:34.630
to reconcile file sharing
with the Betamax framework.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:41.590
The first, and arguably most famous
of the three file sharing cases,

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.464
was Napster.

00:08:44.464 --> 00:08:47.380
I've mentioned the Napster system
and the associated legal controversy

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.870
before.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:53.110
Here's a somewhat more detailed
description of the facts.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:58.380
Napster consisted of a website and
an application program that together

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.520
enabled music fans to exchange
copies of sound recordings.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:08.800
The Napster website,
which was www.napster.com,

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.520
contained a directory listing
all of the recordings that

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.230
could be found on the hard drives
of all of its members' computers,

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.350
and an index to those recordings.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.120
A music fan who wished to
join the community and gain

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.030
access to those recordings,
would first log into the website

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:29.930
and download from it a fee piece
of software known as MusicShare.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.740
After installing the
software on his computer,

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:38.750
the user would sign up by selecting a
unique username, typically fictitious,

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.000
and a password.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.480
He would then create on his
computer a "user library"

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:52.450
into which he would copy any recordings,
typically in the form of MP3 files,

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.340
that he wanted to
share with other users.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.090
He would then log into
the Napster system.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:03.030
His software would talk to the
software on Napster's servers.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:08.460
One result of that conversation is that
a list of the files on his computer

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.930
would appear in the Napster directory.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.200
The files themselves would
not be copied onto the servers

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.580
of Napster's site, just their names.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.815
That's the significance of the
hollow circles in this diagram.

00:10:21.815 --> 00:10:24.620
 

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.260
Other users would be
doing the same thing.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.830
Suppose one of the subscribers,
say user number two,

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:36.000
wanted to find some
recordings by Eric Clapton.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.400
She would submit a search
request using Clapton's name.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.180
If any of Clapton's recordings
appeared in the index,

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.480
the software would identify which
of the libraries of currently

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.520
logged in subscribers
contained those recordings,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.360
and provide that information to the
application on user number two's

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.940
computer.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.920
That information would
enable her computer

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.620
to connect directly to one
of those host computers,

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.980
here belonging to user number
one, download a copy of the file

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:13.250
directly from the host
computer, and save it

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.830
on user number two's hard drive.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.130
The fact that the two users'
computers were in direct contact

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.760
explains the name peer to peer copying.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.780
User number two could then either play
the file directly from her computer

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.930
or, if she had a CD burner
and the appropriate software,

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.220
she could convert the
MP3 file to a WAV file

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.900
and copy it onto a CD, which could
then be played on any CD player.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.670
 

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:49.200
Now if only a few people engaged in this
practice the owners of the copyrights

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.330
and the compositions and
recordings most likely

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.990
would have tolerated it, just as they
had tolerated the longstanding practice

00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:00.732
of teenagers making so-called
mixed tapes for their friends.

00:12:00.732 --> 00:12:04.800
But the system grew
extraordinarily fast.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.130
By October of 2000, roughly
a year after its launch,

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.830
it had 32 million subscribers.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.060
Four months later it had 80 million.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.490
Nor was it limited to the United States.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.260
Indeed the percentage of
people with internet access

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:25.200
who used Napster was higher in
Canada, Argentina, Spain, and Brazil,

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.430
than it was in the United States.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:33.650
Copyright owners, unsurprisingly,
became increasingly concerned.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.490
Soon after the launch of the
service, the Napster executives

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.440
contacted the record
companies and sought

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.680
to obtain licenses to
distribute their works.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.030
The record companies
considered such an arrangement.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:51.540
Indeed Bertelsmann, the German parent
company of one of the record companies,

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.770
extended a loan of $80
million to Napster,

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.810
and tried to persuade the
other record companies

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.300
to license their catalogs to Napster.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.710
But in the end, the
record companies decided

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.640
to litigate rather than negotiate.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.920
As in the Betamax case, the
companies could have brought suit

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.030
against Napster's subscribers, who are
actually engaged in copying their works

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.740
and distributing unauthorized copies.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.990
But again, the
impracticability of that option

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:26.840
prompted the copyright owners
to pursue Napster instead.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.140
Because Napster was not itself copying
recordings or distributing copies,

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.570
the owners did not have a good
claim for direct infringement.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.850
But they could and did contend
that Napster was secondarily

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:43.060
liable for the conduct
of its subscribers.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:47.070
Judge Patel of the district court
found in favor of the owners.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.580
Napster appealed to the
Ninth Circuit, which

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:55.140
ruled, in brief, that use of the
Napster system to sample songs

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.880
is not a fair use.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.210
Because Napster is capable of a
substantial non-infringing use,

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:06.150
the owners of the system lack the
constructive knowledge of infringing

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:10.230
uses necessary to support
contributory liability.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.940
Note here the impact
of the Betamax ruling.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.580
So far things look good for Napster.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.540
But its luck would not hold.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.700
Next the Court of Appeals ruled that
because the Napster operators can

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:28.300
ascertain whether a particular
recording has been copied illegally,

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.580
they have timely actual knowledge
of specific acts of infringement

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.420
necessary to support
contributory liability.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.745
Remember that this was an option
left open by the Betamax case

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:44.260
that the Ninth Circuit
in Napster seized it.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.990
Finally for the same
reason, the court of appeals

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:53.050
ruled that the Napster operators
have the "supervisory control"

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.250
over the conduct of its
subscribers necessary to support

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.225
vicarious infringement.

00:14:57.225 --> 00:15:00.000
 

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Death came swiftly.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.940
By the summer 2002 the
Napster system had been closed

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.780
and the company filed for bankruptcy.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.230
Critics of the record companies
argue that by suing Napster,

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:17.540
they made a catastrophic
strategic mistake.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.330
Had they agreed to license
the Napster service

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:24.390
they might have been able to collaborate
in the construction of a lawful music

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.970
subscription system, from which
they could have earned a great deal

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:33.260
and avoided alienating
millions of consumers.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.420
By adopting instead a
confrontational posture,

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.120
the record companies
delayed for roughly a decade

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.090
the emergence of such services.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:46.560
By then the recording
industry had shrunk by half.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:52.446
In the US its gross revenues in
1999 were around $13 billion.

00:15:52.446 --> 00:15:55.380
Today they're around $7 billion.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.460
Global revenues have shrunk
at a corresponding pace.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:03.470
Today they are around $16 billion.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:07.140
This collapse could've been
avoided if the company's

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:13.700
had embraced peer to peer technology,
instead of trying to suppress it.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.860
The record companies, of course,
disagree with this assessment.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.190
Capitulation to Napster,
they argue, would

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.270
have led to an even faster
decline in the industry,

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:26.520
as other unauthorized and thus free
services sprang up and drew customers

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.230
away.

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:29.930
Perhaps.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:34.860
It's unlikely we'll ever be able
to resolve this controversy.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.390
So back to our story.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:43.330
Napster's demise did indeed open the
way for follow on similar services.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.230
One of them was Aimster,
so named because it

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:50.990
piggybacked on AOL's
instant messaging service.

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:54.850
It was similar to Napster in
many ways, but differed in one.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:58.780
Encryption prevented the
operators of the Aimster system

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:04.160
from knowing the contents of the
files its subscribers shared.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.280
Nevertheless, the intentions
of the Aimster creators

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.670
were reasonably clear from the
fact that they provided users

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:14.609
online tutorials showing
them how to use the system

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:16.800
to exchange sound
recordings, most of which

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.520
would likely be subject
to copyright protection.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:26.140
Like its ancestors, Aimster attracted
subscribers with extraordinary speed.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.450
It was launched on August 8, 2000.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:33.430
Within three days 20,000
people had signed up.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:38.200
By early 2001 it had 2.5
million registered users.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:43.900
And by the end of April 2001, the
number had grown to 4.2 million.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.740
The purpose of the encryption
included in Aimster's design

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:52.790
was, of course, to avoid the kind
of "actual knowledge" of infringing

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.644
behavior that had doomed Napster.

00:17:55.644 --> 00:17:58.310
In the judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.900
this was too clever by half.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.640
In the court's judgment,
Aimster was plainly liable

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.360
for contributory infringement.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:11.230
The court brushed aside the COSNU
defense that had saved Sony on a ground

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.470
that the defendants had
failed to present evidence

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.442
of any lawful uses of their system.

00:18:16.442 --> 00:18:19.780
The court next ruled that
the defendant's strategy of

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.020
see no evil could not save them.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:29.460
In its words "willful blindness" is
the equivalent of actual knowledge.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.950
Finally, material
contribution was established

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:40.930
by the defendant's active encouragement
of infringing uses of the system.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.080
Interestingly the court was
less sure that the defendants

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.580
were liable for vicarious infringement.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:52.430
But no matter, contributory
infringement was sufficient.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:57.050
The holdings in the Aimster case
were relatively unsurprising.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:01.080
Much more eye opening were some
statements made by the court in dictum,

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:07.270
suggesting doubts concerning the pillars
on which the Betamax ruling had rested.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.730
Judge Posner writing for the
court, expressed his disagreement

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.920
with the Betamax
formulation on two fronts.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:19.050
First, he contended that to trigger
the COSNU defense a defendant must

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:23.350
demonstrate that its product has
substantial non-infringing uses,

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:28.880
not merely that it is capable of
substantial non-infringing uses.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.770
Adoption of this suggestion would
entail converting the doctrine

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:38.980
from a COSNU defense to
a [INAUDIBLE] defense.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:43.820
Second, he argued that even if the
defendant makes such a showing,

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:48.080
if the infringing uses are
substantial, the defendant must also

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:53.300
show that it would have been
"disproportionately costly" to design

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:58.460
its product so as to eliminate
or reduce the infringing uses.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.250
These principles were not
necessary to the Aimster opinion,

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:07.630
but they voted ill for the
developers of dual use technologies.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:13.040
The last of major file sharing
cases involved the Grokster service.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.060
It differed from its predecessors,
somewhat, in structure.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.340
Specifically the fast
track technology that it,

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:25.100
along with some other companies
employed, was decentralized.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:30.240
Not quite as decentralized
as Nutella, a popular system

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.800
developed by a renegade
programmer at AOL.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.510
But more so than either
Napster or Aimster.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:41.580
In brief, a fast track user
interested in exchanging files

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:45.070
would locate, with the aid
of a central server, one

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.165
of the set of computers connected
to the internet that functioned

00:20:48.165 --> 00:20:53.300
as so-called super nodes, coordinating
search requests among clusters

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.170
of users.

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.710
Once engaged in the system, the
user could submit a request,

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.230
let's say for a particular
Clapton recording.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.930
If a copy of the
requested recording were

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:09.910
located on one of the
connected users' computers,

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:14.140
it would be delivered to the requesting
party with no further involvement

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.710
by Grokster.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.640
Partly because of the
structure, the system

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.760
was used reasonably often
for non-infringing purposes,

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:26.780
such as distributing movie trailers,
sharing the works of Shakespeare,

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:31.680
and locating computer software for
which distribution is permitted.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.880
As well as for exchanging
recordings unlawfully.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.400
 

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.050
These circumstances prompted
the district court judge

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:45.930
who first heard the copyright owners
suit again Grokster to deny liability.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.810
The Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.270
also ruled in favor
of Grokster, reasoning

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:55.950
that the existence of
legitimate uses of the system

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.230
means that the defendants
could not be charged

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.410
with constructive
knowledge of unlawful uses,

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.260
just as Sony could not be charged
with constructive knowledge

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.590
of unlawful uses of its VCRS.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:11.860
Grokster did not learn of specific
illegal uses of its technology

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.560
until it was too late to stop them.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.250
And unlike Fonovisa,
the defendants were not

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.210
supplying the site and
facilities for illegality,

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:26.310
and had no affirmative duty to alter
their software to prevent illegality.

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.920
For all these reasons, in the
judgment of the Ninth Circuit,

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.120
defendants were not liable
for contributory infringement.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.180
With respect to vicarious infringement,
the plaintiffs had failed to establish,

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.280
said the Ninth Circuit, the necessary
right and ability of the defendants

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:44.040
to supervise the direct infringers.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.760
These arguments, as I hope you see, are
reasonably straightforward applications

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.690
of the law as it existed at the time.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:55.510
The Ninth Circuit was not tilting the
table in favor of the defendant's.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.440
But the copyright owners
and their supporters

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.150
contended that this is
where the current law leads.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:04.840
The law must be wrong,
and should be modified.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.770
They asked the Supreme Court
to revisit the Betamax case

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:13.010
and to adjust the pertinent standard.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:15.180
How exactly?

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.740
Various possible reforms were proposed.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.050
The copyright owners
themselves contended

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:24.980
that the COSNU defense,
announced in Sony,

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:30.180
should not apply when "the primary or
principle use of a product or service

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.810
is infringing."

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.640
The Solicitor General
offered a different approach.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.300
Secondary liability should be imposed
"if the defendant's product is

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.800
overwhelmingly used for
infringing purposes,

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.830
and the viability of
the defendant's business

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.650
depends on the revenue
and consumer interest

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:52.030
generated by such infringement."

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:56.250
One group of economists argued instead
that secondary liability should

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:59.580
be imposed if the defendant
"could eliminate or greatly

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.980
reduce the level of infringement without
significantly cutting down the quantity

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.750
and quality of lawful uses."
you should hear, here,

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:14.750
an echo of Judge Posner's
proposal in Aimster.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:18.510
The most radical approach was offered
by another group of economists.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:23.540
Lower courts could should consider all
economic variables in particular cases

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.725
when deciding whether to
impose secondary liability.

00:24:25.725 --> 00:24:28.380
 

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:32.010
Other parties argued instead,
that the Betamax COSNU defense

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:37.410
should be preserved because first,
tighter standards for contributory

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:41.120
vicarious infringement would endanger
some socially valuable dual use

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.190
technologies.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:47.950
The unpredictability of all of the
proposed alternatives to COSNU,

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:51.730
when combined with the threat
of statutory damages, a topic

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:56.630
we'll examine next week,
would chill innovation.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:00.160
And the entertainment industry
could be saved, they argued,

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.160
through less radical forms of therapy.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.800
 

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.300
In the end, the Supreme
Court split the difference.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.820
It left the Sony COSNU defense intact.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.650
But it added to the set of
forms of secondary liability

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.490
a new doctrine, adapted
from other sources,

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:23.570
which it referred to as "inducement."

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:27.530
The key sentence in the Supreme
Court's opinion announcing this rule

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.790
is set forth on your screen.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:33.900
"One who distributes a device with
the object of promoting its use

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:39.150
to infringe copyright, as shown by clear
expression or other affirmative steps

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:43.550
taken to foster infringement,
is liable for the resulting

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:47.882
acts of infringement by third parties."

00:25:47.882 --> 00:25:50.090
The question immediately
arises, how does a plaintiff

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.760
go about proving
inducement of this sort?

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:58.440
The court's answer by offering evidence
of "purposeful, culpable expression

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.460
and conduct."

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.050
What kinds of evidence will suffice?

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:06.840
Not that the defendant knew that
his product or service was sometimes

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.290
used for unlawful purposes,
that was not enough to give rise

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:15.900
to liability in the Betamax case, as
we saw, and it's still not enough.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.700
Nor is it sufficient for
plaintiff to offer evidence

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:25.620
the defendant is providing
customers generic product support.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.635
Something more is essential in
order to demonstrate inducement.

00:26:29.635 --> 00:26:32.170
 

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.380
In its opinion, the
Supreme Court identified

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.710
four sorts of relevant evidence.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:41.760
Advertising illegal
uses, targeting customers

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:46.420
known to engage in illegal uses,
failure to adopt infringement

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:50.600
reducing technologies,
and commercial sense

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:55.210
of the enterprise that
depends on illegal uses.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.920
The last two types of
evidence, though relevant,

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.850
will not be enough on their
own to succeed, it seems.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:06.250
A plaintiff needs some evidence
of the first two types,

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:10.540
advertising unlawful
uses, or targeting kinds

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.760
of consumers known to be
engaging in infringement,

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.350
such as reaching out to former
Napster subscribers who are now

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.690
looking for a substitute
file sharing service.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:22.560
 

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.880
Like most Supreme Court
opinions, the Grokster ruling

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.960
contained some ambiguities.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.800
For instance, in one
crucial sentence the court

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.490
indicated that liability
under the inducement theory

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.650
arises when the distributor
intended and encouraged

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:41.650
the product to be used to infringe.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.340
The two verbs in that
sentence are different.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.210
The former suggests a
subjective standard,

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:51.490
under which the crucial variable
is the defendant's state of mind.

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:55.650
Evidence pertaining to the defendant's
intention would thus be relevant.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:59.230
The latter, by contrast,
suggests an objective standard,

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:03.540
under which only the defendant's
conduct would be germane.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:09.060
These and other ambiguities are tacitly
left to the lower courts to work out.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:13.000
But the principal implications of
the Grokster ruling are clear enough.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.640
If you actively promote unlawful
uses of your product or service,

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.920
you're in trouble.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:24.850
Ironically this standard, had it
been in place in the late 1970s,

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:28.650
might have led to a different
result in the Betamax case.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:33.040
As you'll recall, I hope, Sony
sponsored some advertisements

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:38.980
that seemed to tout the use of its VCRs
for librarying, not just time shifting.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:42.410
And librarying is an activity that
the Supreme Court subsequently

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:45.500
seemed to assume was unlawful.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:49.680
This appears to be the kind of
active promotion of illegality

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.760
that the court in Grokster condemns.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.910
 

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.320
Whatever the merits of
the Grokster approach,

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.210
evaluating conduct in the
past, it is likely to have

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.990
diminishing force in the future.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:04.010
Why?

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:06.550
Because attentive
potential defendants will

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:10.270
be sure not to advertise
or otherwise promote

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:13.330
the unlawful uses of their
products and services,

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:18.830
and to avoid mentioning such things
in their internal correspondence.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:23.700
In short, the inducement rule is likely
to catch the unsophisticated creators

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:29.010
of startups, not sophisticated
actors with good lawyers.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.845
That's not an optimal legal standard.

00:29:30.845 --> 00:29:34.440
 

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.040
Thus far we've been
examining the expansion

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:42.050
in recent years of the judge made
doctrines of secondary liability.

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:44.920
But there's another force
to be reckoned with.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.700
An economically and
politically important

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:50.700
group of businesses that are
potentially vulnerable to liability

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:54.950
under these expanding rules,
have sought and obtained

00:29:54.950 --> 00:30:00.060
qualified immunity,
specifically in 1998,

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:04.030
as part of the so-called Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, commonly

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:09.050
abbreviated as DMCA,
a group of companies

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:11.960
that provide a variety of
internet based services,

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.280
persuaded Congress to grant them
protection against copyright liability.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.330
Both direct and secondary
liability, provided

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:25.330
that they complied with some
reasonably precise requirements.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:29.750
The complex rules giving
these enterprises protection

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:33.470
are now embodied in section
512 of the copyright statute.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:36.140
 

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:40.000
The details of section 512 are much too
intricate to examine in this lecture.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.340
What I will do in the remainder
of this segment of the lecture

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:48.100
is to sketch the basic principles
underlying this portion of the statute,

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.090
and to describe the most important
of the judicial opinions that

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:57.400
thus far has construed section 512.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.410
A subset of the components of
512 are set forth on your screen.

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:05.720
For the complete set,
click on this link.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:10.010
Internet service providers,
meaning passive intermediaries

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:14.130
who simply carry packets of
information from one party to another,

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:17.790
are not liable for copyright
infringement, provided that they do not

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:24.960
select the stuff that is sent, or who
it is sent to, or modify it en route.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.580
This should not be surprising.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.970
The Postal Service is also not liable
if some of the letters it carries

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:33.130
contain unlawful material.

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:39.260
Things less obvious when we shift
from ISPs to so-called OSPs,

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:45.390
online service providers, which are
defined in section 512)(k)(1)(b)

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:49.930
as providers of online services
or network access or the operators

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:53.160
of facilities therefore.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:57.020
To qualify for the 512
safe harbor, such entities

00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:01.850
must abide by the requirements
set forth in 512(I)

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.920
In brief, adopting,
announcing, and abiding

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:11.000
by a policy for terminating people
who repeatedly abuse their services,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.360
and accommodating reasonable
technological protection

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.230
measures adopted by
the copyright owners.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.860
 

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:25.280
If an OSP qualifies, it enjoys immunity
with respect to various activities,

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.810
including, unsurprisingly,
passive caching of the material

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:32.480
that turns out to be infringing.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:36.330
The most controversial of
the activities for which OSPs

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:40.800
may secure immunity concerns
not carrying packets

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:45.770
from one person to another, or
caching it for faster retrieval,

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:49.290
but rather storing material
sent to them by one person.

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:54.240
And making that material
accessible to lots of other people.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:02.170
In 1998 this practice was not terribly
common, but it is now ubiquitous.

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:07.440
OSPs who do this are free of liability
if they first publicly identify

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.480
an agent the copyright owners
can contact to tell them

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.540
that specific works are being
stored on their systems unlawfully.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.490
Second, abide by a
detailed set of procedures

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:21.640
for removing such material
from their systems,

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.100
or resolving disagreements
between the copyright owners

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:29.220
and the posters
concerning their legality.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:35.410
Third, lacks the kind of specific
knowledge of illegality spelled out

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:38.630
in section 512)(c)(1)(a)

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:45.160
And fourth, lacks the kind of financial
interest spelled out in section

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:52.650
512)(c)(1)(b) The clauses pertaining to
knowledge and financial interest should

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:55.800
sound roughly familiar to you.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.650
They pertain to the
same kinds of concerns

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:02.170
that have long figured in the
doctrines of contributory infringement

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:05.380
and vicarious
infringement, respectively.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:11.000
But those concepts take here an unusual
form, and serve an unusual role.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.550
If an OSP are accused of storing
and distributing infringing stuff,

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:20.870
can show that he lacks both of
these things, he's home free.

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:24.190
If he can not, he's
not necessarily liable,

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:28.230
but must run the gauntlet of the
doctrines of direct and secondary

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:31.850
liability we've considered
in the last four weeks.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:36.884
So, much hinges on how exactly
these requirements are construed.

00:34:36.884 --> 00:34:39.500
 

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.389
The case that to date has its
has examined these requirements

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:48.040
most detail, is Viacom versus YouTube.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.690
The basic facts are likely
familiar to most of you.

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:57.080
YouTube was founded in 2005 by
three former employees of PayPal.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.600
The purpose of the initial version
of YouTube was not entirely clear,

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:06.190
but its principal function soon became
to enable people to post video clips,

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:09.630
and make them available
for the world to watch.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:12.730
It grew extremely rapidly.

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:17.930
By 2007 YouTube was the dominant site of
its kind, and its lead over its rivals

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:21.420
continued to increase.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.160
YouTube's success was
attributable in part

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.720
to the sophistication and
convenience of its technology,

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.700
and in part to the support
it received from Google,

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:34.030
which purchased the company
in November of 2006,

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:39.804
in a stock for stock transaction
worth roughly $1.5 billion.

00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:43.230
Last but not least,
YouTube flourished in part

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:46.810
because it was willing,
particularly in the early years,

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:51.230
to host videos consisting of or
containing commercial copyrighted

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:57.100
material, which lots
of users wanted to see.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.680
The owners of the copyrights in those
materials reacted in various ways

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.510
to the rise of YouTube.

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:04.490
Some shrugged.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:08.010
Some negotiated licenses
with YouTube or Google,

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:11.240
permitting them to host their content.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:15.290
And finally, a few brought law suits.

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:18.830
Included in this last group was
Viacom, the entertainment giant

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:22.510
that owned the copyrights in
many television shows, episodes

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:26.180
of which were uploaded to YouTube
without permission by fans,

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.360
and then watched by other fans.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.000
The numbers were large.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.440
In 2007 when it initiated
the lawsuit, Viacom

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:41.660
identified 63,497 clips
then hosted on YouTube

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:46.980
that, Viacom contended, contained
its copyrighted material.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:51.240
YouTube acknowledged that
some of the videos on its site

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.600
contained copyrighted
material and promptly removed

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.670
the 63,000 clips identified by Viacom.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:01.090
But having done so,
YouTube asserted that it

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:03.980
bore no further legal responsibility.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:07.795
Having complied with the so-called
notice and takedown procedures,

00:37:07.795 --> 00:37:11.170
that as we've seen are
mandated by section 512,

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:14.980
YouTube contended that it was entitled
to the benefit of the safe harbor

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:19.550
of section 512(c), and thus could
not be liable for direct or secondary

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:22.120
copyright infringement.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.320
Viacom, as you might expect, disagreed.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.540
Here's a statement released by Mike
Fricklas, Viacom's general counsel,

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.910
summarising the company's stance.

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:34.630
 

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:37.990
This paragraph on your screen
succinctly states the arguments

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:44.210
that Viacom hoped to use to deny
YouTube the benefit of section 512(c).

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:46.290
As you'll recall, that
provision does not

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:51.190
apply when a defendant either has
actual knowledge of infringing material

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:55.020
on its site, or receives a
financial benefit directly

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.540
attributable to infringement,
which the defendant has

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.480
the right and ability to control.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:04.260
Fricklas, as you can see,
contends that YouTube

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:08.590
fails to satisfy both of those
requirements, either of which

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:11.970
is fatal to its 512(c) defense.

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.500
 

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.540
This paragraph, aimed more at
a general, public audience,

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:23.870
explains why, in Viacom's opinion,
it's fair to require sites like YouTube

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:27.390
to purge their systems
of infringing material,

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:33.790
rather than to require copyright owners
constantly to monitor such sites.

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:35.960
So those are the arguments.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.220
The district court sided with
YouTube on all contested issues,

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:43.910
and granted its summary judgment motion.

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:48.930
In 2012 the Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit reversed.

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:51.090
The interpretations
of the key provisions

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:56.350
of section 512 adopted by the Court
of Appeals were, as we will see,

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:59.070
highly favorable to OSPs like YouTube.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:02.480
But not quite as favorable
as the interpretations

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.290
that had been adopted
by the district court.

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:08.170
Thus the Court of Appeals remanded
the case for reconsideration

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:13.020
in light of its clarified rules.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:17.070
Here, then, are the key portions
of the Court of Appeals' opinion.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:21.290
First, the court ruled that
the disqualification contained

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:28.890
in 512)(c)(1)(A)(i) is triggered
only by actual "subjective"

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:32.680
knowledge of specific infringing
material on the dependent's site.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:39.030
Or willful blindness of the
sort that doomed Napster.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:45.080
The disqualification contained in
512)(c)(1)(A)(ii) the so-called red

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:50.790
flag provision, is triggered only by
actual subjective knowledge of facts

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:55.560
that would have made infringement
objectively obvious to a reasonable

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.160
person.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.900
Merely being aware that there's lots
of infringing material on one's site

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:05.320
is not enough to trigger
either of those provisions.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.230
However, the court
ruled, Viacom had pointed

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:13.000
to a few instances in which internal
correspondence by YouTube executives

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.290
suggested that they were aware
of specific infringing files

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:22.370
on their site, from which a jury might
infer the requisite level of knowledge.

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:25.060
 

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:28.830
Next, the Court of Appeals ruled
that the disqualification contained

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:35.490
in 512)(c)(1)(B) is triggered only by
proof of somewhat greater control over

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:41.710
the infringing behavior than is required
for ordinary vicarious infringement.

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:46.970
Otherwise, the court pointed
out, the safe harbor of 512(c)

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:49.740
wouldn't be of much value,
because would give defendants

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:54.735
immunity only from conduct that would
not trigger vicarious liability anyway.

00:40:54.735 --> 00:40:57.250
 

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:00.720
So what sort of additional control would
cause a forfeiture of the safe harbor

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.480
protection?

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:08.160
Not merely the ability to block access
to material posted on its service,

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.960
but perhaps the sort of
"purposeful, culpable expression

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:17.510
and conduct" that, as we saw, the
Supreme Court in Grokster suggested

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:19.600
would give rise to
liability for inducement.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.450
 

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:24.660
Uncertain on the score,
the Court of Appeals

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.090
suggested that the district
court think about it further.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:29.600
 

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.240
Finally, the Court of Appeals
construed 512(c) itself, broadly,

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:38.110
interpreting it to apply to all
software functions performed

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:42.820
by sites like YouTube "for the
purpose of facilitating access

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:49.020
to user stored material."

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:53.840
The state of the law governing
OSPs after the Viacom decision,

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.090
might be depicted
graphically as follows.

00:41:57.090 --> 00:42:01.370
As you now know, OSPs are potentially
liable not just for direct copyright

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:05.760
infringement, but also for any of
the forms of secondary infringement,

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:12.910
contributory, vicarious, and,
post-Grokster, inducement.

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:16.350
Section 512(c) not only
gives greater specificity

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:20.900
to the limits of those doctrine,
but also, more importantly,

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:28.480
allows OSPs to engage in some kinds of
conduct that, in the absence of 512,

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.310
would give rise to liability.

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:37.330
In particular, hosting material without
enough specific or red flag knowledge

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:41.660
that particular pieces are infringing
to trigger the disqualifications

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.650
of 512)(c)(1)(A).

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:46.927
And without the tight level of
control necessary to trigger

00:42:46.927 --> 00:42:48.510
the disqualification of 512)(c)(1)(B).

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:51.340
 

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:55.440
Exactly what kinds of conduct
fall into the zones identified

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.710
by the arrows in this diagram
will have to be worked out

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:00.800
in subsequent litigation.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:09.290
But this seems to be the structure
that OSPs must and may now rely upon,

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:15.520
at least if the Second
Circuit approach holds.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.340
This concludes our discussion
of secondary liability

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:22.290
and the especially troublesome issues
presented by so-called dual use

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:23.850
technologies.

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:26.930
After the break, we'll turn
to a very different topic,

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:29.860
technological protection measures.

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.072
