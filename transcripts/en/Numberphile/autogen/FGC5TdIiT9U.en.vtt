I think that's what sequences in Spanish

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130
I think that's what sequences in Spanish

you're watching he is a teacher in

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340
you're watching he is a teacher in
 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.299
you're watching he is a teacher in
Colombia and he invented the sequence

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309
Colombia and he invented the sequence
 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.520
Colombia and he invented the sequence
called the recommend sequence which has

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530
called the recommend sequence which has
 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.100
called the recommend sequence which has
got all the sequence people crazy

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110
got all the sequence people crazy
 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.869
got all the sequence people crazy
because it's like really interesting and

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879
because it's like really interesting and
 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.479
because it's like really interesting and
really fun so it's really much easier to

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489
really fun so it's really much easier to
 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.730
really fun so it's really much easier to
explain how this works on a number line

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740
explain how this works on a number line
 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.069
explain how this works on a number line
okay so just say this is not and this is

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079
okay so just say this is not and this is
 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.479
okay so just say this is not and this is
one two three four again I'm Evan twelve

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489
one two three four again I'm Evan twelve
 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.700
one two three four again I'm Evan twelve
thirteen and we go on okay so what we're

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710
thirteen and we go on okay so what we're
 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.380
thirteen and we go on okay so what we're
gonna do we're gonna go air hops we're

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390
gonna do we're gonna go air hops we're
 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.360
gonna do we're gonna go air hops we're
going to start at zero and the first hop

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370
going to start at zero and the first hop
 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.760
going to start at zero and the first hop
is one and then the next hop is two then

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770
is one and then the next hop is two then
 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.790
is one and then the next hop is two then
the next hop is three so each iteration

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800
the next hop is three so each iteration
 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.370
the next hop is three so each iteration
you add one to the hop okay dead easy

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380
you add one to the hop okay dead easy
 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.010
you add one to the hop okay dead easy
and the rule is I pass the mpany always

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020
and the rule is I pass the mpany always
 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.740
and the rule is I pass the mpany always
back but if you can't go back because

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750
back but if you can't go back because
 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.870
back but if you can't go back because
the number has already been used then

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880
the number has already been used then
 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.520
the number has already been used then
you got to go forward we start at zero

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530
you got to go forward we start at zero
 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.719
you got to go forward we start at zero
so then we add one we hop one one I've

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729
so then we add one we hop one one I've
 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.690
so then we add one we hop one one I've
got to go to we've got to go backwards

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700
got to go to we've got to go backwards
 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.560
got to go to we've got to go backwards
can go backwards to go forwards two

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570
can go backwards to go forwards two
 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.580
can go backwards to go forwards two
three can we go backwards

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590
three can we go backwards
 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.180
three can we go backwards
one two three no we can't do that

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190
one two three no we can't do that
 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.310
one two three no we can't do that
yeah so we gotta go forwards one two

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320
yeah so we gotta go forwards one two
 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.870
yeah so we gotta go forwards one two
three we got to get to here now four one

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880
three we got to get to here now four one
 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.789
three we got to get to here now four one
two three four yet we can swing here

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799
two three four yet we can swing here
 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.590
two three four yet we can swing here
back there but at five we'll can't go

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600
back there but at five we'll can't go
 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.750
back there but at five we'll can't go
back so how to get there five one two

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760
back so how to get there five one two
 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.719
back so how to get there five one two
three four five yep and go there five

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729
three four five yep and go there five
 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.030
three four five yep and go there five
six one two three four five six no can't

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040
six one two three four five six no can't
 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.070
six one two three four five six no can't
do that so gotta go here one two three

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080
do that so gotta go here one two three
 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.929
do that so gotta go here one two three
four five six okay you can see how

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939
four five six okay you can see how
 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:53.499
four five six okay you can see how
that's gonna go

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509
that's gonna go
 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.840
that's gonna go
we're kind of gonna do these little

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850
we're kind of gonna do these little
 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.850
we're kind of gonna do these little
weave in and out the question is which

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860
weave in and out the question is which
 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.890
weave in and out the question is which
is of interest and no one knows is every

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900
is of interest and no one knows is every
 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.219
is of interest and no one knows is every
number accounted for so will this

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229
number accounted for so will this
 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.929
number accounted for so will this
ultimately get in every number and it's

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939
ultimately get in every number and it's
 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.340
ultimately get in every number and it's
been tested up serves like some really

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350
been tested up serves like some really
 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.050
been tested up serves like some really
high number but testing it's not the

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060
high number but testing it's not the
 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.639
high number but testing it's not the
same as proving it is it it's assumed

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649
same as proving it is it it's assumed
 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.809
same as proving it is it it's assumed
that this will this will be the case

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819
that this will this will be the case
 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.270
that this will this will be the case
yeah yeah cool I think it's cuz you've

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280
yeah yeah cool I think it's cuz you've
 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.490
yeah yeah cool I think it's cuz you've
got to go back so you're going back and

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500
got to go back so you're going back and
 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.290
got to go back so you're going back and
you're kind of clearing up for yourself

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300
you're kind of clearing up for yourself
 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.390
you're kind of clearing up for yourself
now what's interesting about the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400
now what's interesting about the
 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.970
now what's interesting about the
is because it's very very simple you're

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980
is because it's very very simple you're
 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.380
is because it's very very simple you're
just jumping backwards but if you got

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390
just jumping backwards but if you got
 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.080
just jumping backwards but if you got
you go forward and you get this it's not

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090
you go forward and you get this it's not
 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.610
you go forward and you get this it's not
chaotic but it is it's ordered for a bit

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620
chaotic but it is it's ordered for a bit
 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.440
chaotic but it is it's ordered for a bit
then it is a little bit not all over the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450
then it is a little bit not all over the
 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.000
then it is a little bit not all over the
place then it gets ordered again and

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010
place then it gets ordered again and
 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.899
place then it gets ordered again and
this is easier to see rather than just

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909
this is easier to see rather than just
 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.500
this is easier to see rather than just
looking at numbers this is Julie and our

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510
looking at numbers this is Julie and our
 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.619
looking at numbers this is Julie and our
aliy are you with your eyes or with ears

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629
aliy are you with your eyes or with ears

who I work with a lot has done this

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319
who I work with a lot has done this
 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.580
who I work with a lot has done this
gorgeous representation and to me this

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590
gorgeous representation and to me this
 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.430
gorgeous representation and to me this
looks like you know in the 1950s and 60s

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440
looks like you know in the 1950s and 60s
 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.970
looks like you know in the 1950s and 60s
you would get these artists doing things

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980
you would get these artists doing things
 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.229
you would get these artists doing things
that looked a bit like this kind of bit

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239
that looked a bit like this kind of bit
 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.180
that looked a bit like this kind of bit
geometrical but also you got something a

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190
geometrical but also you got something a
 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.250
geometrical but also you got something a
bit human in also it looks like it

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260
bit human in also it looks like it
 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.800
bit human in also it looks like it
should be your wallpaper in Mad Men yeah

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810
should be your wallpaper in Mad Men yeah
 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.170
should be your wallpaper in Mad Men yeah
definitely it totally could you've got

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180
definitely it totally could you've got
 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.569
definitely it totally could you've got
that mixture of something which is just

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579
that mixture of something which is just
 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.000
that mixture of something which is just
a circle you could get more simple than

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010
a circle you could get more simple than
 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.259
a circle you could get more simple than
that and it's got circles of different

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269
that and it's got circles of different
 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.460
that and it's got circles of different
sizes and they all fitted together

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470
sizes and they all fitted together
 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.160
sizes and they all fitted together
nicely when you look in there's like a

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170
nicely when you look in there's like a
 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.660
nicely when you look in there's like a
bit of a mess of how are they joining

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670
bit of a mess of how are they joining
 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.860
bit of a mess of how are they joining
there's a bit of chaos

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870
there's a bit of chaos
 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.699
there's a bit of chaos
it's standardly beautiful but with a

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709
it's standardly beautiful but with a
 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.290
it's standardly beautiful but with a
little bit of the unknown

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300
little bit of the unknown

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.280
 
in fact if you saw here this bit here

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290
in fact if you saw here this bit here
 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.870
in fact if you saw here this bit here
where it starts off with a loch ness

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880
where it starts off with a loch ness
 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.520
where it starts off with a loch ness
monster and then doubles back and goes

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530
monster and then doubles back and goes
 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.400
monster and then doubles back and goes
on you've got that there so the actual

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410
on you've got that there so the actual
 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.430
on you've got that there so the actual
number line is the diagonal along here

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440
number line is the diagonal along here

well what he's done yeah wherever you're

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660
well what he's done yeah wherever you're
 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.360
well what he's done yeah wherever you're
joined you actually have a proper

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370
joined you actually have a proper
 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.400
joined you actually have a proper
semicircle whereas I've just done it

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410
semicircle whereas I've just done it
 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.220
semicircle whereas I've just done it
with a sort of I don't know what this is

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230
with a sort of I don't know what this is
 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.520
with a sort of I don't know what this is
a kind of human sort of grasping at a

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530
a kind of human sort of grasping at a
 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.680
a kind of human sort of grasping at a
circle or as when you when you do it and

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690
circle or as when you when you do it and
 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.140
circle or as when you when you do it and
obviously if it's a semicircle the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150
obviously if it's a semicircle the
 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.630
obviously if it's a semicircle the
radius is getting weaker so the bit the

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640
radius is getting weaker so the bit the
 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.950
radius is getting weaker so the bit the
bigger the size that the higher it's

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960
bigger the size that the higher it's
 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.420
bigger the size that the higher it's
going to be it's kind of getting bigger

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430
going to be it's kind of getting bigger
 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.740
going to be it's kind of getting bigger
but then it gets smaller again but then

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750
but then it gets smaller again but then
 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.270
but then it gets smaller again but then
he gets bigger and then it has getting

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280
he gets bigger and then it has getting
 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.940
he gets bigger and then it has getting
smaller again ya know so we've got the
