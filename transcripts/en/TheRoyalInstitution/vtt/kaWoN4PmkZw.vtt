[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.810
I'm in London to talk
about the eye.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.540
It's one of the most
impressive feats of

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.870
engineering that you're
likely to see.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.880
But I'm not talking about
the London Eye.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.990
I'm talking about
the human eye.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:49.320
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.910
Now we know that the eye is an
incredible mechanical marvel.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.750
But when you stare into
someone's eyes, you're not

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.520
thinking about engineering.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.470
The first thing that you usually
notice is the colour,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.460
and the colour of the eyes is
down in part to a gene on

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.870
Chromosome 15.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.260
Now that gene is known as
OCA2 or, to you or me,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.250
oculocutaneous albinism II.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.190
Now in order to work out how the
colour in the eye works,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.830
let's have a closer look.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.580
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.320
The coloured part of the
eye is the iris.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.340
And in the iris, the OCA2 gene
gives instructions for the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.550
production of a pigment
called melanin.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.910
Now when lots of melanin is
produced, the result is dark

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.890
brown eyes.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.480
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.180
When little or no melanin is
produced, we get blue eyes.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.310
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.600
Now the blue doesn't come from a
coloured structure or a blue

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.530
pigment, but arises from light
being scattered through the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.440
iris in a similar way to how
light scatters through the

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.330
earth's atmosphere and
gives us a blue sky.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.100
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.210
Although we don't yet fully
understand the genetics of it,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.780
it's the same kind of cells
and the same production of

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.840
melanin that causes our skin
to darken a few days after

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.580
we've been in the sun.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.990
Although in the middle of winter
in England, I think

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.110
that's unlikely to happen
anytime soon.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:41.679
