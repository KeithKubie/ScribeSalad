00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:39.180
at the same time they release chemicals
that paralyze the caterpillar

nothing you can do

transformation but ironically one of the
 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.550
transformation but ironically one of the
greatest dangers the larvae will face is

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560
greatest dangers the larvae will face is
 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.090
greatest dangers the larvae will face is
being themselves impregnated by other

wounded caterpillar helps them out

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270
 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.230

silken blanket to make its own cocoon
 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.680
silken blanket to make its own cocoon
but the parasitized caterpillar spins

but the parasitized caterpillar spins
 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.610
but the parasitized caterpillar spins
his blanket on top of the wasp cocoons

his blanket on top of the wasp cocoons
 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.720

giving them an extra layer of protection

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.460
scientists believe the same wasp virus
that infected it weeks before has now

that infected it weeks before has now
 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.620
that infected it weeks before has now
invaded the caterpillars brain and

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630
invaded the caterpillars brain and
 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.500
invaded the caterpillars brain and
caused this bizarre corruption of its

caused this bizarre corruption of its
 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.760

normal behavior amazingly the

caterpillars natural aggression is now

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290
caterpillars natural aggression is now
 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:25.560
caterpillars natural aggression is now
also exploited by the wasp virus

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570
 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.450
the caterpillar becomes a bodyguard

the caterpillar becomes a bodyguard

actively protecting the cocoons
 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.510
actively protecting the cocoons
from other parasites it will watch over

from other parasites it will watch over
 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.100
from other parasites it will watch over
them unceasingly until it eventually

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110
them unceasingly until it eventually
 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.380
them unceasingly until it eventually
starves to death
