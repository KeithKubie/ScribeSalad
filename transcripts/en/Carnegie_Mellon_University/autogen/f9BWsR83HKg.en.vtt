to help them innovate so there's

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530
to help them innovate so there's
 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.960
to help them innovate so there's
stage-gate processes and there's things

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970
stage-gate processes and there's things
 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.310
stage-gate processes and there's things
called voice of the customer and I won't

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320
called voice of the customer and I won't
 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.320

kind of an unusual opportunity to not
 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:01.719
kind of an unusual opportunity to not
just be a practitioner of an innovation

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729
just be a practitioner of an innovation
 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.279
just be a practitioner of an innovation
not just go out and try to do innovation

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289
not just go out and try to do innovation
 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:04.659
not just go out and try to do innovation
but to really think about it

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669
but to really think about it
 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.670
but to really think about it
conceptually to really think about you

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680
conceptually to really think about you
 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.960
conceptually to really think about you
know what's the heart of innovation and

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970
know what's the heart of innovation and
 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.040
know what's the heart of innovation and
how can you teach people to be

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050
how can you teach people to be
 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.719
how can you teach people to be
innovative and what kind of tools do you

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729
innovative and what kind of tools do you
 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.540
innovative and what kind of tools do you
need to to give them so i'll be sharing

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550

more entrepreneurial stuff now it's i

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080
more entrepreneurial stuff now it's i
 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.450
more entrepreneurial stuff now it's i
still consider it innovation and i'll

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460
still consider it innovation and i'll
 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.339
still consider it innovation and i'll
talk a little bit about that too it's a

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349
talk a little bit about that too it's a
 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:28.510
talk a little bit about that too it's a
little bit more on the business side of

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520
little bit more on the business side of
 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.740
little bit more on the business side of
innovation trying to create new

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750
innovation trying to create new
 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.870
innovation trying to create new
businesses but I've been doing that most

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880
businesses but I've been doing that most
 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.530
businesses but I've been doing that most
recently so here's the

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540
recently so here's the
 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.580
recently so here's the
uh what is bugging and hopefully you

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590
uh what is bugging and hopefully you
 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.010
uh what is bugging and hopefully you
guys will do I got a light nope

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020
guys will do I got a light nope
 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.940
guys will do I got a light nope
nevermind and I'll talk a little bit

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950
nevermind and I'll talk a little bit
 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.170
nevermind and I'll talk a little bit
about it the history of bug you but just

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180
about it the history of bug you but just
 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.700
about it the history of bug you but just
so you can kind of see it this is a map

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710
so you can kind of see it this is a map
 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.320
so you can kind of see it this is a map
well touching so this is tech streak so

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330
well touching so this is tech streak so
 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.230
well touching so this is tech streak so
that's dia fodder Margot Morrison go

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240
that's dia fodder Margot Morrison go
 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.760
that's dia fodder Margot Morrison go
through Schenley Park and then move back

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770
through Schenley Park and then move back
 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.430
through Schenley Park and then move back
here on through and it's a sport and

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440
here on through and it's a sport and
 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.830
here on through and it's a sport and
it's a sport unique to this campus and

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840
it's a sport unique to this campus and
 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.500
it's a sport unique to this campus and
it's a combination of a human powered

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510
it's a combination of a human powered
 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.050
it's a combination of a human powered
vehicle race and a gravity race so

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060
vehicle race and a gravity race so
 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.900
vehicle race and a gravity race so
basically what happens is from a

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910
basically what happens is from a
 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.560
basically what happens is from a
standing start at the bottom of tech you

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570
standing start at the bottom of tech you
 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.100
standing start at the bottom of tech you
push this buggy up a hill and then right

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110
push this buggy up a hill and then right
 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.630
push this buggy up a hill and then right
about here there's a transition where

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640
about here there's a transition where
 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.760
about here there's a transition where
one person releases the buggy and then a

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770
one person releases the buggy and then a
 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.440
one person releases the buggy and then a
second person comes it starts pushing it

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450
second person comes it starts pushing it
 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.520
second person comes it starts pushing it
so you get a little bit of a relay race

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530
so you get a little bit of a relay race
 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.040
so you get a little bit of a relay race
kind of saying takes it over the crest

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050
kind of saying takes it over the crest
 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.990
kind of saying takes it over the crest
of the hill and then throws the buggy

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000
of the hill and then throws the buggy
 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.370
of the hill and then throws the buggy
down you can see this person here kind

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380
down you can see this person here kind
 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.290
down you can see this person here kind
of throwing buggies and goes and what's

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300
of throwing buggies and goes and what's
 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.180
of throwing buggies and goes and what's
called the freeroll so now it's a

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190
called the freeroll so now it's a
 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.430
called the freeroll so now it's a
gravity race so now what might be more

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440
gravity race so now what might be more
 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.650
gravity race so now what might be more
familiar to you guys who haven't you

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660
familiar to you guys who haven't you
 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.500
familiar to you guys who haven't you
know don't know about buggy yet big like

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510
know don't know about buggy yet big like
 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.720
know don't know about buggy yet big like
a soap box derby race right so bucks the

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730
a soap box derby race right so bucks the
 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.010
a soap box derby race right so bucks the
race you build a car go straight

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020
race you build a car go straight
 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.960
race you build a car go straight
downhill right now this is a little bit

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970
downhill right now this is a little bit
 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.640
downhill right now this is a little bit
more complicated because obviously there

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650
more complicated because obviously there
 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.400
more complicated because obviously there
are lots and lots of turns so it's not a

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410
are lots and lots of turns so it's not a
 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.350
are lots and lots of turns so it's not a
straight course like soap box derby is

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360
straight course like soap box derby is
 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.840
straight course like soap box derby is
and then one of the kind of cruel things

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850
and then one of the kind of cruel things
 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.150
and then one of the kind of cruel things
about it is that the lowest portion of

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160
about it is that the lowest portion of
 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.160
about it is that the lowest portion of
the of the race which is right about

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.170
the of the race which is right about
 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.570
the of the race which is right about
here so you're going too fast if you can

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580
here so you're going too fast if you can
 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.640
here so you're going too fast if you can
the gravity race he's going approaching

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650
the gravity race he's going approaching
 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.440
the gravity race he's going approaching
40 miles an hour you have to make a

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.450
40 miles an hour you have to make a
 

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.210
40 miles an hour you have to make a
really really sharp turn to go through

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220
really really sharp turn to go through
 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.980
really really sharp turn to go through
this area called the shoot so there's

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990
this area called the shoot so there's
 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.810
this area called the shoot so there's
always kind of issues about stability of

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:10.820
always kind of issues about stability of
 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.790
always kind of issues about stability of
getting through there then what'll end

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800
getting through there then what'll end
 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.200
getting through there then what'll end
up happening and here's a picture of it

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.210
up happening and here's a picture of it
 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.650
up happening and here's a picture of it
go to the shoot but you'll come back up

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:16.660
go to the shoot but you'll come back up
 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.940
go to the shoot but you'll come back up
back down here there's another person

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:18.950
back down here there's another person
 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.590
back down here there's another person
will then pick it up run behind the

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:20.600
will then pick it up run behind the
 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.600
will then pick it up run behind the
buggy it's a hill 3 and there's two

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:22.610
buggy it's a hill 3 and there's two
 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.840
buggy it's a hill 3 and there's two
other people that finish the hill on

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:24.850
other people that finish the hill on
 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.310
other people that finish the hill on
going up through tech and then finally

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:27.320
going up through tech and then finally
 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.680
going up through tech and then finally
here's the finish finishes right here

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:31.690
here's the finish finishes right here
 

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.460
here's the finish finishes right here
one of the interesting things about

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.470
one of the interesting things about
 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.820
one of the interesting things about
again a cruel thing about the way the

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.830
again a cruel thing about the way the
 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.920
again a cruel thing about the way the
race is run is one of the rules is is

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:38.930
race is run is one of the rules is is
 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.270
race is run is one of the rules is is
when the buggy crosses the finish line

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.280
when the buggy crosses the finish line
 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.700
when the buggy crosses the finish line
the last pusher the hill 5 person has to

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:42.710
the last pusher the hill 5 person has to
 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.080
the last pusher the hill 5 person has to
be touching the buggy has to be touching

the handlebars so it's one of these

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:45.590
the handlebars so it's one of these
 

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.080

faster than someone can run and there's
 

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.409
faster than someone can run and there's
these people at the end diving to try to

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:53.419
these people at the end diving to try to
 

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:54.909
these people at the end diving to try to
touch the buggy and it gets pretty

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:54.919
touch the buggy and it gets pretty
 

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:57.999
touch the buggy and it gets pretty
dramatic so this is what buggy is now

00:07:57.999 --> 00:07:58.009
dramatic so this is what buggy is now
 

00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:02.140

going so a lot of changes but finally in

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:50.630
going so a lot of changes but finally in
 

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.650

the 30s you ended up getting buggies now

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:53.660
the 30s you ended up getting buggies now
 

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.210

that started to look kind of like modern

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:55.220

really big in buggy circles and this is

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:24.620
really big in buggy circles and this is
 

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.910
really big in buggy circles and this is
the illustration he uses about why women

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920
the illustration he uses about why women
 

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.620

that picture are pyka drivers and you
 

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:33.970
that picture are pyka drivers and you
can kind of see you know as soon as you

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:33.980
can kind of see you know as soon as you
 

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.720
can kind of see you know as soon as you
start going to you know two women you

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:37.730
start going to you know two women you
 

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.519
start going to you know two women you
could get lots of small people so it's

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:39.529
could get lots of small people so it's
 

00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:41.079
could get lots of small people so it's
lighter and that ends up becoming a

00:09:41.079 --> 00:09:41.089
lighter and that ends up becoming a
 

00:09:41.089 --> 00:09:44.440
lighter and that ends up becoming a
really really important part of you know

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:44.450
really really important part of you know
 

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.699
really really important part of you know
one of the basic kind of things with

00:09:45.699 --> 00:09:45.709
one of the basic kind of things with
 

00:09:45.709 --> 00:09:48.430
one of the basic kind of things with
this is with a buggy since I'm a lot of

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440
this is with a buggy since I'm a lot of
 

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.260
this is with a buggy since I'm a lot of
that race you're pushing it when you're

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:50.270
that race you're pushing it when you're
 

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.180
that race you're pushing it when you're
pushing something that's lighter you

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:52.190
pushing something that's lighter you
 

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.949
pushing something that's lighter you
know it's a lot easier to push there's a

00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959
know it's a lot easier to push there's a
 

00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:56.440
know it's a lot easier to push there's a
big advantage to that and women sorry to

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:56.450
big advantage to that and women sorry to
 

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.780
big advantage to that and women sorry to
push as well and then finally the last

00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:58.790
push as well and then finally the last
 

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.990
push as well and then finally the last
really major rule

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000
really major rule
 

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.080
really major rule
change that affected what buggy is was

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:03.090
change that affected what buggy is was
 

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.260
change that affected what buggy is was
an 89 just after I'd left and they had

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:06.270
an 89 just after I'd left and they had
 

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.630
an 89 just after I'd left and they had
outlawed two-wheel buggies and the

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640
outlawed two-wheel buggies and the
 

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.740
outlawed two-wheel buggies and the
reason with two will buggies kind of

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:09.750
reason with two will buggies kind of
 

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.930
reason with two will buggies kind of
like bicycles or modified bicycles they

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:11.940
like bicycles or modified bicycles they
 

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.150
like bicycles or modified bicycles they
have a tendency you flop over a lot so

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160
have a tendency you flop over a lot so
 

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.740
have a tendency you flop over a lot so
they're not very stable but they can be

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:15.750
they're not very stable but they can be
 

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.570
they're not very stable but they can be
they can be actually go pretty fast

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:17.580
they can be actually go pretty fast
 

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.210
they can be actually go pretty fast
especially when they're in a fairing so

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:20.220
especially when they're in a fairing so
 

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.590
especially when they're in a fairing so
from a safety perspective just from the

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600
from a safety perspective just from the
 

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.970
from a safety perspective just from the
lack of stability rather than trying to

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980
lack of stability rather than trying to
 

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.140
lack of stability rather than trying to
figure out how to make them stable they

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:24.150
figure out how to make them stable they
 

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.360
figure out how to make them stable they
just were outlawed so there's a bit of a

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:26.370
just were outlawed so there's a bit of a
 

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.960
just were outlawed so there's a bit of a
history here's the course record um I

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:29.970
history here's the course record um I
 

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.180
history here's the course record um I
wish I could still when I first put them

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:32.190
wish I could still when I first put them
 

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.430
wish I could still when I first put them
together this presentation I was able to

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440
together this presentation I was able to
 

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.470
together this presentation I was able to
say that quantum leap still had the

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480
say that quantum leap still had the
 

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.900
say that quantum leap still had the
course record we had a 206 something

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:38.910
course record we had a 206 something
 

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.150
course record we had a 206 something
which is I have to point that that's

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.160
which is I have to point that that's
 

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.140
which is I have to point that that's
that that's that blue dot right there

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:44.150
that that's that blue dot right there
 

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.460
that that's that blue dot right there
but since then last couple years the

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:46.470
but since then last couple years the
 

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.750
but since then last couple years the
records actually been broken which is

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760
records actually been broken which is
 

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.730
records actually been broken which is
pretty exciting so the rate the whole

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:49.740
pretty exciting so the rate the whole
 

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.740
pretty exciting so the rate the whole
race takes a little bit over a 2 minutes

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:51.750
race takes a little bit over a 2 minutes
 

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.720
race takes a little bit over a 2 minutes
to run that's a picture of the buggy

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:53.730
to run that's a picture of the buggy
 

00:10:53.730 --> 00:11:00.770
to run that's a picture of the buggy
that holds the record so again just a

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:00.780
that holds the record so again just a
 

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.910
that holds the record so again just a
little a little introduction at least

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920
little a little introduction at least
 

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.770
little a little introduction at least
but what buggy is now I want to start

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:03.780
but what buggy is now I want to start
 

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.670
but what buggy is now I want to start
talking about innovation and when I

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680
talking about innovation and when I
 

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.010
talking about innovation and when I
first want to do is try to get clear on

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:10.020
first want to do is try to get clear on
 

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.770
first want to do is try to get clear on
some definitions people I think have

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:12.780
some definitions people I think have
 

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.520
some definitions people I think have
different ideas of what innovation means

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:15.530
different ideas of what innovation means
 

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.020
different ideas of what innovation means
and sometimes you think you're talking

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:18.030
and sometimes you think you're talking
 

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.220
and sometimes you think you're talking
saying the same thing when everyone's

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:19.230
saying the same thing when everyone's
 

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.300
saying the same thing when everyone's
talking about innovation you may be

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:20.310
talking about innovation you may be
 

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.280
talking about innovation you may be
talking about very different things and

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:22.290
talking about very different things and
 

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.800
talking about very different things and
for me this is a mental model that

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:24.810
for me this is a mental model that
 

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.660
for me this is a mental model that
actually a colleague of mine got my

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:26.670
actually a colleague of mine got my
 

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.460
actually a colleague of mine got my
native Jim white came up with at praxair

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:28.470
native Jim white came up with at praxair
 

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.170
native Jim white came up with at praxair
and I really really really like this

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:30.180
and I really really really like this
 

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.579
and I really really really like this
model I don't think this is a really

00:11:31.579 --> 00:11:31.589
model I don't think this is a really
 

00:11:31.589 --> 00:11:33.230
model I don't think this is a really
succinct way of explaining what

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240
succinct way of explaining what
 

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.420
succinct way of explaining what
innovation is and as an engineer I like

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:35.430
innovation is and as an engineer I like
 

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.610
innovation is and as an engineer I like
to see it in an equation format right so

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:37.620
to see it in an equation format right so
 

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.380
to see it in an equation format right so
the whole point is innovation is

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:39.390
the whole point is innovation is
 

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.920
the whole point is innovation is
invention plus application equals equals

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:42.930
invention plus application equals equals
 

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.900
invention plus application equals equals
the innovation so the invention part of

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:44.910
the innovation so the invention part of
 

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.310
the innovation so the invention part of
it just need a simple in a dictionary

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320
it just need a simple in a dictionary
 

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.260
it just need a simple in a dictionary
definition when you're inventing what

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:48.270
definition when you're inventing what
 

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.460
definition when you're inventing what
are you doing you're bringing something

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:49.470
are you doing you're bringing something
 

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.140
are you doing you're bringing something
new you bring something novel to the

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:51.150
new you bring something novel to the
 

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.060
new you bring something novel to the
world so that inventors are really

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:53.070
world so that inventors are really
 

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.590
world so that inventors are really
really important part of innovation part

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600
really important part of innovation part
 

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.579
really important part of innovation part
of it is you're doing something new

00:11:55.579 --> 00:11:55.589
of it is you're doing something new
 

00:11:55.589 --> 00:11:56.600
of it is you're doing something new
you're doing so that's never been done

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:56.610
you're doing so that's never been done
 

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.180
you're doing so that's never been done
before but just that app just that act

00:11:59.180 --> 00:11:59.190
before but just that app just that act
 

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.280
before but just that app just that act
of creating something new really is an

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:01.290
of creating something new really is an
 

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.900
of creating something new really is an
innovation you have to take that

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:02.910
innovation you have to take that
 

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.270

value now that value can be monetary I
 

00:12:19.589 --> 00:12:20.750
value now that value can be monetary I
mean I tend to think about things that

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760
mean I tend to think about things that
 

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.490

applying it and making something happen
 

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.810
applying it and making something happen
so I'm going to give you some examples

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820
so I'm going to give you some examples
 

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:49.040
so I'm going to give you some examples
of and of what innovation is to kind of

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:49.050
of and of what innovation is to kind of
 

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.780
of and of what innovation is to kind of
hopefully prove my point to you guys

application this is an example of some

00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399
application this is an example of some
 

00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:57.889
application this is an example of some
work that i did when i was at praxair

00:12:57.889 --> 00:12:57.899
work that i did when i was at praxair
 

00:12:57.899 --> 00:13:01.490
work that i did when i was at praxair
and basically it's pretty cool

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500
and basically it's pretty cool
 

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.650
and basically it's pretty cool
technology it's a pretty neat pretty it

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:03.660
technology it's a pretty neat pretty it
 

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.600
technology it's a pretty neat pretty it
was a pretty neat project to work on but

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:05.610
was a pretty neat project to work on but
 

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.250
was a pretty neat project to work on but
it's a device that we call up time and

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:07.260
it's a device that we call up time and
 

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.680
it's a device that we call up time and
basically what it is it's a little gizmo

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:09.690
basically what it is it's a little gizmo
 

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.069
basically what it is it's a little gizmo
that set in the valve that's in a gas

00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079
that set in the valve that's in a gas
 

00:13:13.079 --> 00:13:15.559
that set in the valve that's in a gas
cylinder and it's a little safety device

00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:15.569
cylinder and it's a little safety device
 

00:13:15.569 --> 00:13:16.790
cylinder and it's a little safety device
and basically what you can do you can

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800
and basically what you can do you can
 

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.170
and basically what you can do you can
take a cylinder you can open up the

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180
take a cylinder you can open up the
 

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.240
take a cylinder you can open up the
cylinder valve and nothing will come out

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:20.250
cylinder valve and nothing will come out
 

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.980
cylinder valve and nothing will come out
of it unless you pull a vacuum on that

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:21.990
of it unless you pull a vacuum on that
 

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.780
of it unless you pull a vacuum on that
open you have to basically pull a vacuum

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:23.790
open you have to basically pull a vacuum
 

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.639
open you have to basically pull a vacuum
opens up a little mechanical switch and

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:25.649
opens up a little mechanical switch and
 

00:13:25.649 --> 00:13:27.949
opens up a little mechanical switch and
it allows flow reason why this is

00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959
it allows flow reason why this is
 

00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:29.300
it allows flow reason why this is
important or reason why this is relevant

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:29.310
important or reason why this is relevant
 

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.280
important or reason why this is relevant
is you have to understand its

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:31.290
is you have to understand its
 

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.990
is you have to understand its
application and it's specifically

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000
application and it's specifically
 

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.900
application and it's specifically
designed for iron in planters which are

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:35.910
designed for iron in planters which are
 

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.610
designed for iron in planters which are
basically kind of the heart of a

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:37.620
basically kind of the heart of a
 

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.069
basically kind of the heart of a
semiconductor fab and I on implants

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079
semiconductor fab and I on implants
 

00:13:40.079 --> 00:13:42.110
semiconductor fab and I on implants
based in planters or how you end up in

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120
based in planters or how you end up in
 

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.110
based in planters or how you end up in
pedo silicon chips and basically what

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120
pedo silicon chips and basically what
 

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.370
pedo silicon chips and basically what
you do if you want to put arsenic into

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.380
you do if you want to put arsenic into
 

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.590
you do if you want to put arsenic into
your chip you take a gas and say it's

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600
your chip you take a gas and say it's
 

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.079
your chip you take a gas and say it's
arcing blow it apart in an ionization

00:13:51.079 --> 00:13:51.089
arcing blow it apart in an ionization
 

00:13:51.089 --> 00:13:52.610
arcing blow it apart in an ionization
chamber so you just get it to its

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620
chamber so you just get it to its
 

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.610
chamber so you just get it to its
constituent ions mass let the arsenic I

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:55.620
constituent ions mass let the arsenic I
 

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.650
constituent ions mass let the arsenic I
on and then you accelerate it into the

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:57.660
on and then you accelerate it into the
 

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.910
on and then you accelerate it into the
chip at something like three million

00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920
chip at something like three million
 

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.949
chip at something like three million
five billion volts and that's how you

00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959
five billion volts and that's how you
 

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:03.230
five billion volts and that's how you
implant these things the reason why

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240
implant these things the reason why
 

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.379
implant these things the reason why
that's a problem is all the gases or

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:06.389
that's a problem is all the gases or
 

00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:07.910
that's a problem is all the gases or
just about all the gases are used for

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920
just about all the gases are used for
 

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.180
just about all the gases are used for
implant are really toxic really

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:11.190
implant are really toxic really
 

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.610
implant are really toxic really
pyrophoric really corrosive like really

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:13.620
pyrophoric really corrosive like really
 

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.069
pyrophoric really corrosive like really
nasty deadly gases matter of fact a lot

00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079
nasty deadly gases matter of fact a lot
 

00:14:16.079 --> 00:14:17.480
nasty deadly gases matter of fact a lot
of the chemicals there's not most of the

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:17.490
of the chemicals there's not most of the
 

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.009
of the chemicals there's not most of the
chemicals used to make semiconductors

00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:19.019
chemicals used to make semiconductors
 

00:14:19.019 --> 00:14:20.780
chemicals used to make semiconductors
are pretty difficult to deal with and

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:20.790
are pretty difficult to deal with and
 

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.090
are pretty difficult to deal with and
the way a semiconductor fab tip

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:23.100
the way a semiconductor fab tip
 

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.370
the way a semiconductor fab tip
deals with this is you'll have your fab

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:25.380
deals with this is you'll have your fab
 

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.390
deals with this is you'll have your fab
floor which will have all the

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:26.400
floor which will have all the
 

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.710
floor which will have all the
semiconductor tools all this stuff it's

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720
semiconductor tools all this stuff it's
 

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.990
semiconductor tools all this stuff it's
processing the silicon wafers then in

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000
processing the silicon wafers then in
 

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.880
processing the silicon wafers then in
the basement our gas cabinets and

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:31.890
the basement our gas cabinets and
 

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.650
the basement our gas cabinets and
chemical cabinets so all of them are

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660
chemical cabinets so all of them are
 

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.150
chemical cabinets so all of them are
isolated and especially vent alized

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160
isolated and especially vent alized
 

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.000
isolated and especially vent alized
ventilated containers but you can't do

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.010
ventilated containers but you can't do
 

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.650
ventilated containers but you can't do
that with an ion implant machine because

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660
that with an ion implant machine because
 

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.690
that with an ion implant machine because
then that gas cabinet has to be at the

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:41.700
then that gas cabinet has to be at the
 

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.700
then that gas cabinet has to be at the
same voltage is the ion chamber so it's

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:43.710
same voltage is the ion chamber so it's
 

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:44.990
same voltage is the ion chamber so it's
at three million volts so now you have a

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000
at three million volts so now you have a
 

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.060
at three million volts so now you have a
gas cabinet you have gas lines there are

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:47.070
gas cabinet you have gas lines there are
 

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.170
gas cabinet you have gas lines there are
three million volts that are sneaking

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:48.180
three million volts that are sneaking
 

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.670
three million volts that are sneaking
through your fab so that's a really

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680
through your fab so that's a really
 

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.530
through your fab so that's a really
really bad problem so it's the one

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:51.540
really bad problem so it's the one
 

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:52.880
really bad problem so it's the one
exception as far as I know it's the only

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:52.890
exception as far as I know it's the only
 

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.400
exception as far as I know it's the only
exception in a semiconductor fab where

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:55.410
exception in a semiconductor fab where
 

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.470
exception in a semiconductor fab where
your gas cabinet is actually attached to

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480
your gas cabinet is actually attached to
 

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.060
your gas cabinet is actually attached to
the unit operations actually attached to

00:14:59.060 --> 00:14:59.070
the unit operations actually attached to
 

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.100
the unit operations actually attached to
the ion implanter ok now this creates

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:01.110
the ion implanter ok now this creates
 

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:02.990
the ion implanter ok now this creates
another problem which is you've got to

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000
another problem which is you've got to
 

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.400
another problem which is you've got to
change that thing out you run out of gas

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:04.410
change that thing out you run out of gas
 

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:05.870
change that thing out you run out of gas
and you need to put more are seen in or

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880
and you need to put more are seen in or
 

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.790
and you need to put more are seen in or
phosphine or whatever now you have to

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800
phosphine or whatever now you have to
 

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.380
phosphine or whatever now you have to
take a cylinder of gas and walk it

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:09.390
take a cylinder of gas and walk it
 

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.270
take a cylinder of gas and walk it
through your fab floor now as I said

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:11.280
through your fab floor now as I said
 

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.550
through your fab floor now as I said
before it's really really toxic really

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560
before it's really really toxic really
 

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.860
before it's really really toxic really
corrosive you open up that bottle you

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:15.870
corrosive you open up that bottle you
 

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.990
corrosive you open up that bottle you
let gas out in your fab you're gonna can

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000
let gas out in your fab you're gonna can
 

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.630
let gas out in your fab you're gonna can
really hurt people and kill people and

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:19.640
really hurt people and kill people and
 

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.980
really hurt people and kill people and
you'll have to shut down the fab you

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:21.990
you'll have to shut down the fab you
 

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.900
you'll have to shut down the fab you
know and you know an hour of fab time is

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:23.910
know and you know an hour of fab time is
 

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.910
know and you know an hour of fab time is
millions of dollars in profit with a big

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920
millions of dollars in profit with a big
 

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.950
millions of dollars in profit with a big
semiconductor fab there's a lot of big

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:27.960
semiconductor fab there's a lot of big
 

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.470
semiconductor fab there's a lot of big
issues associated with that so the idea

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480
issues associated with that so the idea
 

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.480
issues associated with that so the idea
is now this is a safety feature right so

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:32.490
is now this is a safety feature right so
 

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:34.190
is now this is a safety feature right so
now you can take a cylinder put a lot of

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:34.200
now you can take a cylinder put a lot of
 

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.720
now you can take a cylinder put a lot of
Arsene into it a really nice you know

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:35.730
Arsene into it a really nice you know
 

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.610
Arsene into it a really nice you know
supply of arcing and again if you walk

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:37.620
supply of arcing and again if you walk
 

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.260
supply of arcing and again if you walk
it down to fab floor and you offer some

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:39.270
it down to fab floor and you offer some
 

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.700
it down to fab floor and you offer some
makes the trip you have some some

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:40.710
makes the trip you have some some
 

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.650
makes the trip you have some some
mistake and the valve opens nothing's

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:42.660
mistake and the valve opens nothing's
 

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.940
mistake and the valve opens nothing's
going to happen again because you have

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:43.950
going to happen again because you have
 

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:45.200
going to happen again because you have
to suck on this thing you have to pull a

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:45.210
to suck on this thing you have to pull a
 

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.180
to suck on this thing you have to pull a
vacuum on it and I named planners

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:47.190
vacuum on it and I named planners
 

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.470
vacuum on it and I named planners
running out vacuum so it all kind of

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480
running out vacuum so it all kind of
 

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.730
running out vacuum so it all kind of
works so going into this isn't an

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:52.740
works so going into this isn't an
 

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.790
works so going into this isn't an
innovation right so the invention of

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800
innovation right so the invention of
 

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.960
innovation right so the invention of
inventions pretty clearly there's

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:56.970
inventions pretty clearly there's
 

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:58.760
inventions pretty clearly there's
patents and there's a little gizmo and

00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:58.770
patents and there's a little gizmo and
 

00:15:58.770 --> 00:15:59.960
patents and there's a little gizmo and
you can get this patent and kind of

00:15:59.960 --> 00:15:59.970
you can get this patent and kind of
 

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:01.940
you can get this patent and kind of
understand how that gizmo works so you

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:01.950
understand how that gizmo works so you
 

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.950
understand how that gizmo works so you
have an invention but that's not

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:03.960
have an invention but that's not
 

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.350
have an invention but that's not
innovation you have to apply it here's a

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360
innovation you have to apply it here's a
 

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.810
innovation you have to apply it here's a
old sales literature that would appear

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820
old sales literature that would appear
 

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.760
old sales literature that would appear
in a semiconductor trade magazine so

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:10.770
in a semiconductor trade magazine so
 

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.650
in a semiconductor trade magazine so
it's your marketing it you're selling it

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:12.660
it's your marketing it you're selling it
 

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.760
it's your marketing it you're selling it
to people you're creating a business

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:13.770
to people you're creating a business
 

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.590
to people you're creating a business
around it so you really are taking this

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600
around it so you really are taking this
 

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.030
around it so you really are taking this
invention and applying into the real

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040
invention and applying into the real
 

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.400
invention and applying into the real
world and they produce innovation and

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:19.410
world and they produce innovation and
 

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.930
world and they produce innovation and
again in this case i'm using i'm

measuring that value that external value

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680
measuring that value that external value
 

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.030
measuring that value that external value
in terms of dollars and it's real data i

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040
in terms of dollars and it's real data i
 

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.950
in terms of dollars and it's real data i
can't really tell you exactly what the

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:27.960
can't really tell you exactly what the
 

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.050
can't really tell you exactly what the
numbers are but if you look at time this

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.060
numbers are but if you look at time this
 

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.050
numbers are but if you look at time this
would be tens of months and dollars are

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.060
would be tens of months and dollars are
 

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.110
would be tens of months and dollars are
tens of millions of dollars so a pretty

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120
tens of millions of dollars so a pretty
 

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.179
tens of millions of dollars so a pretty
classic

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:37.189

I've been involved with is really the
 

00:16:58.709 --> 00:17:00.139
I've been involved with is really the
application part of it and there's

00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:00.149
application part of it and there's
 

00:17:00.149 --> 00:17:02.359
application part of it and there's
actually what we're setting up is a it's

show again applying it creating a

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.020
show again applying it creating a
 

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.449
show again applying it creating a
business finding you know setting up

00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.459
business finding you know setting up
 

00:17:17.459 --> 00:17:18.559
business finding you know setting up
distribution all that sort of stuff

00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:18.569
distribution all that sort of stuff
 

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:20.689
distribution all that sort of stuff
you're applying this technology you're

00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:20.699
you're applying this technology you're
 

00:17:20.699 --> 00:17:22.130
you're applying this technology you're
applying this invention this shoe and

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:22.140
applying this invention this shoe and
 

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.750
applying this invention this shoe and
trying to make a business out of it and

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760
trying to make a business out of it and
 

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.760
trying to make a business out of it and
then the innovation part of it well

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:25.770
then the innovation part of it well
 

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:26.899
then the innovation part of it well
we're trying I don't know if we're

00:17:26.899 --> 00:17:26.909
we're trying I don't know if we're
 

00:17:26.909 --> 00:17:28.340
we're trying I don't know if we're
successful yet so that's where we have

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:28.350
successful yet so that's where we have
 

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:30.019
successful yet so that's where we have
you know little thing this night this is

00:17:30.019 --> 00:17:30.029
you know little thing this night this is
 

00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:32.210
you know little thing this night this is
my hope since it's in the middle but

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:32.220
my hope since it's in the middle but
 

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.620
my hope since it's in the middle but
again you know here's more of a business

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:33.630
again you know here's more of a business
 

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.840
again you know here's more of a business
oriented more entrepreneurial thing but

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:35.850
oriented more entrepreneurial thing but
 

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.899
oriented more entrepreneurial thing but
it's still innovation and here's my

00:17:38.899 --> 00:17:38.909
it's still innovation and here's my
 

00:17:38.909 --> 00:17:42.110
it's still innovation and here's my
argument that the buggy is innovation so

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120
argument that the buggy is innovation so
 

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.649
argument that the buggy is innovation so
using that same you know formalism you

00:17:45.649 --> 00:17:45.659
using that same you know formalism you
 

00:17:45.659 --> 00:17:48.139
using that same you know formalism you
have an invention in this case this is a

00:17:48.139 --> 00:17:48.149
have an invention in this case this is a
 

00:17:48.149 --> 00:17:49.730
have an invention in this case this is a
picture of quantum leap right so we

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:49.740
picture of quantum leap right so we
 

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.380
picture of quantum leap right so we
invented we created we created that bug

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:51.390
invented we created we created that bug
 

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.659
invented we created we created that bug
you create something new then you got to

00:17:53.659 --> 00:17:53.669
you create something new then you got to
 

00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:56.480
you create something new then you got to
apply it right so it's not it's not just

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:56.490
apply it right so it's not it's not just
 

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.399
apply it right so it's not it's not just
having a buggy you have to have races

00:17:58.399 --> 00:17:58.409
having a buggy you have to have races
 

00:17:58.409 --> 00:18:00.289
having a buggy you have to have races
you have to compete so here's a

00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:00.299
you have to compete so here's a
 

00:18:00.299 --> 00:18:02.419
you have to compete so here's a
competing that's an application of this

00:18:02.419 --> 00:18:02.429
competing that's an application of this
 

00:18:02.429 --> 00:18:04.310
competing that's an application of this
technology of that invention and then

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320
technology of that invention and then
 

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.500
technology of that invention and then
finally here it's the innovation here

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:06.510
finally here it's the innovation here
 

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.330
finally here it's the innovation here
the value you know that's a picture of

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:08.340
the value you know that's a picture of
 

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.340
the value you know that's a picture of
us celebrating and this one I when I

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:10.350
us celebrating and this one I when I
 

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.899
us celebrating and this one I when I
when I sent to my friend Elizabeth was

00:18:11.899 --> 00:18:11.909
when I sent to my friend Elizabeth was
 

00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:14.000
when I sent to my friend Elizabeth was
dancing Dave so she knew immediately

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.010
dancing Dave so she knew immediately
 

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.340
dancing Dave so she knew immediately
what picture that was and that's Dave

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:16.350
what picture that was and that's Dave
 

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.590
what picture that was and that's Dave
sours who's actually the chairman the

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600
sours who's actually the chairman the
 

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.149
sours who's actually the chairman the
year after me so he's the one who was

00:18:20.149 --> 00:18:20.159
year after me so he's the one who was
 

00:18:20.159 --> 00:18:21.289
year after me so he's the one who was
the chairman who actually set the record

00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.299
the chairman who actually set the record
 

00:18:21.299 --> 00:18:23.810
the chairman who actually set the record
but this is this is the year before so

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:23.820
but this is this is the year before so
 

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.159
but this is this is the year before so
the innovation here are the value that

00:18:25.159 --> 00:18:25.169
the innovation here are the value that
 

00:18:25.169 --> 00:18:28.039
the innovation here are the value that
you gain you'll buggy was was victory

00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:28.049
you gain you'll buggy was was victory
 

00:18:28.049 --> 00:18:29.149
you gain you'll buggy was was victory
mean that's the external measure of

00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159
mean that's the external measure of
 

00:18:29.159 --> 00:18:31.310
mean that's the external measure of
success but again innovation there's an

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320
success but again innovation there's an
 

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.659
success but again innovation there's an
invention component there's an

00:18:32.659 --> 00:18:32.669
invention component there's an
 

00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:34.760
invention component there's an
application opponent so buggy is

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:34.770
application opponent so buggy is
 

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:38.360
application opponent so buggy is
innovate and innovative activity so just

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:38.370
innovate and innovative activity so just
 

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.460
innovate and innovative activity so just
again one argument first argument I want

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:40.470
again one argument first argument I want
 

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:41.960
again one argument first argument I want
to make is all of these things you know

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:41.970
to make is all of these things you know
 

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.730
to make is all of these things you know
certainly new product development I

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:43.740
certainly new product development I
 

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.430
certainly new product development I
think you can all wrap your heads around

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440
think you can all wrap your heads around
 

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.350
think you can all wrap your heads around
say that yeah thatthat's innovation but

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360
say that yeah thatthat's innovation but
 

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.610
say that yeah thatthat's innovation but
they can I think being an entrepreneur

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:48.620
they can I think being an entrepreneur
 

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.110
they can I think being an entrepreneur
could be innovative and I certainly

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.120
could be innovative and I certainly
 

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.350
could be innovative and I certainly
think a buggy is innovative I want to

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360
think a buggy is innovative I want to
 

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.480
think a buggy is innovative I want to
give you a another kind of theoretical

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:55.490
give you a another kind of theoretical
 

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.100
give you a another kind of theoretical
concert to start to thinking about

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:57.110
concert to start to thinking about
 

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.509
concert to start to thinking about
things and this is really a way to think

00:18:58.509 --> 00:18:58.519
things and this is really a way to think
 

00:18:58.519 --> 00:19:00.519
things and this is really a way to think
about organizations now I've given you a

00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:00.529
about organizations now I've given you a
 

00:19:00.529 --> 00:19:02.619
about organizations now I've given you a
conceptual model about innovation now

00:19:02.619 --> 00:19:02.629
conceptual model about innovation now
 

00:19:02.629 --> 00:19:03.700
conceptual model about innovation now
I'm going to talk about kind of

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:03.710
I'm going to talk about kind of
 

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.279
I'm going to talk about kind of
organizations and this is based on a

00:19:06.279 --> 00:19:06.289
organizations and this is based on a
 

00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:09.029
organizations and this is based on a
work called activity theory which is

00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039
work called activity theory which is
 

00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:12.310
work called activity theory which is
kind of a meta theory that comes out of

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320
kind of a meta theory that comes out of
 

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.289
kind of a meta theory that comes out of
soviet-era psychology it actually comes

00:19:14.289 --> 00:19:14.299
soviet-era psychology it actually comes
 

00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:17.110
soviet-era psychology it actually comes
out from the 20s then in the 80s and 90s

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120
out from the 20s then in the 80s and 90s
 

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.840
out from the 20s then in the 80s and 90s
it got picked up and applied by a lot of

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:19.850
it got picked up and applied by a lot of
 

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.430
it got picked up and applied by a lot of
Scandinavian researchers and it got

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440
Scandinavian researchers and it got
 

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.019
Scandinavian researchers and it got
applied to a lot of like human computer

00:19:23.019 --> 00:19:23.029
applied to a lot of like human computer
 

00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:25.450
applied to a lot of like human computer
interaction shared work which is kind of

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:25.460
interaction shared work which is kind of
 

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.249
interaction shared work which is kind of
how I got involved in it and it's a

00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:27.259
how I got involved in it and it's a
 

00:19:27.259 --> 00:19:29.470
how I got involved in it and it's a
basic way of looking at how people

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480
basic way of looking at how people
 

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.649
basic way of looking at how people
organize themselves to do something and

00:19:31.649 --> 00:19:31.659
organize themselves to do something and
 

00:19:31.659 --> 00:19:33.940
organize themselves to do something and
there's some at least some face validity

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:33.950
there's some at least some face validity
 

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:37.210
there's some at least some face validity
to it where you can take a look at work

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:37.220
to it where you can take a look at work
 

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.560
to it where you can take a look at work
you know what's what's what's what's the

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:38.570
you know what's what's what's what's the
 

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:39.850
you know what's what's what's what's the
what are the elements of work you if

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:39.860
what are the elements of work you if
 

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.169
what are the elements of work you if
you're trying to make a periodic table

00:19:41.169 --> 00:19:41.179
you're trying to make a periodic table
 

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:43.480
you're trying to make a periodic table
of work what is it there's an individual

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:43.490
of work what is it there's an individual
 

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:47.049
of work what is it there's an individual
two acts on a task to produce an outcome

00:19:47.049 --> 00:19:47.059
two acts on a task to produce an outcome
 

00:19:47.059 --> 00:19:49.539
two acts on a task to produce an outcome
that's pretty straightforward but in

00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:49.549
that's pretty straightforward but in
 

00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:51.610
that's pretty straightforward but in
most things we do certainly in buggy

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:51.620
most things we do certainly in buggy
 

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.769
most things we do certainly in buggy
certainly a new product development it's

00:19:53.769 --> 00:19:53.779
certainly a new product development it's
 

00:19:53.779 --> 00:19:55.990
certainly a new product development it's
not just any one person doing that you

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000
not just any one person doing that you
 

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.430
not just any one person doing that you
know acting on that task for an outcome

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440
know acting on that task for an outcome
 

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.049
know acting on that task for an outcome
there's a group of people so now you

00:19:59.049 --> 00:19:59.059
there's a group of people so now you
 

00:19:59.059 --> 00:20:01.119
there's a group of people so now you
have an individual and you have a team

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:01.129
have an individual and you have a team
 

00:20:01.129 --> 00:20:03.310
have an individual and you have a team
the team is acting on the task and then

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320
the team is acting on the task and then
 

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.200
the team is acting on the task and then
the team and the individual are acting

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.210
the team and the individual are acting
 

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:06.639
the team and the individual are acting
on each other so this is kind of an

00:20:06.639 --> 00:20:06.649
on each other so this is kind of an
 

00:20:06.649 --> 00:20:07.990
on each other so this is kind of an
intro that the kind of a first layer of

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000
intro that the kind of a first layer of
 

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.759
intro that the kind of a first layer of
activity series and one of the things

00:20:09.759 --> 00:20:09.769
activity series and one of the things
 

00:20:09.769 --> 00:20:11.769
activity series and one of the things
that teaches you is when you start to

00:20:11.769 --> 00:20:11.779
that teaches you is when you start to
 

00:20:11.779 --> 00:20:13.629
that teaches you is when you start to
look at activity you look at work

00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:13.639
look at activity you look at work
 

00:20:13.639 --> 00:20:15.460
look at activity you look at work
there's really two at least initially

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:15.470
there's really two at least initially
 

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.810
there's really two at least initially
two things you can take a certain

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:16.820
two things you can take a certain
 

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.490
two things you can take a certain
focusing on take a look at the

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:18.500
focusing on take a look at the
 

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.440
focusing on take a look at the
organization and you can take a look at

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:20.450
organization and you can take a look at
 

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:22.629
organization and you can take a look at
the task so the first stuff i'm going to

00:20:22.629 --> 00:20:22.639
the task so the first stuff i'm going to
 

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:24.070
the task so the first stuff i'm going to
talk about is I'm going to talk I'm now

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080
talk about is I'm going to talk I'm now
 

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.960
talk about is I'm going to talk I'm now
going to go in and talk about buggy is a

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:25.970
going to go in and talk about buggy is a
 

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.019
going to go in and talk about buggy is a
task and kind of get into this at least

00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:29.029
task and kind of get into this at least
 

00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:30.879
task and kind of get into this at least
the buggy people we're here should enjoy

00:20:30.879 --> 00:20:30.889
the buggy people we're here should enjoy
 

00:20:30.889 --> 00:20:31.990
the buggy people we're here should enjoy
it a little bit about what you have to

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000
it a little bit about what you have to
 

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.850
it a little bit about what you have to
do to create a buggy and all that I'm

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:33.860
do to create a buggy and all that I'm
 

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.440
do to create a buggy and all that I'm
going to talk about that and then after

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:35.450
going to talk about that and then after
 

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:37.240
going to talk about that and then after
that I'm going to talk about the

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:37.250
that I'm going to talk about the
 

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.860
that I'm going to talk about the
organization and then tie it back to

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:40.870
organization and then tie it back to
 

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.529
organization and then tie it back to
innovation so let's talk about buggy is

00:20:44.529 --> 00:20:44.539
innovation so let's talk about buggy is
 

00:20:44.539 --> 00:20:48.519
innovation so let's talk about buggy is
a task so there's a primary engineering

00:20:48.519 --> 00:20:48.529
a task so there's a primary engineering
 

00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:49.749
a task so there's a primary engineering
challenge and this is one of the things

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:49.759
challenge and this is one of the things
 

00:20:49.759 --> 00:20:51.580
challenge and this is one of the things
that makes buggy really exciting is a

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:51.590
that makes buggy really exciting is a
 

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.680
that makes buggy really exciting is a
classic engineering trouble challenge

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:53.690
classic engineering trouble challenge
 

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.350
classic engineering trouble challenge
remember about you about 50 seconds or

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:56.360
remember about you about 50 seconds or
 

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:56.820
remember about you about 50 seconds or
so

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:56.830
so
 

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.639
so
Phylly is the buggy going downhill so

00:20:59.639 --> 00:20:59.649
Phylly is the buggy going downhill so
 

00:20:59.649 --> 00:21:00.930
Phylly is the buggy going downhill so
what's the primary thing you want to if

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:00.940
what's the primary thing you want to if
 

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.480
what's the primary thing you want to if
you a gravity racer soapbox derby

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:02.490
you a gravity racer soapbox derby
 

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.080
you a gravity racer soapbox derby
basically what you're doing is taking

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:04.090
basically what you're doing is taking
 

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:06.480
basically what you're doing is taking
the potential energy of your hill and

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:06.490
the potential energy of your hill and
 

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:07.919
the potential energy of your hill and
you're converting into kinetic energy of

00:21:07.919 --> 00:21:07.929
you're converting into kinetic energy of
 

00:21:07.929 --> 00:21:09.120
you're converting into kinetic energy of
your vehicle right pretty

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:09.130
your vehicle right pretty
 

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.950
your vehicle right pretty
straightforward any time that thing

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960
straightforward any time that thing
 

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.769
straightforward any time that thing
flexes you've wasted you've wasted that

00:21:13.769 --> 00:21:13.779
flexes you've wasted you've wasted that
 

00:21:13.779 --> 00:21:15.779
flexes you've wasted you've wasted that
height into into flexing so what you

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:15.789
height into into flexing so what you
 

00:21:15.789 --> 00:21:17.519
height into into flexing so what you
need is something that's very very rigid

00:21:17.519 --> 00:21:17.529
need is something that's very very rigid
 

00:21:17.529 --> 00:21:18.840
need is something that's very very rigid
right that's your primary thing it has

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:18.850
right that's your primary thing it has
 

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.980
right that's your primary thing it has
to be rigid now but you also for 75

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:22.990
to be rigid now but you also for 75
 

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.019
to be rigid now but you also for 75
seconds or so people are pushing it and

00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:25.029
seconds or so people are pushing it and
 

00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:27.210
seconds or so people are pushing it and
as I you know hinted before mentioned

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:27.220
as I you know hinted before mentioned
 

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.560
as I you know hinted before mentioned
before about why there are female

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:28.570
before about why there are female
 

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:30.330
before about why there are female
drivers now when you're pushing

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:30.340
drivers now when you're pushing
 

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.620
drivers now when you're pushing
something you want it as light as

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:31.630
something you want it as light as
 

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.090
something you want it as light as
possible I mean put a really really

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:33.100
possible I mean put a really really
 

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.259
possible I mean put a really really
heavy shopping cart versus a light

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:34.269
heavy shopping cart versus a light
 

00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:35.610
heavy shopping cart versus a light
shopping cart it's a lot easier to push

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:35.620
shopping cart it's a lot easier to push
 

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.289
shopping cart it's a lot easier to push
the light shopping cart so you have a

00:21:37.289 --> 00:21:37.299
the light shopping cart so you have a
 

00:21:37.299 --> 00:21:39.659
the light shopping cart so you have a
fundamental engineering challenge how do

00:21:39.659 --> 00:21:39.669
fundamental engineering challenge how do
 

00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:41.759
fundamental engineering challenge how do
you make something light and rigid you

00:21:41.759 --> 00:21:41.769
you make something light and rigid you
 

00:21:41.769 --> 00:21:43.740
you make something light and rigid you
know classic problem um there's other

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:43.750
know classic problem um there's other
 

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:44.940
know classic problem um there's other
issues and I'll talk a little bit about

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:44.950
issues and I'll talk a little bit about
 

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.039
issues and I'll talk a little bit about
them too if you look on the downhill

00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:47.049
them too if you look on the downhill
 

00:21:47.049 --> 00:21:49.409
them too if you look on the downhill
part of it after you make a rigid buggy

00:21:49.409 --> 00:21:49.419
part of it after you make a rigid buggy
 

00:21:49.419 --> 00:21:50.940
part of it after you make a rigid buggy
the next thing you need is low rolling

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:50.950
the next thing you need is low rolling
 

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.799
the next thing you need is low rolling
resistance wheels and I'll talk in more

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:52.809
resistance wheels and I'll talk in more
 

00:21:52.809 --> 00:21:54.060
resistance wheels and I'll talk in more
detail about that because that's a real

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:54.070
detail about that because that's a real
 

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.009
detail about that because that's a real
you know hot topic and buggy and there's

00:21:56.009 --> 00:21:56.019
you know hot topic and buggy and there's
 

00:21:56.019 --> 00:21:58.080
you know hot topic and buggy and there's
lots of Secrets associated with that you

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:58.090
lots of Secrets associated with that you
 

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.610
lots of Secrets associated with that you
need to make it recently aerodynamic

00:21:59.610 --> 00:21:59.620
need to make it recently aerodynamic
 

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.340
need to make it recently aerodynamic
again these things go around 40 miles an

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:02.350
again these things go around 40 miles an
 

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:03.720
again these things go around 40 miles an
hour so you start to get in the area

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:03.730
hour so you start to get in the area
 

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.000
hour so you start to get in the area
that aerodynamics matter a lot of

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.010
that aerodynamics matter a lot of
 

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.710
that aerodynamics matter a lot of
different shapes work but you still need

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:07.720
different shapes work but you still need
 

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.389
different shapes work but you still need
to make an aerodynamic and as I'd

00:22:09.389 --> 00:22:09.399
to make an aerodynamic and as I'd
 

00:22:09.399 --> 00:22:10.830
to make an aerodynamic and as I'd
mentioned before when you're at the

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840
mentioned before when you're at the
 

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.149
mentioned before when you're at the
lowest point of the course and you're

00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159
lowest point of the course and you're
 

00:22:12.159 --> 00:22:13.500
lowest point of the course and you're
going the fastest you have to make this

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:13.510
going the fastest you have to make this
 

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.330
going the fastest you have to make this
really really really sharp turn so you

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:15.340
really really really sharp turn so you
 

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.500
really really really sharp turn so you
have to be able to make this thing that

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:16.510
have to be able to make this thing that
 

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:17.850
have to be able to make this thing that
it can stable and actually get through

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:17.860
it can stable and actually get through
 

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.370
it can stable and actually get through
this turn without wiping out and when

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:20.380
this turn without wiping out and when
 

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.440
this turn without wiping out and when
you go to carnival if you guys do the

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:22.450
you go to carnival if you guys do the
 

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:23.970
you go to carnival if you guys do the
carnival a lot of people will they'll go

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:23.980
carnival a lot of people will they'll go
 

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.769
carnival a lot of people will they'll go
they'll go in the shoot and they're

00:22:25.769 --> 00:22:25.779
they'll go in the shoot and they're
 

00:22:25.779 --> 00:22:26.909
they'll go in the shoot and they're
there because well the buggies are

00:22:26.909 --> 00:22:26.919
there because well the buggies are
 

00:22:26.919 --> 00:22:28.110
there because well the buggies are
moving the fastest but they're also

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.120
moving the fastest but they're also
 

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.060
moving the fastest but they're also
waiting for buggies to spin out and wipe

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:30.070
waiting for buggies to spin out and wipe
 

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.310
waiting for buggies to spin out and wipe
out and kind of exciting right but even

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320
out and kind of exciting right but even
 

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.360
out and kind of exciting right but even
if you don't wipe out even if these

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:33.370
if you don't wipe out even if these
 

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.519
if you don't wipe out even if these
buggies don't you know twist if they

00:22:35.519 --> 00:22:35.529
buggies don't you know twist if they
 

00:22:35.529 --> 00:22:37.320
buggies don't you know twist if they
scrub speed that's also an issue right

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:37.330
scrub speed that's also an issue right
 

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.000
scrub speed that's also an issue right
is you kind of skate through the escape

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:39.010
is you kind of skate through the escape
 

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.310
is you kind of skate through the escape
through the turn and on the pushing side

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.320
through the turn and on the pushing side
 

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.169
through the turn and on the pushing side
of it think the other issue is not only

00:22:43.169 --> 00:22:43.179
of it think the other issue is not only
 

00:22:43.179 --> 00:22:44.850
of it think the other issue is not only
does the thing need to be light and this

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:44.860
does the thing need to be light and this
 

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.049
does the thing need to be light and this
is also something that was always very

00:22:46.049 --> 00:22:46.059
is also something that was always very
 

00:22:46.059 --> 00:22:48.480
is also something that was always very
very important for us in spirit was you

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:48.490
very important for us in spirit was you
 

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.950
very important for us in spirit was you
need to have a good pushing platform

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960
need to have a good pushing platform
 

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.299
need to have a good pushing platform
there are buggies that are harder to

00:22:51.299 --> 00:22:51.309
there are buggies that are harder to
 

00:22:51.309 --> 00:22:52.680
there are buggies that are harder to
push in their buggies that are easier to

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:52.690
push in their buggies that are easier to
 

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:54.659
push in their buggies that are easier to
push so now do you want to make it light

00:22:54.659 --> 00:22:54.669
push so now do you want to make it light
 

00:22:54.669 --> 00:23:00.370
push so now do you want to make it light
you want to make it easy to push

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:00.380
 
 

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.660
 
oh here's just since I have it in the

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:04.670
oh here's just since I have it in the
 

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:05.620
oh here's just since I have it in the
picture one thing that's kind of

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:05.630
picture one thing that's kind of
 

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.000
picture one thing that's kind of
interesting talk a little bit more about

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.010
interesting talk a little bit more about
 

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.770
interesting talk a little bit more about
this later too if you see there's a

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:08.780
this later too if you see there's a
 

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.390
this later too if you see there's a
woman that's actually Denise Redmond

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400
woman that's actually Denise Redmond
 

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.340
woman that's actually Denise Redmond
there's a flag and there's one of our

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:12.350
there's a flag and there's one of our
 

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:15.610
there's a flag and there's one of our
buggies I think that's ql these buggies

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:15.620
buggies I think that's ql these buggies
 

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.130
buggies I think that's ql these buggies
are so low to the ground that you can't

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:18.140
are so low to the ground that you can't
 

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.830
are so low to the ground that you can't
see over the crown of the road so to let

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840
see over the crown of the road so to let
 

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.000
see over the crown of the road so to let
your driver know when to turn you have

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:22.010
your driver know when to turn you have
 

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:23.440
your driver know when to turn you have
to signal it so I actually have two

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:23.450
to signal it so I actually have two
 

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.450
to signal it so I actually have two
single flags and then she knows to take

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:25.460
single flags and then she knows to take
 

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:30.700
single flags and then she knows to take
their turn into the shoot so again what

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:30.710
their turn into the shoot so again what
 

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.020
their turn into the shoot so again what
do you need you need a light and rigid

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:32.030
do you need you need a light and rigid
 

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.370
do you need you need a light and rigid
buggy so if you start looking at

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:33.380
buggy so if you start looking at
 

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.920
buggy so if you start looking at
technology solutions it's really kind of

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:35.930
technology solutions it's really kind of
 

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:37.600
technology solutions it's really kind of
only a handful of technologists kind of

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:37.610
only a handful of technologists kind of
 

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.690
only a handful of technologists kind of
makes sense one of the things is let's

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:40.700
makes sense one of the things is let's
 

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.980
makes sense one of the things is let's
all talk to the second bullet point

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:41.990
all talk to the second bullet point
 

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:44.800
all talk to the second bullet point
first materials what you drive you to

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:44.810
first materials what you drive you to
 

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:46.540
first materials what you drive you to
materials that are really light and

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:46.550
materials that are really light and
 

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.310
materials that are really light and
really rigid and really when it all

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320
really rigid and really when it all
 

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.590
really rigid and really when it all
comes down to it it's aluminum you know

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:50.600
comes down to it it's aluminum you know
 

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.580
comes down to it it's aluminum you know
you can also get some like special

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:51.590
you can also get some like special
 

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.530

beryllium alloys and titanium and crazy

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:53.540
beryllium alloys and titanium and crazy
 

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:54.670
beryllium alloys and titanium and crazy
things like that but basically it's

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:54.680
things like that but basically it's
 

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.320
things like that but basically it's
aluminum and then it's composite

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:56.330
aluminum and then it's composite
 

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:57.910
aluminum and then it's composite
materials my favorite being the

00:23:57.910 --> 00:23:57.920
materials my favorite being the
 

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.820
materials my favorite being the
composite material part of it and then

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:00.830
composite material part of it and then
 

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.140
composite material part of it and then
if you look at a structure part of it

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:02.150
if you look at a structure part of it
 

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.490
if you look at a structure part of it
structurally how do you make something

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:03.500
structurally how do you make something
 

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.890
structurally how do you make something
that's light and rigid okay one again

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:05.900
that's light and rigid okay one again
 

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.840
that's light and rigid okay one again
you have the right kind of materials but

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:07.850
you have the right kind of materials but
 

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.910
you have the right kind of materials but
there's really kind of three ways to do

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:09.920
there's really kind of three ways to do
 

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.110
there's really kind of three ways to do
it and there's kind of hybrids between

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120
it and there's kind of hybrids between
 

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.700
it and there's kind of hybrids between
them but one is to make a Space Frame a

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:12.710
them but one is to make a Space Frame a
 

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.920
them but one is to make a Space Frame a
truss right like a bridge you know

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:14.930
truss right like a bridge you know
 

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:18.250
truss right like a bridge you know
another is to make a tube you know tubes

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:18.260
another is to make a tube you know tubes
 

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.200
another is to make a tube you know tubes
can be really light and then another way

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:20.210
can be really light and then another way
 

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:21.610
can be really light and then another way
to do it what you've seen is basically

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:21.620
to do it what you've seen is basically
 

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.560
to do it what you've seen is basically
kind of a skateboard design again there

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:23.570
kind of a skateboard design again there
 

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.390
kind of a skateboard design again there
can kind of be hybrids of hybrids of all

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:25.400
can kind of be hybrids of hybrids of all
 

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.390
can kind of be hybrids of hybrids of all
those our choice and in this again the

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400
those our choice and in this again the
 

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.800
those our choice and in this again the
buggy quantum belief that held the

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:29.810
buggy quantum belief that held the
 

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.840
buggy quantum belief that held the
record for so many years basically it's

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:31.850
record for so many years basically it's
 

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:33.490
record for so many years basically it's
a carbon-fiber tube it's a monocoque

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:33.500
a carbon-fiber tube it's a monocoque
 

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.530
a carbon-fiber tube it's a monocoque
it's a tube made out of you know getting

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:35.540
it's a tube made out of you know getting
 

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.790
it's a tube made out of you know getting
made out of this you know really light

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:36.800
made out of this you know really light
 

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:42.370
made out of this you know really light
and strong composite material so again

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:42.380
and strong composite material so again
 

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.560
and strong composite material so again
not only do you get into issues of you

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:44.570
not only do you get into issues of you
 

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.810
not only do you get into issues of you
know interesting design and you know and

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:46.820
know interesting design and you know and
 

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.220
know interesting design and you know and
challenging design when you do this

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:48.230
challenging design when you do this
 

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.800
challenging design when you do this
stuff do you get workmanship ends up

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:50.810
stuff do you get workmanship ends up
 

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:52.000
stuff do you get workmanship ends up
becoming an important part of it

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:52.010
becoming an important part of it
 

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:56.350
becoming an important part of it
actually building these things now Lola

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360
actually building these things now Lola
 

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.020
actually building these things now Lola
rolling resistance wheels now imagine

00:24:59.020 --> 00:24:59.030
rolling resistance wheels now imagine
 

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.790
rolling resistance wheels now imagine
you've got your rigid buggy and let's

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:00.800
you've got your rigid buggy and let's
 

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.770
you've got your rigid buggy and let's
imagine that you've done a good job and

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:02.780
imagine that you've done a good job and
 

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.530
imagine that you've done a good job and
it's actually life is the buggy goes

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:05.540
it's actually life is the buggy goes
 

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.620
it's actually life is the buggy goes
down that hill what happens for each of

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:08.630
down that hill what happens for each of
 

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.230
down that hill what happens for each of
your tires is there's a little flat spot

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:11.240
your tires is there's a little flat spot
 

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.210
your tires is there's a little flat spot
right because it's weighted down

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:13.220
right because it's weighted down
 

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.549
right because it's weighted down
then is that buggy rolls the flat spot

00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:15.559
then is that buggy rolls the flat spot
 

00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:18.130
then is that buggy rolls the flat spot
kind of moves right or the tire moves

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:18.140
kind of moves right or the tire moves
 

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.080
kind of moves right or the tire moves
right it kind of rotates through so

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:20.090
right it kind of rotates through so
 

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:22.750
right it kind of rotates through so
what's happening constantly on each of

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:22.760
what's happening constantly on each of
 

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.340
what's happening constantly on each of
those tires is they're expanding and

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:24.350
those tires is they're expanding and
 

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:25.210
those tires is they're expanding and
contracting you're getting this

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:25.220
contracting you're getting this
 

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.430
contracting you're getting this
expansion and contraction and any time

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440
expansion and contraction and any time
 

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.600
expansion and contraction and any time
you do this you're going to get energy

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:28.610
you do this you're going to get energy
 

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.180
you do this you're going to get energy
loss there's going to be hysteresis loss

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:30.190
loss there's going to be hysteresis loss
 

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.730
loss there's going to be hysteresis loss
in the in those tires and what you want

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:33.740
in the in those tires and what you want
 

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.440
in the in those tires and what you want
is you want to minimize those energy

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:35.450
is you want to minimize those energy
 

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.510
is you want to minimize those energy
losses you want to minimize that loss

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520
losses you want to minimize that loss
 

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.100
losses you want to minimize that loss
and again because now again the

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:39.110
and again because now again the
 

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.649
and again because now again the
potential energy instead of going to

00:25:41.649 --> 00:25:41.659
potential energy instead of going to
 

00:25:41.659 --> 00:25:43.960
potential energy instead of going to
kinetic energy is going to the losses in

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:43.970
kinetic energy is going to the losses in
 

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:45.880
kinetic energy is going to the losses in
your tires so what you need is you need

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:45.890
your tires so what you need is you need
 

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:47.620
your tires so what you need is you need
something where you can minimize those

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:47.630
something where you can minimize those
 

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:50.260
something where you can minimize those
energy losses but still get through the

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:50.270
energy losses but still get through the
 

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:51.640
energy losses but still get through the
shoot and there's actually even gets a

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:51.650
shoot and there's actually even gets a
 

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:52.960
shoot and there's actually even gets a
little bit more if there's a reason like

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:52.970
little bit more if there's a reason like
 

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.029
little bit more if there's a reason like
for example you know conceptually maybe

00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039
for example you know conceptually maybe
 

00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:56.409
for example you know conceptually maybe
you could say oh you put steel rims on

00:25:56.409 --> 00:25:56.419
you could say oh you put steel rims on
 

00:25:56.419 --> 00:25:57.909
you could say oh you put steel rims on
something right so they're not going to

00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919
something right so they're not going to
 

00:25:57.919 --> 00:25:59.500
something right so they're not going to
flex you know I can get an energy loose

00:25:59.500 --> 00:25:59.510
flex you know I can get an energy loose
 

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:01.990
flex you know I can get an energy loose
loss but you have no grip you have no

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000
loss but you have no grip you have no
 

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.640
loss but you have no grip you have no
ability to get into the get through

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:03.650
ability to get into the get through
 

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:05.620
ability to get into the get through
the chute there's also some other other

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:05.630
the chute there's also some other other
 

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.480
the chute there's also some other other
issues kind of around that as well it's

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:07.490
issues kind of around that as well it's
 

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:09.070
issues kind of around that as well it's
a little bit more complicated but

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080
a little bit more complicated but
 

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.600
a little bit more complicated but
because a real big challenge how do you

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:10.610
because a real big challenge how do you
 

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.430
because a real big challenge how do you
have I mean once you have a light and

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440
have I mean once you have a light and
 

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.560
have I mean once you have a light and
rigid buggy what what makes a freeroll

wheels and actually I've had experience

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:31.610
wheels and actually I've had experience
 

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.120
wheels and actually I've had experience
in all of them and then not only that

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:34.130
in all of them and then not only that
 

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.130
in all of them and then not only that
there's another level of complication

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:36.140
there's another level of complication
 

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.919
there's another level of complication
that it's not just finding this wheel

00:26:38.919 --> 00:26:38.929
that it's not just finding this wheel
 

00:26:38.929 --> 00:26:42.279
that it's not just finding this wheel
you then a wheel and of itself doesn't

00:26:42.279 --> 00:26:42.289
you then a wheel and of itself doesn't
 

00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:43.750
you then a wheel and of itself doesn't
let's just like roll all that well you

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760
let's just like roll all that well you
 

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.070
let's just like roll all that well you
then have to go and actually treat the

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.080
then have to go and actually treat the
 

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.320
then have to go and actually treat the
wheel can chemically treat it you can

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:47.330
wheel can chemically treat it you can
 

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.149
wheel can chemically treat it you can
heat treat it if you have pneumatics you

00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.159
heat treat it if you have pneumatics you
 

00:26:49.159 --> 00:26:50.500
heat treat it if you have pneumatics you
can play around with gas pressure and

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:50.510
can play around with gas pressure and
 

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:52.480
can play around with gas pressure and
what gases you have and you can do an

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:52.490
what gases you have and you can do an
 

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.919
what gases you have and you can do an
experiment it's kind of neat if you have

00:26:53.919 --> 00:26:53.929
experiment it's kind of neat if you have
 

00:26:53.929 --> 00:26:56.529

like a superb all right drop it down and

00:26:56.529 --> 00:26:56.539
like a superb all right drop it down and
 

00:26:56.539 --> 00:26:57.970
like a superb all right drop it down and
measure its rebound so maybe the super

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:57.980
measure its rebound so maybe the super
 

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.190

hours bounce it it's now going to come

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:06.830
hours bounce it it's now going to come
 

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:09.399
hours bounce it it's now going to come
up to about seventy percent and so

00:27:09.399 --> 00:27:09.409
up to about seventy percent and so
 

00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:11.080
up to about seventy percent and so
that's why you get these chemical

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:11.090
that's why you get these chemical
 

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:12.789
that's why you get these chemical
treatments similarly you take it you

really well known in soap box derby and
 

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.470
really well known in soap box derby and
a lot of the technology this whole

a lot of the technology this whole
 

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.330
a lot of the technology this whole
originally like how you know to heat and

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:30.340
originally like how you know to heat and

and treating wheels in soap box derby
 

00:28:33.129 --> 00:28:35.730
and treating wheels in soap box derby
long before it ever came into it came

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:35.740
long before it ever came into it came
 

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.950
long before it ever came into it came
into buggy so one of the things it was

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:37.960
into buggy so one of the things it was
 

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.210
into buggy so one of the things it was
really important for us and when the

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:39.220
really important for us and when the
 

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.560
really important for us and when the
reasons why we were able to get you know

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:40.570
reasons why we were able to get you know
 

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.629
reasons why we were able to get you know
kind of fast kind of quick is we knew

00:28:42.629 --> 00:28:42.639
kind of fast kind of quick is we knew

points on this is you have you know

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:48.970
points on this is you have you know

proprietary knowledge is part of the
 

00:28:50.649 --> 00:28:53.009
proprietary knowledge is part of the
task of buggy but so is external

00:28:53.009 --> 00:28:53.019
task of buggy but so is external
 

00:28:53.019 --> 00:28:56.490
task of buggy but so is external
relationships and you know and uh using

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:56.500
relationships and you know and uh using
 

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.379
relationships and you know and uh using
you know partnering with people

00:28:58.379 --> 00:28:58.389
you know partnering with people
 

00:28:58.389 --> 00:29:04.440
you know partnering with people
externally there's some additional

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:04.450
externally there's some additional
 

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.129
externally there's some additional
design elements that I haven't mentioned

00:29:07.129 --> 00:29:07.139
design elements that I haven't mentioned
 

00:29:07.139 --> 00:29:09.720
design elements that I haven't mentioned
one basic configuring is gear

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:09.730
one basic configuring is gear
 

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:11.909
one basic configuring is gear
configuration issue like is it and

00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:11.919
configuration issue like is it and
 

00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:13.529
configuration issue like is it and
typically there are either tricycles or

00:29:13.529 --> 00:29:13.539
typically there are either tricycles or
 

00:29:13.539 --> 00:29:16.950
typically there are either tricycles or
reverse tricycles right now it used to

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960
reverse tricycles right now it used to
 

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.480
reverse tricycles right now it used to
be a little bit more complicated because

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:18.490
be a little bit more complicated because
 

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:19.680
be a little bit more complicated because
people would have their two-wheel

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:19.690
people would have their two-wheel
 

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:21.090
people would have their two-wheel
buggies or affordable buggies or three

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:21.100
buggies or affordable buggies or three
 

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:23.279
buggies or affordable buggies or three
well buggies now all buggies are three

00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:23.289
well buggies now all buggies are three
 

00:29:23.289 --> 00:29:25.379
well buggies now all buggies are three
wheel and the reason is going back to

00:29:25.379 --> 00:29:25.389
wheel and the reason is going back to
 

00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:27.570
wheel and the reason is going back to
that low rolling resistance thing four

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:27.580
that low rolling resistance thing four
 

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.190
that low rolling resistance thing four
wheels have more rolling resistance than

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200
wheels have more rolling resistance than
 

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.840
wheels have more rolling resistance than
three wheels you're not allowed to use

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:30.850
three wheels you're not allowed to use
 

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:32.399
three wheels you're not allowed to use
two wheels so you want to use the fewer

00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:32.409
two wheels so you want to use the fewer
 

00:29:32.409 --> 00:29:33.539
two wheels so you want to use the fewer
enough fewest number of wheels you can

00:29:33.539 --> 00:29:33.549
enough fewest number of wheels you can
 

00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:35.580
enough fewest number of wheels you can
which ends up being three so then you

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:35.590
which ends up being three so then you
 

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.960
which ends up being three so then you
have to figure out your configuration

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:36.970
have to figure out your configuration
 

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:38.970
have to figure out your configuration
and then from your configuration you

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:38.980
and then from your configuration you
 

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:39.919
and then from your configuration you
have to worry about steer

00:29:39.919 --> 00:29:39.929
have to worry about steer
 

00:29:39.929 --> 00:29:42.419
have to worry about steer
right so that gets another complication

00:29:42.419 --> 00:29:42.429
right so that gets another complication
 

00:29:42.429 --> 00:29:44.669
right so that gets another complication
you also have to have brakes on these

00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.679
you also have to have brakes on these
 

00:29:44.679 --> 00:29:47.519
you also have to have brakes on these
the hope is you never ever ever use a

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:47.529
the hope is you never ever ever use a
 

00:29:47.529 --> 00:29:49.889
the hope is you never ever ever use a
break in a race because obviously that

00:29:49.889 --> 00:29:49.899
break in a race because obviously that
 

00:29:49.899 --> 00:29:51.719
break in a race because obviously that
slows you down but from a safety

00:29:51.719 --> 00:29:51.729
slows you down but from a safety
 

00:29:51.729 --> 00:29:53.639
slows you down but from a safety
perspective somehow somebody spins out

00:29:53.639 --> 00:29:53.649
perspective somehow somebody spins out
 

00:29:53.649 --> 00:29:55.019
perspective somehow somebody spins out
in front of yet you got to be able to

00:29:55.019 --> 00:29:55.029
in front of yet you got to be able to
 

00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:56.189
in front of yet you got to be able to
stop it or you're going to hit the buggy

00:29:56.189 --> 00:29:56.199
stop it or you're going to hit the buggy
 

00:29:56.199 --> 00:29:57.779
stop it or you're going to hit the buggy
in front of you so you're required to

00:29:57.779 --> 00:29:57.789
in front of you so you're required to
 

00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:59.249
in front of you so you're required to
have brakes and you have to design him

00:29:59.249 --> 00:29:59.259
have brakes and you have to design him
 

00:29:59.259 --> 00:30:01.049
have brakes and you have to design him
at all frankly we've had problems I've

00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:01.059
at all frankly we've had problems I've
 

00:30:01.059 --> 00:30:05.729
at all frankly we've had problems I've
had a this buggy actually failed failed

00:30:05.729 --> 00:30:05.739
had a this buggy actually failed failed
 

00:30:05.739 --> 00:30:09.180
had a this buggy actually failed failed
to break test for us in 86 and one of

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:09.190
to break test for us in 86 and one of
 

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.069
to break test for us in 86 and one of
things you have to do to prove that you

00:30:11.069 --> 00:30:11.079
things you have to do to prove that you
 

00:30:11.079 --> 00:30:14.279
things you have to do to prove that you
what people used to do in like the 60s

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:14.289
what people used to do in like the 60s
 

00:30:14.289 --> 00:30:17.279
what people used to do in like the 60s
70s maybe is they'd have brakes and your

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:17.289
70s maybe is they'd have brakes and your
 

00:30:17.289 --> 00:30:18.509
70s maybe is they'd have brakes and your
buggy would get approved and that they

00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:18.519
buggy would get approved and that they
 

00:30:18.519 --> 00:30:19.559
buggy would get approved and that they
take the brakes off and they wouldn't

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:19.569
take the brakes off and they wouldn't
 

00:30:19.569 --> 00:30:21.779
take the brakes off and they wouldn't
racing with brakes because the idea was

00:30:21.779 --> 00:30:21.789
racing with brakes because the idea was
 

00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:23.819
racing with brakes because the idea was
if there's no brakes the driver won't

00:30:23.819 --> 00:30:23.829
if there's no brakes the driver won't
 

00:30:23.829 --> 00:30:25.619
if there's no brakes the driver won't
have any you know can't use them so you

00:30:25.619 --> 00:30:25.629
have any you know can't use them so you
 

00:30:25.629 --> 00:30:28.109
have any you know can't use them so you
don't have to worry about it right but

00:30:28.109 --> 00:30:28.119
don't have to worry about it right but
 

00:30:28.119 --> 00:30:30.209
don't have to worry about it right but
you know but so they imposed a new

00:30:30.209 --> 00:30:30.219
you know but so they imposed a new
 

00:30:30.219 --> 00:30:32.189
you know but so they imposed a new
regulation which is immediately after

00:30:32.189 --> 00:30:32.199
regulation which is immediately after
 

00:30:32.199 --> 00:30:33.689
regulation which is immediately after
the race you have to test your brakes

00:30:33.689 --> 00:30:33.699
the race you have to test your brakes
 

00:30:33.699 --> 00:30:37.049
the race you have to test your brakes
and it can you know and people fail it

00:30:37.049 --> 00:30:37.059
and it can you know and people fail it
 

00:30:37.059 --> 00:30:39.359
and it can you know and people fail it
and we failed it and we failed it for a

00:30:39.359 --> 00:30:39.369
and we failed it and we failed it for a
 

00:30:39.369 --> 00:30:41.249
and we failed it and we failed it for a
really you know well I we thought we

00:30:41.249 --> 00:30:41.259
really you know well I we thought we
 

00:30:41.259 --> 00:30:42.989
really you know well I we thought we
were doing the right thing which is that

00:30:42.989 --> 00:30:42.999
were doing the right thing which is that
 

00:30:42.999 --> 00:30:45.599
were doing the right thing which is that
sting which is the buggy that I one with

00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:45.609
sting which is the buggy that I one with
 

00:30:45.609 --> 00:30:50.729
sting which is the buggy that I one with
an 87 had a really awful design of its

00:30:50.729 --> 00:30:50.739
an 87 had a really awful design of its
 

00:30:50.739 --> 00:30:52.619
an 87 had a really awful design of its
break but it was a drop break and

00:30:52.619 --> 00:30:52.629
break but it was a drop break and
 

00:30:52.629 --> 00:30:53.609
break but it was a drop break and
basically what that meant there was a

00:30:53.609 --> 00:30:53.619
basically what that meant there was a
 

00:30:53.619 --> 00:30:55.379
basically what that meant there was a
pivot and she would kick her legs back

00:30:55.379 --> 00:30:55.389
pivot and she would kick her legs back
 

00:30:55.389 --> 00:30:57.449
pivot and she would kick her legs back
and a break would drop off and actually

00:30:57.449 --> 00:30:57.459
and a break would drop off and actually
 

00:30:57.459 --> 00:30:58.739
and a break would drop off and actually
picked the whole back of the buggy off

00:30:58.739 --> 00:30:58.749
picked the whole back of the buggy off
 

00:30:58.749 --> 00:31:01.709
picked the whole back of the buggy off
and to have this whole lever arm work

00:31:01.709 --> 00:31:01.719
and to have this whole lever arm work
 

00:31:01.719 --> 00:31:03.269
and to have this whole lever arm work
there was a big cut out in the bottom of

00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279
there was a big cut out in the bottom of
 

00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:04.559
there was a big cut out in the bottom of
the buggy to allow the lever to come

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:04.569
the buggy to allow the lever to come
 

00:31:04.569 --> 00:31:06.930
the buggy to allow the lever to come
through and at the last minute and we

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:06.940
through and at the last minute and we
 

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.339
through and at the last minute and we
had never done this in practice our

00:31:08.339 --> 00:31:08.349
had never done this in practice our
 

00:31:08.349 --> 00:31:10.199
had never done this in practice our

car driver Chris Winkler decided that he

00:31:14.069 --> 00:31:14.079
car driver Chris Winkler decided that he
 

00:31:14.079 --> 00:31:15.809
car driver Chris Winkler decided that he
wanted to make it aerodynamic so he put

00:31:15.809 --> 00:31:15.819
wanted to make it aerodynamic so he put
 

00:31:15.819 --> 00:31:17.939
wanted to make it aerodynamic so he put
little bits of tape on other side of the

00:31:17.939 --> 00:31:17.949
little bits of tape on other side of the
 

00:31:17.949 --> 00:31:19.739
little bits of tape on other side of the
break and then the break seized up and

00:31:19.739 --> 00:31:19.749
break and then the break seized up and
 

00:31:19.749 --> 00:31:21.180
break and then the break seized up and
you know we would have gotten sixth

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:21.190
you know we would have gotten sixth
 

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:22.499
you know we would have gotten sixth
place with that I had that had that not

00:31:22.499 --> 00:31:22.509
place with that I had that had that not
 

00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:24.269
place with that I had that had that not
happened so you have to worry about

00:31:24.269 --> 00:31:24.279
happened so you have to worry about
 

00:31:24.279 --> 00:31:25.829
happened so you have to worry about
bricks and I guess do you have to worry

00:31:25.829 --> 00:31:25.839
bricks and I guess do you have to worry
 

00:31:25.839 --> 00:31:29.609
bricks and I guess do you have to worry
about you know maintenance like one of

00:31:29.609 --> 00:31:29.619
about you know maintenance like one of
 

00:31:29.619 --> 00:31:30.959
about you know maintenance like one of

like what we were thinking in order to

00:31:49.769 --> 00:31:49.779
like what we were thinking in order to
 

00:31:49.779 --> 00:31:50.830
like what we were thinking in order to
get this

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:50.840

the driver in the whole front of the
 

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:56.650
the driver in the whole front of the
buggy actually came off and so there's a

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:56.660
buggy actually came off and so there's a
 

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.360
buggy actually came off and so there's a
there was like a fork on the front like

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:58.370
there was like a fork on the front like
 

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:00.220
there was like a fork on the front like
a bicycle and then of the wheels off the

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:00.230
a bicycle and then of the wheels off the
 

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:02.950
a bicycle and then of the wheels off the
fork and there's a panel and took a

little pieces of living and they were
 

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.100
little pieces of living and they were
bolted together and to get her in we

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:06.110
bolted together and to get her in we
 

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.960
bolted together and to get her in we
take the whole assembly off put her in

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:07.970
take the whole assembly off put her in
 

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:10.480
take the whole assembly off put her in

a nightmare to get it aligned it was

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.200
a nightmare to get it aligned it was

a nightmare to get it aligned it was
never align right it was an awful thing

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:13.790
never align right it was an awful thing

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600
and
 

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.690
and
and a few hours later you know he's in

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:03.700
and a few hours later you know he's in
 

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.490
and a few hours later you know he's in
the buggy room and I have the buggy

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:05.500
the buggy room and I have the buggy
 

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.380
the buggy room and I have the buggy
apart and I'm looking at it and you know

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:07.390
apart and I'm looking at it and you know
 

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.270

it was a space frame that was shattered
 

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:13.340
it was a space frame that was shattered
and another bad idea is not only was a

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:13.350
and another bad idea is not only was a
 

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:15.359

way that the space room was put together
 

00:34:15.369 --> 00:34:19.109
way that the space room was put together
it was epoxy together and if he had done

00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119
it was epoxy together and if he had done
 

00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:20.340
it was epoxy together and if he had done
it the right way it would have worked

but we didn't and so all the joints just

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200
but we didn't and so all the joints just
 

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.129
but we didn't and so all the joints just
pop on this thing and you know I'm

after you get out of here next point
want to go back to activity theory and

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:24.740
want to go back to activity theory and
 

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.490
want to go back to activity theory and
put give you another layer of activity

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:27.500
put give you another layer of activity
 

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.800

of how to look at things and really what

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:32.360
of how to look at things and really what
 

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.060
of how to look at things and really what
I'm trying to get at is is let's look at

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:34.070
I'm trying to get at is is let's look at
 

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.740
I'm trying to get at is is let's look at
an organization how do you analyze an

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:35.750
an organization how do you analyze an
 

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:38.110
an organization how do you analyze an
organization I've analyzes the task how

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:38.120
organization I've analyzes the task how
 

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.880
organization I've analyzes the task how
do you analyze an organization so you

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:39.890
do you analyze an organization so you
 

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:41.680
do you analyze an organization so you
recognize the whole individual team task

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:41.690
recognize the whole individual team task
 

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:45.430

outcome thing activity theory posits the

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440
outcome thing activity theory posits the
 

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.910
outcome thing activity theory posits the
existence of what they call mediators

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:48.920
existence of what they call mediators
 

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.000
existence of what they call mediators
and mediators are things that guide you

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.010
and mediators are things that guide you
 

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:53.920
and mediators are things that guide you
guide you and your work right and

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:53.930
guide you and your work right and
 

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:55.690
guide you and your work right and
they're both enabling and limiting and

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:55.700
they're both enabling and limiting and
 

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.330
they're both enabling and limiting and
they're both internal and external so

00:39:58.330 --> 00:39:58.340
they're both internal and external so
 

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.250
they're both internal and external so
you can kind of think of personal work

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:00.260
you can kind of think of personal work
 

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.430
you can kind of think of personal work

people an organization is organized to
 

00:41:00.259 --> 00:41:01.509
people an organization is organized to
do something so how does that

training that you have right then if you

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880
training that you have right then if you
 

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.269
training that you have right then if you
look at how does that team divided

00:41:31.269 --> 00:41:31.279
look at how does that team divided
 

00:41:31.279 --> 00:41:33.130
look at how does that team divided
itself up to work on that task how do

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:33.140
itself up to work on that task how do
 

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.630
itself up to work on that task how do
you have that division of labor or a

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640
you have that division of labor or a
 

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.729
you have that division of labor or a
division of labor it's really kind of

00:41:36.729 --> 00:41:36.739
division of labor it's really kind of
 

00:41:36.739 --> 00:41:39.009
division of labor it's really kind of
two things one is your hierarchical

00:41:39.009 --> 00:41:39.019
two things one is your hierarchical
 

00:41:39.019 --> 00:41:40.930
two things one is your hierarchical
structure your management structure how

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:40.940
structure your management structure how
 

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.839
structure your management structure how
do you communicate and control and work

00:41:43.839 --> 00:41:43.849
do you communicate and control and work

the organization that way but really
 

00:41:45.859 --> 00:41:48.699
the organization that way but really
importantly also the way you have

00:41:48.699 --> 00:41:48.709
importantly also the way you have
 

00:41:48.709 --> 00:41:51.609
importantly also the way you have
division and flavor you have this again

00:41:51.609 --> 00:41:51.619
division and flavor you have this again
 

00:41:51.619 --> 00:41:53.709
division and flavor you have this again
more kind of top-down hierarchy but you

00:41:53.709 --> 00:41:53.719
more kind of top-down hierarchy but you
 

00:41:53.719 --> 00:41:56.589
more kind of top-down hierarchy but you
have to have mechanisms of bridge so if

00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599
have to have mechanisms of bridge so if
 

00:41:56.599 --> 00:41:58.299
have to have mechanisms of bridge so if
you can look at an organization chart

00:41:58.299 --> 00:41:58.309
you can look at an organization chart
 

00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:59.769
you can look at an organization chart
you have these boxes right and then come

00:41:59.769 --> 00:41:59.779
you have these boxes right and then come
 

00:41:59.779 --> 00:42:01.809
you have these boxes right and then come
time to come down there's often times

00:42:01.809 --> 00:42:01.819
time to come down there's often times
 

00:42:01.819 --> 00:42:03.099
time to come down there's often times
where you need to bridge from one

00:42:03.099 --> 00:42:03.109
where you need to bridge from one
 

00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:04.239
where you need to bridge from one
organization or one part of the

cross-functional team when I did a lot

00:42:11.289 --> 00:42:11.299
cross-functional team when I did a lot
 

00:42:11.299 --> 00:42:12.969
cross-functional team when I did a lot
of that when I was at practice area but

00:42:12.969 --> 00:42:12.979
of that when I was at practice area but
 

00:42:12.979 --> 00:42:14.019
of that when I was at practice area but
you'd have a marketing person a

00:42:14.019 --> 00:42:14.029
you'd have a marketing person a
 

00:42:14.029 --> 00:42:16.059
you'd have a marketing person a
salesperson and operations person you

00:42:16.059 --> 00:42:16.069
salesperson and operations person you
 

00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:17.469
salesperson and operations person you
know in an RD person all on the same

00:42:17.469 --> 00:42:17.479
know in an RD person all on the same
 

00:42:17.479 --> 00:42:19.390

team that's a liaison device so it's a

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:19.400
team that's a liaison device so it's a
 

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.650
team that's a liaison device so it's a
means by which you coordinate your

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:20.660
means by which you coordinate your
 

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:23.109
means by which you coordinate your
activity across and bridge the

00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119
activity across and bridge the
 

00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:27.099
activity across and bridge the
organization so these are all structural

00:42:27.099 --> 00:42:27.109
organization so these are all structural
 

00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:28.269
organization so these are all structural
things these are kind of like how you

00:42:28.269 --> 00:42:28.279
things these are kind of like how you
 

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:30.939
things these are kind of like how you
design the organization or and these are

00:42:30.939 --> 00:42:30.949
design the organization or and these are
 

00:42:30.949 --> 00:42:32.939
design the organization or and these are
all the kind of the task focused things

00:42:32.939 --> 00:42:32.949
all the kind of the task focused things
 

00:42:32.949 --> 00:42:35.709
all the kind of the task focused things
but I would say even more important than

00:42:35.709 --> 00:42:35.719
but I would say even more important than
 

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:37.660
but I would say even more important than
that if you look at an organization or

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:37.670
that if you look at an organization or
 

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.789
that if you look at an organization or
the people side of it it's interesting

00:42:39.789 --> 00:42:39.799
the people side of it it's interesting
 

00:42:39.799 --> 00:42:40.870
the people side of it it's interesting
what's went to

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880
what's went to
 

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.920
what's went to
and believe it or not they have

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:41.930
and believe it or not they have
 

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:43.630
and believe it or not they have
conferences they'd have titles like this

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640
conferences they'd have titles like this
 

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.280
conferences they'd have titles like this
the conference called front end of

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:45.290
the conference called front end of
 

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:47.170
the conference called front end of
innovation big comforter people really

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:47.180
innovation big comforter people really
 

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.580
innovation big comforter people really
kind of get into how do you do new

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:48.590
kind of get into how do you do new
 

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:49.780
kind of get into how do you do new
product development especially on the

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:49.790
product development especially on the
 

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:50.890
product development especially on the
front end how do you figure out what to

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:50.900
front end how do you figure out what to
 

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:53.200
front end how do you figure out what to
work on and it was a panel discussion

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:53.210
work on and it was a panel discussion
 

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:56.200
work on and it was a panel discussion
and it was debate where the debate was

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:56.210
and it was debate where the debate was
 

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:57.820
and it was debate where the debate was
what's more important the processes you

00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:57.830
what's more important the processes you
 

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:00.280
what's more important the processes you
use or the people that are involved and

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:00.290
use or the people that are involved and
 

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:03.100
use or the people that are involved and
there was a vote and you know hands-down

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:03.110
there was a vote and you know hands-down
 

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.740
there was a vote and you know hands-down
process one you know and I think part of

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:05.750
process one you know and I think part of
 

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:07.600
process one you know and I think part of
it is a lot of people were at that come

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:07.610
it is a lot of people were at that come
 

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:09.250
it is a lot of people were at that come
for like me we're process people so

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:09.260
for like me we're process people so
 

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.570
for like me we're process people so
you're kind of justifying your existence

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:10.580
you're kind of justifying your existence
 

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.190
you're kind of justifying your existence
or something I think another part of it

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.200
or something I think another part of it
 

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.600
or something I think another part of it
is those were actually better debaters

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:13.610
is those were actually better debaters
 

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:15.730
is those were actually better debaters
so it was it more you know it was easy

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:15.740
so it was it more you know it was easy
 

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:17.980
so it was it more you know it was easy
to convince people and then I went back

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:17.990
to convince people and then I went back
 

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:19.420
to convince people and then I went back
to my hotel room and I thought about it

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:19.430
to my hotel room and I thought about it
 

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:20.800
to my hotel room and I thought about it
I'm like oh that's completely wrong

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:20.810
I'm like oh that's completely wrong
 

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:22.900
I'm like oh that's completely wrong
clearly clearly if you look at an

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:22.910
clearly clearly if you look at an
 

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:24.790
clearly clearly if you look at an
organization the most important part is

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800
organization the most important part is
 

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.320
organization the most important part is
not your process he's not your structure

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:26.330
not your process he's not your structure
 

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:27.400
not your process he's not your structure
of your organization but the people

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:27.410
of your organization but the people
 

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:28.660
of your organization but the people
themselves because that's where the

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:28.670
themselves because that's where the
 

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:30.400
themselves because that's where the
structure comes from right and those are

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:30.410
structure comes from right and those are
 

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:31.840
structure comes from right and those are
them and that's how that structure gets

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:31.850
them and that's how that structure gets
 

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:34.120
them and that's how that structure gets
used it's fun of those people so you can

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:34.130
used it's fun of those people so you can
 

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:36.310
used it's fun of those people so you can
look at organizations as structure and

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:36.320
look at organizations as structure and
 

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.380
look at organizations as structure and
its people and if you look at the people

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:38.390
its people and if you look at the people
 

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:39.550
its people and if you look at the people
apart again these coordinating

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:39.560
apart again these coordinating
 

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.740
apart again these coordinating
mechanisms if you look at an individual

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:41.750
mechanisms if you look at an individual
 

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:44.620
mechanisms if you look at an individual
acting on you know the team acting on

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:44.630
acting on you know the team acting on
 

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:47.580
acting on you know the team acting on
the rest of people here's you know the

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:47.590
the rest of people here's you know the
 

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:50.590
the rest of people here's you know the
external comm unit i said but these

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:50.600
external comm unit i said but these
 

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.230
external comm unit i said but these
mediators are both external and internal

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240
mediators are both external and internal
 

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.610
mediators are both external and internal
so the external kind of thing is the

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:54.620
so the external kind of thing is the
 

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.140
so the external kind of thing is the
individual acting on the team is that

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:56.150
individual acting on the team is that
 

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:57.370
individual acting on the team is that
person's ability to be a leader and

00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:57.380
person's ability to be a leader and
 

00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.320
person's ability to be a leader and
leadership and influencing others the

00:43:59.320 --> 00:43:59.330
leadership and influencing others the
 

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:00.940
leadership and influencing others the
more internal part is self motivation

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:00.950
more internal part is self motivation
 

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:02.770
more internal part is self motivation
you're motivating yourself so leadership

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:02.780
you're motivating yourself so leadership
 

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.130
you're motivating yourself so leadership
and motivation become really important

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:05.140
and motivation become really important
 

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:08.250
and motivation become really important
then if you look at how does the group

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:08.260
then if you look at how does the group
 

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.810
then if you look at how does the group
interact to the individual influence the

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:10.820
interact to the individual influence the
 

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.120
interact to the individual influence the
individual well what is you know the

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:13.130
individual well what is you know the
 

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:14.860
individual well what is you know the
culture your corporate culture or social

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:14.870
culture your corporate culture or social
 

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:16.030
culture your corporate culture or social
norms but you can use different words

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:16.040
norms but you can use different words
 

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.860
norms but you can use different words
about it but that's that you know what

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:17.870
about it but that's that you know what
 

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:19.030
about it but that's that you know what
are their kind of rules of engagement

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040
are their kind of rules of engagement
 

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.930
are their kind of rules of engagement
rules of human engagement so typically

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:22.940
rules of human engagement so typically
 

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.280
rules of human engagement so typically
you know people are familiar with using

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:24.290
you know people are familiar with using
 

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.800
you know people are familiar with using
corporate culture but it's not just so

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:26.810
corporate culture but it's not just so
 

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:28.480
corporate culture but it's not just so
that would be again more the external

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:28.490
that would be again more the external
 

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:30.880
that would be again more the external
thing but it's also who you all who you

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:30.890
thing but it's also who you all who you
 

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:32.620
thing but it's also who you all who you
interact with your personal network of

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:32.630
interact with your personal network of
 

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:34.360
interact with your personal network of
people those are also that's also a

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:34.370
people those are also that's also a
 

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:38.020
people those are also that's also a
mediator right like I said I'm going to

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:38.030
mediator right like I said I'm going to
 

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:44.800
mediator right like I said I'm going to
go and let me tie back that conception

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:44.810
go and let me tie back that conception
 

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:47.050
go and let me tie back that conception
or you know that conceptual model of

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:47.060
or you know that conceptual model of
 

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:49.210
or you know that conceptual model of
these coordinating mechanisms and tie it

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:49.220
these coordinating mechanisms and tie it
 

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.910
these coordinating mechanisms and tie it
back to innovation so what are the

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920
back to innovation so what are the
 

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.590
back to innovation so what are the
things that are critical for innovation

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:53.600
things that are critical for innovation
 

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.540
things that are critical for innovation
I think there's really two main areas

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:55.550
I think there's really two main areas
 

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:56.770
I think there's really two main areas
are really really critical for

00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:56.780
are really really critical for
 

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:58.480
are really really critical for
innovation and they go back to that

00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:58.490
innovation and they go back to that
 

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:01.270
innovation and they go back to that
invention plus application to drive

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280
invention plus application to drive
 

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.370
invention plus application to drive
invention the one thing that you can

00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:03.380
invention the one thing that you can
 

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.370
invention the one thing that you can
really effectively drive in invention to

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:06.380
really effectively drive in invention to
 

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.620
really effectively drive in invention to
do is to drive collaboration you got to

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:08.630
do is to drive collaboration you got to
 

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:10.270
do is to drive collaboration you got to
have an exchange of ideas that's really

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:10.280
have an exchange of ideas that's really
 

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.440
have an exchange of ideas that's really
really for me that's why we have patents

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:11.450
really for me that's why we have patents
 

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:13.720
really for me that's why we have patents
is so that information gets shared so

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:13.730
is so that information gets shared so
 

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:15.840
is so that information gets shared so
you have to have a sharing of ideas to

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:15.850
you have to have a sharing of ideas to
 

00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:19.090
you have to have a sharing of ideas to
drive invention but it's not again it's

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:19.100
drive invention but it's not again it's
 

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.650
drive invention but it's not again it's
not just invention innovation is not

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:20.660
not just invention innovation is not
 

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:22.540
not just invention innovation is not
just invention innovation is also

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:22.550
just invention innovation is also
 

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:24.670
just invention innovation is also
application it's taking those that that

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:24.680
application it's taking those that that
 

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.050
application it's taking those that that
invention and applying it well how do

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:26.060
invention and applying it well how do
 

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:27.220
invention and applying it well how do
you do that well you've got to focus

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:27.230
you do that well you've got to focus
 

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:29.200
you do that well you've got to focus
your organization so you have this thing

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:29.210
your organization so you have this thing
 

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:30.400
your organization so you have this thing
where you have collaboration and you

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:30.410
where you have collaboration and you
 

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:33.300
where you have collaboration and you
have focus again so if you look at

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:33.310
have focus again so if you look at
 

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:35.050
have focus again so if you look at
collaboration being critical for the

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:35.060
collaboration being critical for the
 

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.700

of the buggy you still have enough

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:08.360
of the buggy you still have enough
 

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:11.140
of the buggy you still have enough
enough a carbon fiber that you keep the

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:11.150
enough a carbon fiber that you keep the
 

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:13.570
enough a carbon fiber that you keep the
tude solid then the problem becomes and

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:13.580
tude solid then the problem becomes and
 

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:15.520
tude solid then the problem becomes and
then you can basically he slides in over

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:15.530
then you can basically he slides in over
 

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:17.260
then you can basically he slides in over
the wheel so now we didn't have the

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:17.270
the wheel so now we didn't have the
 

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:18.130
the wheel so now we didn't have the
problem didn't have to take the wheel

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:18.140
problem didn't have to take the wheel
 

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:20.350

00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:20.930
stuff done and was really really helpful
so all these people stood up and we

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:20.940
so all these people stood up and we
 

00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:22.010
so all these people stood up and we
really did have a management rector

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:22.020
really did have a management rector
 

00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:23.150
really did have a management rector
again all the teams have a little bit

00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160
again all the teams have a little bit
 

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:26.890
again all the teams have a little bit
different but but that was ours saying

00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:26.900
different but but that was ours saying
 

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:30.560
different but but that was ours saying
and just to finish it up tool yeah julia

00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:30.570
and just to finish it up tool yeah julia
 

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:32.780
and just to finish it up tool yeah julia
is the buggy people laugh right it's on

00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:32.790
is the buggy people laugh right it's on
 

00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:34.970
is the buggy people laugh right it's on
those special training and tools as

00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:34.980
those special training and tools as
 

00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:36.350
those special training and tools as
being these coordinating mechanisms

00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:36.360
being these coordinating mechanisms
 

00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:37.700
being these coordinating mechanisms
clearly it makes sense that there's

00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:37.710
clearly it makes sense that there's
 

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:38.990
clearly it makes sense that there's
tools and buggy and everyone who doesn't

00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000
tools and buggy and everyone who doesn't
 

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.430
tools and buggy and everyone who doesn't
knows buggy than those that the most

00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.440
knows buggy than those that the most
 

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.110
knows buggy than those that the most
important tool in the buggy room is duct

00:58:42.110 --> 00:58:42.120
important tool in the buggy room is duct
 

00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:44.450
important tool in the buggy room is duct
tape although although actually spirits

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:44.460
tape although although actually spirits
 

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:47.270
tape although although actually spirits
case the most important tool in the

00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280
case the most important tool in the
 

00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.980
case the most important tool in the
bugging room is this piece of wood but

00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:48.990
bugging room is this piece of wood but
 

00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:50.750
bugging room is this piece of wood but
has to do with how we build our buggies

00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:50.760
has to do with how we build our buggies
 

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:52.580
has to do with how we build our buggies
and it really does say the most

00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:52.590
and it really does say the most
 

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:53.720
and it really does say the most
important tool in the buggy room is

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:53.730
important tool in the buggy room is
 

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:55.280
important tool in the buggy room is
written on is written in marker on that

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:55.290
written on is written in marker on that
 

00:58:55.290 --> 00:58:57.170
written on is written in marker on that
self but it's not just tools you really

00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:57.180
self but it's not just tools you really
 

00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:58.370
self but it's not just tools you really
do have training and you really didn't

00:58:58.370 --> 00:58:58.380
do have training and you really didn't
 

00:58:58.380 --> 00:58:59.810
do have training and you really didn't
have practice all the time so this is a

00:58:59.810 --> 00:58:59.820
have practice all the time so this is a
 

00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:05.960
have practice all the time so this is a
part of the organization in and buggy so

00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:05.970
part of the organization in and buggy so
 

00:59:05.970 --> 00:59:08.000
part of the organization in and buggy so
based on you know the buggy or any of

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:08.010
based on you know the buggy or any of
 

00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:09.140
based on you know the buggy or any of
that I have that conception of what

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:09.150
that I have that conception of what
 

00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:11.180
that I have that conception of what
innovation is me you know when an

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:11.190
innovation is me you know when an
 

00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:13.490
innovation is me you know when an
organization is from from the activity

00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:13.500
organization is from from the activity
 

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:15.590
organization is from from the activity
theory stuff and use it through buggy

00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:15.600
theory stuff and use it through buggy
 

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.120
theory stuff and use it through buggy
I'm this is the stuff I can say is you

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:17.130
I'm this is the stuff I can say is you
 

00:59:17.130 --> 00:59:18.200
I'm this is the stuff I can say is you
know if you're kind of create an

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:18.210
know if you're kind of create an
 

00:59:18.210 --> 00:59:20.030
know if you're kind of create an
innovative organization to do an

00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:20.040
innovative organization to do an
 

00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:22.190
innovative organization to do an
innovative task the most important thing

00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200
innovative task the most important thing
 

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.170
innovative task the most important thing
is to people so you got to recruit

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180
is to people so you got to recruit
 

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:26.000
is to people so you got to recruit
talented people you got to retain him

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:26.010
talented people you got to retain him
 

00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:27.800
talented people you got to retain him
you gotta motivate them right then

00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:27.810
you gotta motivate them right then
 

00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:29.660
you gotta motivate them right then
you've got to have you know a culture

00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:29.670
you've got to have you know a culture
 

00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:31.310
you've got to have you know a culture
and you got to have these mechanisms in

00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:31.320
and you got to have these mechanisms in
 

00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:32.990
and you got to have these mechanisms in
place that really encourage

00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000
place that really encourage
 

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.550
place that really encourage
collaboration that this is a really

00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:34.560
collaboration that this is a really
 

00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:35.960
collaboration that this is a really
really important part of an innovative

00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:35.970
really important part of an innovative
 

00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:38.210
really important part of an innovative
organization you also need to have all

00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:38.220
organization you also need to have all
 

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:39.500
organization you also need to have all
the motivation and leadership and

00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:39.510
the motivation and leadership and
 

00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:41.480
the motivation and leadership and
structure that you have collaboration

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:41.490
structure that you have collaboration
 

00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:43.370
structure that you have collaboration
but you have focus you focus on on

00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:43.380
but you have focus you focus on on
 

00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:44.720
but you have focus you focus on on
making the things that aren't really

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:44.730
making the things that aren't really
 

00:59:44.730 --> 00:59:46.250
making the things that aren't really
applying it you need to have that and

00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:46.260
applying it you need to have that and
 

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:47.660
applying it you need to have that and
then of course you have to give your

00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:47.670
then of course you have to give your
 

00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:49.940
then of course you have to give your
folks the right tools in the right

00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:49.950
folks the right tools in the right
 

00:59:49.950 --> 00:59:52.670
folks the right tools in the right
training to go along with that so it's a

00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680
training to go along with that so it's a
 

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.230
training to go along with that so it's a
conclusion you know as I've kind of try

00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240
conclusion you know as I've kind of try
 

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.180
conclusion you know as I've kind of try
to give you at least a conceptual or a

00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:56.190
to give you at least a conceptual or a
 

00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:57.350
to give you at least a conceptual or a
couple different reception models for

00:59:57.350 --> 00:59:57.360
couple different reception models for
 

00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.810
couple different reception models for
innovation and then used in New a little

00:59:59.810 --> 00:59:59.820
innovation and then used in New a little
 

00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:01.130
innovation and then used in New a little
bit about new product development and

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:01.140
bit about new product development and
 

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.960
bit about new product development and
then use primarily buggies an example

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:02.970
then use primarily buggies an example
 

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:05.420
then use primarily buggies an example
you know I think I can now say this you

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:05.430
you know I think I can now say this you
 

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:07.910
you know I think I can now say this you
know is that all anybody needs about

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920
know is that all anybody needs about
 

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.220
know is that all anybody needs about
innovation is to do buggy so it's not

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:10.230
innovation is to do buggy so it's not
 

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:11.600
innovation is to do buggy so it's not
just you know I don't think I don't that

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:11.610
just you know I don't think I don't that
 

01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:12.770
just you know I don't think I don't that
I certainly know I see up people from

01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:12.780
I certainly know I see up people from
 

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:14.780
I certainly know I see up people from
other organizations it's my experience

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:14.790
other organizations it's my experience
 

01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:15.920
other organizations it's my experience
and experiences

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:15.930
and experiences
 

01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:17.810
and experiences
spirit back in the 80s is we're not the

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:17.820
spirit back in the 80s is we're not the
 

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:30.980
spirit back in the 80s is we're not the
only ones so thank you if anyone has any

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:30.990
only ones so thank you if anyone has any
 

01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:36.530
only ones so thank you if anyone has any
questions now we're yeah how do you have

01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:36.540
questions now we're yeah how do you have
 

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.420
questions now we're yeah how do you have
a really relaxed and collaborative

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:38.430
a really relaxed and collaborative
 

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:42.710
a really relaxed and collaborative
environment for people to kind of talk

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720
environment for people to kind of talk
 

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.970
environment for people to kind of talk
with each other and brainstorm yet like

01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:46.980
with each other and brainstorm yet like
 

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.190
with each other and brainstorm yet like
keep people motivated to actually

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200
keep people motivated to actually
 

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.570
keep people motivated to actually
accomplish something in other words you

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:53.580
accomplish something in other words you
 

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:58.280
accomplish something in other words you
know as a manager how do you balance you

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:58.290
know as a manager how do you balance you
 

01:00:58.290 --> 01:01:00.920
know as a manager how do you balance you
know having people be in a collaborative

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:00.930
know having people be in a collaborative
 

01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:03.620
know having people be in a collaborative
environment that actually work right and

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:03.630
environment that actually work right and
 

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:05.270
environment that actually work right and
I actually I think that's probably that

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280
I actually I think that's probably that
 

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.550
I actually I think that's probably that
the biggest challenge right is in some

01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:07.560
the biggest challenge right is in some
 

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.980
the biggest challenge right is in some
ways that invention and collaboration

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:09.990
ways that invention and collaboration
 

01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:12.530
ways that invention and collaboration
and that application focus our kind of

01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:12.540
and that application focus our kind of
 

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:14.450
and that application focus our kind of
antithetical right you know one thing

01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:14.460
antithetical right you know one thing
 

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.770
antithetical right you know one thing
let's go down this path and it's going

01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780
let's go down this path and it's going
 

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:16.880
let's go down this path and it's going
to do it and the other thing you're

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:16.890
to do it and the other thing you're
 

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:18.770
to do it and the other thing you're
saying oh let's explore right and to be

01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:18.780
saying oh let's explore right and to be
 

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.300
saying oh let's explore right and to be
able to balance those two can be really

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:20.310
able to balance those two can be really
 

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:22.730
able to balance those two can be really
difficult my experience I mean my own

01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:22.740
difficult my experience I mean my own
 

01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:25.490
difficult my experience I mean my own
personal experiences both doing buggy

01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:25.500
personal experiences both doing buggy
 

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.950
personal experiences both doing buggy
and then was when I was a technical

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:27.960
and then was when I was a technical
 

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.690
and then was when I was a technical
manager at a pretty big group at praxair

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:29.700
manager at a pretty big group at praxair
 

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.360
manager at a pretty big group at praxair
was to be really open with people and

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:32.370
was to be really open with people and
 

01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:35.030
was to be really open with people and
really direct with people and and and

really direct with people and and and
first of all I mean have an environment

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:36.420
first of all I mean have an environment
 

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:37.610
first of all I mean have an environment
where you really told I mean I would you

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:37.620
where you really told I mean I would you
 

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:39.590
where you really told I mean I would you
know tell people and you know and my
