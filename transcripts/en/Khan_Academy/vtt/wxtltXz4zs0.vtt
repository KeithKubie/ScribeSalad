00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:03.162
Narrator: Benito
Musssolini's rise to power

00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:06.603
in the early 1920s in
Italy is a fairly rapid,

00:00:06.603 --> 00:00:10.823
and from historical perspective,
fairly surprising one.

00:00:10.823 --> 00:00:14.799
To give some context, as late as 1915,

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.900
(writing) 1915, he had
recently been ousted

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.813
from the Italian Socialist
Party based on his decent

00:00:20.813 --> 00:00:23.334
over whether Italy should enter the war.

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:26.154
The official stance of the party is that

00:00:26.154 --> 00:00:29.217
World War I is an imperialist war,

00:00:29.217 --> 00:00:31.269
that Italy had no business entering it,

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.862
that Italy should stay neutral,

00:00:32.862 --> 00:00:35.668
but you had more nationalist
elements in the party

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.152
and Mussolini was one of them.

00:00:37.152 --> 00:00:39.181
He says, no this is
Italy's chance for glory,

00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:42.181
this is Italy's chance
to build its empire.

00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:45.430
So, in 1915 he's ousted
from the Socialist Party

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.679
and he decides to start his own group

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:53.927
called the Fasci d'azione rivoluzionaria

00:00:53.927 --> 00:00:56.389
and I talk about that
in the video on fascism,

00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:00.341
but it was often referred
to as the Milan fascio

00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:02.852
(writing) the Milan fascio

00:01:02.852 --> 00:01:05.671
which was a group that
was strongly nationalist

00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:07.592
that was pro entering the war.

00:01:07.592 --> 00:01:09.391
Italy does eventually enter the war,

00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:10.852
not necessarily because of these guys,

00:01:10.852 --> 00:01:15.846
this was still a fairly
insignificant organization.

00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:17.455
The reason why I'm
mentioning it is it shows

00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:19.864
Mussolini even before
the war was showing these

00:01:19.864 --> 00:01:22.054
very strong nationalistic tendencies

00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:24.785
and this tendency to start organizations

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:28.512
that were pro-nationalist
and he tended to call

00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:30.998
them fasci.

00:01:30.998 --> 00:01:33.774
He get's this notion of fasci ...

00:01:33.774 --> 00:01:35.601
The term had been used
well before Mussolini

00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:37.735
for a kind of league of revolutionaries,

00:01:37.735 --> 00:01:40.405
league of people who are looking to

00:01:40.405 --> 00:01:43.343
take action on something.

00:01:43.343 --> 00:01:46.165
Then he enters into the war as a soldier

00:01:46.165 --> 00:01:50.736
and then exiting the war in 1919,

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:56.235
he decides to reorganize
or to start leading

00:01:56.235 --> 00:01:58.318
a group again.

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:02.188
This time he calls it the
Fasci di Combattimento.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:10.547
(writing) Fasci di
Combattimento, battimento

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.452
which could literally be translated as

00:02:12.452 --> 00:02:14.850
the league of combatants.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.869
This isn't even a formal
party at this point of time,

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:21.461
it's really a collection of
a couple of hundred people.

00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:25.871
The estimates I've seen
is about 200 individuals

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:27.393
who group together.

00:02:27.393 --> 00:02:32.876
What unifies them is a strongly
anti-socialist ideology.

00:02:32.876 --> 00:02:34.689
There's an irony here because Mussolini

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.124
was in the socialist party before the war,

00:02:37.124 --> 00:02:40.714
but is a strongly anti-socialist ideology

00:02:40.714 --> 00:02:44.179
and a strongly nationalist ideology.

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.957
To understand where this
strong anti-socialist

00:02:47.957 --> 00:02:51.725
or anti-Bolshevik ideology
came from you have to

00:02:51.725 --> 00:02:53.918
understand the context of Italy and Europe

00:02:53.918 --> 00:02:54.921
of that time.

00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:57.714
You have to remember
that the Russian Empire

00:02:57.714 --> 00:03:00.383
fell during World War I, it was now run by

00:03:00.383 --> 00:03:01.450
the communists.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.817
You have a fear that
that is going to spread

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:04.812
throughout Europe.

00:03:04.812 --> 00:03:09.052
You have the leading
party in Italy at the time

00:03:09.052 --> 00:03:10.859
is the Italian Socialist Party,

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.124
you have a left-leaning government.

00:03:14.124 --> 00:03:19.354
There is a desire to react
against that seeming spread

00:03:19.354 --> 00:03:23.217
of socialism or of communism.

00:03:23.217 --> 00:03:25.999
These guys don't view it
as hey let's meet together

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.135
and talk about and maybe
try to run for elections.

00:03:28.135 --> 00:03:30.499
They want to actively coerce people.

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.399
They want to actively intimidate people

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:35.602
and these groups that
would rise out of this,

00:03:35.602 --> 00:03:38.404
that would be strongly anti-socialist

00:03:38.404 --> 00:03:43.183
and the anti left-leaning government

00:03:43.183 --> 00:03:45.059
they would wear these black shirts

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:47.116
and they were often
called The Black Shirts.

00:03:47.116 --> 00:03:48.747
Which I wont write in
black because then you

00:03:48.747 --> 00:03:51.266
wouldn't see it, so I'll
write in this blue color.

00:03:51.266 --> 00:03:53.053
(writing) These Black Shirts.

00:03:53.053 --> 00:03:55.391
These were very loosely organized bands,

00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:57.532
they were often called fasci,

00:03:57.532 --> 00:04:01.988
it would often be young
men who would gather

00:04:01.988 --> 00:04:03.541
together in towns throughout Italy

00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:06.949
and say we believe in this
anti-socialist ideology,

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:10.681
we want to take up arms
and intimidate socialist,

00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:12.805
intimidate people on the left.

00:04:12.805 --> 00:04:14.535
So, you have these Black Shirts,

00:04:14.535 --> 00:04:16.888
this paramilitary group starting to arise.

00:04:16.888 --> 00:04:19.472
In 1919, I want to emphasize, very small,

00:04:19.472 --> 00:04:23.270
very, very small, very,
very insignificant,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.807
but their influence grows.

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.862
You have more and more
of these fasci forming

00:04:27.862 --> 00:04:28.746
throughout Europe.

00:04:28.746 --> 00:04:30.750
Not through Europe, throughout Italy.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.641
This is very appealing
to, especially young boys

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:35.686
in Italy.

00:04:35.686 --> 00:04:39.076
Mussolini, himself, is
a very inspiring orator.

00:04:39.076 --> 00:04:43.362
He's kind of this larger
than life personality.

00:04:44.715 --> 00:04:47.340
Sometimes what he says
didn't necessarily make

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.533
complete logical sense,
but it really appealed

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:53.128
to people's emotions, that
he was a strong leader,

00:04:53.128 --> 00:04:55.849
that someone that they would
actually want to follow.

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.517
In two short years you forward to 1921,

00:04:58.517 --> 00:05:01.333
(writing) 1921.

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:04.404
This Fasci di Combattimento
had now morphed

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:07.396
into a real national party, it's now ...

00:05:07.396 --> 00:05:11.998
and they renamed
themselves the nationalist

00:05:11.998 --> 00:05:15.727
or the National Fascist Party.

00:05:15.727 --> 00:05:16.727
(writing) Fascist Party.

00:05:16.727 --> 00:05:17.872
Obviously it wasn't
called that in Italian.

00:05:17.872 --> 00:05:22.807
In Italian it was the
Partito Nazionale Fascista

00:05:22.807 --> 00:05:26.400
and Mussolini is the leading figure here.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.068
He gets elected to the Chamber of Deputes.

00:05:30.068 --> 00:05:31.790
(writing) Chamber of Deputes

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.882
along with several other fascists,

00:05:33.882 --> 00:05:35.733
but they're still a fairly small party.

00:05:35.733 --> 00:05:38.130
Although they've already
now they're gaining steam,

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.965
they're becoming
mainstream, but even though

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:43.157
they're becoming more
mainstream they still haven't

00:05:43.157 --> 00:05:46.711
given up their use of force and their use

00:05:46.711 --> 00:05:48.138
of intimidation.

00:05:48.138 --> 00:05:51.805
Then we forward to 1922 and
all of this is happening

00:05:51.805 --> 00:05:55.558
quite rapidly, but by 1922 Italy is not in

00:05:55.558 --> 00:05:56.448
a good situation.

00:05:56.448 --> 00:05:58.222
People aren't happy with
the left-leaning government,

00:05:58.222 --> 00:06:00.323
they feel that it's
weak, that it's not able

00:06:00.323 --> 00:06:02.304
to turn the economy
around, that it's not able

00:06:02.304 --> 00:06:05.222
to bring order, that the
extreme left is having

00:06:05.222 --> 00:06:08.060
too much power, that
they're too many strikes,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.239
that the country isn't being run properly;

00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:13.982
the middle class and the
elite aren't happy with this.

00:06:13.982 --> 00:06:17.133
So, the fascists are getting more and more

00:06:17.133 --> 00:06:18.619
and more followers.

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:21.070
One, kind of you could
say civilian followers,

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.302
but they're also getting
more and more fasci

00:06:23.302 --> 00:06:24.635
that are forming.

00:06:24.635 --> 00:06:28.969
They're showing that their use of violence

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:33.190
actually can sometimes
get goals that the weaker

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.570
government couldn't get,
they were able to break

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.876
strikes in 1922 with the perception that

00:06:38.876 --> 00:06:40.468
that was helping to bring order.

00:06:40.468 --> 00:06:43.338
So, by October of 1922,

00:06:43.338 --> 00:06:45.713
(writing) by October of 1922,

00:06:45.713 --> 00:06:47.325
you have Mussolini at this head,

00:06:47.325 --> 00:06:49.887
he has this conference of 40,000 fascists

00:06:49.887 --> 00:06:54.071
and they essentially come
to the idea that they

00:06:54.071 --> 00:06:57.938
need to march on Rome,
to bring order to Italy,

00:06:57.938 --> 00:07:00.068
that they should demand,
they should demand

00:07:00.068 --> 00:07:03.095
a stronger government.

00:07:03.095 --> 00:07:06.800
(writing) So, in October
you have a march on Rome

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.550
and I've seen several accounts of the size

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.143
of this march on Rome, but the numbers

00:07:12.143 --> 00:07:15.405
that I've seen is on the order of 200,000.

00:07:15.405 --> 00:07:19.386
(writing) 200,000 fascists march on Rome.

00:07:19.386 --> 00:07:22.801
This essentially causes
the current government

00:07:22.801 --> 00:07:26.551
to be ... the Prime Minister to be ousted

00:07:26.551 --> 00:07:31.682
and the King appoints
Mussolini as Prime Minister.

00:07:31.682 --> 00:07:36.669
(writing)So, Mussolini, Mussolini is now

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:38.335
the Prime Minister.

00:07:38.335 --> 00:07:42.176
So this is a super rapid ascend,

00:07:42.176 --> 00:07:44.270
really based on peoples'
unhappiness with the

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.732
left-leaning government, peoples' desire

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:49.982
for a strong leader, Mussolini's kind of

00:07:49.982 --> 00:07:50.862
charisma.

00:07:50.862 --> 00:07:53.544
Every picture you see of him he has these

00:07:53.544 --> 00:07:57.388
really stern looks, he has
this impression of a really

00:07:57.388 --> 00:07:58.518
strong figure.

00:07:58.518 --> 00:08:00.581
Not only did he become Prime Minister,

00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:02.669
but he's able to get dictatorial powers.

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:05.143
The legislator actually
gives him dictatorial powers

00:08:05.143 --> 00:08:07.239
for a year.

00:08:07.239 --> 00:08:13.785
(writing) Dictata-, dictatorial powers

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:16.025
for one year, so you can't, at this point

00:08:16.025 --> 00:08:17.479
call him the dictator.

00:08:17.479 --> 00:08:20.195
We'll see that that's going
to come in a few years,

00:08:20.195 --> 00:08:22.523
but he's granted,
essentially, absolute control.

00:08:22.523 --> 00:08:26.696
He can pass laws at will
and it's an interesting

00:08:26.696 --> 00:08:28.385
question of history of why at this point

00:08:28.385 --> 00:08:32.479
the legislator was willing
to give him dictatorial

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:35.932
powers and why the King was fine with this

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:40.117
fairly strong character
being Prime Minister

00:08:40.117 --> 00:08:44.268
with dictatorial powers.

00:08:44.268 --> 00:08:46.547
My understanding is,
and I'm curious to see

00:08:46.547 --> 00:08:48.325
what you guys say in the message boards,

00:08:48.325 --> 00:08:49.736
is that it really was around ...

00:08:49.736 --> 00:08:52.745
people were desire ... on
one level there was a desire

00:08:52.745 --> 00:08:54.142
especially amongst the middle class

00:08:54.142 --> 00:08:56.656
and the elite, of having
this strong leader,

00:08:56.656 --> 00:08:58.484
of maybe someone who could bring order

00:08:58.484 --> 00:08:59.889
and pride to the country.

00:08:59.889 --> 00:09:02.465
Then on top of that he
was backed up by these,

00:09:02.465 --> 00:09:05.135
he was backed up by the Black Shirts,

00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:07.499
this paramilitary group that was dispersed

00:09:07.499 --> 00:09:11.248
throughout Italy that could
intimidate his opponents.

00:09:11.248 --> 00:09:13.409
You could imagine some
legislators were actually

00:09:13.409 --> 00:09:16.530
keen to support a strong
leader after many years

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.731
of weak leadership, but on top of that

00:09:18.731 --> 00:09:21.986
they probably felt intimidated into giving

00:09:21.986 --> 00:09:25.892
Mussolini these absolute powers.
