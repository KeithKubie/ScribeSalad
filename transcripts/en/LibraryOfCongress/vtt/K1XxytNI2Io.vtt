00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.670
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.960
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Good morning

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.260
&gt;&gt; Good morning

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Good morning, C.W
Ferris [phonetic] elementary school,

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.810
from Washington D.C, right?

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.110
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.290
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Have any
of you've been here before?

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.380
Wow, great.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:49.970
Welcome back, you're at the Young
Readers Center of the Library

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:59.380
of Congress and we're
very glad to have you.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:11.670
And our partner today, this
program is Everybody Wins, D.C.,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:20.400
and they have brought a
very special guest for you.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.040
And a special guess that's in, so,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.090
this is actually a couple,
this is really neat.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:39.350
What the Young Readers Center
does with Everybody wins DC,

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:53.320
is bring a guest who either talks
about a career or a vocation,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.080
or a special hobby
which is an avocation.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.700
And today we have Doctor Jim
Salander, who's career is a surgeon

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.630
but his hobby, his
avocation is bee keeping.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.650
How many people have
met a beekeeper before?

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:21.290
OK, well by the end of this morning
you're all going to meet one.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.840
So, I'm going to turn
the program over to Jim,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.580
he's going to talk a little
bit, show you a lot of things,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:42.320 position:56%
he'll do a little reading because we
always tie our programs into a book,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.100
which you'll get to
take home with you.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.400
So, here you go, Jim.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.700
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Thank
you, thanks very much.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.140
Come in a little closer because
I got stuff that's going to be --

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.130
I'm going to be passing around

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.620
and it will be easier
if everybody's up close.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.510
There you go, that's terrific.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.810
What's a hobby?

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.110
Who knows what a hobby is?

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.200
&gt;&gt; A hobby is something that
you want to do all the time.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.880
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Something
you want to do all the time,

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.330
you get to do it all the time?

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.900
No, so when do you do it?

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.000
Do you have a hobby?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.300
What's your hobby?

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.780
&gt;&gt; My hobby's playing outside.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.080
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Playing outside?

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.380
OK, that's good.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.760
Do you have a hobby?

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.060
What's your hobby?

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.750
&gt;&gt; I like to read.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.050
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Reading, OK.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.100
One more, one more
hobby, what's your hobby?

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.400
&gt;&gt; Draw pictures.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.260
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Drawing
pictures, OK.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.570
Good and you guys do those when?

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.970
You do those during the day?

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.270
&gt;&gt; After school.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.570
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: After school, yes.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.580
And adults have hobbies too,
moms and dads and grandparents

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.520
and so forth, and I have a hobby
also, and you've already been told

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.990
that during the day I'm a doctor,
I do stuff doctoring, I do surgery,

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.150
but on the weekends,
I have a hobby too

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.740
and my hobby is keeping honeybees.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.400
So that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.450
How many have ever seen
a honeybee up close?

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.510
Up close. You have, OK good,
good, we'll we're going to get

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.020
to meet some of my bees here in
a few minutes [Surprise gasp]

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.180
In just a minute, just
a minute, you don't have

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.110
to worry, don't have to worry.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.860
What are you worried about?

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.380
When I say honeybees, what
are you worried about?

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.980
&gt;&gt; They might sting you?

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.920
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: They might sting
you, they might, they might.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:40.590
But you know, there's a lot of
things out there, whether it's cars

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.110
or whether it's a knife and
fork at the dinner table,

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.260
but if you know how
to use those things

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.520
and you understand those
things, then you don't have

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.410
to worry about getting hurt.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.820
Nobody's going to get hurt
with my bees today, OK?

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.370
You can get some good stuff from
bees, what do we get from bees?

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.670
&gt;&gt; Honey.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.050
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Honey,
sure we get honey.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.940
OK so, let's talk about
the bees and what they do

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.360 position:56%
and what I do, and it will be - yes?

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.400
&gt;&gt; Are we going to be
able to taste some honey?

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.860
&gt;&gt; Taste some honey?

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.890
Well, if we're real nice to the
bees and you're not afraid of them.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.190
&gt;&gt; Yay.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.670
&gt;&gt; Sure, I've got some honey for
you to taste and I have some honey

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.940
for you to take home, OK?

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.470
[Applause] So, now, where do
the bees - how does this start?

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.320
Let's talk, where do the
bees get this honey from?

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.440
Where do they get it from?

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.740
Yes.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.040
&gt;&gt; They get it from flowers.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.340
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: From flowers, OK.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.990
When they go out to the flower,
when they go out to the flower,

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.470
do they get honey or do
they get something else

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.680
and then make the honey?

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.500
OK, they get something
else, what do they get?

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.840
Just a sec, just a
sec, what you say?

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:12.820
Well the go out and the get pollen,
we'll talk about that separate,

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:19.830
but what do they use
to make the honey with,

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.120
what do they use to
make the honey with?

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.420
&gt;&gt; Nectar.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.720
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Nectar?

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.020
Everybody hear that word?

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.580
Nectar. Because that's what
they get from the flower, OK so,

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:41.140
they go out to the flower and
they collect that nectar and then,

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.890
let's see, how do they
bring that back?

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.840
If I sent you to the store -- the
nectar is like a liquid, right?

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:56.880
It's like milk, or it's
about that or is like water,

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.710
but how to they carry that?

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.380
They come out with a
little jug or something,

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.940
or does it come all
packaged like milk does?

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.240
&gt;&gt; No.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.540
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: No?

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.840
How does it get there?

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.140
&gt;&gt; By their mouth.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.440
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: By their mouth?

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.740
So, they just fill
up their mouth hole?

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.040
&gt;&gt; No.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.340
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: No?

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.640
Then how to they do that?

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.940
How do the bees -- yes?

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.620
&gt;&gt; They swallow it and then
they go all the way to the --

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.700
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: What?

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.000
They swallow it?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.300
But how do they get it?

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.360
How do they get it in?

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.560
I have a picture of
some bees here --

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.810 position:56%
well did we decide how they do that?

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.110
&gt;&gt; Through their nose.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Through their nose?

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.710
Like an elephant?

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.010
&gt;&gt; No, the antennas.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.200
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: No,
the antennas are --

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.700
we're going to talk about those in
a little bit, those are up here.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.020
&gt;&gt; Their tongues

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:01.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Their tongues, they
have a long tongue, a longue tongue;

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.350
I'll show you a picture of it.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:08.080
Here's the tongues -- I only
have this to pass around, sure,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.860
but here's some bees, they're in a
hive and they got their tongues out

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:18.650
and they're doing stuff with the
honey here so, I'm just going

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:23.140
to show you what their
tongues look like.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: OK, see the tongue?

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.520
A thick long like,
you guys got tongues?

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.820
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.200
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Let's see
your tongues, the tongues.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:40.100
Now, imagine, imagine you went
to the store with someone --

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.400
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Yes, I'm sorry.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.550
Imagine if you went to the store
to pick up a quarter of milk.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:50.540
You go there with your mother,
your grandmother, your brother,

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.660
your sister o you go
yourself, and you need to pick

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.000
up that quarter milk, so,
you're going to do what?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.140
You're going to go to the
store; you're going to pick

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.690
up a quarter milk, right?

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.630
Pick it up with your
hands and carry it home.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.330
But the bees aren't going to do
that, they're going to pick it

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.220
up with their tongue,
and they're going to go,

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.550
just like these guys here.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:16.690
That's a pretty tough trick, and
then they're going to swallow it

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.990
and then bring it back to the hive.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.640
Well, how to they get it up?

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.750
The bees do something
that, if you did it,

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:30.440
it would be because you were
sick, but the bees swallow it,

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.880
and they put it in a special
stomach and then when they get back

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.180
to the hive, they bring it up.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.610
OK? Wait a minute, just a minute,
how many of you guys drink milk?

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:36.910
How many of you drink milk?

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.210
Well, the cows eat grass and
stuff and the milk comes out,

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.510
you drink the milk [Grossed out
expression] How many eat eggs?

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.810
So, we get a lot of different
stuff from animals, and the animals

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.110
or the insects kind of do
things differently than you

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:43.410
and I would do if we
were making food.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.710
Now, what else do they get
at the hive that they may --

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.010
at the flower to bring back home?

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.310
Somebody else talked
about it a minute ago.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.610
&gt;&gt; Pollen?

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:49.910
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Pollen?

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.210
What's pollen?

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.510
What's the pollen, who
hasn't answered something?

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Pollen is something in, like they
got that stuff that I get of honey,

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.110
there was, you know, honey things.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.410
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: It's not little
honey things, it's different

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:57.710
than the nectar, is
different, what is it?

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Pollen is, when they get close to
a flower, pollen it's on the flower

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.310
and it makes you sneeze
and helps the flowers grow.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.610
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Right,
that's what the --

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.910
the flower has the
nectar inside the flower

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.210
and then it also has this
pollen, but what is pollen?

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.510
If I gave it to you,
what would it look like?

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:06.810
What would it look like?

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.110
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: What
does pollen look like?

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.410
Is it liquid, like the nectar?

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:10.710
&gt;&gt; No.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.960
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Is it like
a cube of sugar, a big chunk?

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.420
&gt;&gt; No.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:15.720
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: What's
it look like?

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.880
&gt;&gt; It looks like a small crumb?

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.410
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Like a small what?

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:24.710
&gt;&gt; Crumb.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.010
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Yes,
it's like small crumb,

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.310
it's like salt or pepper.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.730
It's little, little,
little bits and pieces, OK?

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:35.660
And the bees do two
things with the pollen, OK?

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.650
One thing is they pack up some of
that pollen and they take it back

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.550
to the hive, and I'm going
to show you that in a minute.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.640 position:56%
I'm going to show you what that
looks like when the bees get it back

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:50.590
to the -- back home, but
what else do they do with it?

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.500
What else happens when
they go to the flower?

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.620
And this is a real important part,

00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:00.270
because this is what the
flower gets out of the deal.

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:03.420 position:56%
I mean, what's the flower doing, why
is the flowers giving them nectar?

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:11.250
&gt;&gt; When they get the nectar,
the seeds from the flower fall

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.740
and they make other flowers.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.820
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Well the
seeds, not seeds but the pollen,

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.120
we're talking about the pollen.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.560
When they go to get the nectar,
they come over here to the flower

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.870
and they're drinking it up, OK?

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.530
We will hear [slurping sound],
and what happens is they get

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.890
that pollen all over
themselves, it's like if you were

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:35.270
at the table eating and you
had a -- you got kind of messy,

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.800
you get the food all over yourself,
or you might get something else all

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.050
over yourself, and what they
do is they go to one flower

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.250
and then they go to another
flower, and that pollen that gets

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.990
on them gets spread
to another flower.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.140
And that's very important
for the flower part of this,

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.420
and that's what the flower
gets out of this deal,

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.830
that's a very important job that
the bee has, to spread that pollen

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:06.450
around so that the flowers --
so the flowers can do what?

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:07.750
&gt;&gt; Grow.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.250
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Grow, and what
happens when the flowers grow

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.920
after the bees have been there?

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.810
What do we get from those
flowers, just pretty flowers?

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.110
&gt;&gt; No, honey.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.410
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: What happens?

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:22.430
What becomes of that flower?

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.940
&gt;&gt; They bloom

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:30.270
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: They bloom,
OK and then what happens,

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.110
what happens to that flower?

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:33.410
This is important.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:34.710
&gt;&gt; It grows.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: It grows into what?

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.440
&gt;&gt; A bigger, a bigger flower.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.240
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: A
bigger flower, yes.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.560
What else happens?

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.210
&gt;&gt; A tree.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:47.540
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: A tree, and
what do we get from the trees?

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.070
&gt;&gt; Apples.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.370
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Everybody
hear that?

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:56.240
Stand up. What do we get from that
tree that the bee gives the pollen

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.630
to the flowers, and the flower gets
bigger, and the tree gets bigger,

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.530
and then what do we
get from the flower?

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.850
&gt;&gt; Apples.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.960
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Everybody
hear that?

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.300
Apples and pears, and
all kinds of other --

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:16.300
pumpkins [crosstalk]
pumpkins don't grow on trees,

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.530
you're absolutely right,
you can sit down, thank you.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:24.120 position:56%
But there's a whole lot of food that
you guys eat, and that you guys see

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.230
on the table that the
bees are part of that,

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.610
that's what the bees are doing.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:33.520
But we're here to talk, not so
much about the apples or the pears

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:39.030
or the pumpkins, or the
squash, or the almonds.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.580
Almonds, how many eat nuts?

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.320
How many like nuts?

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.920
Almonds, walnuts, big
deal with the bees.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.470
But let's talk about the honey.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.910
The bees have gone out there;
let's see this might be a good time

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.050
to meet some of the bees.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.350
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.650
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: You
want to do that?

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:00.950
Let's -- OK, now let
me just grab you,

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:05.970
before everybody gets all concerned
here, these are not living,

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.960 position:56%
they are not living, they have spent
the last few weeks in the freezer

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.590
of my house, they're going
to stay in the plastic bag,

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.260
you will not get stung, OK?

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.390
Now, we're going to pass them out
and I want you to look at them,

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:23.010
we're going to take a couple of
minutes to look at them real close,

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:29.880
and I want to see -- please,
they're in a plastic bag.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.460
But I want you to look at
different parts of them,

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:37.170
some of you may have two bees in
there, I want you to see the wings,

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:41.430
I want you to see the antenna.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:47.500
They're all going to get passed
out -- let me get some more.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.830
Here, there's enough for everybody,
there's enough for everybody.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:15:02.290 position:56%
[Crosstalk] If you don't want it you
don't have to but I can promise you,

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:13.660
nobody is going to get
hurt with these bees today.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.780
&gt;&gt; You want to know
what I know about bees?

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.940
They taste with their feet.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.890
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: They
taste with their --

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:27.910
we can talk about that
-- with their antenna?

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:36.250
Has everybody got at least one?

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:38.390
What I want to show you --

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.650
[crosstalk] OK, can
you see, can you see?

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.940
First, I want you to see --
first of all, how small they are,

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.870
these are just little
things, the little guys, OK?

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:51.450
They're little tiny things and
now I want you to see their wings

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:57.650
that they use to fly around with
and to bring back the nectar

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:00.000
and to bring back the pollen.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.310
Now, some of you will be
able to see on the head,

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.380
those two little things of the top?

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.680
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.980
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: What
are those called?

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.280
&gt;&gt; Antennas.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.680
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: The antennas
and those are very important

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.790
because that's what -- just like
you, if you were in a dark room,

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:19.190
and I handed you something, how
would you know what I gave you?

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.770
Your hands, right?

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.800
And that's basically what the
bees do with their antenna,

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.500
is they use their hands,
not to pick up,

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:32.230
but they use their
antenna to feel things.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:35.630
Some of you will also see
in your bees, if you look --

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.570
you can see the head and
you can see the eyes,

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.050 position:56%
now here's the important part, guys.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:47.790 position:56%
I want you to look at the other end
of the bee, the other end of the bee

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.660
up close; some of you may
see the bee's stinger.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.960
&gt;&gt; I see it

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.260
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: You may see

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.200
that little pointed thing
at the end of its butt.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.150
&gt;&gt; Ugh.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.750
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: That's
what he's got,

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.590
it's not a tail there,
it's his stinger.

00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:07.240
Can you see him?

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.510
You don't see, you may
not have a stinger,

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.170
you may not see the stinger.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:14.470
What do you got?

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.850
A couple of guys in
there, a couple of gals.

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:21.150
Sure, you do, see that little
pointy thing right there?

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:26.280
[Crosstalk].

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.760
What did you ask?

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.660
&gt;&gt; Are these girls?

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.270
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: These are
girls, they're all girls.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.710
Yes, you see?

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:35.620
The stinger's right there.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.940
Kids, these are all girl bees.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.470
[Shouting] These are all girl bees.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:50.790
&gt;&gt; How can you tell them apart?

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.200
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Well,
more importantly,

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.670
the bees can tell them apart.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:04.100
But I know that these are girls,
I'll tell you that in a minute,

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.920
I'll explain to everybody.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:11.110
OK everybody, you got
to know your bees,

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:18.490
let's take them back up,
we'll take them back up.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:25.590
&gt;&gt; Well, you got a dandy
here, this is great --

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.560
did everybody see the wings?

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:38.180
Everybody see the antlers,
or the antennas?

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.480
The antlers.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.780
[Crosstalk].

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:49.100
Now, somebody asked me --
I'm sorry, what's your name?

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.400
&gt;&gt; Jolane [phonetic].

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.700
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Joy?

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.440
&gt;&gt; Jolane.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.740
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Jolane.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:19:00.410
You asked me, who asked me if
I knew they we're girl bees?

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:05.990
There are three kinds of bees
in a hive, three kinds of bees.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:07.290
What kind of bees are there?

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:08.590
Queen bee.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:09.890
&gt;&gt; Boy bees.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.520
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Boy
bees that they're called?

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.160
Drones and then there's the lady
bees which are the worker bees

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.100
that you have, and
here's some other bees,

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.760
just to show you these are
all kind of old and dried up,

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.150
but what I want you to see here --

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:30.630
what I want you to see
is the different size,

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.580
this top bees here are queen
bees, they're all kind of dried

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.650
up so you can't see very much of --

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:41.700
but these are the size of the
boy bees, they're the drones

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.430
and the girl bees are on the
bottom, they're smaller, OK?

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:55.680
OK, everybody see these back here?

00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.440 position:56%
These are the boy bees and these are
the girl bees, this one's broken,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.040
these are the boy bees,
these are the queen bees.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.870
&gt;&gt; Do these have pins in them?

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.570
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Yes, they're pins.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.240
Yes, coming over there.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.510
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me,

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.410
here are the boy bees,
they're the bigger bees.

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:19.500
And these are the girl
bees, this one's broken.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.460
And this is the queen bee.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.030
&gt;&gt; And what's that?

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Excellent question.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.840
&gt;&gt; Who's that one?

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:31.690
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: OK, now
when I pass these kids --

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:34.940
up, just a sec, just a sec.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:39.040
Somebody asked me over
here about why these bees

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.040
on the top the queen bees, had
a little piece of paint on them,

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.430
they have a little
green dot on them.

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:49.700
And the reason for that
is that in the hive --

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.720
a hive is where they live,
that's their home right?

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:58.770
In the hive, there are all these
bees, there's thousands of bees,

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:04.430
thousands of bees in there, and
if I want to go and see the queen,

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:08.190
to be sure that she's healthy,
or if I want to do something

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:12.060
with the queen, it's very, very
difficult to find them because,

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.790
as you can see there's
not much difference.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:19.340
And so, then you can mark
them with a little tiny dot

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.030
from a magic marker,
a little bit of paint,

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:26.050
and that's what this little one
right there is -- OK, I'm sorry.

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:29.410
Those are the queen bees up here.

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:35.140
OK, so the bees collect up the
nectar, they collect up the pollen,

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.900
how do they bring the
pollen back to the hive?

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.790
How do they bring it
back to the hive?

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:41.150
They swallow the nectar --

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And they put it in a special
stomach, and then when they get back

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.870
to the hive they bring it back.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.570
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: That's the
nectar, how about the pollen?

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:56.520
That stuff that's like
pep - they what?

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.950
[crosstalk]Well, no, their body is
for sharing with the other flowers,

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:03.460
they carry it in like a
little saddle, like a pocket,

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.490
just like if you had
something you wanted to carry,

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:09.970
they have little pockets on
their sides and a carrier, OK?

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.860
Like little saddle
bags on a bicycle.

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.690
OK, so they come back
to the hive, right?

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:21.510
And these -- I got hives here,
there are no living bees in here,

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:24.690
there are no live bees,
but this is the hive,

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:29.860
and what the hive is,
is a stack of boxes, OK?

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.860
And there's a top,
and there's a bottom.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:39.700
Now, when you go home at night,
you just kind of throw your stuff

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:44.570
in the house, or you
have - are there closets?

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.390
And where do you keep books,
where do you keep books?

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:48.690
&gt;&gt; On the shelves

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:52.550
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: On shelves, and
where do you keep your clothes?

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.570
&gt;&gt; In my closet

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:56.950
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: OK, you
got a place to put that.

00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:01.290
Well, when the hive's -- when the
bees come back to their house,

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:05.200
they have to have places
to put their stuff, right?

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:15.240
And so, my job is to give them
the box and inside the box I got -

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.830
the shelves, I give
them piece of wood, OK?

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:22.530
&gt;&gt; What's the wood for?

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.430
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Them I give
them a piece of plastic,

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:29.710
and I put the two together,
I put the two together,

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:32.010
and this is what it looks like.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.310
&gt;&gt; That's a honeycomb.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.440
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: It' still not
honeycomb, because now if they put

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.490
in on there, it would
kind of smush off, right?

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:40.670
That wouldn't work very well.

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:47.340
It'd be like having a dresser
and no drawers in it, or a drawer

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.510
and no bottom on the
-- you put it on

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.190 position:56%
and the clothes falls on the bottom.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:56.500
So, look what the bees
do, look what the bees do.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:04.050
The bees have the wax, where
do the bees get the wax from?

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:10.130
[crosstalk] Kids, let's have
a hand, let's have a hand,

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:13.240
where do the bees get the wax from?

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.760
Just a sec.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.790
&gt;&gt; The flowers?

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.850
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: No, they
don't get it from the flowers;

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:22.260
they don't get it from the flowers.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.630
Who has not answered?

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:24.930
Yes?

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.230
&gt;&gt; Pollen?

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:27.690
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: No, they don't
get it from the pollen either,

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:34.430
where do they get the wax from,
where do they get the wax?

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:35.740
&gt;&gt; The nectar?

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.320
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: No, no.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:42.790
Let me tell you where
the wax comes from,

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:47.250
because they get a lot
of it, look at this.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:53.930
There's wax, there's more wax,
there's all these spaces and look

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.870
at this, and this is
- what is the matter?

00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:03.040
This is the pollen,
this is the pollen.

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:07.190
Look, there's a bee.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.780
Kids, kids, kids, kids, kids.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.370
So, what do they put in the spaces?

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.080
In here, they put honey,
what else goes in there?

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.380
&gt;&gt; Wax?

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.050
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: I'm sorry?

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:23.350
&gt;&gt; Wax?

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:24.650
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: No.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:25.950
&gt;&gt; Pollen?

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:27.250
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: What else
do they put in their closet?

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:35.450
I showed you here, I showed you
that they put in the pollen,

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:42.330
what else do they have in
there, besides pollen and honey?

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:50.640 position:56%
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a
minute kids, we got all these bees,

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.610
where do the bees come from?

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:59.720
Oh. And where do they -- what?

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.520
Where do they come from?

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.230
&gt;&gt; The queen.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:09.390
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: They come from the
queen and the queen lays an egg,

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:15.690
well, where do they put the egg?

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.890
[crosstalk] Wait a minute, wait
a minute, kids, one at a time.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:23.930 position:56%
Where do they put -- the queen's got
all these thousands of bees there,

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:27.060
we can't just dump them in a
drawer and let them all fall

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:31.730
into the bottom, where does
the queen put the eggs,

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.700
so the eggs will go up and be bees?

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.880
Now, think about that.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.080
&gt;&gt; They have them in the
honey, in the honeycomb.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:45.110
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Well, yes but
they don't mix them in together,

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:51.030
they don't mix them in together,
but what she does is they have a --

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.860
they put them in the
same kind of arrangement,

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.630
now this is a little
discolored, this is darker,

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:03.470
because it's been used many
times as a nursery, for the bees.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:10.800
Here's a nursery that hasn't
been used very much, OK?

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.700 position:56%
This has been used a lot and that's
why it's dark and she goes in there,

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.470
and the puts in an egg
in each one of these

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:22.280
and then the worker bees come
along, give it a bit drop of honey,

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.080
and somebody else gives them
a little drop of the pollen,

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.370
and then they close it over.

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:32.740
And then the egg becomes a bee, and
then the bee climbs out and goes

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.830
to work with everybody else.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.600 position:56%
But let's look at this for a second;
oh, I didn't answer the question

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.220
where the wax comes from.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.110
Where does the wax come from?

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.720
One more person gets the try.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.560
&gt;&gt; The wax comes from the honey.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.470
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: No, the wax
doesn't come from the honey,

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:53.300
when you go out in the
yard, when you go outside

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.560
and play real hard, do you sweat?

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.860
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.310
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: So, little
drops of water come off, right?

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:10.130
Listen to this one guys,
the bees sweat wax.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.730
Now, they don't do it all them,
they don't work and run around

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:15.930
and it just comes dripping off
of them but if they need wax,

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:24.530
if they need wax to fill this
up, some of them begin --

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:30.110
the wax coming off them and they
take and mold it, into this,

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:34.320
and they mold it into this,
and that's where it comes from

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:41.780
and that's also where
they put the honey.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:55.080
That's honey, that's the honey.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.380
It's gross?

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.380
&gt;&gt; It's not gross, it's awkward.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.680
&gt;&gt; You say it's gross?

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.980
Too close?

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:04.620 position:56%
You guys are going to get real
close to the honey, is anybody going

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:05.920
to eat the honey I give you?

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.220
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.240
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: How
much closer can you get?

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:18.050
Here we go, there's -- now look
at this, it doesn't come off.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:23.020
Because, because the bees have
put little tops on their jars,

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:28.880
a little top's on here and this is
capped honey, they've capped it,

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.220
so that it can store there,

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:36.160
and why do the bees have all
this honey in the hive anyway?

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.680
Why do they make honey?

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:43.340
&gt;&gt; So they can drink
some food an eat food?

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.330
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: That's
right, so they can eat it,

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:48.860
because in the winter
now, there's no flowers --

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.780
well, there's a few flowers
out now but in January,

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:55.800
when they get hungry, they
can't go to the store,

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.210
they can't go to the grocery store,
they can't go to "Whole Foods"

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:01.510
or the Stayflay [phonetic].

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.090 position:56%
They can't go to the vending machine
and put some money in and get

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:09.330
out a candy bar, they eat the
honey so they have to make --

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:14.260
and my job is to trick them
into making more honey.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:18.400
Well, let's go back to this one
for just a second, on the subject

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:23.350
of the nursery where the bees
were, you see the color, it's dark,

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:27.050
it's much darker than
the other one, right?

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:33.360
OK, and here's a funny hole in it
for some reason, I'm not sure why.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:39.180
What else do you see here, what
do you see here that's different,

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.620 position:56%
tell me, somebody tell me something.

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.870
What do you see here
that's different?

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:49.700
&gt;&gt; It's darker and they got --

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:54.030
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Well, first of
all it's a little irregular, right?

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:58.660
This one was nice and
smooth, see this is smooth

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:00.690
and this is kind of bumpy.

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:04.590
Besides being bumpy, does
anybody see anything different?

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:09.230
What's different here?

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:11.410 position:56%
Big holes, you mean these guys here?

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:15.500
Yes, they're big holes, OK.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.180
Everybody get your thinking cap on.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:23.330
Why are some of the holes
bigger than the other holes?

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:26.760
&gt;&gt; Because they put
too much wax in there.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.740
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Why
do the bees go ahead

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.470
and make some bigger than others?

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:32.790 position:56%
Who can answer that question for me?

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:35.020
Who can answer -- who has not
answered a question before?

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:38.110
&gt;&gt; I have answered a question?

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:44.470
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: You
have answered a question;

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.060
well can you answer this one?

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:52.190
Why are they bigger, who can tell
me why these holes are bigger?

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:53.490
Yes.

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:59.540
&gt;&gt; They're bigger because,
the holes are big

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:03.850
because probably some
bees need to come out.

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.550
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Well, the bees
can come out, the bees can come

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:09.770
out of the small ones too, but why
would the bees go to the trouble

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:13.880 position:56%
of making big holes and small holes?

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:20.980
&gt;&gt; The queen lays eggs
inside of the thing.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.220
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: OK,
yes, she put eggs in,

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.960
I'm going to give you a
hint, here comes the hint,

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:34.130
everybody ready for a hint?

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:42.170
[Crosstalk] Some of the eggs might
be bigger, the eggs aren't bigger,

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.160
but why do you need a bigger hole?

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.710
&gt;&gt; Because there might
be a lot of boy bees --

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:50.230
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: That's the answer,

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:53.740
because the boy bees
need a bigger space,

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.830
because they come out bigger bees.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.960
&gt;&gt; But there aren't that many.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.870
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: You're
right, there aren't that many,

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:03.600
there aren't that many, and
overall in the hive, they only make

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:08.470
up a very small percentage of
the eggs that the queen lays.

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:12.580
But she comes around; now listen
to this, you got to believe me,

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.440
you got to have faith in this.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:18.880
The queen comes around and she
comes to one of those little holes,

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:24.210
or big holes, and she
feels with her antenna, OK?

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:30.560
And she says, "Oh, this is a small
hole", and in there she lays an egg

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.390
that will become a
female, and if she comes

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:39.490
around to a hole that's
big, what happens?

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:43.650
She lays an egg that
going to become a boy.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:46.310
Now there's the trick for you.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:52.300
OK, then she does that and the
worker bees make the holes --

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.990
make the spaces, based on what
they think are going to need,

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:00.140
it's like if you were building
a house at home and you said,

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.920
"Well I need a dresser, I need a
closet, that's got this much space

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.270
in it, because I'm going to
have a lot of dresses and coats,

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:09.150
or maybe I'll only
make one this size

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:11.880
because my coats are
going to be smaller".

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:16.430
So, now we know about the wax,
we know about the baby bees,

00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:19.150
we know about the honey
[surprise gasp] They are not --

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:30.430
didn't I tell you at the beginning

00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:39.040
that nobody was going
to get stung or hurt?

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.340
&gt;&gt; They're frozen

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.660
&gt;&gt; You put them in a freezer?

00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:47.140
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: I went
to hive earlier this year

00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:53.320
and the whole hive had
died, the bees had died, OK?

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:58.670
And so, I took it back to the
house and I saved it, so that one,

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:02.320
that I could show it to you guys
and two, I'm going to give it

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.070
to some other bees in the spring,

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:08.960
but on one of these frames
[crosstalk] These are the bees

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:23.730
that clustered around here, OK, and
this is what they happen to be --

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:28.170
they died in place, and so I
brought these in to show it

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.680
to you, what the bees look like.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:33.890
Because the bees cluster in a group
in the winter, they don't hibernate

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:38.100
like bears and they don't
migrate like -- who migrates?

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.410
What animal migrates and
goes away for the winter

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:42.150
where it's warn, who does that?

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:43.450
&gt;&gt; A bear?

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:45.290
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: No,
the bears go to sleep.

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:49.220
They hibernate in a cave or some
dark place, but who goes away

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.200
for the winter where it's warm?

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.500
&gt;&gt; Birds?

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.800
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Birds,
that's called...

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.100
&gt;&gt; Hibernate.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.360
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: No, sleeping is
the hibernating, flying away is the

00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.990
&gt;&gt; Migrating.

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:01.290
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Migrating.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:04.780
Well, the bees don't do either,
the bees don't do either.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.860
If I turn the temperature
in this room down,

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.120
so that 'it was real cold,
until there was snowing in here,

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.040
that's how cold it was,
what would you guys do?

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.610
If you couldn't leave?

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:20.430
&gt;&gt; I would put my coat on.

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:22.720
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: You might
snuggle up with each other,

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.540
when you come out from
playing outside on a cold day;

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:29.750 position:56%
doesn't it feel good when somebody
gives you a hug, kind of feels warm?

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.480
And that's what the
bees do in the winter;

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.270
they snuggle up to keep warm.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:38.600
OK so, we got the bees, we got
the honey, and we got the hive.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:46.190 position:56%
Now, let me tell you what my job is,
how I get the honey out of the hive,

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.520
once I've tricked the bees

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:52.060
into making more honey
than they need, OK.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:56.400
A hive is a stack of boxes, yes?

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.180
How much honey do you
think the bees need

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.410
for the winter, in
one stack of boxes?

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:03.250
And I'll tell you that they
don't go next door to borrow any,

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:06.710
and they don't go to
the 7-Eleven to buy any.

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:09.890
So, we have a stack of
boxes that's a hive,

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:13.040
how much honey do you think
they need for the winter?

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.420
I need pounds, somebody tell
me the number of pounds.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.720
&gt;&gt; 300 pounds?

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:21.110
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: 300 pounds,
not that much, not that much.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:23.290
&gt;&gt; 100 -- 200 pounds.

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:25.400
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: No,
they only need 60 pounds.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.700
&gt;&gt; What?

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.360
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: But we're going to
taste some honey in a little while,

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.700
from this jars that
are a half a pound.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:40.780 position:56%
And as long as I have this out
here, these are three jars of honey,

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.800
three jars of honey,
now this jar is bigger,

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.830
but what else is different
about these three jars?

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:52.890
Look at them, and tell me what's
different about these three jars.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.890
&gt;&gt; One is light and one is --

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.090
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: This
looks real dark, right?

00:37:58.090 --> 00:37:59.600
How about these two?

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:04.290
This honey here was from
2004, that was 11 years ago -

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:05.970
was that before you guys were born?

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:07.270
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:10.190
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: So, this jar
of honey is older than you guys.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.980
But what's the difference
between these two jars

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.550
of honey besides the age?

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:16.450
Is the difference in color, right?

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:17.870
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:19.300
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Why
is a different color?

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.450
Why is this honey so, so dark?

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:24.720
&gt;&gt; Because it's older.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.130
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: No, this honey's
just a year old, it's not that old.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:32.170
But why are two jars of
honey different color?

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:33.470
Different color.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:37.390
&gt;&gt; Are those made by
different kinds of bees?

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:39.730
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Different
kinds of bees, no,

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:41.250
they all make the same stuff.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:42.550
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:43.850
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: They
all make the same stuff.

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:48.480
Yes. Different what?

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.330
Different kinds of honey, but how
does it get to be different kinds?

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:56.280
These are from the same
place, different years.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.160
Same place, different years.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:04.140
One more - oh, one more, one more.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.160
Excuse me, everybody be very quiet.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.960
What's the answer?

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:14.460
&gt;&gt; Do they get it from
different flowers?

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:17.960 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Different flowers,
different flowers, excellent answer.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:21.480
This year they went to
all these flowers here,

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:24.890
this year maybe it was raining
one day and they couldn't get

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:27.470
to these flowers over here, so they
went for those flowers over there,

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:31.120
and they came up with
different colors,

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.270
and it tastes a little different.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:37.120 position:56%
And what do you think happened here?

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.550
They were really different flowers
in that area where those bees were,

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.340
this was called buckwheat honey.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:44.640
&gt;&gt; Buckwheat honey?

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.660
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: And it's almost
like molasses, it's very dark,

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:51.160
but it's just honey, no
chemicals, no nothing.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:56.700
So, how do I get in and out of the
hive without getting you-know-what?

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.530
Stung, how does that happen?

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:01.070
I don't put them all in the
freezer the night before.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:04.930
&gt;&gt; You use a special suit?

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:07.490
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: A
special suit, come on up.

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:12.370
I need some people to try on
the equipment and to hold -

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:17.300
just a second, and to hold
some of the tools that I use,

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.910
but you got to be quiet so
you can hear the whole story.

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:22.660
Once you come on, you
come on up first,

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:28.820
and then we'll take a
family picture, there we go.

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.840
OK, all set, you can put
your arms out on there,

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.760
I need a couple more
people, where is it --

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:36.430
right here, right here come on up.

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:41.700
Over the top, there
you go, there we go.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:46.790
I got somebody else come on up.

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:49.180
Here we go, where's my other --

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:53.180
here we go, I'm sorry I stepped
on your toe, put that on,

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:57.040
just like a jacket, and
I got one more that's got

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:00.140
to come, who's going to -- ?

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.440
&gt;&gt; Me, me, me.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.740
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Right there,
you come on up, the flower girl.

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:06.010
Now, I got some other stuff that I
need help with, I need other stuff,

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:08.760
because I want to show
you some other tools.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.060
There you go.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.290 position:56%
I want to show you some other tools.

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:15.300
Now look at this item.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.120
&gt;&gt; What is the smoke thing?

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.100
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Just a second,
this keeps the bees off of my face

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:24.400
and off my clothing and off
my -- and then I have this,

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.340
I have this, what is this?

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:27.640
&gt;&gt; A filter?

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.940
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: It's a smoker.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.670
Now watch, I want to
show you something.

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:33.890
Uh, uh, what's your name?

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:35.190
&gt;&gt; Shelissa [phonetic].

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:38.190
&gt;&gt; What is it?

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:39.490
Shelly?

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:40.790
&gt;&gt; Shelissa.

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:42.090
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Shelissa,
so when I come

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:46.130
over to Shelissa, she
doesn't like it.

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:48.420
And he doesn't like it either.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:52.420
Now wait a minute, the
bees don't like it either.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:55.380
And so, if I come into the
hive and I give it a puff --

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:58.200
what I do is dug a little fire

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:04.190
in here [surprise gasp] I
dug a little fire in there,

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:08.580 position:56%
and out comes smoke, there's no fire
in there now, and the bees don't

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:10.850
like it either, they move away.

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:16.230
And so, that's what happens, I use
this smoker to blow a little smoke

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:21.070
on the bees, it doesn't hurt them,
it's not hot, it's not fire, OK?

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:23.060
So, I need somebody
to hold this for me.

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:24.360
&gt;&gt; Me.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.650
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: OK, I
have this, I have a brush -

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:32.500
come on up, the front of the brush.

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:38.470
I have special tools --
where's my other special,

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:40.250
oh here it is right there.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:43.250
Special tools for going in,
and look what this tool does.

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:45.150
&gt;&gt; Is it a scraper?

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.220
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: No,
this is not scrapers.

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:48.520
Watch this.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.340
If there are two of these that
are real close together, this --

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:55.320 position:56%
this tool, see this hook over there?

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.150
It goes there and it
allows me to pick that up.

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:01.850
So, I need some people
to hold these.

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:03.310
&gt;&gt; Me.

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:07.400
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: There
we go, just one second,

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.800
and when I bring all
those back to the hive --

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.270
let's have some other
people hold these.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:16.570
You can --

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.340
&gt;&gt; Am I holding this right?

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Will you hold that?

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:24.940
Who wants to hold the honey?

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:26.920
&gt;&gt; Me, me [crosstalk].

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.950
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Well,
here's something,

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:34.470
here's something that's very
interesting, look at this,

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:38.630
look at this, wait a minute,
you don't know what it is.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:43.010
What else do you think the bees
don't like besides the smoke?

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:45.470
&gt;&gt; Water.

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:46.770
&gt;&gt; Vitamins.

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:48.070
&gt;&gt; It's water.

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:49.370
&gt;&gt; Water.

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:50.670
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: It's just water.

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:52.050
&gt;&gt; Just like kids.

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:54.790
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Here
we got the bees;

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:57.110
somebody's got to hold the bees.

00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:59.760
OK, we need a group
picture, everybody else stand

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.340
up over this way here, so
we can have a group picture,

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:07.320
we got to have somebody
hold the honey.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.620
&gt;&gt; Me, me.

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:13.420
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Hold it, hold it.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:17.150
I need some holders for
these, no, no you got that on.

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:19.040
Here you go.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.190
Who else who's got
something to hold?

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:30.690
[Crosstalk] Who wants to hold
the one with the bees on it?

00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:34.940
OK, just hold it up over your head.

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.240
You got it?

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.210
Hold it up, you got it?

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:47.530
Everybody got something?

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:49.180
&gt;&gt; No.

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:51.820
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: You
want to hold this one?

00:44:51.820 --> 00:45:01.100
Hold it up, turn around, turn
around, hold it up, hold it up.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:10.870
OK, here we go, OK guys, then
there, turn towards the camera.

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:13.200
Well, you got to hold this.

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:22.440
Hold this over your head so
they can see that, here we go.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.460
OK guys; let's have
everything back, slowly,

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:33.610
slowly [crosstalk]There you go.

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:43.150
Did you get to stick
the finger in there?

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:47.780 position:56%
Quick, quick, quick, stick a finger.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:51.740 position:56%
You see this, you see these guys
here, see, these were the male bees,

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:53.300
the boy bees were down there.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:57.590
See that, and these are girl
-- the girl bees are up here.

00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:00.250
You see that, look at this.

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:10.970
This are the boy bees here,
these are the boy bees

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:33.210
down there[crosstalk] A couple more
questions, a couple more questions.

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:43.840
Now, what else -- we talk about
what the bees do with the wax.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:52.580
What can we -and we know
what they do with the honey,

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:56.880
what do we do with the wax?

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.010
What do we do with the wax,
what can you do with the wax?

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:02.310
&gt;&gt; Make candles?

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:03.610
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Make candles.

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:09.850
So, what I do, is I collect some
of this wax, and I melt it down,

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:18.080
and I strain it, and then I pour
into this, and out comes that,

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:23.460
a candle that you can light.

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.550
What's this thing in the
middle called, by the way?

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:28.720
What's this string here
in the middle called?

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.020
&gt;&gt; A tweet.

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:31.320
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: A tweet?

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.620
No.

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:33.920
&gt;&gt; A twig?

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.220
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: A what?

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:36.520
A twig? No.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.820
&gt;&gt; A thread?

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:39.120
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: I'm going

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.850
to give you a new word
then, it's a new word.

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:42.150
&gt;&gt; Match.

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:44.930
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: No, match
is what you light it with.

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:49.070
What's in the middle
is called a wick, wick.

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:50.370
&gt;&gt; I was close.

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:54.980
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: W-I-C-K,
that's a wick.

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:57.820
So, you can make candles from it,

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.320
because a long time ago
there weren't electricity.

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:04.140 position:56%
Well, now we got something else
that's very important to go through,

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:07.310
now that we're on the subject
of light and electricity.

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:10.430
So, we've got a stack,
and I'll do one more thing

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:11.730
and then we're going to read.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:15.110
We have a stack of boxes, OK?

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:17.470
Does anybody see any
windows here in this box?

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:18.770
&gt;&gt; No.

00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:20.690
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Does anybody
see any electric light bulbs

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:21.990
in this box?

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:23.290
&gt;&gt; No.

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:24.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Now, wait a minute.

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:28.090
So, we have a bunch of boxes,
maybe six or eight of them,

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:31.190
with no windows and
no electric lights.

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:34.220 position:56%
Oh-oh. There's a door at the bottom?

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.520
&gt;&gt; No.

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.940
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: There's a door
at the top, a little opening

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.240
for them to come in and out of.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:43.340
But once they come back
to the hive, how does --

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:46.200
if you went to the store,
you were on a walk one day,

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:49.610
and you found a place that
were giving away free candy,

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:51.730
and you wanted to come
back and tell your friends

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:54.190
about it, how would you do that?

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:55.660
You'd come back and --

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:56.960
&gt;&gt; Walk.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.770
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: You'd walk back
and you tell them about the candy?

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:01.390 position:56%
You'd say, "Hey, there's candy over
there, in fact I brought you a piece

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:04.290
of it, here's a piece
of it, let's all go,

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:07.850
it's just down the street", right?

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:09.510
But it's dark in there.

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:12.540
When you were looking at the bees,
did you see ears on those bees?

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:13.850
&gt;&gt; No.

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:16.470
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: No ears.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:22.920
No ears and their mouth
doesn't talk, how are they going

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:26.670
to tell the other bees
where the flowers are?

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:33.490
Antennas? Not too much,
not too much.

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:37.070
Well, I'm going to tell you exactly
what the secret of the bees is,

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:39.660
how they talk to each
other in this circumstance.

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.210
They -- they dance.

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:46.020
Everybody on your feet,
everybody on your feet.

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:48.040
I'm going to teach
you the bee dance.

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:53.860
OK, but you got to
listen; you got to listen.

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:59.680
First of all, what they
do is they go in a circle,

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:03.850 position:56%
they dance in a circle and depending
upon - it's like a little figure

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:05.150
of eight, and that's how it
tells them the direction.

00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:06.450
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: OK, stop.

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:12.720
Now we got direction to how
to get to the candy store,

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:17.640
but we don't know how
far the candy store is,

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:21.470
so what do you think they do?

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:24.760
They jiggle their behinds.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:30.520
That's how they do it, so everybody
give their behinds a jiggle,

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:34.000
everybody give your
behinds a jiggle.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.300
OK, stop, stop, stop.

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.380
Now I want you to do them both of
them together, I want you to walk

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:42.630
in a little bit of a circle, and
I want you jiggle your bottom,

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:45.580
OK, very good, very good.

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:51.540
Now that was the easy
part, but if you were a bee

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:56.090 position:56%
and it depended upon -- because what
you're doing is you're getting honey

00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:57.960
for everybody else.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.520
It's not just for you that
you're getting the honey;

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:04.520
they got to cooperate with all the
other bees to go out and get all

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:07.910
that nectar, and bring it back so
that those bees can have something

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:10.980
to eat, and the bees this winter
can have something to eat,

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:12.690
so they got to cooperate.

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:17.940
So, it's very important for
this last step in the bee dance,

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.830
and it's the hardest step.

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:27.280
Close your eyes, because it's
dark in there, it's dark, so,

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:30.710
I want everybody to
close their eyes,

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:34.380
walk in a circle and
wiggle your behind.

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:43.410
And that's the bee dance,
that's the bee dance.

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:45.250
OK guys that's it.

00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:46.660
So, listen, what you
have to understand,

00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.850
everybody had a good
time, jiggling --

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:52.790
for the bees, it's
a serious business.

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:58.160
Everybody have a seat,
everybody have a seat.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:04.460
What I want to do is, how many
know this book "Winnie the Pooh"?

00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:08.260
Now, when you leave here today,

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:13.980
when you leave here today
everybody will have a book about

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.260
"Winnie the Pooh", and
I'm going to read you --

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:20.340
Pooh is a bear, if you don't
know the book, Pooh is this bear

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:24.650
in the middle, he's Pooh Bear,
and Winnie is his friend,

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:27.780
and I want to read
a little bit to you

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:31.410
about Pooh Bear who
lives in the woods.

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:33.670 position:56%
"One day when he was out walking" --

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:38.460
that's Pooh, here's his picture
there, "he came to an open space

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:41.140
in the middle of a
forest, and in the middle

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:46.350
of the place there was a large oak
tree and from the top of the tree,

00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:51.220
way at the top of the tree,
there came a loud buzzing noise."

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:53.250
Can everybody make a buzzing noise?

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:55.860
Excellent.

00:52:55.860 --> 00:53:01.930
"Winnie the Pooh sat down on the
foot of the tree and put his head

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:04.760
between his paws and
began to think".

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.960
OK, everybody put their
head between their paws,

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:12.090
and think, OK come back again.

00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:13.830
Here he is right here.

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:16.090
"First of all", he said to
himself the buzzing noise

00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:19.580
like that means something.

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.130
Everything means something, right?

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:24.680
You don't get a buzzing noise
like that just buzzing buzzing

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.510
without it meaning something.

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:31.180 position:56%
If there's a buzzing noise,
somebody's making the buzzing noise,

00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:34.450
and the only reason for
making a buzzing noise

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:37.120
that I know of, is
because you are a --

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:41.090
&gt;&gt; Bee.

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:42.390
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: So, here he is,

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:45.850
he is looking up and
he sees these bees.

00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:47.770
And then he thought
another long time".

00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:50.810
What do you think he's
thinking about?

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:52.770
Yes, he's thinking about honey.

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:56.000
"And he said, 'and the
only reason for being a bee

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.020
that I know of is making honey'.

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:02.940
And then he got up, 'and the
only reason for making honey is

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:05.960
so that I can eat it',
this is Pooh speaking.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:10.230
"So, he began to climb the tree",
and here he is climbing this tree,

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:13.400
see he's all the way up here, and
look what they did with the words,

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:14.700
they put the words up on the side

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:16.850
like they were climbing,
the words here.

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:18.280
Is that fun?

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:23.390
"He climbed, and he
climbed, and he climbed,

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:28.360
and as he climbed he sang
a little song, to himself,

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:33.150
and it went like this", I taught
you the bee dance, now we're going

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:35.530
to learn the bear's song.

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:39.740
"'Isn't it funny how
a bear likes honey?

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:44.480
Buzz, buzz, buzz, I
wonder why he does'.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.790
Then he climbed a little
further and a little further,

00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:49.460
and a little further
and by the time" --

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:51.740
that way he had another
song, so he's climbing

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:53.530
up the tree, see him climbing here?

00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:56.830
And he's going up and up and up,

00:54:56.830 --> 00:55:01.370
trying to get to the
bees right here on top.

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:05.000
"'It's very funny' -- this is his
song, 'it's very funny thought

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.040
that if bears were bees, and they
built their nests at the bottom

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:15.220
of trees, and that being so, if the
bees were bears, we shouldn't have

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:18.720
to climb up these stairs'.

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:22.520
He was getting rather tired by
this time, so that's why he began

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.700
to sing a complaining song.

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:29.030
He was nearly there and just
as he stood on the top branch,

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:33.140
the top branch to get
the hive, crack.

00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:39.260
Oh, oh, oh helps Pooh as he dropped
ten feet on the branch below,

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:43.440
"'if only I hadn't -- he
said as he bounced 20 feet

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:47.380
to the next branch -- you
see what I meant to do?'

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:50.350
He explained as he turned
head over heels and crashed

00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:55.730
on another branch 30 feet below,
'that's what I meant to do'.

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:59.410 position:56%
Of course, it was rather -- he
admitted as he slithers very quickly

00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:03.310
to the next branches, 'it
all comes I suppose' --

00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:07.140
he decided as he said
goodbye to the last branch.

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:13.950
And he spun around three times
and flew gracefully into a bush,

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:17.780
it all comes because -why
did this happened to Pooh?

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:19.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Because he was climbing the tree.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.540
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: But why
was he climbing the tree?

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:24.210
&gt;&gt; To get the honey

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:29.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: "'It all comes from
liking honey so much, oh help'".

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:33.910
Well, we have some honey for
you guys today to taste here,

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:37.800
and then you have some honey that
your teacher is going to give you

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:42.210
at school at the end of the day
that you can take home and share it

00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:43.510
with somebody else if you like.

00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:47.700
We're going to have it on a spoon
and we're going to eat some honey

00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:53.180
from last year, and then these
are the little packages here,

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.140
let me just show you
what this looks like.

00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:59.510
These are packages of honey
sticks; you guys know honey sticks?

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:00.810
&gt;&gt; No.

00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:02.110
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: No?

00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:06.560
Well OK, what it is it's a little
plastic tube, a little plastic tube

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:08.820
and it's filled with honey.

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:12.570
And when you go home, not at
school, not on the way home,

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:17.390
but when you get home, you can
either bite off the end of this,

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:20.880
just a little bit of a nip, or you
can have somebody else help you

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:24.160
with scissors and make a
little hole there at the end,

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.700
and then you can suck
the honey out, OK?

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:30.120
There's enough here
for each one of you,

00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.640
and for the teachers as well, OK?

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.390
We got time for a couple
of questions,

00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:35.700
anybody got more questions?

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:37.000
Yes?

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.020
&gt;&gt; How come can't we
get a jar of honey?

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:42.310
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: A
jar of honey, well --

00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:44.880
I'll tell you, if you
keep these someday,

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:48.360
you can have many jars of honey.

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.670
Well, maybe when you
get to be big you can,

00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:52.100
maybe when you get to be big.

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:56.400
You know that the President
has bees at the White House?

00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:57.700
They're at the White House.

00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:00.160
Now he doesn't go out to do it
himself, and his wife doesn't

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:03.440
but there's a man there that
keeps the bees at the White House.

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:04.740
What other questions do you have?

00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.040
Yes.

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.870
&gt;&gt; Where do the eggs come from?

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:10.180
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: The
eggs come from the queen,

00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:14.190
the queen lives for
three or four years.

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:19.540
The female worker bees only live
for about four or five weeks, so,

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:22.860
she is busy laying
eggs all of the time,

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:28.560
and in a hive that's really
working hard, in June and July,

00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:34.080
before I steal all the honey, there
maybe 60 or 80,000 bees in there,

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:38.690
as many people to show up in a
Red Skins game, all in one hive,

00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:43.880
all working together,
cooperating and getting that done

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:46.580
so that they will have honey
and so that I'll have honey

00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:47.900
and so that you'll have honey.

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:50.220
&gt;&gt; Where does the queen come from?

00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:51.520
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Where does what?

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:52.820
&gt;&gt; Where does the queen come from?

00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:54.900
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: I'm sorry,
where does the queen come from?

00:58:54.900 --> 00:59:02.460
The queens -- if the hive is doing
poorly, if the queen gets sick,

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:07.910
if the queen gets old, if the queen
dies, then the other bees will try

00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:14.780
and take one of the eggs that she
has laid and make it into a queen,

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:17.610
they get the queen before
she dies, hopefully,

00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:20.910
to lay an egg in a
special large hole,

00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:23.940
even larger than the ones
that I showed you, OK?

00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:27.230
Much bigger, they're about
the size of my little finger,

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:30.970
and she puts a female egg in there
and then they put some extra stuff

00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:33.160
in there, and she develops
as a queen,

00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:35.750
and she can live four, five years.

00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:38.340
I don' do it that way,
but there are people

00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:41.820
that keep bees who raise queens.

00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:46.530
Hundreds of them and they
come in little boxes,

00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:51.080
they come in little boxes with a
little screen and a little plug

00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:54.800
of sugar at the end, and
you put it in the hive,

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:58.670
and the other bees will eat out
that sugar and let her release

00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:03.220
into the hive, so that she can
become the queen of that hive.

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:06.160
But there are people that do
that, that raise the queens,

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:09.190
and when I buy these, if
I do, they come in a box.

01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:11.080
&gt;&gt; Like that?

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.870
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Just like this
and you can get them in the mail,

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:14.880
and then there's one
of these little things

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:19.930
with the queen in it on the inside.

01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:21.230
What other questions?

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:22.530
Quick questions, yes?

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:29.860
&gt;&gt; Do you make the bees that -

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:34.160
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Well,
I make the bees?

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.060
I get them, I buy them --
if I set my hive up right,

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:40.960
then the queen will be making
more bees, but if I wanted

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:44.930
to start one tomorrow, let's say
I have just the wooden stuff,

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:47.650
and I wanted to make a hive
right there, I'll make a hole

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:50.240
in the window and they can
come in and out of the window,

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.490
you don't think they'd
mind here, do you?

01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:58.110
What I do is I can buy this,
and there's somebody else,

01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:02.530
who takes bees from a hive, dumps
them in here, adds the queen

01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:05.530
and sells it to me, and then
I dump them in my equipment

01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:09.590
and if I've done my job right
the bees will like it there

01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:11.910
and they'll stay there
and make honey.

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:14.460
And take care of the
flowers that are around here.

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.760
Yes?

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.410
&gt;&gt; Do you like your job?

01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:19.120
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: I do, I do,

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.350
and you know what the
best part of the job is?

01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:25.090
The best part of the job --

01:01:25.090 --> 01:01:28.810
no, the best part is
coming and talk to you guys.

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:32.110
Come in and talk to other schools,
other kids and teaching people

01:01:32.110 --> 01:01:36.310
about bees so they don't have
to be afraid of them, OK?

01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:38.160
But thank you, that
was a good question.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.580
Yes? I'm sorry?

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:40.880
[Inaudible].

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:45.550
Yes, it's a hobby,
but you can learn how,

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:47.390
it's like a lot of other hobbies.

01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:49.190
Yes?

01:01:49.190 --> 01:02:10.250
[ Inaudible ]

01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:13.330
&gt;&gt; How do they eat the honey?

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:18.730
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: Oh, good question,
good question, good question.

01:02:18.730 --> 01:02:22.790
In the winter when they
want to eat the honey,

01:02:22.790 --> 01:02:26.520
they use that same tongue,
that they went to collect it,

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.770
but they don 't put it in that
special stomach, they just eat it

01:02:29.770 --> 01:02:33.160
and they only eat a very, very
little bit, because it has

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.750
to be shared with all
the other hives --

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:38.650
all that hive, all the other
bees at the hive, it takes a lot

01:02:38.650 --> 01:02:42.710
of cooperation, with
all of those bees,

01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:45.130
so that they can do
all of these jobs.

01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:47.400
They got to keep it clean in there.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.870 position:56%
Sometimes there's a little bit of
dirt, sometimes a bee dies in there,

01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:55.310 position:56%
sometimes there's a little chunk of
wax, they got to keep it real clean,

01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:58.860 position:56%
they got to keep it so it's just the
right temperature, it's not too hot,

01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:02.400
it's not too cold, there's not too
much humidity, it doesn't get wet

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.480
in there, they got
a lot of work to do,

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:08.580
because it's all closed
up, and remember the dance?

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:14.690
It's dark in there, and they got
to do all their work in the dark.

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:15.990
Yes?

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:21.920
&gt;&gt; How do the queen
bees get the eggs out --

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: OK, we can do this.

01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:31.030
The bees, they make the queen, and
then the queen goes out of the hive

01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:36.200
when she gets old enough, and she
gets strong enough, she goes out

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:41.500
and she finds a boy bee to be her
husband, and then she comes back

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:47.180
to the hive and she's ready to lay
eggs, but she never goes out again,

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:50.980
she never goes out again and
she stays in the hive for three

01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:58.070
or four years, and lays thousands
of eggs, boy eggs, girl eggs,

01:03:58.070 --> 01:04:00.030
all of that, that's all she does.

01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:03.270
She doesn't make wax,
she doesn't sting

01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:05.940
and she doesn't do anything
else, the other lady bees,

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.420
the other girl bees
do all that work, yes?

01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:11.400
&gt;&gt; When she lays eggs,
where do the eggs come from?

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: They come out from
her bottom; right out of her bottom,

01:04:15.110 --> 01:04:19.290
just like a chicken,
a chicken lays an egg.

01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:23.060
In the queen, she's got a
special apparatus for growing eggs

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:27.090
on the inside and a special
little opening to drop it out,

01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:30.880
so she comes over to that opening,
she feels the size of it, she's,

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.420
"oh, this one gets a
little boy egg", kapunk,

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:37.210
and she gives it a
little boy egg, yes,

01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:40.510
and the other one she
feels a little girl egg

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:46.540
and she gives It a little girl egg,
I don't know how she does that.

01:04:48.130 --> 01:04:54.340
We have one more question,
one more question, yes.

01:04:57.130 --> 01:05:02.500
&gt;&gt; What kind of bee
has the queen bee?

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.120
&gt;&gt; Jim Salander: What kind
of -- Well, what the --

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:08.970
the person who raises queen bees,
now with my hives they're set up so

01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:12.220
that they make more
honey than they need, OK?

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:15.780
Some people set them up so that
they make more wax than they need,

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:19.310
some people like the pollen so they
collect the pollen from the bees,

01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:22.550
but you can set it up, read the
books and learn how to do it,

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:26.250
so that you can basically
trick the bees

01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:30.150
into making more queens
than they need.

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:33.600
Thank you all very much for
coming, I appreciate it,

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.990 position:56%
now everybody gets a taste of honey.

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:40.710
Who's going to be doing this?

01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:44.800
There's this, this stick
it in and get enough for --

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:48.650
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
