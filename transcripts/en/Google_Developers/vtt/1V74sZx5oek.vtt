DAVID MCCLUSKY: One of
the most familiar features

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.330
of Google Maps is autocomplete.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.730
Google's type ahead
functionality.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.590
Autocomplete reduces
errors in entries

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.180
and provides a better
experience for the user.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.230
This functionality is included
in our Google Places API

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.530
library.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.680
However, many developers
tend to overlook it

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.860
when building their own
mapping applications.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.610
Including autocomplete
in your application

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.990
is as easy as these three steps.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.890
Step one, be sure to include
the Places library when

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.920
loading the JavaScript API.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.780
Step two, create a text
box and instantiate

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.610
the autocomplete service.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.130
Step three, create an event
to capture the results.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.040
You can also further
customize the experience

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.220
by biasing the results to a
particular geographic area

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.365
or by filtering out the
types of results displayed.

00:00:47.365 --> 00:00:48.990
To get started, take
a look at our blog

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.970
and read the developer
documentation.
