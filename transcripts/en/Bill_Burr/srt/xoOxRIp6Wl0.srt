1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,910
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:06,780
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,260
uh, January 25th, 2060.
What's going on our,

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,410
how are you? Ah, you know how
I'm doing? I'm not doing good.

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,990
Ah, everybody in Denver settling in
with a big fucking smile on your face,

6
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,370
aren't ya? Ha.

7
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:31,230
You fucking pot smoking
cuts with the God damn hemp.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,830
Ponchos um, congratulations
to the Broncos.

9
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:37,620
They deserve to right out of the
gate. You know, we took the ball,

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,030
they stopped us. And I remember when they
scored in the first drive, I was like,

11
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:45,420
that was disturbingly easy. Um,

12
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,910
and uh, you know, they
just, we have, they just

13
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,663
von Fucking Miller. I mean, if the,

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,460
if he was in the backfield
any quicker during the game,

15
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,740
he'd be taking the fucking
snap. I mean, it was brutal.

16
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:03,200
We just didn't have any answers
on the outlet, the book. And, uh,

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:03,841
that's what did it,

18
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:06,960
not the fucking field goal and not
us going forward and forth down.

19
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:09,870
I can only imagine what they're seeing
on, I'm doing this Sunday night.

20
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:13,680
I can imagine the sports talk radio that
they're second guessing bill Belichick.

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,370
Yeah. Second guessing. Yes. Second guess
them. It's just bill Belicheck. Oh,

22
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:18,840
what are you? Yeah,
you're the other fucking,

23
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,260
you've never coached on any fucking,

24
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,580
you can level [inaudible] kick
the field goal there. One,

25
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,650
there would have been a [inaudible] floor
to take four kitchens or toward show

26
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,023
[inaudible] fuck.

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,060
I love how people think like, like
something earlier in the game.

28
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:42,170
If they just did this, that, that, that
doesn't change everything after that.

29
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:46,430
I mean, how many fucking back to the
futures do they have to make that you see,

30
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:49,100
if you change one thing, that
it changes everything else.

31
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:53,930
So if the Patriots did kick the fucking
thing and we got to within five and when

32
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:54,950
we got the ball back,

33
00:01:54,951 --> 00:01:59,210
the fact that a touchdown would put us
ahead rather than us being down by eight,

34
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:02,960
they would have had a completely
different fucking defense. Okay.

35
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:06,680
Before they fucking do all of that
second guessing shit. You know,

36
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,640
fucking Versie was going through that
thought that I said I was saying.

37
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,380
I was saying when they did, it was dumb.

38
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,170
Oh did you non coach Versie to
listen to you as opposed to to,

39
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,650
to fucking Belicheck. Um,
when they did it, I was like,

40
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:23,780
I love the, I love the call going forward.

41
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,700
We weren't able to move the fucking ball
at all on offense the entire fucking

42
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:29,750
game. We will,

43
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,540
the only reason why we had a touchdown
was because they had that fucking

44
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:36,350
lateral. And even then, then we
missed a fucking extra point. It just,

45
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,050
it wasn't our day. Even
when we had got a gift,

46
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,260
we fucked it up and then we gave it right
back with a pick and then they scored.

47
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,460
But um, yeah, we weren't able
to move the fucking ball.

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,690
Every time Brady went back, there
was somebody in his face, you know,

49
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:51,960
chomping at the fucking his,

50
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:55,900
his legs as he was trying to throw the
fucking thing. You're that close. I, I,

51
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,520
I agreed with going
forward. It didn't work out,

52
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:03,100
but you know how life is sometimes.
So, um, but it was a great season and,

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,240
um, for what they accomplished with all
the injuries and all that type of shit,

54
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:10,090
it was amazing. And, uh, I
got to tell you, I am, um,

55
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,630
I'm definitely rooting
for, uh, Peyton manning.

56
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:17,650
I'd like to see him go out like John
Elway would be pretty cool for another guy

57
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:21,100
in the Broncos does that. But uh, then
you also, you've got to love Cam Newton.

58
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,130
You know, Jesus Christ, you only
guy not like about Cam Newton.

59
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,250
It's one more person tells me there's
nobody having more fun than him.

60
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,820
Nobody ever called for to care to a,

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,370
it's like a kid on
Christmas a, he's like a,

62
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,650
he's like a kid with a second birthday.

63
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,520
It's like, I get it. He's having fun.

64
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:47,540
He's also totally fucking hamming it up
and making sure his next sneaker deal

65
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:51,080
would be, it will be even 10 times.
What the fuck he has right now.

66
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:54,160
Let's not just, let's start,
be totally naive here.

67
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,890
It just act like everything he's doing
is just because he loves playing the

68
00:03:57,891 --> 00:03:59,840
game. He wasn't this
fucking animated what?

69
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:03,440
He was at a a fucking Auburn.

70
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,730
I used to watch those games
rote against [inaudible].

71
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,740
I used to wear it against him
so I would watch and I was, oh,

72
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,500
he wasn't doing all that
shit. But then again,

73
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:15,620
he couldn't get paid or at least legally
he couldn't get paid back then. So,

74
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,100
you know, what was the point? A
dance it every time you fuck it.

75
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,940
I love when that one
guy fucking, uh, they,

76
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,420
they through the screen pass and he ran
all the way to the other side of the

77
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:24,560
field. By the time he gets there,

78
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Cam Newton runs in with them and
kind of fucking jumps in on that guy.

79
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:33,470
Superbowl super was his
touchdown salivate celebration.

80
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,910
And then the camera man is just following
Cam Newton for the rest of the time.

81
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,843
And um,

82
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,090
in my, uh, in my business, that's a,

83
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:46,860
okay,

84
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,240
that's called a [inaudible] steel on a
scene. It's called, uh, uh, Jesus Christ.

85
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:54,420
I don't do enough acting to even know
stealing the xen is when you're better

86
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:59,320
than the other person. Upstaging
somebody. He was upstaging him. So, um,

87
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,970
I, I just don't need anybody else telling
me how much fun Cam Newton's having.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,380
I get it. He's having a good time,

89
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:07,920
but he's also completely hamming
it up because when he does,

90
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,870
he makes a zillion dollars. However, as
crushing as the Patriot's loss was like,

91
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,120
I literally had to,

92
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,950
I had to go for a walk after they
lost. Um, and I gotta tell you,

93
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:21,720
I felt like we were
going to lose that game.

94
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,010
Okay.

95
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,860
You know, sometime in the second quarter,
I was just like, this, I can feel it.

96
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:30,020
This just isn't our day. It
just wasn't Brady never, I mean,

97
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:33,320
they will all over and he
never got comfortable and, uh,

98
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,120
he wasn't screaming and yelling and
getting people going. I thought,

99
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,690
but our fucking defense played great. Um,

100
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,600
but I g I don't know,
sometimes you can just feel,

101
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:45,460
it's just not your fucking day. So
I literally had to go for a walk,

102
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,670
went to the bank, I mailed
something, I got the car washed.

103
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,690
It was like nobody, there was like a
ghost town. It was just like, you know,

104
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,030
some fucking nerds or whatever
who don't give a shit about,

105
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,060
and some poor bastards who
had to work. And, um, yeah,

106
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:06,320
I went to the car wash and then I
went to this, uh, uh, I don't know,

107
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,230
Mediterranean, Middle East and one of
the fuck it has got one of those reps,

108
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,200
the Shwarma wraps, whatever
the fuck you call it.

109
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,770
And it actually worked out perfectly. I
walked a few blocks over. I got the rap,

110
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,920
I ate it, I watched some of
the Carolina Arizona game.

111
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,260
And then when I came back,
right as I came back,

112
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:23,750
the guy was finishing my car
and he put his hand up like go,

113
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,830
whose car resist is fucking
perfect, perfect timing. Um,

114
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,660
that was about the only a good thing
that happened during those three hours of

115
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:37,480
watching the fucking
game. But, um, anyways,

116
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,780
I got to tell you is as bad as, um,

117
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,770
as bad as the, the feeling I
had when the Patriots lost. Um,

118
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,640
the one thing that cheered
me up was watching that
Carolina fans fall out of the

119
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:54,670
fucking stance. That was one
of the funniest fucking things.

120
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,250
I've seen it a long
time. He just completely,

121
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:00,970
he missed timed when the player
was coming down. I think he,

122
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,670
I think he just ran down and he just,

123
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,290
Mitch misjudge where the rail was and
he just slammed into it and just went

124
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:12,070
right up and over, straight
up and over. I mean if you,

125
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,560
if you put a coat rack on wheels,

126
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,370
it would have landed lighter than
this guy did. There was just no,

127
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,250
nothing athletic about it.
It was just all fucking,

128
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,880
was it a nourishes that the proper
physics, Jeremy just read that.

129
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:28,840
I just wish I could have heard his
thoughts when he was at the tipping point

130
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:30,400
when his legs were right up.

131
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,390
But pointing at the 12 and his head was
at six o'clock right as it started to

132
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:39,010
come around till about 1145 you know,

133
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:42,640
he was lying to himself hanging onto the
rail. Like, I got this, I got this. Ah,

134
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,533
fuck.

135
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:49,140
Oh it is stupid dad jeans just shooting
up in the air right from the gap.

136
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,620
It just fucking lands on the
ground. I liked when he got up to,

137
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:56,800
and then he tried to like climb back up
in the stands and that dude was it like

138
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:59,260
I had nobody. I, what, what,
why don't you just walk around?

139
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,350
We don't need your fallen down again. Um,

140
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,810
okay.

141
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,250
I'll tell you what the
funny thing is is, you know,

142
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:08,920
there's going to be some lawyer scaring
the fuck out of the owner of that team.

143
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,570
Then emotionless maniac that they kept
cutting to when he would just be sitting

144
00:08:13,571 --> 00:08:18,160
there like he was listening to the
verdict of his own murder trial. Um,

145
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,620
the fuck is what that guy is. He
just focused on the super bowl.

146
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:25,750
Everybody in his luxury box is going nuts.

147
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,680
He's got his fucking fired up a wife.

148
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,740
That's when you know you got money when
your wife has a fur coat and hasn't been

149
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:33,790
spray painted. You know,

150
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:38,380
that's when you know that [inaudible] you
guys are living a level of wealth that

151
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:41,230
you don't even run into
commoners to you. You know,

152
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,860
there's always some content's got to come
along and fucking spray paint somebody

153
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:46,450
for a coat, which I've never understood.

154
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,530
It's like the animal died and now
he's going to throw out a tidy,

155
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:55,060
at least it was a jacket. You know
what I mean? Like, if somebody came on,

156
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,020
killed me and made a jacket out of me,
I wouldn't want you to spray paint it,

157
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,330
you know, and then they're
just going to throw it out.

158
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,740
Then I'm just like a fucking jacket,
you know, on a landfill, right.

159
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,640
Floating in the ocean. Let
the bitch walk around with it.

160
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,610
Um, anyways, Jesus fucking
Christ. I'll tell you right now,

161
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:22,550
nobody's having more fun in
the national football league.

162
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,930
Oh God. I was watching the
game with a buddy of mine.

163
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,450
We were just throwing out the cliches
out there. He gets, he gets here.

164
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:32,180
He's the first one here. When
he's the last one to leave.

165
00:09:32,181 --> 00:09:34,730
I'll tell you right now, you
can be 22 guys like that.

166
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:37,050
I could coach his date goes to Bob.

167
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,490
I'll tell you right now, you have
to know where you are on the field.

168
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,260
Why would you run a five yard route when
you need six yards for a first down?

169
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:50,330
I mean, that just doesn't make any sense.

170
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,383
Okay,

171
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,360
I'll tell you out there they
are. [inaudible] they're
just having fun out there.

172
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,790
They're just having fun. That's what
this game's all about. They're out there,

173
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,330
they're loose. He's just
out there slinging it. Um,

174
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,400
anyways, and just like that. My
fucking football season is over.

175
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:12,720
So who do you like in the Super Bowl?
I'll tell you what I don't like.

176
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:15,960
Have you seen that fucking
advertisement for Super Bowl 50,

177
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:20,290
the 50s and gold and for whatever reason,
this, this woman's standing, yeah.

178
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,480
Looking like the hot chick that walks in
in some gumshoe movie from the fucking

179
00:10:25,481 --> 00:10:26,590
1940s.

180
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,130
She stayed in there in a raincoat and
high heels with like a golden umbrella

181
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,750
telling you it's, it's over.

182
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,930
It's fucking over. The bills hired a, uh,

183
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,650
I didn't know what they are. They
had a woman for some job over,

184
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,030
it's fucking over. It's done. It's done.

185
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,680
Those three hours where you
could get away as a married guy,

186
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,240
you could just get away for three
hours. It's just, it's over. It's, I, I,

187
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:57,910
it's gonna sound like
the Westminster dog show

188
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,060
in about seven years. You
know, we had a great run,

189
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:08,470
we had a great run, and now it's over,

190
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,090
you know, but it's our own damn
faults. It's our own damn fault.

191
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:14,050
You know what it was?

192
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:19,360
We just couldn't hide the joy we were
having watching football without him.

193
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,800
We couldn't hide the joy in, there's
nothing that annoys a fucking woman,

194
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:26,650
like a bunch of guys going and
having a good time without them.

195
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,260
So they're in that dressing in pink for
a fucking month. It's, it's fucking,

196
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,640
it's fucking over.

197
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,073
Uh,

198
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,100
I wish I just knew. I just knew,

199
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:42,040
I wish I knew that it was going to come
to this. I would have tried to enjoy,

200
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,223
you know,

201
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,520
my first 37 38 years of football
where they just flew by.

202
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,800
I would've tried to enjoy him a
little bit more and now it's over.

203
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,210
We should make a trade, which is what
we should do. We should just trade them.

204
00:11:59,211 --> 00:12:00,850
The WNV just go like, well,

205
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:04,250
what if we just give you
a league that we started?

206
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,280
It'd be almost like a divorce where you
just get it even though you didn't do

207
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:07,670
anything.

208
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,000
Or maybe like emotionally supported the
guy or some shit or whatever the fuck he

209
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:14,330
say at the court. Right. You
just give them the w NBA.

210
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,100
You can be the commissioners, all the
owners, the commentators, the rafts.

211
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:20,870
You can be everybody in the stands.

212
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,560
We'll give you your section
of Buffalo wild wings yet now

213
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,280
just, just don't take NFL football from
us. Can you? Can you just not just,

214
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:34,460
can you give us, can you just leave
us with that? Can we just have that?

215
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,790
Oh God. Maybe I'm just
too old to understand it.

216
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,650
Coach, can you tell us what
happened there in the first half?

217
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,130
No. Know we weren't good to Donna.
No, we got to get off there.

218
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,570
Know fuck the baby.

219
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,930
I just don't know if I'm ready for that.

220
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,140
You know? I don't know.

221
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,830
I just, you know, I don't, I don't know
where, where do you go now? I guess.

222
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,460
I guess the only place left is you become
one of those weird old guys that plays

223
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:09,510
chess on the park.

224
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,570
Your is about chess.

225
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,280
It's boring and quiet enough that they
don't notice that you're over there

226
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:24,450
without them enjoying yourself. You know?

227
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,290
That's the genius. You ever see a guy
who's been married for like 50 years?

228
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:33,940
Like the genius of him, I swear to God,
the genius of them is they fucking,

229
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,780
they know how to have a good time
without their wife noticed it.

230
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,150
So it doesn't peak your interest.
Right. She's fucking over in the corner.

231
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:46,350
She don't give a shit. Right.
But young guys were idiots.

232
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,820
We come home with a big grin on her face
talking about how awesome it was, blah,

233
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,450
blah.

234
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:56,450
And all they hear is this motherfucker
had the nerve to go out for three hours

235
00:13:57,751 --> 00:14:02,430
and not miss me and not
think about me. Well,

236
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:06,140
we'll see about that, won't we? Um,

237
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,680
it's fucking over. Ah, it's over.

238
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:16,590
Just like the Patriots season. So
who do you guys like in the, um,

239
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,730
who do you guys like in the, uh,

240
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,713
okay.

241
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,100
I'm trying to think of an
activity that women do.

242
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,190
Fucking group that they have that
I would like to infiltrate. And I,

243
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:31,640
for the life of me, I can't think of
it. You know, what are they got though?

244
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,070
The F the four h club girl scouting.

245
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,593
Um,

246
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,530
any of those feminist groups.
That'd be a funny thing to join.

247
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,290
Join one of those fucking groups
and act like you're a feminist.

248
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,860
You just go down there and you say like
the most ignorant but like yet it's

249
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:56,820
still pro women shit come down
there with a fucking bud tall.

250
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,750
Yeah. I just wanted to say, you know,
I came down here to support you broads.

251
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,540
You know, I think it's a, I think it's
fucked up the way that guy treats you.

252
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,051
You know,

253
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:07,540
just cause you run around with a skirt
and it takes you long to get ready.

254
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,280
Doesn't mean you can't run the company.
Right. Am I right ladies? Go buy a bill.

255
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,530
Um, we really appreciate
you coming down here.

256
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:16,240
We think what you're saying is positive,

257
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,920
which is just some buzzwords here
that we, uh, put into a spreadsheet,

258
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:25,060
a little pamphlet thing that we'd like
you to look at. Maybe could not say them.

259
00:15:25,061 --> 00:15:27,650
The next meeting. Maybe take
a couple of weeks off. Oh Duh.

260
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,080
I'm showing up every week.

261
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,870
Okay.

262
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,780
Wait for them to kick me out.
Then I sue them for being sexist.

263
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,730
Um, I'm just a grumpy old
man. That's all it is.

264
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:43,130
I am a grumpy old man who wants
things to stay the same, you know?

265
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:46,160
Do I make any money off the NFL? I
don't. I do have the mute button.

266
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,570
You gotta you gotta love the mute button.

267
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,810
Anytime they cut to the chick on the
sideline. I just fucking, I hit mute,

268
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,160
you know, just trying to,
to keep it going, you know,

269
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,980
just for another couple more
weeks. How come we can't blah,

270
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:05,150
blah blah and the, okay. All right.
Jesus Christ. I think it really comes up.

271
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,600
I don't know. What are you gonna do?
It's a, you know, it's fucking over.

272
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,770
It's our own God damn faults. We just
had too much fucking fun without,

273
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:23,550
so, you know, the next thing
we start, just, you come home,

274
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,600
you get you, you tone it
down. Fucking tone it down.

275
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:33,270
Um, anyways, let's plow ahead
here. So I still haven't even said,

276
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,830
what is it, the, uh, super bowl. Who
Do you like? Panthers of Broncos.

277
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,880
You know, I was impressed
at the panthers. Fucking,

278
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,880
we're kicking the shit out of Arizona
and they didn't take their foot off the

279
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:49,310
gas pedal this week. Um, I don't know,

280
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:51,380
but the Broncos have that fucking defense,

281
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,430
but our offensive line steaks
doesn't stink. We're just banged up.

282
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,980
So I don't know. I don't
know how good the, uh,

283
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,633
okay.

284
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,360
I Dunno. I don't know if you know
what? I don't even fucking know.

285
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:08,560
I'm still so fucking annoyed
by that. Goddamn the finality.

286
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,140
I'm not even that we lost because I
felt Denver was the better fucking team.

287
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:16,060
God Damn mother fucker. All right.
That's it. Plowing ahead. Oh,

288
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:20,380
by the way, did I mention I saw a, the
hateful eight? Did anybody see that?

289
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,540
Did anybody see that? Hey, full
aid, I came up, I talked about it.

290
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:30,040
I saw it in 70 millimeter
at the arclight here in, uh,

291
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,220
in Los Angeles. Um,

292
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,200
it had an intermission and it
had an overture in the beginning.

293
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,900
There were no coming attractions
cause who the fuck's gonna shoot that?

294
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:42,100
The 70 millimeter. Right.

295
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:47,790
And I absolutely fucking love
that movie from start to finish.

296
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:52,230
I love the of it. I love
the whole, I just loved,

297
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,480
I loved it. I just the whole fuck.

298
00:17:57,481 --> 00:18:00,680
It was just an experience like Terentino's
like I don't give a fuck about your

299
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:02,060
cell phone. How you yeah,

300
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:06,110
your fucking brain is all scrambled now
cause you're looking at an iPad screen.

301
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:07,340
All God Damn Day Long.

302
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:11,360
I don't give a fuck the movies this long.

303
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,260
This is the movie I wanted to make and
you can settle the fucking or leave.

304
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,170
Is it just an experience? I absolutely
fucking love that movie. Um,

305
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,890
I was speaking and was speaking of iPads,

306
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,480
so you see when the
Patriots iPads went out,

307
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,750
no stranger to the Broncos go out in
that weird as just one of those strange

308
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,850
things. Just one of those fluke
things that happen to happen and I,

309
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:32,684
it's all good.

310
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,860
It's all good because it happened to the
Patriots now had it happened the other

311
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:40,550
way around and it was in
our stadium. Oh Jesus.

312
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:43,840
How many months would ESPN talk
about that? You know, verse,

313
00:18:43,841 --> 00:18:46,700
he called me today instead
of former quarterback, I
think it was for the giants.

314
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:47,780
I don't even know. It
was saying like, yeah,

315
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,670
we just take air out of the
ball all the fucking time.

316
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,160
Everybody did it and everybody does it.

317
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,410
Okay.

318
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,960
Once again, and I know you
guys are like, oh Jesus, Bill,

319
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,940
how long are you going
to harp on this? Well,

320
00:18:57,941 --> 00:19:01,810
they talked about it for fucking
eight months. You know, I think since,

321
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,360
you know, the judge threw it out of court.

322
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:06,520
I mean it hasn't been eight
months since then. Has It?

323
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,390
September, October,
November, December, January.

324
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,800
You got another three
months of this shit. Um,

325
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:20,770
anyways, enough of that shit. I uh, oh
by the way, I started that, that um,

326
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,110
that series top boy,

327
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,580
top boy on a Netflix and
a fucking great show.

328
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,390
Two episodes in enjoying
it, but Jesus Christ,

329
00:19:31,391 --> 00:19:33,160
you got to put on the fucking subtitles.

330
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,760
Good Lord mumble and fast as fuck.

331
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,180
It's almost as bad as peaky
blinders, but peaky blinders.

332
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,790
You can understand this shit was supposed
to happen like a hundred years ago.

333
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,300
This shit here as far as I can tell
supposed to be going on right now and I

334
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:51,650
still can't understand them. I don't
think they say in it enough. Um,

just the amount of drummers that I saw
that night and I got to stand behind him.

414
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,810
There's any youtube video you're going
to see my dumb fucking head just staring

415
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:40,240

416

00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,790
Scott, John Hommel. I never heard
of fucking destroyed cashmere,

429
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:39,150
just so many fucking amazing drummers
and I actually got to sit in,

430
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:44,460
which is fucking hilarious. I got to sit
in, in between guys at that level. Uh,

431
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,250
I played that song off of, uh, the
presence album for your love and uh,

432
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,890
I'm sorry for your love
for your life and uh,

433
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,170
I wanna thank uh,

434
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,150
everyone in the Moby Dick's for
helping walk me through that song. Um,

435
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,260
I, you know, you know what it was,
I fucked up a lot during the song,

436
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,590
but I nailed the arrangement
as far as like all the changes.

437
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,400
I was on it for that. And
I find that if you do that,

438
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,580
that people in the crowd don't
notice that you fucking up the fills.

439
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,400
There was like one big Phil and I
fucking ribbed out on the thing.

440
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,840
I was so fucking pissed. Um, what
are you gonna do? But it was, uh,

441
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,200
it was just a fucking
amazing night and, uh,

442
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,530
four hours fucking long watching
these guys. And they had this

443
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,740
bottom fucking vista light set, the
exact same style kit that he had.

444
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:39,530
Um, a if you watched the song and
the song remains the same and this,

445
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,540
the fucking kick drum was wide
open. They had nothing in there.

446
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,730
They didn't even a filled
strip going across it.

447
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,950
It was one of the sickest sounds I've
ever heard in my life. Big 26 inch kit.

448
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:55,200
They had the two tympanies to the left
of the high hat and then the fucking

449
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:57,570
Gong. And it's, I'm so pissed
at the end of the song,

450
00:26:57,571 --> 00:26:58,740
I didn't hit the fucking Gog.

451
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:03,600
How many fucking opportunities do you
get to do that? And I blew it. But, um,

452
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,680
I just had, I just had the
best time doing it. And uh,

453
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,630
then of course I'm driving home. It was
down in Anaheim and I'm driving home.

454
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,830
And the best thing about
driving home at night in La is,

455
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,260
is finally no traffic and
I'm fucking cruising. And uh,

456
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:24,290
all of a sudden the fucking five just
comes to a grinding halt in three,

457
00:27:24,631 --> 00:27:25,470
four lanes,

458
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:29,820
merge down to one and then are
forced off of the highway into like a

459
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:31,860
neighborhood. Uh,

460
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,400
because the only time they obviously that
they can fix the highways is at night.

461
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:39,690
So I have empathy for these
state workers out here,

462
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:43,480
but um, suck for me
and I just, I complete,

463
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,910
I had like a fucking meltdown for about
five minutes and I was texting everyone

464
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:50,490
that I got a number from
that was on the show,

465
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:54,570
telling them not to
get on the five and uh,

466
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,670
fuck a Bruton. And once again,

467
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:58,980
I just don't understand why
people buy fast cars out here.

468
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:02,310
Unless you have a pickup truck with a
trailer and you could drive that car,

469
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,990
you can tow the car to a race track.
I just don't understand. You know,

470
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:08,820
these fucking cars you see out here,

471
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,910
they can go like 180 hundred
60 toward a miles an hour.

472
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:14,190
Some of these fucking cars. It's
like, where are you doing that?

473
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,903
I don't know.

474
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,560
It's fucking ridiculous. I beeped at
this lady today. I was probably a dick.

475
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,281
I just really,

476
00:28:22,281 --> 00:28:25,040
I can't fucking stand people when
they sit at a God damn red light,

477
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:27,470
you're right behind them. And
then when the light turns green,

478
00:28:27,471 --> 00:28:30,230
they put on their fucking left
turn signal and then you beat bad.

479
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:32,600
And they're like, what the fuck?
It's like you give me a heads up,

480
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,290
give me a heads up so I could have backed
off and gone around you your fucking

481
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:38,600
Dick. Now that 20 people
behind me are going to go by.

482
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,910
I'm going to miss the fucking
light. Now I'm on your schedule.

483
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:42,340
Yeah.

484
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,470
You know like that. That's
never happened to you.

485
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:47,320
You'd never been the person behind that
person. You don't fucking remember.

486
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,570
Now you're first in line.
You just say fuck it.

487
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,400
Yeah,

488
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,910
sorry. Most of this shit, everything
that I'm saying, women in the NFL,

489
00:28:54,911 --> 00:28:57,230
all of this shit, most of this
shit has nothing to do with the,

490
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,410
it has to do with the fact
that my team lost, you know?

491
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,810
So now I'm just fucking
grumpy. Um, anyways.

492
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,740
Naela be the best day alive.

493
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,780
Okay.

494
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,600
It's weird. One for the
gipper. Um, alright. Oh, hey,

495
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:23,230
I'm going to be playing out live again.
If you guys, uh, Andy would stand up.

496
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:27,550
Oh, Dean del Ray. Dean del
raised a 50th birthday.

497
00:29:27,551 --> 00:29:31,510
You got to come down to this at the
El Rey theater, del Ray at the El Rey.

498
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:36,750

unbelievable fucking lineup of, uh,

499
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,960
comedians and musicians to
celebrate Dean Del Rey's 50th.

500
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,050
And of course, my fucking
Internet cuts out.

501
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:48,490
I finally had the fucking thing finally
had it. I had it all fucking lined up.

502
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,480
I was ready to read off the
whole thing. And what happens?

503
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:57,250
It just fucking disappears.
You fucking cunt. All right,

504
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,930
well, this is what I know.

505
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,943

511
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,030

uh, we're going to do some, uh,

512
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,620

513
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,010

Um,

523
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,480
all right, let's, uh, let's
continue on here with, with the, uh,

524
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:14,370
with the podcast. What else did I
want to talk about? Is there anything,

525
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:18,690
anything at all? Is I, if
I, as I settle into the fact

526
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:24,080
that my fucking football
season is over, um, oh,

527
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,410
Jesus Christ to Patrice O'Neal benefit,
how the fuck did I almost forget that?

528
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,170
Uh, late gray Patrice O'Neil, the, I
think this is the fourth one we've done.

529
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,003
Um,

530
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:40,990
yeah, 13, 14, 15, 16. Yeah, this is
the fourth one's already flying by.

531
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,960
Um, it's sold out. There will be
a few tickets released at the, um,

532
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,330
right before the show starts.

533
00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:52,120
It's always a few people that request
the tickets and then they don't show up.

534
00:31:52,121 --> 00:31:55,720
So there's a chance if you walk
up there might be a sub tickets.

535
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,110
It's going to be an amazing
lineup. And as always, uh,

536
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,860
other than the money that we use
to, uh, pay to rent out the theater,

537
00:32:02,861 --> 00:32:07,861
all monies goes to a Patricia's loved
ones and it's really made an unbelievably

538
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:11,140
positive effect on their lives.

539
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,543
Um,

540
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:12,991
you know,

541
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:16,470
his mom has been able to get a condo and
his stepdaughters is going to private

542
00:32:16,471 --> 00:32:19,800
school since the benefit. And um,

543
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:25,320
just the quality of their lives
basically stayed the same, you know,

544
00:32:25,321 --> 00:32:29,040
Patrice was taking care of
them. So, um, it's really,

545
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:32,340
it's the greatest thing that I'm involved
in during the course of the year and

546
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:36,670
I'm so happy that you guys
step it up every year and, um,

547
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,660
buy tickets.

548
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,090
I want to thank everybody who bought
that means the world to me and everybody

549
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:45,050
involved and all the comics that take
time out of their schedule to come down

550
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:49,670
there and um, and
perform. And it's just a,

551
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:52,400
it's just an awesome thing and we're just
going to keep doing it as long as you

552
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:56,600
guys keep showing up. All right.
So thank you. Thank you for that.

553
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,360
And with that, let's get into some
of the reeds here for their, uh,

554
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:05,170
for this week. All right. What are we
up to here? 33 minutes. Sorry. Alright.

555
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:10,250
Alright. Hacky hate. Hey
Bill, how I, yeah, he says,

556
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:15,080
I am not a patriots fan. I am a die
hard bears fan. After the Patriots lost,

557
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:20,081
all I saw on Facebook was people
trashing Brady and bringing up Trump and

558
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:24,410
deflate gate. I get it. They're on most,

559
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,920
they're on top most of the time and
people love to trash him or whoever's

560
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,840
winning at life.

561
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,340
Now let's stop giving excuses to these
pansy ass fucking sports fan who spent

562
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:38,600
sports fans who spend 90% of their
fucking time talking about gossip.

563
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,020
It all gets classified under
gossip. Every hack who was,

564
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,640
who was a static that the
pastry is lost is an asshole.

565
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,780
Especially the ones who will declare
they could care less about sports.

566
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,930
Congrats. You're about as cool
as the guy who paints his face.

567
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,120
The only time I talk shit about the
Patriots is to remind them of 1985 even.

568
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:03,050
That's pretty weak. Go bears.
Um, yeah, but you know,

569
00:34:03,051 --> 00:34:07,310
if you're on top you got to expect that
people are going to give you shit. Um,

570
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,780
the only thing I didn't like was, was
when the, the uh, Broncos' defense,

571
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,920
you know, oh, we're getting sugar
here. What about Tom Brady? It's like,

572
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:20,840
well then when a fucking Superbowl win
four of 'em and they'll talk about you.

573
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:23,480
The Patriots never talked
shit about the Broncos.

574
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:27,730
They never said that they were better
than the Broncos. And I also love to,

575
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,530
it's just like, you know, they
were favorites. They were fit.

576
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:33,770
Like the Patriots made themselves
favorites that, you know,

577
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,220
what's really overrated is,

578
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:40,570
is being a favorite or being an underdog
has nothing to do with your team.

579
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:46,630
It has to do with the fucking dope in
the buffalo wild wings who's betting on

580
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:49,040
games? All right.

581
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,380
What Vegas tries to do is they try to
get money on both sides of the ball,

582
00:34:53,381 --> 00:34:55,940
so they try to pick a number. All right,

583
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,270
that's going to entice people to go 50 50.

584
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:02,060
That's why the line changes
during the course of the week.

585
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,330
Did one team get better or another
team get get worse? I mean,

586
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:07,940
if there's an injury, yes, but
generally speaking, no, what happens is,

587
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,310
is this too much money going to one side?

588
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:14,800
So they need to entice people to
come back the other side. Because if,

589
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,320
if you know that you can't have like 90%
of the money on one side of the ball,

590
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:23,060
that could completely fuck
over the gambling ring or the,

591
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,270
uh, they don't like those
odds. And because Ty's lose,

592
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,870
that's enough to tip it in their fucking
favor. That's basically what goes on,

593
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,810
which is why, you know,

594
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:37,040
if you look back in oh seven when the
Patriots beat the giants the last game of

595
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,471
the year,

596
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:41,730
and the giants put up like fucking 33 or
34 points and we only won by like three

597
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:42,480
or something.

598
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,480
That's why like a month later we
were still 14 point favorites.

599
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,180
It had no, the Patriots are
overhyped. They weren't overhyped.

600
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:56,181
What happened was the Superbowl brings
out people who don't know shit about

601
00:35:56,971 --> 00:36:01,590
football. All right? It
brings out the fucking ladies.

602
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:04,140
It brings out all you know this, this
is not the worst in a super bowl party.

603
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,930
If you give a shit about football,
if you really liked the super bowl,

604
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,670
if really like football, if
you're really a football fan,

605
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,780
you watch it alone or you watch it with
like two or three other people that keep

606
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:16,320
their fucking mouth shut, right? Um,

607
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,380
but what happens is during the Superbowl
that brings out all the fucking,

608
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,840
the novice fans that people don't even
watch and all they see is 18 and old

609
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,820
fucking bearer. They know
Brady. Like they know,

610
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:30,000
they know Tom Brady the way I
know Darth Vader. All right.

611
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:34,600
I can't tell you a fucking
thing about the last, like,

612
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:36,880
I don't even know how many there's
been since the original three.

613
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:42,250
I know Veda is fucking Luke's
father and that fucking,

614
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,133
uh,

615
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:49,270
Luke in layer a brother and sister and
that they kind of had like this sexual

616
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:52,010
tension in one to fuck each
other in the beginning,

617
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:55,460
which I think is a really weird thing
to put into a kid's movie, don't you?

618
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:57,943
Um,

619
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,140
okay.

620
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,990
Maybe he didn't know that
when he initially wrote it
and then he just needed a

621
00:37:01,991 --> 00:37:04,870
good left turn when he was writing the
second one. I have no fucking idea,

622
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:08,350
but I think the way he tried to make it
up was with those durables in the third

623
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:13,120
one, you know, going where
the fuck they did, you know,

624
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,210
I know what the fuck they did. So
anyway, so that's as much as I can.

625
00:37:16,211 --> 00:37:19,270
As much as I know about star wars,
these people know about football.

626
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:20,170
So then they come in,

627
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,550
they go to Vegas and everybody goes in
and thinks that they're fucking Sean

628
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,340
Connery and James Bond,
right. They way, you know,

629
00:37:27,341 --> 00:37:30,670
they fucking go down there and
they got some Almond Vegas suit on.

630
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,010
Their wife's wearing
some fucking, you know,

631
00:37:33,011 --> 00:37:36,040
sparkly number and everybody's
out there, you know,

632
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:38,650
stepping outside of themselves
and say, I want to gamble.

633
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:42,130
I want to get in the action.
Who's playing? I don't know
who that other team is.

634
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,890
I know Tom Brady is, let me, yeah,

635
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,860
let me put a hundred bucks on his
done the Clef of his fucking chin.

636
00:37:47,861 --> 00:37:52,600
And that's how the line goes from
what it should be about three,

637
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:56,340
four points to all the way up to 14.
That's what the fuck happens. All right.

638
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:01,760
And that was for everybody who doesn't
fucking gamble. Okay. All right,

639
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,590
cool enough already. We get it.
Your team lost and you fucking,

640
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,820
you were in a country mood. Um, thank
God that guy fell out of the stance.

641
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:14,170
He didn't even look that drunk. I
just loved his fucking gap jeans.

642
00:38:14,171 --> 00:38:18,820
Just fucking straight up in the air.
All right. Next question here. Um, oh,

643
00:38:18,821 --> 00:38:23,290
by the way, if you'd like to
donate to this podcast, um,

644
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,540
all you gotta do is just go to,
uh, next time you go to Amazon.

645
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,920
If the next time I'm going
to buy something on that,
uh, just go to my website,

646
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,970
Bill bird.com. Click on the podcast page,
and then you just click on the Amazon.

647
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,640
It just takes you there. It doesn't
cost you any extra money. Uh, you might,

648
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,430
you know, later on in life, if
your index finger wears out,

649
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:43,420
you might think like, you know what,

650
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,750
if I didn't do those extra two
clicks with my index finger,

651
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,580
maybe I would've had another 10 minutes
of joy and no fucking constant pain and

652
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:55,450
my index finger. Other than that,
there's really nothing I even do it.

653
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,750
I even go when I go to Amazon. Well,
why wouldn't I guess I get the money,

654
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,710
right? You know, I did. I went on
there and I fixed my fucking car.

655
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,530
I Dunno what the fuck capita, my
cooler this year, that the rose bowl,

656
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,500
it's been to every rose bowl that I've
been to and I've been to eight of them at

657
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:16,300
this point and I never had
a fucking problem. And at
some point, like my cooler,

658
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:19,030
basically it opens up
to a point, you know,

659
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:22,420
the hinges stop it from opening and
then there's this strap to keep it from

660
00:39:22,421 --> 00:39:26,530
going any further. And I
don't know what happened. Um,

661
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,720
cause I fucking passed out like at
like 10 o'clock in the morning. So,

662
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,880
and I didn't even notice
that my cooler was fucked up.

663
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:38,320
But at the end of the night when
I got my cooler back, the, uh,

664
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,160
it had basically been decapitated.

665
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:45,320
The strap was busted and the hinges were
busted. And I was like, what the fuck?

666
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:49,760
What happened? Yeah, it's like the
hulk opened the thing up or something.

667
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,070
She's like, just open it a little, it's
fine. But then I was thinking of Warren,

668
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,960
I fell down was I was drunk that I
land on the cooler and it's like, no,

669
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,780
I w I wouldn't notice that
I landed flat on my butt.

670
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,200
I landed like that fucking guy.
What? He fell out of the stands.

671
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:07,160
It's how I fell. I fell on the grass.
Do you realize I was on a fairway,

672
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,700
a straight fairway golf course and
I lost my balance and fell down.

673
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:15,620
That's how fucking drunk I wasn't, you
know what? It was fucking great. Um,

674
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,590
so anyways, I went to a, Oh,
actually I didn't go to Amazon,

675
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,800
they just looked up Igloo m cooler
repair kit and they got like,

676
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,500
there's two different kinds of hinges and
I accidentally ordered two of them and

677
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:30,520
I only need one of them.

678
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,620
So I have an extra repair kit and I
know you know the odds and they send you

679
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:39,610
like three sets of hinges. You
know, if you have like the,

680
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,290
the giant one,

681
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:44,140
you're the person who kills his wife and
doesn't want anybody to know and just

682
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,880
say she's on vacation and he cuts her up.

683
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,780
Like they have that size hinge for that
cooler and then they just got, you know,

684
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,780
the happy drunk that falls down
on New Year's Day, you know,

685
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,590
so they come with three
sets of hinges for each.

686
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,880
So I have an entire extra one. So
anybody out there who has like a,

687
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,900
a cooler that needs to be
replaced, it comes with everything.

688
00:41:04,901 --> 00:41:09,490
Even like the drain little drain hole,
fucking spout thing, it's got that, um,

689
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,310
the strap does come separately.
I don't have an extra strap,

690
00:41:12,311 --> 00:41:15,160
but I have an extra a repair
kit. So if anybody wants it,

691
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,700
send us an email with an address and
I'll send it out to you because what else

692
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:20,230
am I going to do with it? I'm
not going to throw it out.

693
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:25,660
And someday if I ever move, um, you know,

694
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,640
I've got to pack up something that I
don't even fucking need. So there you go.

695
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:32,180
Oh, by the way, uh,

696
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,180
I'm still in the running here
to maybe get this drum room

697
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:43,630
made slash podcast room in the back of
my garage, um, as always, this major,

698
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:47,470
major fucking structural issues. But, um,

699
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,640
I don't know. It's just gotta. I gotta
I gotta show up that part of the house,

700
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:53,570
but there's this, all these,

701
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,830
these all these fucking issues that I
can't even talk about because, you know,

702
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,800
I'm getting a permit. I'm doing all of
that fucking shit. I know. Somebody like,

703
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,290
well, you don't need
a full computer muted,

704
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,820
full if you're building
within the structure,

705
00:42:04,821 --> 00:42:07,010
if you know the Antigone square footage
of Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

706
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:08,720
I know all that shit. But
like, I just, you know,

707
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,710
anytime you start hammering
in your fucking garage,

708
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,590
you neighbors here at
the fucking rat you out.

709
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:17,020
I just don't need the fucking headaches.

710
00:42:17,021 --> 00:42:22,021
So I'm doing my due diligence
and it's taking a long time.

711
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:25,550
But, um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna make this,

712
00:42:25,551 --> 00:42:30,200
I'm gonna make this fucking happen
and I have a 71 Ludwig green sparkle,

713
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:34,070
all bottom sized drums and I'm gonna
make sure that they fucking fit in there

714
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,650
and I'm going to fucking, I don't
give a shit. What do I care? Right.

715
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,903
You know,

716
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,810
the oceans are all fished out. The
government takes all your fucking money.

717
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:50,680
You know, I don't give a fuck. I'm going
all out with this thing, this thing.

718
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,870
I'm literally going to be able to
pull. I'm going to tell this guy,

719
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,920
if I'm able to do this and I'm not going
to have a fucking problem legally and I

720
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,600
could build the fucking
thing I want to build,

721
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,620
I'm literally going to be able to play
at two o'clock in the fucking morning and

722
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:03,940
no one's even going to
hear it. They might,

723
00:43:03,941 --> 00:43:05,800
it might sound like a
stereos on really low,

724
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:11,110
but I'd never be a Douche enough
to play then, um, at least sober.

725
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,830
That'll be great then. Right?
Anytime I'm bugging my wife,

726
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:18,400
I can just walk out the back
door, go into my garage,

727
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:22,990
sit down and put on a Zeplin
album, guns and roses.

728
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:27,400
Fucking uh, all my fucking Shit I
listened to when I was growing up.

729
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:33,090
Queens of the Stone Age, you know? Right.

730
00:43:33,091 --> 00:43:36,400
What w what else do you fucking
need? Uh, you know what else I need?

731
00:43:36,401 --> 00:43:40,930
I need a bar out there, right?
Flat screen TV. You know,

732
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:44,350
it's funny about a man cave when somebody
really goes throws down and their

733
00:43:44,351 --> 00:43:48,190
fucking man cave. All I hear
is I am not happily married.

734
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:53,380
And what you're doing is you're building
a mini version of what your life would

735
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:56,470
look like if you weren't what your house
would look like if you weren't married.

736
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:00,430
Like after you show them the house
with all the throw pillows and all the

737
00:44:00,431 --> 00:44:02,260
fucking popery and all that shit.

738
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,750
You bring your buddy out to the
garage and your psych. Yeah.

739
00:44:04,751 --> 00:44:07,870
If I wasn't married, like this
is what it would look like.

740
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,640
But you know what's funny about that?

741
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,870
I'm old enough to know that if
your house did look like that,

742
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,950
the ice, I see the loneliness in it.

743
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,270
Cause the bottom line is a
man cave. What it is is like

744
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,600
what's your building is
what you wish you had,

745
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:31,560
you wish you could afford when
you were fucking 22 years old.

746
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:35,730
That's basically it. And the problem
is, is if you do it honestly,

747
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:40,080
if you're actually work
your balls off, you know,

748
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,110
and you don't steal from anybody
or any of that fucking shit,

749
00:44:43,111 --> 00:44:45,720
it's going to take it
to your about 50 LSU,

750
00:44:45,721 --> 00:44:50,010
one of these fucking nerds and silicone
valley that comes up with an app or some

751
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:54,130
shit. You know, you really don't
get paid until you get close to 50.

752
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:58,230
That's just how it is, you
know? It's just how it is.

753
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,530
Except for Cam Newton. He's
getting paid around. Yeah.

754
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,240
Do I write down? Don't worry. He's
having more fun than that guy.

755
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,510
If you look up fun in the dictionary. Um,

756
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:11,340
anyways, I, um, yeah,

757
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:13,350
I'm going to fucking make a
little podcasting. I mean,

758
00:45:13,351 --> 00:45:18,210
I don't have a lot of
room, but, uh, I'm gonna,

759
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:22,590
I'm gonna fucking do it up.
Right. And, uh, you know,

760
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:25,560
getting back and taking lessons again
through the shit that I'm actually paying

761
00:45:25,561 --> 00:45:29,040
attention to now that I never paid
attention to how I hold onto this sticks

762
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,640
where I'm hitting the
snare drum, my balance,

763
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:35,910
all of that shit used to be
all about going on youtube,

764
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,600
seeing some guy do one of those Gospel
Chop fucking licks in an I'm going to go

765
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:44,601
down here and fucking just do this for
fucking nine days in a row and then I'll

766
00:45:44,731 --> 00:45:46,590
be able to do that, you know, pull this,

767
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,570
fill off next time I walk into Guitar
Center. And, uh, and then meanwhile,

768
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:55,770
all my other planks shocked.
And, uh, I've just had this

769
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,320
total epiphany about all
of it. And a, it's funny,

770
00:46:01,321 --> 00:46:03,330
I'm not doing nearly as
much as I used to do,

771
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:06,980
but I think I'm playing better than
I ever played. And uh, yeah, I dunno.

772
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,780
It's fucking exciting. It gives me a
reason to get up in the morning, you know?

773
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:13,800
So anyways, let's move on
to the next question here.

774
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,291
Uh, oh my God.

775
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:19,680
Did I tell you guys how I butchered that
fucking pork chop meal that I made? Oh,

776
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:20,840
I'm still sick over that.

777
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,493
Okay.

778
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:23,721
Ugh. I'm like,

779
00:46:23,721 --> 00:46:27,230
I'm eating pork chops again this week
cause I have to redeem myself. All right,

780
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,000
so the hacky hate. Yeah. Yeah.

781
00:46:29,001 --> 00:46:31,910
That just kind of comes with winning
games and whatever. I'm all right.

782
00:46:31,911 --> 00:46:35,810
No Asian diversity at the
Oscars. Bill hello from Canada.

783
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:39,260
Would love to hear what your take is on
why no one is complaining about the lack

784
00:46:39,261 --> 00:46:42,980
of agents at the Oscars.
Oh, you motherfucker. That's
the bit I was going to do.

785
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:49,020
That was the bit I was going to do.
Yeah, that's, it's as egos as an agent.

786
00:46:49,021 --> 00:46:50,400
I don't care because a,

787
00:46:50,401 --> 00:46:54,840
I suspect we aren't producing good
enough shit not to not, oh wait,

788
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,470
we're not producing good enough
shit. Not because we're Asian. B,

789
00:46:58,471 --> 00:47:01,860
Asians aren't getting sweet
rolls because I'm not profitable.

790
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:06,810
They aren't going to cast an Asian
parentheses or black or female actor that

791
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:11,600
would make more money out
of some white conspiracy.

792
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,480
Dude, you had like fucking two
sets of parentheses in there.

793
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,830
Asians aren't getting sweet rolls
because it's not profitable.

794
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:24,740
They aren't going there. They
aren't going to not cast an Asian

795
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:31,270
are black or female actor that, oh, I
see what you're saying. They're not,

796
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:35,980
they aren't going to not cast an Asian
actor that would make more money out of

797
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:39,220
some white conspiracy. So you're saying
if they, if they would make them money,

798
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,020
then they would see,

799
00:47:41,021 --> 00:47:45,910
who cares if you don't like
how the Oscars define the best,

800
00:47:45,911 --> 00:47:49,140
whatever. I don't get why.

801
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:53,450
And then that's the end of it. I
see what you're saying. Well, yeah,

802
00:47:53,451 --> 00:47:55,640
you're looking at it from a very, uh,

803
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:02,110
like money. Like I think that's a
lot of times sometimes, you know,

804
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:04,930
it looks like it's racism. A
lot of times it's just money.

805
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:10,290
But what I think American cinema is
finally realizing is that there's a whole

806
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:18,480
bunch of other people in the world that
they can actually get money from if they

807
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:22,590
gave a fuck to make a movie
that would appeal to them.

808
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,210
And the only thing,

809
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,990
reason why I think they're doing that
is because everybody's stole movies and

810
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:30,060
it's so hard to make
money off of them now.

811
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:34,560
And there's such a big
fucking risk because what
happened to the music business

812
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:38,490
has happened slash is happening
to the movie business right now,

813
00:48:38,491 --> 00:48:43,491
which is why there's really no more
like from like $20 million to like $70

814
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:50,100
million. They don't make movies in
that budget anymore. They just don't.

815
00:48:50,101 --> 00:48:54,900
It's either like some fucking $100 million
star wars action hero movie or it's

816
00:48:54,901 --> 00:48:58,260
like fucking below $10 million it seems.

817
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,420
I'm all the way down to like a hundred
grand, like in the sort of, you know,

818
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,880
micro budget fucking thing. Um,

819
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,690
so yeah, I see what you're
saying. Yeah. I mean the, yeah,

820
00:49:09,691 --> 00:49:12,540
there's no agent's area there. Where's
the outcry for that? Well, people don't,

821
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:14,130
people give a fuck about themselves.

822
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,760
That's the one thing that I can
say about people in general,

823
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:19,500
straight across the board, you know,

824
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,240
which is why I guess white people need,

825
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:28,230
because they're running shit, quote,
run and shit. You know what I mean?

826
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,290
Like they're all cooperating with one
another because there's white people in

827
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:32,220
those positions.

828
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,620
They need to take the time to actually
give a fuck about other stuff.

829
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:37,603
Cause I gotta be honest with you.

830
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:40,890
I've thought that kid that played
easy in a straight Outta Compton,

831
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,910
he should've gotten nominated. He was,
he was the fucking Shit and that movie,

832
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:48,480
I should know that actors name he
was, you know what, God dammit.

833
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,590
Why don't I step outside my whiteness.

834
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,440
I'm going to,

835
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,530
I'm going to set the example here
right now and I'll tell you right now,

836
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:02,710
there's nobody having more fun right
now going on the Internet than this guy.

837
00:50:02,721 --> 00:50:06,560
You look up fun on the Internet. There'll
be a picture of me easy. He actor,

838
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,673
um, I'm

839
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:11,823
Eric Lynn ride is here.

840
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,800
Jason Mitchell on playing easy
e that fucking guy was the,

841
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:19,210
he should have got something
even get a golden globe.

842
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,830
You get nominated for that. Um,

843
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,070
that was one of those movies that
I actually didn't even want to see.

844
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,740
There was some line that
what's his face? Uh, um,

845
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:36,420
Giamatti said, you know what I mean? You
can't try it out like that, like that,

846
00:50:36,421 --> 00:50:39,350
that phony yelled, whatever the fuck
he yells. I go, Jesus Christ, this,

847
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:42,890
this looks really heavy
handed. You know what I mean?

848
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:45,800
And then they always have
to have the uh, you know,

849
00:50:45,801 --> 00:50:50,420
they always have to have the white white
angel and those movies when they show

850
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:54,200
racism, so then white people will go so
they can lie to themselves and be like,

851
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:56,930
yeah, if I was there, that's
the white guy. I would be,

852
00:50:56,931 --> 00:51:01,790
I'd be the Angel White Guy. I wouldn't
be the, the A, you know, the racist guy.

853
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,930
Um, yeah, no, it's a very,
it's a very interesting,

854
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:11,120
the whole fucking thing is
really interesting. I don't know.

855
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,140
I have no idea. I mean I think
you shouldn't just say, look,

856
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:20,000
black actors should be nominated.
You should fucking then back it up.

857
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,990
You know what I mean? And give shout
outs to people that fucking deserve.

858
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,080
He's to be like Jason Mitchell, plain
easy and straight outta Compton.

859
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:30,710
I would a fuck is going to say
he should have got something. Um,

860
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,630
or maybe they did do that. I've
got to be honest with you. I don't,

861
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:37,610
I don't really pay attention to award
shows. I fucking can't stand up. Um,

862
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,860
they're horrific. They're fucking
horrific. They're boring as hell.

863
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:46,460
There's usually one moment
that's worth fucking watching.

864
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:49,700
And at that with the Internet,
you're not going to miss it.

865
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,660
They're just going to show it to you.

866
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:55,430
So why would you waste four hours
of your life watching the shit?

867
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:59,240
Like for the Golden Globes, the, the,
the moment of the night was Jim Carrey.

868
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:04,070
Jim Carrey stole that. Even that
fucking speech was hilarious.

869
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:07,940
And from what I've heard,
um, from people out here,

870
00:52:07,941 --> 00:52:12,560
he just winged that thing. That's
how fucking funny that guy is. Um,

871
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,950
and watching him do that and the brutal
honesty of it really made me wish I

872
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:19,820
could still watch him to stand up,
to be honest with you. Um, all right,

873
00:52:19,821 --> 00:52:22,040
here we go to your
health. Good Syrup Bill.

874
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,870
I've heard you discussed many topics with,

875
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:27,940
with yourself on the podcast
about health and longevity, uh,

876
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:30,830
of the major topics I.
E. Food and exercise.

877
00:52:30,831 --> 00:52:35,270
I would have to suggest considering
another area to focus on breathing.

878
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:40,700
Yeah. Jesus. I got to work on
this too. Breathing is huge.

879
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:45,790
How you breathe in the types of breaths
you take during the day to really change

880
00:52:45,801 --> 00:52:48,170
your body for the better. I just
literally thought about breathing.

881
00:52:48,171 --> 00:52:49,220
I got more relaxed.

882
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:53,520
This is this yoga shit that I
try to slow my brain down for.

883
00:52:53,521 --> 00:52:56,600
Conscious breathing,
conscious breathing. Oh,

884
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,060
you're going to plug your book in
the middle of this. You motherfucker.

885
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,330
You know what? You got
me. He suckered me in,

886
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,770
but I'm going to read it like deep
thoughts by Jack Handy. Here we go.

887
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:11,300
Conscious breathing is a book
in a great place to start.

888
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,041
Also,

889
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:18,041
a man by the name of Wim Hoff is doing
amazing things and has been on Joe

890
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:23,390
Rogan's podcast. You may not
have three hours to listen to it,

891
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:27,750
but if you run into Joe, I'm sure
he can give you the breakdown.

892
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,330
Thanks for the free laps.

893
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,193
Um,

894
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,520
no. I listen to anybody that's on
Rogan's podcast. Joe Rogan's podcast,

895
00:53:36,521 --> 00:53:38,620
the fastest fucking three hours you're
ever going to spend. You've ever,

896
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:41,400
ever lucky enough to be a fucking
guest. You can be like admin.

897
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:45,100
You're like 40 minutes and then all of a
sudden you like it. How the fuck is it?

898
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:49,750
Like seven o'clock at night? That
guy, I missed her. I miss my meal. Um,

899
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,340
well I'll, I'll give it a chance.
I'll give it a try. I know I,

900
00:53:52,341 --> 00:53:56,640
I definitely need to
fucking stress less and a,

901
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,800
that's always like one of my goals. I
haven't been drinking this year though.

902
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:03,250
The day after the Rose Bowl
was the last time I boozed

903
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:05,563
um,

904
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:10,390
I had one gulf of wine after I made this
really rich dinner and in my stomach I

905
00:54:10,391 --> 00:54:13,210
needed to settle it. So my
wife was drinking some wine.

906
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:17,560
I just took a gulp of that. And
then the last three nights in a row,

907
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:21,310
I'm getting rid of these Rosebowl
beers. I just drink like one light beer.

908
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:25,390
I just have one and then, then I'm done.
And it just kind of makes me sleepy.

909
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,360
But I'm just trying to free
up some room in the fridge.

910
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,400
Cause every year at the
end of the Rose Bowl,

911
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:35,610
I get stuck with all the extra beers
and like fucking 15 cans of half used

912
00:54:36,281 --> 00:54:38,380
mustard. Um,

913
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,930
I get all the condiments and a broken
cooler. All right? Trash in the ocean.

914
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:48,340
Hey, bill, I know you talk about
this all the time on your podcast,

915
00:54:48,341 --> 00:54:51,880
but believe it or not, there are
people who do not believe our trash

916
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,480
being dumped to the ocean is a problem.

917
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,670
While there's always
going to be those people,

918
00:54:57,671 --> 00:55:00,580
there's also people that thought
the fucking world was flat. Well,

919
00:55:00,581 --> 00:55:01,960
I guess I would have
thought the world is flat.

920
00:55:01,961 --> 00:55:05,260
If I live back then people didn't think
that we were f we are owning an effect

921
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:08,560
on the climate. You know,

922
00:55:08,561 --> 00:55:12,250
all the fucking trees that we've cut
down that alone. You know what I mean?

923
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,410
It's, um, all right. Anyways,

924
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:17,920
he says there was another
scientific study done.

925
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,450
If you believe in that kind of thing,

926
00:55:19,451 --> 00:55:24,451
that state's plastics will
outweigh fish in the ocean by 2050.

927
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,510
Yeah, I saw that.

928
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:29,380
I don't think that that's going to happen
because I have a feeling that mother

929
00:55:29,381 --> 00:55:33,790
nature has had enough with
us and will, you know,

930
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:37,150
when they keep predicting by 2090,

931
00:55:37,151 --> 00:55:41,950
the population will more than
fucking quintuple. I think that,

932
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,940
you know, we're already long past the
tipping point. Scientists have said,

933
00:55:45,941 --> 00:55:50,500
we're past the point where we can
even fix this fucking thing. So I,

934
00:55:50,501 --> 00:55:53,830
this is like when you can't do your
homework at some point you're like, mom,

935
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,990
and she comes down and helps you out. I
think Mother Nature is going to do that.

936
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:04,480
And uh, she's an old school mom and
she's going to slap the shit out of us.

937
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:07,143
Um,

938
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,960
but you don't need to
listen to me say this.

939
00:56:08,961 --> 00:56:12,200
Just listen to George Karl and he'll
tell you all about it. I'm all right.

940
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:12,561
He said,

941
00:56:12,561 --> 00:56:17,000
I guess these assholes assume there'll
be dead by then and don't give a shit.

942
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,360
Long time listening to hear, just
saw you in Indy back in October.

943
00:56:20,361 --> 00:56:24,700
I can share you. We aren't all ignorant
KKK or gym or say fancy. And I,

944
00:56:24,701 --> 00:56:27,490
you know, I just say that just
to fuck with you. Jesus Christ.

945
00:56:27,491 --> 00:56:28,930
I grew up outside of Boston.

946
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:32,590
Half the people in the clan would go
there and be like, all right, hey,

947
00:56:32,591 --> 00:56:37,090
take it easy. You know, I understand,
but easy. All right, thanks.

948
00:56:37,091 --> 00:56:40,810
And Go fuck yourself. And
then they sent me the, uh,

949
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:44,590
the unbelievably depressing
link, which I don't,

950
00:56:44,591 --> 00:56:46,990
I don't even go to them anymore.
I don't even go to many markers.

951
00:56:46,991 --> 00:56:48,730
All they do is depress me. All right?

952
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:52,570
Average amount of waste produced
by humans, Jesus Christ,

953
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:54,820
which is staring into this. Hey Bill,

954
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,920
I'm from Columbia and love your
podcast and your stand up comedy. Hey,

955
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:03,010
that's fucking great.
Oh, you're from Columbia.

956
00:57:03,011 --> 00:57:07,930
I thought you were down there listening.
I'm bored over. You're from there,

957
00:57:07,931 --> 00:57:09,400
right? You'll live there at some point.

958
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:14,140
You still listen to the podcast is
still cool. Uh, he goes, I'm the are.

959
00:57:14,141 --> 00:57:15,790
She goes, I don't know who
the fuck wrote is. He goes,

960
00:57:15,791 --> 00:57:20,290
the other day I was wondering how much
poop is produced by humans on a daily

961
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:24,640
basis. And I did a little research on
the Internet and some calculations,

962
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:28,750
which I would like to share with
you and your audience. Okay?

963
00:57:28,751 --> 00:57:33,250
According to the world fact book,
the world population consists

964
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:39,390
of 7 billion, 174,000, 611.

965
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,780
Wait a minute. Why don't let

966
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,173
7,174,611,584 people,

967
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:53,250
and the average human being
weighs around 62 kilograms. Oh,

968
00:57:53,251 --> 00:57:56,430
you motherfucker. I want to know what
that is in pounds I wagon. I gotta.

969
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,620
I gotta switch that over. I want
to see where the fuck I'm at.

970
00:57:59,760 --> 00:57:59,860
Okay.

971
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:04,090
Wait, what did you just say?
62 what do you guys think?

972
00:58:04,091 --> 00:58:07,350
The average person who, I haven't say the
average person weighs about a hundred.

973
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:11,020
A lot of starving people.
I've got 162 pounds.

974
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:12,730
Okay.

975
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,460
What he's what he's
saying here. All right. 62

976
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:19,703
and

977
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,200
oh, B s. All right.

978
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,490
Okay.

979
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:27,820
That's equal to 136 pounds. Holy Shit.

980
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:29,603
Okay.

981
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,660
God Damn it. There's a lot of small
or starving people in the world.

982
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,153
Okay.

983
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,960
All right. Now, the average,
that means I am right now,

984
00:58:37,961 --> 00:58:41,500
I'm like 40 pounds over the average
and the average human being. All right.

985
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:46,950
Now the daily average for stool crows is
one ounce per 12 pounds of body weight,

986
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:55,680
which means the average
person pope's 11.39 ounces.

987
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,620
Therefore, each day the planet receives

988
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:06,710
2,295,876 metric tons of shit,

989
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:13,370
but since the average stool is
75% water too, this is gross,

990
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:18,030
it will be safe to say that humans produce

991
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:25,820
1,721,000 hundred seven metric tons
of poop every day. Jesus Christ,

992
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,660
you really taken all the fun out of
this podcast to put this in perspective.

993
00:59:30,661 --> 00:59:32,190
I think you put it into perspective,

994
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:37,380
but he's going to keep going at the
empire state building weighs 350,000 tons,

995
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:44,100
so human beings puked the equivalent of
five giant turds the size of the empire

996
00:59:44,141 --> 00:59:47,590
state building. If we add
farts to the equation,

997
00:59:47,591 --> 00:59:49,300
this fucking dude is all in

998
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:55,620
the average person farts
17 times a day. That's it.

999
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,760
Try eating a salad. Fucking
double your numbers.

1000
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:03,600
You Break Dan Marino's
record times 17 times a day,

1001
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:08,460
producing a litter, a liter
of Fart in total or litter.

1002
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:12,360
L, I. T. T. E. R. That's
a litter of Fart in total,

1003
01:00:12,361 --> 01:00:15,720
which gives a new meaning
to a breathing fresh air.

1004
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:21,220
I have included the links
where I got the information

1005
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,390
at the end of this email.

1006
01:00:24,391 --> 01:00:27,550
And when you think about it on top
of eating our own rollerblades,

1007
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:30,060
we're eating our own shit. By the way,

1008
01:00:30,061 --> 01:00:33,450
everything you read or hear
about Columbia is true.

1009
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:39,060
That go have a meaningful experience
with yourself. Let me go. Oh,

1010
01:00:39,061 --> 01:00:42,690
that means go fuck yourself. Ah,
this guy's a clever son of a bitch.

1011
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:47,610
Um, Jesus Christ. Well,
you know what? Hey,

1012
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,780
how about I end the podcast with
what I promised to do last week,

1013
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:55,170
which is I was gonna start reading
segments from the Bible. Now granted,

1014
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,840
I don't own a Bible. All right,

1015
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:02,130
let's start with John Three
16 because I'm a sports fan.

1016
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,410
John Three

1017
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:10,950
68 he sat it onto you with,

1018
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,451
all right,

1019
01:01:12,451 --> 01:01:17,451
John Three 16 for God so loved the world
that he gave his only his one and only

1020
01:01:17,761 --> 01:01:22,290
son, that whoever believes
in him shall not perish,

1021
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:25,830
perish, but have eternal life.
Well, that's straight forward.

1022
01:01:25,831 --> 01:01:29,880
He let his kid die. So as long as
you believe that that happened,

1023
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,380
you will not die. You will have
eternal life. You will live forever.

1024
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:37,920
Think about that forever.

1025
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:45,060
You know you have has been at the DMV.
Just imagine that. Except it never ends,

1026
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:50,170
right. What the fuck would you do forever?

1027
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:56,690
There's no way that that's
fucking true. You know,

1028
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,700
movies don't go on forever.

1029
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:04,200
Planets don't go on forever or
livable. Planets don't go on forever.

1030
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:07,960
I'll fuck. This is why I don't
read the Bible and I, sorry,

1031
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:10,280
I don't fucking get all right,
let's, let's, let's, uh,

1032
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:14,060
let's just look up Bible
passages. Bib. Ellie,

1033
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:18,110
it'd be funny if this actually
got me back to going to church.

1034
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:21,870
I still loved going to church. You
know what I mean? I still like going,

1035
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:26,700
you know, Gabe and my dad, JJ has cries.

1036
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:30,630
There's die for Ross and his [inaudible].

1037
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:32,150
Mm.

1038
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,440
From the dead. Alright.

1039
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:38,470
Encouraging Bible Verses Hope
Bible Verses Bible verses,

1040
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:44,220
but friendships, Bible
verses. Let's give hope.

1041
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:50,060
Encouraging. Well, when a fuck is it? Ah,

1042
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,840
I just wanted to open it like
the phone book, the Bible.

1043
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:56,480
I'm gonna look up the Bible.
Please read the Bible,

1044
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:02,700
www free bible on your
phone. I don't want it.

1045
01:03:02,701 --> 01:03:06,900
I want it on my fucking screen. I
want amber. No. What? Cheeseburger.

1046
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:14,610
Visual Kim James Bible.
Commit thy way unto the Lord.

1047
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:19,590
Trust also in him and he shall
bring it to pass. Bring one

1048
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:24,120
commit day way unto the Lord. All right,

1049
01:03:24,121 --> 01:03:27,840
so walk in the general direction
of the Lord. Trust also in him,

1050
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:31,590
while if I'm walking towards a marinade,
isn't that trusting him? Winning.

1051
01:03:31,591 --> 01:03:33,890
I'm creeping up on him anyway, man.

1052
01:03:33,891 --> 01:03:38,700
Just making sure everything's cool
and walking your way. But you know,

1053
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,680
just wave your white flag.

1054
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:42,750
Okay.

1055
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:45,180
Don't open a trap door
when I get there dude.

1056
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:48,090
And he shall bring it to pass.

1057
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,120
Okay,

1058
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,040
Genesis. Oh, I remember reading this.

1059
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:56,380
It like makes sense for like
three fucking sentences.

1060
01:03:56,381 --> 01:03:58,510
And then you just like
what? In the beginning,

1061
01:03:58,511 --> 01:04:00,280
God created the heaven and the earth

1062
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:06,160
and the earth was without form and void
and darkness was upon the face of the

1063
01:04:06,161 --> 01:04:07,900
deep period.

1064
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:12,610
The deep what and the spirit of God
moved upon. That's like when they go,

1065
01:04:12,611 --> 01:04:14,050
you know, they got to eat up some clock.

1066
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:20,630
Darkness was upon the face of the deep
and the spirit of God moved upon the face

1067
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:25,570
of the waters. I thought there wasn't any

1068
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:29,150
that there wasn't any
water, wasn't anything.

1069
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:32,750
How was the water for his
face to be on? And God said,

1070
01:04:32,751 --> 01:04:35,960
let there be light and there
was light. Let that be.

1071
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:40,310
There was sound. Is this
Bon Scott? God said,

1072
01:04:40,311 --> 01:04:43,100
let there be light and there was light.
Well what was he doing before that?

1073
01:04:43,101 --> 01:04:46,430
He was just sitting in the
darkness all by himself.

1074
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,080
Just one day he's laying there
going, I'm going to make some shit.

1075
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,270
And God saw the light

1076
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:00,040
that it was good and God divided
the light from the darkness.

1077
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:04,630
God called the light days like Cam
Newton. Everything's about the same guy.

1078
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:09,970
I'll tell you right now, nobody's
having more fun than God making Earth.

1079
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:13,630
He's like a kid in the candy store that
doesn't exist and kids don't exist cause

1080
01:05:13,631 --> 01:05:17,890
he hadn't made it yet.
Oh fuck this genesis.

1081
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,293
Okay,

1082
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:24,160
let's look up job. Let's
see what old job had to say.

1083
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:29,300
Where the fuck is he? Well, let's read
Titus. That's the name of a comic I know.

1084
01:05:29,301 --> 01:05:31,190
How about that? Alright, Paul,

1085
01:05:31,191 --> 01:05:34,730
a servant of God and an
apostle of Jesus Christ

1086
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:40,430
according to the faith of God's elect
and the acknowledging of the truth,

1087
01:05:40,431 --> 01:05:42,140
which is after godliness.

1088
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:45,700
I feel like somebody is
trying to sell me a car. Oh,

1089
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,230
that was all one sentence
in hope of eternal life,

1090
01:05:49,231 --> 01:05:52,440
which God that cannot lie
promised before the world began.

1091
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:58,540
Dude, this is like the the like
God called everything you know,

1092
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:00,010
before you even born and all that.

1093
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,820
But half in do times manifested
his word to you know,

1094
01:06:03,821 --> 01:06:06,130
and I thought this would be a funny
bit, this is just fucking annoying.

1095
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,970
But half the do times manifested
his word through preaching,

1096
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:14,290
which is committed unto me according
to the commandment of God, our savior.

1097
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:18,790
It's just, it just goes in circles to
Titus, my own son. After the common faith,

1098
01:06:18,791 --> 01:06:19,780
he had another kid,

1099
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:24,700
he had Jesus and he
had Titus grace, mercy,

1100
01:06:24,701 --> 01:06:29,640
and peace. Who are they as grace?

1101
01:06:29,641 --> 01:06:31,410
Grace did. Was she another virgin?

1102
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:33,810
How many times is it going to use
this virgin? Think he banged them

1103
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:36,420
right?

1104
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:40,570
He had Jesus with Mary and then grace
was his fucking side piece and he had

1105
01:06:40,571 --> 01:06:41,860
Titus. All right.

1106
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:43,240
Okay.

1107
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:48,240
For this cause left ID and Crete that
thou should have set in order the things

1108
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:53,620
that are wanting in orders. Elders
in every city as I appointed thee,

1109
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:59,020
if any, be blameless. The husband of
one wife having faithful children,

1110
01:06:59,021 --> 01:07:01,090
not accused of riot or unruly.

1111
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:07,320
It's not a sentence or maybe
it was back then. You know,

1112
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:13,760
if I get judged someday, you know, and,
and God's standing there and being like,

1113
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:15,410
I just spoke to it. I, you
know, I tried to get through.

1114
01:07:15,411 --> 01:07:17,390
I try to get through the book.
I don't know what to tell you

1115
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:20,700
as far as I can see, it's
a bunch of fragments.

1116
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:22,850
All right?

1117
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,540
They're not complete thoughts. You know,

1118
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,210
you can't write just because you put a
period at the end of it doesn't make it a

1119
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:29,044
sentence.

1120
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,273
Right?

1121
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:36,410
That's a podcast for this week. Once
again, congratulations to the Broncos.

1122
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,860
Congratulations to the lady who got
a job. I'm gonna end this positive.

1123
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:44,060
Gradually says to the lady who got
the job there at the buffalo bills.

1124
01:07:44,061 --> 01:07:46,940
I'm sure you're going to do a great
job. I'm just a grumpy old fucking man.

1125
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:51,470
His team lost. All right.
Congratulations to the panthers. Um,

1126
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:55,280
I look forward to seeing
Cam Newton, you know,

1127
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,530
play against Peyton manning.
It's going to be great.

1128
01:07:57,531 --> 01:08:01,460
I love that he called him the
sheriff. Um, I thought that was cool.

1129
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:07,010
You know, the best of the old versus the
best of the new. So I'm an old fucker,

1130
01:08:07,011 --> 01:08:11,240
so I'm gonna have to root. I got a
group for P, uh, the Denver Broncos,

1131
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:14,930
the AFC and Peyton
manning. Um, even though I,

1132
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,080
the panthers and I love the way they
fucking play in their defenses to shit.

1133
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:23,270
And um, I don't know. I just hope
it's a good game. I hope the panthers,

1134
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:26,060
if they're gonna win or the Broncos,

1135
01:08:26,061 --> 01:08:28,400
I just don't want anybody beating
the fuck out of anybody. Right.

1136
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,810
But I will tell you as always, I
will be watching it by myself. Okay.

1137
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,870
I'm not going to, I might go to a
Superbowl party cause my team's out it,

1138
01:08:35,871 --> 01:08:36,740
but I don't think so.

1139
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:41,290
I want to see Peyton's last game and
I hope it goes out like Elway and a,

1140
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:45,650
I'm going to do what I always do. All
right, I'm going to tape the game.

1141
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:50,300
You let it go for a good
90 minutes. As I mentioned,

1142
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:55,040
you shut your phone off. You get the
grill going, you crack a couple of beers,

1143
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:57,570
you know, you make
yourself a burger or two,

1144
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:59,620
you invite a couple of
friends over and then he guy,

1145
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:03,400
let's sit down and watch it. And you
blow through all the fucking beginning in

1146
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:06,060
the hope of the

1147
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:09,230
brave ride bump kickoff. And there we go.

1148
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:11,690
Blow through all the fucking commercials.

1149
01:09:11,691 --> 01:09:14,770
Fast forward through Beyonce
lip sinking during halftime.

1150
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:19,040
You get caught up halfway through
the third fucking quarter. And uh,

1151
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:22,820
and if there were any cool commercials
that you missed, you have them recorded,

1152
01:09:22,821 --> 01:09:25,070
but someone's going to put
them up online anyways.

1153
01:09:25,071 --> 01:09:26,360
You're not going to miss a fucking thing.

1154
01:09:26,361 --> 01:09:30,590
And you can watch the Superbowl and about,
I dunno, you can watch it about two,

1155
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:34,070
two hours and 20 minutes, two
hours, two and a half hours.

1156
01:09:34,071 --> 01:09:37,910
It's fucking tremendous. All
right. God bless you guys yet,

1157
01:09:37,911 --> 01:09:42,620
go fuck yourselves and I'll
check on Thursday. All right.
