00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.770
Brenda Mae Tarpley (a.k.a. Brenda Lee and
“Little Miss Dynamite”) was born to an

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.070
extremely poor family in December of 1944.
Things took a turn for the worse when her

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.080
father, a onetime semi-pro baseball player
and carpenter, died in a construction accident

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.849
in May of 1953 when she was 8 years old.

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.489
Within two years of this happening, the 10
year old girl started taking over her deceased

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.390
father’s role as the primary bread winner
of the family, with frequent performances

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.350
on various TV and radio shows, as well as
in record shops- then her big break happened

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.260
when she sang in front of future Country Music
Hall of Famer Clyde “Red” Foley, who sold

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.829
over 25 million records in his lifetime, a
feat Brenda Lee would easily surpass.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.150
At the time, Foley was hosting a new show
called Ozark Jubilee, a country music and

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.310
performance show. Lee was a huge fan of Foley,
so decided to go meet him as he was on tour

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.229
promoting his TV show in her home town. Without
them ever hearing her sing, a local DJ, “Peanut”

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.560
Faircloth, convinced Foley and his promoter
to let little Brenda open the show with one

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.200
song, Hank Williams’ Jambalaya, which she
added her own little twist to by speeding

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.040
up the tempo and rapidly starting and stopping
her voice during certain words of the song.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.040
(You can see a short bit of her performing
this song when she’s 16 here or as an adult

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.040
here, or a phenomenal mashup of a bunch of
snippets of her early performances here).

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.740
Foley said this of hearing the 10 year old
Lee in that performance,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.049
I still get cold chills thinking about the
first time I heard that voice. One foot started

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.860
patting rhythm as though she was stomping
out a prairie fire but not another muscle

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.460
in that little body even as much as twitched.
And when she did that trick of breaking her

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.329
voice, it jarred me out of my trance enough
to realize I’d forgotten to get off the

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.820
stage. There I stood, after 26 years of supposedly
learning how to conduct myself in front of

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.520
an audience, with my mouth open two miles
wide and a glassy stare in my eyes…

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.099
The way I stood back and enjoyed watching
her work, I felt guilty for not going out

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.410
to the box office and buying a ticket.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.900
Even though she was slated to just do one
song, the crowd called for an encore and she

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.660
performed three more before leaving the stage.
Foley signed her that night to a 5 year contract

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.390
and she became a fixture on his show, which
became her platform for vaulting into super-stardom.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.700
Three years later, at the age of 13 in 1958,
Lee recorded what today is the song she’s

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.209
probably best known for (though she had numerous
hits throughout her career), Rockin’ Around

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.019
the Christmas Tree. The song was written by
Johnny Marks who, despite being Jewish, wrote

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.300
several hit Christmas songs besides that one
(Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Run Rudolph

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.599
Run, A Holly Jolly Christmas, The Most Wonderful
Day of the Year, etc.).

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.980
Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree mostly
flopped upon its initial release, selling

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.620
just 5,000 copies. The next year, they released
the song a second time and it again flopped,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.159
selling just over what it did on its initial
release. It finally started to gain some traction

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.620
the next year as Brenda Lee’s fame began
to skyrocket, managing to rise as high as

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.010
number 14 on the Hot 100 Pop Singles list.
Within 5 years of that, it went as high as

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.849
number 3 on that same list. By the song’s
50th anniversary in 2008, Brenda Lee’s original

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:33.709
version of it had sold over 25 million copies,
including about 700,000 digital copies, making

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.780
it the 4th most digital downloads sold of
any Christmas single.
