00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,980
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich Radiolab. The podcast. Yes,

2
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:08,490
and today on the podcast we're going to
present a story that a whole thing is an

3
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:10,290
accident, really. The category podcast,

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,400
we were on tour a few months ago doing
this symmetry thing in San Francisco and

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,300
right as we were there,

6
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:19,650
we got an email from a woman who lives
there telling us this new nutty story.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,670
Something odd had happened to her
and she wanted to share it with us,

8
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:25,560
so he met her in the lobby. I missed,

9
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:27,660
I didn't hit the record
button fast enough.

10
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:28,950
Could you just tell me your name again?

11
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:33,030
And My name is lysis Schonfeld and I'm
a research technician at the Gladstone

12
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:35,520
institute at the University
of California San Francisco.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,880
Now Lysa is just getting started
with her scientific career,

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,910
finishing my undergraduate degree
about a year and a half ago,

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,080
and this story takes place as she was
about to take that next step after college

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,540
and apply to Grad schools. The Star
of our story other than of course,

17
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,970
Lizer herself, is a little
mischievous part of her brain. Well,

18
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,540
everyone's brain, your brain called
the Basal Ganglia, the Basal Ganglia,

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,340
which is a time she'd been studying
just so we understand basil and Ganglia,

20
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:06,310
so Bazell is not the a thing from
which Pesto is made. In your case,

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,410
what does Bazell mean about that? Okay,

22
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,460
let's go to go on to Ganglia. You know,
collections of neurons, big collections.

23
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:16,590
So basically Langley has a
fairly large part of your brain.

24
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,470
It's actually this big hunk deep in
the center and it's responsible for

25
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:23,010
controlling and coordinating movement.
When I move my neck back and forth,

26
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:27,360
am I using my Basal Ganglia? Yeah. When
I wink can by using my basal Ganglia.

27
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,380
When I make an expression in my
face, I'm using my Bazell testimony.

28
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,960
What about if I'm reading a, the
New Yorker, I don't think so.

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,670
Apologies to the New
Yorker and its employees,

30
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,990
but is this part of your brain is really
basic and at the lab where she was

31
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:40,824
working,

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,000
they had figured out this particular
Basal Ganglia trick using this really cool

33
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:48,180
technology called optogenetics. Maybe
trick isn't quite the right word.

34
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:50,760
What they'd done is they'd found
a way to take a mouse thread,

35
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,360
a little fiber optic cable through
its skull deep into its brain,

36
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,480
into its base with ganglion so
that when you shine a blue laser,

37
00:01:57,481 --> 00:01:59,610
literally we just shine
lasers and a mouse brains.

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,480
They could actually turn it's basal
Ganglia or parts of it on or off.

39
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,640
When this is in a live mouse,
this isn't a live mouse.

40
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:08,580
So we have these really cool videos
showing a mouse running around having a

41
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:13,200
great mouse time. You turn the light on,

42
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,950
we can get them to free
in mid-stride. Yeah,

43
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,030
so you hit the laser and boom,
the mouse stop out just like this.

44
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,070
So use those lights. They're like puppet
ties the mouse. If you're this mouse,

45
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:29,860
no matter how hard you try, feet move,

46
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,230
as long as that light is on,
come on fool. You can't do it.

47
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,470
Lysa is holding the strings. Not Exactly.

48
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:40,290
It turns out she doesn't get to play with
the laser that much. I'm kind of like,

49
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,720
I'm the bottom of the totem pole,
so I do a lot of pipe heading.

50
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,970
It's like where you squirt
liquid from one tube to another.

51
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:49,290
I'm working at my pipe padding,
we're getting the thumb muscles. Oh,

52
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,570
I could beat anyone in that
wrestling competition right now.

53
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,730
So at a certain point she was like,

54
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,620
enough of this time for me to apply
to Grad school. I applied to five,

55
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,800
university of California,
San Diego, University of
Washington and Seattle U CSF,

56
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,780
Rockefeller University and Harvard.
Cause you're going big. Yeah, go bigger.

57
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,290
Go home. Right. So she hits
off to her first interview.

58
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,860
University of Washington went great.
I loved it. Okay. I went to Penn,

59
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,890
university of Pennsylvania,
went down to UCFC in San Diego.

60
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,640
It's a beautiful place, great scientists.

61
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:22,990
It's actually the largest neuroscience
community in the world. So far so good.

62
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,090
Did you ever go back to San
Francisco where we are now?

63
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,010
This is where things get strange. Yes.

64
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:31,090
So my last interview,

65
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,750
my very last interview was at UCF
and she says about a week before that

66
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:37,990
interview I got really sick. So I
think it was some kind of stomach flu,

67
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:39,490
but it was pretty severe nausea.

68
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:42,790
I wasn't really able to eat or do
anything and throwing up. Yeah,

69
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,350
I'll all sorts of, I don't know.

70
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,700
I had some bad dim some the weekend
before that could have been.

71
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,840
She goes to the doctor,

72
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,480
he gives her some pills to fight the
nausea and then the next day was my

73
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:55,450
interview. Friday was my
interview. So I went, you know,

74
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,180
there's a nice introduction. They
give you a breakfast. This point.

75
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,530
She's pretty familiar
with the whole routine.

76
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,290
Generally the way these interviews are
structured is that we talk a little bit

77
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,500
about my research and dopamine and
the Basal Ganglia and these mice,

78
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,770
they tell her about their work. I have
to think of a couple of woody questions.

79
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:10,770
I asked my questions.
What's a really question?

80
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,450
What are the science questions? What
are you saying? Nevermind. Anyhow,

81
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:21,130
she's raring to go and she heads into
meet her first Basal Ganglia Titian of the

82
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,080
day and he studies, um,

83
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,410
one of the things he studies is
dopamine in the Basal Ganglia.

84
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,890
He study stuff that's a little bit more
molecular than what I, what I know.

85
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,830
But we had a good conversation
about dopamine and at this
point in the day I was

86
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:36,100
feeling okay. Then I went
to my second interview,

87
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,440
which is this woman that I
was so excited to talk to.

88
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,030
Her name is Alison Dope and she's pretty
well known. Alison Dope. Alison Dope.

89
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,860
Wow. She studies dopamine,
she studies songbirds,

90
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,520
which is what lies I've really wanted to
study. So birds have basic English too.

91
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,530
So she's pretty fired up and kind of
in the beginning of that interview, my,

92
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,440
my face started to feel a
little bit strange and I was
wearing glasses that day.

93
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,410
So what I felt was happening was
that my glasses were, you know,

94
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:05,620
your glasses get loose and they kind
of start to slip down your nose and you

95
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:09,400
have to kind of tighten the muscles
around your ears to try and keep your

96
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:12,460
glasses on. So we were talking and
I just kept on feeling like, God,

97
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:13,780
why can't I stop tightening that?

98
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,520
It was Kinda got to the point where it
started to distract me, but I felt okay.

99
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,510
Then we went to lunch and this was a
lunch with all the current students and a

100
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:25,630
lot of the current faculty and
all the prospective students.

101
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,510
And at lunch I remember
on the walk to lunch,

102
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,700
my head just started spontaneously
turning to the right, like,

103
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,860
like I like I would be trying to sit
here and face you and I would just turn

104
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:40,540
over here and face Robert t. It was such
a funny thing. And you're like, no, no,

105
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,820
don't do that. Exactly what was happening?

106
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:45,100
I was trying to send signals to
my neck being like, all right,

107
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,320
sitting here having lunch
with an important professor.

108
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:50,830
Why don't you just face him, talk to him
and instead I'm just turning over here,

109
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,020
turning over here, turning over here.
Oh, you're turning a fairly wide art.

110
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,190
Yeah. You're turning away.
Yeah. Professor. Oh, I remember,

111
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,860
I remember at one point in lunch turning
my chair like this so I could see

112
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,490
a sign. A permanent
side. Long Glance. Yeah,

113
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,480
but you figured it's not that painful,
so it must just be a cramp or something.

114
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:14,750
I'm kind of thinking. Oh, okay.
So I slept funny last night.

115
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:18,350
I must've slept on a weird angle on
my pillow. Now I'm having a net cramp.

116
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,470
My glasses are loose. I just
gotta tighten the glasses,

117
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,410
everything under control. So, so then I,

118
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:28,190
after lunch was going to go to my third
interview was with Alison dopes husband

119
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:31,430
who also studies songbirds. So he's
familiar with the Basal Ganglia too.

120
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,560
They meet up to walk over
to his office together.

121
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,860
And so I explained to him on the walk
over, I think I'm having neck cramps.

122
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,830
Would it be possible maybe
to try and get a hot pad?

123
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,460
He's so sure I may track
one down, but on the walk,

124
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:45,680
not only now just my neck
start turning to the right,

125
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:49,740
but it's snapping itself back in
voluntarily. My head snapping back light.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,910
Suddenly your eyes are pointing up at
the sky. And then as I'm talking to him,

127
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:55,290
I'm realizing that I can't
control my eyebrows from,

128
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,730
from raising pretty tightly. So I
look like you're doing right now.

129
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,830
Like I'm doing like deep
surprise, constant deeps.

130
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,640
I can't stop it. I look surprised at
everything I'm saying and I can't stop it.

131
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,600
So after the eyebrows start and
I can't pull them back down then,

132
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,380
then the mouth, then all this area
starts to go lower to face. Yes.

133
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:19,610
What is it doing? It turns into
this really twisted, painful,

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,810
grimacing smile. Would you mind?

135
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,780
I'll demo it. Okay. So I've got the neck,

136
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,990
it's like this crane back eyebrows
wrote like this total surprise,

137
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
like this crazy Frankenstein face

138
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,980
demeanor for graduate interview. No,

139
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,310
it's not going well and I'm
noticing that something is be,

140
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,420
I think at that point he thought I was
just really excited to be talking about

141
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:51,880
neuroscience and I'm just trying
to think, okay. Mouth, like try,

142
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,220
try and just calm down a little
bit. And it was pretty painful too.

143
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:58,930
I mean it was like, imagine like a
Charlie horse in your face. Oh yeah.

144
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,560
But she gets through the interview
and I actually do okay. You know,

145
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,220
he asked me tough questions about
science and I can answer him I think.

146
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,250
And I leave the interview and then I
met by the woman who's the head of the

147
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:14,770
admissions weekend and she took one
look at Lysa and she said, hi. You know,

148
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:17,840
I don't know if you should do the rest
of the interviews and with her as my

149
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:22,160
student host decides, alright, let me
just call my dad, just saying, Hey dad,

150
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:24,800
I'm in the middle of an interview and
someone kind of funny is happening with my

151
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:25,910
face. I can't control it.

152
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,310
And while I'm talking to him I lose
control of my mouth and my tongue so I

153
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,970
can't, I can kind of talk,
but it's, it's pretty bad.

154
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,820
Yeah. Is Your Dad a doctor? No. Imagine
your kid calling you being like,

155
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,320
I'm losing control of my face.

156
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,210
And as they're telling you that I started
to think something's really wrong.

157
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:53,360
And then my student host comes rushing
back in running and he looks at me and he

158
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:55,130
tries to put on a calm face and he says,

159
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,840
so now we need to go
to the emergency room.

160
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,170
So they throw into a taxi
and in the taxi it went from,

161
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:02,820
I can't control my mouth to a complete,

162
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,820
I mean a complete the all seat
of a torque. I did not look good.

163
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,630
As we're pulling up to the emergency room
is when my throat started tightening.

164
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,810
They rushed her inside and
they have me in a Gurney,

165
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,920
in a room in the back of
the Er, surrounded by six
people. Within two minutes,

166
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,420
doctors swarming all around her oxygen
mask. EKG leads all over my chest.

167
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,780
They do an ivy and then she's lying there
on the table and she's thinking like,

168
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:30,660
what's wrong with me? Why
can't I control my throat?

169
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:32,940
Why can't I control my body?
And I just, I couldn't.

170
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,360
I remember frantically sending messages
like, you got to cut this out now,

171
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,830
but she wasn't in control
and it turned out okay.

172
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:41,450
[inaudible]

173
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,640
the wild. She was going from
interview to interview to interview,

174
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:47,690
talking about how her lab had taken
these little Macy's and seize control of

175
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,960
their Basal Ganglia. The
composition that I took,

176
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:54,950
that nausea drug was actually affecting
the dopamine systems and my basal

177
00:09:54,951 --> 00:09:56,510
Ganglia. In other words,

178
00:09:56,511 --> 00:10:00,890
that drug had been doing to her pretty
much with what she'd been doing to those

179
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,680
mice. One to 2% of people
who take composition.

180
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,290
They can have what's
called an acute dystonia,

181
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,350
which is what happened to me
during all those interviews.

182
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,070
And the crazy thing is the guy that I
talked to first in the morning was the

183
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,340
molecular dopamine guy. You know, how
does dopamine get packed in the vesicles?

184
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:17,240
How does it get released?

185
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,450
And it wasn't until I started talking
with a more systems level people who

186
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:23,720
studied the behavioral output of the
Basal Ganglia that I started to have

187
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:25,490
behavioral deficits in my Basal Ganglia.

188
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,860
So your Basal Ganglia are testing the
San Francisco docs and they are failing

189
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,440
[inaudible] yeah, you can get into
San Francisco state. I just CSF CSF.

190
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,330
No, no. Oh Hm. Damn it. Basal Ganglia,

191
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,020
we should probably tell everybody
that lies is obviously doing okay.

192
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:48,050
Back in the Er when the doctors
finally figured out what was going on,

193
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,420
they just gave her some Benadryl of all
things and actually within 20 minutes I

194
00:10:53,421 --> 00:10:54,740
was feeling a lot better.

195
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,370
She could breathe her face it
unclenched and we asked her,

196
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,660
how has this little adventure
changed you? Uh, she said, well,

197
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,290
I'm still working with those mice cause
when we talk to her Grad school hadn't

198
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,500
started yet. And now when I go
into that room with a little laser,

199
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,960
I go in now and I just
really, I empathize with them.

200
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,050
Come a little catch. This would just be
for a couple of minutes. You can do it.

201
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,790
Yeah. I'm thinking a lot about that.

202
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,393
[inaudible]

203
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,670

candidate at the University of Washington
