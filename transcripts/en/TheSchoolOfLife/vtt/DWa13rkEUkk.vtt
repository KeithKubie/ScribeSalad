00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.620
Lying in bed late at night or waiting at the
platform for the commuter train home, we often

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.110
daydream about where it would be so much nicer
to be: perhaps the beaches of Goa on India’s

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.610
west coast, a little restaurant by a quiet
canal in Venice, the highway near Big Sur

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.400
in California or maybe the Faroe islands,
far to the north of Scotland. The desire to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.340
travel is, almost always, sparked by a picture
or two: a couple of mental snapshots that

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.620
encapsulate all that seems most alluring about
a destination. A trip lasting many hours and

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.910
costing what could be a small fortune may
be initiated by nothing grander or more examined

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.239
than one or two mental postcards. We travel
because of a background belief that, of course,

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.790
the reality of a scene must be nicer than
the evanescent mental images that take us

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.460
there. But there is something about the way
our minds work that we would do well to study

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.660
before we ever pack a suitcase: mental images
are momentary. That is, they last, at best,

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.280
three seconds. When we imagine a scene, we
imagine not a film but, that far briefer and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.380
in many ways far more forgiving medium, a
picture. And yet, we are never in a destination

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.120
just for a moment and that brute fact alone
may be enough to cause grievous damage to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.210
the hopes that transport us far from home.
We know the phenomenon well enough at the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.189
cinema. Imagine if in the course of a story,
the screen were filled with a sublime view

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:46.979
of ocean waves crashing against a craggy headland.
We might sigh with desire at such splendour.

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.580
But if the camera started to linger on the
scene, we might rapidly grow twitchy. What

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.961
is fabulous in increments of seconds can become
properly maddening after half a minute. Two

00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:05.770
minutes in, we may be so irritated as to be
ready to leave our seats. It’s not that

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.160
we’re ungrateful or shallow, rather that
we absorb beauty quickly and then want to

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.460
move on. Beauty is like a brilliant joke:
we laugh, but don’t need the comic element

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.590
to be continuously replayed. The lovely mental
pictures that get us to travel are – in

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.510
essence – hugely edited versions of what
we actually encounter in any destination.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.120
We will, eventually, certainly see these pictures,
but we will also see so much else, so much

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.599
that is painful or boring, dispiriting or
mundane: hours of footage of the stained airline

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.569
seat ahead of us, the back of the taxi driver’s
head, the wall of the cheap hotel, a framed

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.450
photograph of Marilyn Monroe on the wall of
a little local restaurant… Furthermore,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.069
there will always be something else on the
lens between us and the destination we’d

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.750
come for, something so tricky and oppressive
as to undermine the whole purpose of having

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.849
left home in the first place, namely: ourselves.
We will, by an unavoidable error, bring ourselves

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.000
along to every destination we’d ever wanted
to enjoy. And that will mean bringing along

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.659
so much of the mental baggage that makes being
us so intolerably problematic day to day:

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:34.700
all the anxiety, regret, confusion, guilt,
irritability and despair. None of this smear

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.489
of the self is there when we picture a trip
from home. In the imagination, we can enjoy

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.879
unsullied views. But there, at the foot of
the golden temple or high up on the pine-covered

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:53.800
mountain, we stand to find that there is so
much of ‘us’ intruding on our vistas.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.830
We ruin our trips by a fateful habit of taking
ourselves along on them. There’s a tragi-comic

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.500
irony at work: the vast labour of getting
ourselves physically to a place won’t necessarily

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.159
get us any closer to the essence of what we’d
been seeking. As airlines, hotel chains and

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:22.400
travel magazines conspire never to tell us,
in daydreaming of the ideal location, we may

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.160
have already enjoyed the very best that any
place has to offer us.
