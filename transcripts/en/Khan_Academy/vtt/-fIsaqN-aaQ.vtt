00:00:00.303 --> 00:00:02.630
- So we've seen in the
last few videos if we start

00:00:02.063 --> 00:00:04.682
with a logistic differential equation

00:00:05.787 --> 00:00:10.566
where we have r which is
essentially is a constant

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.582
that says how fast our we growing

00:00:12.582 --> 00:00:15.673
when we're unconstrained
by environmental limits.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:17.713
Then we have K which we can view

00:00:17.713 --> 00:00:21.685
as the maximum population
given our constraints.

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.168
We saw that if we wanted to solve this,

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:25.488
and we didn't want one
of the constant solutions

00:00:25.488 --> 00:00:26.640
of N of T is equal to zero,

00:00:26.064 --> 00:00:27.863
or N of T is equal to K,

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.867
and we did this in the last few videos.

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:35.062
We got the solution that N of T is equal

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.219
to our initial N naught
times our maximum population.

00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:51.480
All of that over our initial population

00:00:53.844 --> 00:00:58.193
plus the difference between
our maximum population,

00:00:58.193 --> 00:01:00.340
and the initial population.

00:01:00.684 --> 00:01:05.684
So K minus N naught times
E to the negative rt.

00:01:18.782 --> 00:01:19.796
That this right over here.

00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:21.524
This logistic function.

00:01:21.524 --> 00:01:26.524
This logistic function is
a nonconstant solution,

00:01:28.256 --> 00:01:29.831
and it's the interesting one we care about

00:01:29.831 --> 00:01:31.639
if we're going to model population

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:36.258
to the logistic differential equation.

00:01:36.731 --> 00:01:39.495
So now that we've done all
that work to come up with this,

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:40.343
let's actually apply it.

00:01:40.343 --> 00:01:43.620
That was the whole goal, was
to model population growth.

00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:46.024
So let's come up with some assumptions.

00:01:47.046 --> 00:01:48.942
Let's first think about,

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.954
well let's say that I have an island.

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:54.296
So let's say that this is my island,

00:01:54.627 --> 00:01:59.627
and I start settling it with a 100 people.

00:02:00.027 --> 00:02:02.604
So I'm essentially saying N naught

00:02:02.847 --> 00:02:04.789
Let me do that in the N naught color.

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.297
So I'm saying N naught is equal to 100.

00:02:09.297 --> 00:02:10.342
Let's say that this environment,

00:02:10.747 --> 00:02:15.747
given current technology
of farming and agriculture,

00:02:15.921 --> 00:02:18.522
and the availability of
water and whatever else,

00:02:18.891 --> 00:02:23.891
let's say it can only
support 1,000 people max.

00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:32.591
So you get the idea, so
we get K is equal to 1000.

00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:36.591
That's the limit to the population.

00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:37.820
So now what we have to think about

00:02:37.082 --> 00:02:38.827
is what is r going to be?

00:02:39.565 --> 00:02:40.971
So we have to come up
with some assumptions.

00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:45.971
So, let's say in a generation
which is about 20 years,

00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:48.677
well I'll just assume in 20 years,

00:02:48.677 --> 00:02:51.205
yeah I think it's reasonable
that the population grows

00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:55.741
by, let's say that the
population grows by 50%.

00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:59.292
In 20 years you have 50% growth.

00:03:00.088 --> 00:03:05.088
50% increase, increase
in the actual population.

00:03:06.415 --> 00:03:08.510
So what would you have to
have your annual increase

00:03:09.365 --> 00:03:13.114
in order to after 20 years to grow by 50%.

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:15.684
Well to think about that
I'll get out my calculator.

00:03:16.471 --> 00:03:19.063
One way to think about it, growing by 50%,

00:03:19.063 --> 00:03:23.385
that means that you are at
1.5 your original population,

00:03:23.526 --> 00:03:25.994
and if I take that to the 120th power,

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.837
and we'll just do 1 divided by 20th.

00:03:29.978 --> 00:03:33.073
This essentially says how
much am I going to grow by

00:03:33.073 --> 00:03:36.185
or what is going to, this is telling me

00:03:36.185 --> 00:03:41.185
I'm going to grow by a factor
of 1.02 every year, 1.02048.

00:03:44.242 --> 00:03:46.327
So one way to think
about it is if every year

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:52.092
I grow by 0.020 I'll just
round five then over 20 years

00:04:08.987 --> 00:04:13.987
as this compounds I
will have grown by 50%.

00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:17.810
So that would be our r.

00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:20.252
This is essentially how much
we're going to grow each year.

00:04:20.987 --> 00:04:25.987
Let me write that, growth each year.

00:04:26.906 --> 00:04:29.915
We're going to assume
our t here is in years.

00:04:30.244 --> 00:04:34.350
So we're going to assume
that our t is in years.

00:04:34.915 --> 00:04:37.231
So t is in years.

00:04:37.813 --> 00:04:40.381
So what would our logistic
function look like,

00:04:40.674 --> 00:04:42.622
given all these assumptions?

00:04:42.635 --> 00:04:47.635
We would have N of T, let me N of T,

00:04:48.096 --> 00:04:53.096
is equal to, is equal to N naught times K.

00:04:54.447 --> 00:04:56.605
That's going to be 100 times 1000.

00:04:57.374 --> 00:05:02.374
So it's going to be 100 times 1000.

00:05:03.411 --> 00:05:06.608
My initial population
times my maximum population

00:05:06.077 --> 00:05:11.070
divided by my initial population,

00:05:15.388 --> 00:05:19.733
plus the difference between
my final and initial.

00:05:19.733 --> 00:05:22.065
So that's 1000 minus 100,
so that's going to be,

00:05:22.603 --> 00:05:24.701
this right over here is going to be 900.

00:05:25.004 --> 00:05:29.248
900 times e to the negative r.

00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:34.731
So the negative 0.0205 times t.

00:05:40.551 --> 00:05:43.158
So it will be equal to that,

00:05:43.407 --> 00:05:47.881
and to verify that this actually is,

00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:50.038
this actually does describe population

00:05:50.038 --> 00:05:50.964
in the that way we thought

00:05:50.964 --> 00:05:53.695
the logistic differential equation would

00:05:53.957 --> 00:05:55.423
let's actually plot it.

00:05:55.423 --> 00:05:58.048
So let me just pause this
video and then plot it.

00:05:58.663 --> 00:05:59.781
So there you go, I made a plot

00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:00.844
and I copy and pasted it here,

00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:06.398
and we see the behavior
that we wanted to see.

00:06:06.398 --> 00:06:10.599
We see the population right
over here at year zero,

00:06:10.678 --> 00:06:12.702
it's starting at 100.

00:06:12.918 --> 00:06:14.999
Let me do this in a color that
you're more likely to see.

00:06:15.988 --> 00:06:18.992
Population starts at
100, and we can see that,

00:06:18.992 --> 00:06:22.087
let's see after 20 years our population

00:06:22.087 --> 00:06:25.681
looks like it's almost grown to 150.

00:06:25.775 --> 00:06:27.962
So it looks like, at
least in the beginning,

00:06:27.962 --> 00:06:32.407
this term, this right
over here is dominating.

00:06:32.407 --> 00:06:37.407
We are growing by this .0205,
that would be 2.05% per year,

00:06:40.211 --> 00:06:43.129
which gets us close to 50% growth,

00:06:43.017 --> 00:06:44.933
and we see that's what
happening initially.

00:06:45.086 --> 00:06:48.120
So we go from 100 to 150
in the first 20 years,

00:06:48.012 --> 00:06:49.063
in the first generation.

00:06:49.063 --> 00:06:52.620
Then in the next generation
we should add another 75

00:06:53.187 --> 00:06:56.210
if we weren't being kind of
constrained by the environment.

00:06:56.417 --> 00:06:59.163
So 150 plus 75 would be 225,

00:06:59.467 --> 00:07:01.513
and it looks like we got
after 20 years to about 200.

00:07:01.927 --> 00:07:03.391
So we're a little bit slower.

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:05.058
We're a little bit slower than kind

00:07:05.058 --> 00:07:07.253
of the pure exponential growth.

00:07:07.253 --> 00:07:09.980
But the pure exponential
growth would probably

00:07:09.098 --> 00:07:13.249
have us tracking something closer to here,

00:07:14.354 --> 00:07:15.441
but still growing pretty well.

00:07:16.224 --> 00:07:18.224
But then as our population gets larger

00:07:18.224 --> 00:07:19.490
and larger and larger as we're getting

00:07:19.049 --> 00:07:20.941
closer and closer to
the maximum population,

00:07:21.382 --> 00:07:26.382
our rate of growth is approaching zero.

00:07:26.514 --> 00:07:30.008
So we constantly approach
our maximum population,

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:33.308
but we never quite get there.

00:07:33.308 --> 00:07:34.843
It's really an asymptote.

00:07:34.843 --> 00:07:37.620
We're just approaching it as
time goes on and on and on.

00:07:38.065 --> 00:07:40.002
But you can kind of set your own threshold

00:07:40.587 --> 00:07:42.210
and say ok, when do we get

00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:44.992
to kind of 90% of maximum population?

00:07:45.503 --> 00:07:47.097
That looks like that happens,

00:07:47.097 --> 00:07:50.163
90% of maximum population happened

00:07:50.163 --> 00:07:55.163
after 210 years on this island.

00:07:55.744 --> 00:07:57.183
So on a human scale that seems

00:07:57.183 --> 00:07:58.779
like a long time, many generations.

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:00.857
But, I guess in a cosmic
scale it's not that long.

00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:02.575
Not even a cosmic scale,

00:08:02.575 --> 00:08:04.656
even just slightly longer
than a human scale.

00:08:05.633 --> 00:08:10.198
So, it'll happen, well this
describes what's happening.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:12.065
So this is a pretty interesting model,

00:08:12.065 --> 00:08:14.638
and I'd be interested
to see how it compares

00:08:14.638 --> 00:08:17.933
with actual data out there
for actual population growth.

00:08:17.933 --> 00:08:21.951
With that said, it's not this you know,

00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:24.857
everything that we've done
so far has always assumed,

00:08:24.857 --> 00:08:28.945
we're kind of assuming this
idea of a Malthusian limit.

00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:31.598
But what we've learned from human history,

00:08:31.598 --> 00:08:35.287
that this Malthusian limit
seems to keep getting pushed

00:08:35.287 --> 00:08:39.029
higher and higher based on
the improvement of technology.

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:40.224
That we're able to grow more crops

00:08:40.224 --> 00:08:41.140
in a certain amount of area.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.142
We have better rule of law,

00:08:42.241 --> 00:08:43.928
so people don't kill each other as often.

00:08:43.928 --> 00:08:47.481
We have better control
of water and irrigation,

00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:49.208
and all of these things.

00:08:49.208 --> 00:08:51.234
So that we're able to increase the limits

00:08:51.468 --> 00:08:53.825
far beyond what we thought.

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:57.343
I would guess if you told Thomas Malthus

00:08:57.343 --> 00:09:00.025
that in the year 2014
we have seven billion

00:09:00.025 --> 00:09:02.023
people on the earth, he would have said

00:09:02.023 --> 00:09:04.119
that's far beyond the Malthusian limit.

00:09:04.119 --> 00:09:05.072
He probably would have guessed

00:09:05.072 --> 00:09:06.970
the Malthusian limit was like a billion,

00:09:06.097 --> 00:09:08.639
or two billion given the
technology of the time,

00:09:09.512 --> 00:09:11.785
and we're already at 7 billion.

00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:13.603
As technology improves
and agriculture improves,

00:09:13.603 --> 00:09:15.401
and rule of law improves,
and everything improves,

00:09:15.401 --> 00:09:17.396
we might be able to get, who knows?

00:09:17.396 --> 00:09:18.759
There might be a time,
we might think it's crazy

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:21.160
for their to be 20 billion
people on the planet,

00:09:21.016 --> 00:09:23.074
but given today's technology.

00:09:23.218 --> 00:09:25.219
But if technology improves
then optimistic scenarios

00:09:25.228 --> 00:09:27.883
that maybe we could keep going.

00:09:27.883 --> 00:09:29.887
That's not necessarily a good thing,

00:09:29.923 --> 00:09:33.455
but that just might be what it is.
