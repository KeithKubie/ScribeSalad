00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.990
ROGER: It's a magic square.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.830
A magic square is an array of
numbers which you put in

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.080
columns and rows.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.440
So in this case, there are four
rows and four columns,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.260
going up and down, and you
put a number in each.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.810
And the idea is to make sure
that the sum of all these

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.340
numbers going down in each
column is the same.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.140
And the sum of all numbers
in each row is the same.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.520
And the diagonals.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.150
And the other diagonals.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.330
So I want to draw in a
particular way my favorite

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.110
magic square.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.100
And there are bigger
magic squares.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.680
There are different famous magic
squares, such as the one

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.730
in Durar's painting.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.570
But this--

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.330
I want to draw, showing you how
it has extra special magic

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.870
properties.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.654
BRADY: Extra-special
magic properties?

00:00:45.654 --> 00:00:47.280
That's a big promise.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.570
Are you going to be able
to live up to that?

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.840
ROGER: Well, you be
the judge of that.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.065
So I'm going to draw a square.

00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:55.270
Hopefully draw a square.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.860
And put in four columns,
four rows.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.530
And I'm going to write the
numbers in a particular way,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.390
such as in a modern
calculator.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.245
So I'm going to write this
as 2, like that.

00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:10.970
And as 5--

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.070
oops, that's meant
to be square.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.640
And then 18.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.110
And I'll do 18 as two boxes.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.470
And then 51.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.780
And 82.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.810
This is going to take
a time, Brady.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.030
This is a magic square.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.040
Let me show you why.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.780
If I add up all these numbers in
each row, they come to the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.690
same total.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.510
If I add up all these numbers,
that row, that row, that row,

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.840
and that row, each one comes
to the same number.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.570
Or this diagonal, or that
diagonal, they add up-- or

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.640
this little square in here, they
all add up to the same

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.400
number, which is 176.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.640
I'm writing it in normal
curly numbers.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.910
You'll see the reason
why in a minute.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.530
This 28, plus 15, plus
52, plus 81, is 176.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.510
They're all the same number.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.330
That's what makes
a magic square.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.960
If I do a diagonal, 58 plus
21, plus 15, plus

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.500
82 is equal to 176.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.660
So this is quite remarkable,
that somebody could dream up

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.300
something--

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.980
52 plus 15, plus 21,
plus 88 is 176.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.470
51 plus 15, plus 88,
plus 22, is 176.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.300
So whichever way you go,
diagonal, across, down, check

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.330
it out for yourself,
it adds up to 176.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.885
Well, let me show you what's
different about the way I've

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:39.710
drawn this.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.310
If I now turn it upside down.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.680
I have 11 plus 22,
plus 58, plus 85,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.180
which is equal to 176.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.590
82 plus 51, plus 25,
plus 18 is 176.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.420
And you go through--

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.300
28 plus 15, plus 81, plus 52--

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.720
is that 52?

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.420
I can't write.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.410
Yes, that's 52.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.100
That's 176.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.580
So whether you read it upside
down or backwards,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.080
it's still the same.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.150
But there's even
one more thing.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.810
One more thing, which is
absolutely beautiful.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.210
I can now get a mirror and
place it next to it.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.990
And you will be able
to see the top row

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.700
reads 28, 82, 55, 11.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.140
And the next row is 15,
51, 88, and 22.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.640
These also add up to 176.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.580
So this is not only a magic
square which I can turn upside

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.000
down, I can also look at
it reversed in a mirror

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.990
and it's still 176.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.200
So this is why this is more
than just a magic square.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.620
It is a magic square
in different ways--

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.530
reversing, and mirror imaging.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.970
And I find that incredible.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.380
It wouldn't have existed, of
course, before we had these

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.640
modern ways of writing twos
and eights and fives.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.990
Of course, you can't do
it that way 'round.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.870
That doesn't work.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.300
That doesn't make any
sense at all.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.600
So it's only up and down.
