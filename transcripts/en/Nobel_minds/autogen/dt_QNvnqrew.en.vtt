00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:04.450 align:start position:0%
the Nobel Committee because they really
 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.170 align:start position:0%
the Nobel Committee because they really
helped<00:00:04.660><c> to</c><00:00:04.930><c> define</c><00:00:05.470><c> a</c><00:00:05.830><c> certain</c><00:00:06.729><c> part</c><00:00:06.939><c> of</c><00:00:07.029><c> work</c>

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:07.180 align:start position:0%
helped to define a certain part of work
 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.919 align:start position:0%
helped to define a certain part of work
and<00:00:07.389><c> I</c><00:00:07.450><c> would</c><00:00:07.569><c> say</c><00:00:07.779><c> that</c><00:00:09.450><c> the</c><00:00:10.450><c> work</c><00:00:10.660><c> that</c><00:00:10.839><c> we</c>

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:10.929 align:start position:0%
and I would say that the work that we
 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.339 align:start position:0%
and I would say that the work that we
did<00:00:11.139><c> was</c><00:00:11.320><c> to</c><00:00:11.440><c> develop</c><00:00:11.650><c> models</c><00:00:12.900><c> for</c><00:00:13.900><c> the</c><00:00:13.990><c> big</c>

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:14.349 align:start position:0%
did was to develop models for the big

did was to develop models for the big
molecules<00:00:14.830><c> in</c><00:00:14.980><c> chemistry</c><00:00:15.370><c> and</c><00:00:15.459><c> biology</c><00:00:15.610><c> that</c>

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 align:start position:0%
molecules in chemistry and biology that
 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
molecules in chemistry and biology that

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 align:start position:0%
would enable one to do calculations on
 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.650 align:start position:0%
would enable one to do calculations on
these<00:00:17.859><c> models</c><00:00:18.099><c> now</c><00:00:18.490><c> one</c><00:00:19.330><c> needs</c><00:00:19.480><c> to</c><00:00:19.630><c> remember</c>

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 align:start position:0%
these models now one needs to remember
 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.870 align:start position:0%
these models now one needs to remember
that<00:00:20.050><c> computers</c><00:00:20.529><c> were</c><00:00:20.710><c> really</c><00:00:21.310><c> really</c><00:00:21.609><c> slow</c>

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 align:start position:0%
that computers were really really slow
 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.769 align:start position:0%
that computers were really really slow
back<00:00:22.510><c> then</c><00:00:23.400><c> something</c><00:00:24.400><c> like</c><00:00:24.580><c> a</c><00:00:24.970><c> hundred</c>

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 align:start position:0%
back then something like a hundred
 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.290 align:start position:0%
back then something like a hundred
million<00:00:26.320><c> times</c><00:00:26.589><c> slower</c><00:00:27.429><c> than</c><00:00:27.580><c> today</c><00:00:27.970><c> and</c>

million times slower than today and
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.120 align:start position:0%

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 align:start position:0%
basically the key thing was was to
 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
basically the key thing was was to
simplify<00:00:33.550><c> things</c><00:00:33.790><c> and</c><00:00:34.450><c> like</c><00:00:34.630><c> Einstein</c><00:00:35.110><c> once</c>

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 align:start position:0%
simplify things and like Einstein once
 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.510 align:start position:0%

wikiquote said it wasn't really him and
 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
wikiquote said it wasn't really him and
that<00:00:41.020><c> wasn't</c><00:00:41.260><c> that</c><00:00:41.530><c> you</c><00:00:41.650><c> should</c><00:00:41.800><c> make</c>

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 align:start position:0%
that wasn't that you should make
 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.980 align:start position:0%
that wasn't that you should make
everything<00:00:42.460><c> as</c><00:00:42.730><c> simple</c><00:00:42.880><c> as</c><00:00:43.060><c> you</c><00:00:43.210><c> can</c><00:00:43.480><c> but</c><00:00:43.840><c> no</c>

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 align:start position:0%
everything as simple as you can but no
 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
everything as simple as you can but no
simpler<00:00:44.370><c> so</c><00:00:45.370><c> we</c><00:00:45.550><c> had</c><00:00:45.700><c> to</c><00:00:45.820><c> make</c><00:00:46.000><c> things</c><00:00:46.300><c> as</c>

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 align:start position:0%
simpler so we had to make things as
 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.300 align:start position:0%
simpler so we had to make things as
simple<00:00:46.570><c> as</c><00:00:47.020><c> we</c><00:00:47.170><c> could</c><00:00:47.440><c> sort</c><00:00:47.680><c> of</c><00:00:47.770><c> the</c><00:00:47.860><c> computer</c>

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 align:start position:0%
simple as we could sort of the computer
 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
simple as we could sort of the computer
could<00:00:48.400><c> do</c><00:00:48.520><c> the</c><00:00:48.640><c> calculation</c><00:00:49.240><c> but</c><00:00:49.960><c> not</c><00:00:50.140><c> so</c>

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 align:start position:0%
could do the calculation but not so
 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
could do the calculation but not so
simple<00:00:50.800><c> that</c><00:00:50.890><c> the</c><00:00:51.010><c> results</c><00:00:51.400><c> would</c><00:00:51.460><c> be</c>

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 align:start position:0%
simple that the results would be
 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
simple that the results would be
meaningless

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 align:start position:0%

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
and we were lucky I think we got the
 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.770 align:start position:0%
and we were lucky I think we got the

right level of simplicity we were then
 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
right level of simplicity we were then

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 align:start position:0%
but in calculations you can do the same
 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.279 align:start position:0%
but in calculations you can do the same
thing<00:01:12.939><c> for</c><00:01:13.030><c> a</c><00:01:13.090><c> lot</c><00:01:13.270><c> of</c><00:01:13.299><c> biological</c><00:01:13.840><c> molecules</c>

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 align:start position:0%
thing for a lot of biological molecules
 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:16.529 align:start position:0%
thing for a lot of biological molecules
and<00:01:14.500><c> then</c><00:01:15.100><c> you</c><00:01:15.130><c> can</c><00:01:15.429><c> sort</c><00:01:15.820><c> of</c><00:01:15.880><c> calculate</c><00:01:16.390><c> the</c>

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 align:start position:0%
and then you can sort of calculate the
 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
and then you can sort of calculate the

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 align:start position:0%
data in between experiments so it
 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.039 align:start position:0%
data in between experiments so it
becomes<00:01:18.399><c> a</c><00:01:18.549><c> tool</c><00:01:18.759><c> that</c><00:01:19.509><c> can</c><00:01:19.659><c> be</c><00:01:19.780><c> used</c><00:01:19.960><c> with</c>

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 align:start position:0%
becomes a tool that can be used with
 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:21.810 align:start position:0%
becomes a tool that can be used with
experiments<00:01:20.710><c> and</c><00:01:20.920><c> I</c><00:01:20.979><c> think</c><00:01:21.189><c> it's</c><00:01:21.520><c> it's</c><00:01:21.700><c> I</c>

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 align:start position:0%
experiments and I think it's it's I
 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.069 align:start position:0%
