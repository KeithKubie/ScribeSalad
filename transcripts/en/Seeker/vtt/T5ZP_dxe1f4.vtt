00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:08.240
Remoted Piloted Aircraft seem so… futuristic,
but just how long have they’ve been around?

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.599
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.000
While remote piloted aircraft seem like a
weird future thing, radio controlled aircraft

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.320
go as far back as the second world war.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.289
In 1934, the British Air Ministry ordered
over 400 of a type of radio-controlled plane

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.460
called “Queen Bee”.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.960
Fast forward a few years and what we think
of as RPAs here in the US well they’re actually

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.580
as old as the space race.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.580
Seriously.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.450
Back when The Andy Griffith Show was on the
air, the US Military was planning unmanned

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.450
aircraft.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.480
One of the first programs was launched under
the code name of "Red Wagon” . A few years

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.870
later the first military campaign such aircraft
ever took part in was the Vietnam War.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.960
The first of these, the AQM-34 Ryan Aeronautical
“Lightning Bug”, could take photos from

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.830
the air, collect intelligence and even drop
leaflets.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.080
Their photographic abilities became so useful
during that campaign that one expert, Dr.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.240
Thomas P. Ehrhard says, "the Air Force depended
almost entirely on them for bomb damage assessment

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.510
due to bad weather."

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.940
In total there were nearly 3500 UAV missions
during the war.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.810
And only about 500 were lost for various reasons.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.710
But for a long time after the war, there wasn’t
much interest in these aircraft anymore.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.080
Until the Gulf War.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.080
Remote piloted aircraft technology took off
in the 1990s.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.970
Back when I was watching Pokemon, engineers
and researchers with the Air Force were designing

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.690
top of the line technology.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.920
Many of the first generations of aircraft
were for surveillance purposes during the

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.220
Gulf War, like the Air Force’s Predator.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.140
According to a recent congressional report,
the Military now heavily relies on these type

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.390
of aircraft.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.320
Nearly 31% of their aircraft are unmanned.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.020
And they are stealthier and safer than ever.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.600
Most of them are little guys, like the Army’s
Raven.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.610
Which looks like a souped up toy plane to
me.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.380
Basically they are like little cameras with
wings.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.120
Fitted with color cameras and infrared night
vision, these guys are like our military’s

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.120
eye in the sky.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.840
And they’re pretty fast, they can fly at
speeds up to 60 miles per hour.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.250
Or perhaps you’re more familiar with the
Air Force’s Predator RPA.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.840
These are a little bit bigger and have been
around for a while.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.810
Early versions of the aircraft flew missions
in the Balkans 20 years ago.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.130
And because they can fly for a while and can
carry infrared cameras, they were approved

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.319
in 2006 to fly in civilian airspace here in
the US for search and rescue operations.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.069
And they’re safer than they’ve ever been.

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.930
According to that recent congressional report,
there were only 7.5 accidents per 100,000

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.480
hours of flight in 2012, which is less than
the 20 accidents in 2005.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.069
Unmanned aircraft have come a long way since
the early days.

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.920
Now they’re used for protecting nature and
maybe someday bringing packages straight to

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.920
your front door.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.040
And we can probably thank the United States
Air Force for some of this new technology.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.239
Powered by Airmen and fueled by innovation,
wvery day American Airmen go above and beyond

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.379
to break barriers both professionally and
personally.

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.510
Whether it’s overcoming poverty to become
a nurse and officer or becoming the first

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.219
female Thunderbird pilot, these Airmen are
doing what others once thought was impossible.

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:58.269
So what do you think of the future of this
technology?
