00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.860
 Let's talk about how to become a leader of Catholicism. 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.950
 And the Pope who led the billions of believers 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.060
 Here are the requirements you need to have this high status: 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.400
 First, it is a Catholic 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.720
 Second, male 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.210
 This seems a bit easier... although technically possible on an ordinary Sunday 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.419
 Catholics have become popes, but this has never happened before. 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:21.390
 Because becoming a pope is not like being a president, you are not just for public office. 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.509
 The pope was chosen by a group of cardinals not publicly decided, although in theory they 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.499
 You can choose any Catholic male believer to become the Pope. In fact, they will choose one of the cardinals. 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:30.060
 Become a pope. 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.579
 The last time it was not a cardinal and became a pope was more than 600 years ago. So although it is not 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.829
 The official request is an unofficial official request. (become a cardinal) 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.070
 Therefore, before you become a pope, you first need to be a cardinal master, and this requires 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.519
 You step by step to climb the Catholic business class. * 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.660
 The first step: become a priest. Unlike other churches here you can be on the web 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.289
 Fill out the form and prove acceptance of the priesthood. To become a true priest in the Catholic Church, 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.719
 You need professional training. So you need a lot of education 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.129
 Usually a college degree in Catholicism and then a master's degree in theology. 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.699
 In addition to your academic credentials, you must also be: 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.160
 Man is unmarried 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.909
 Willing to remain single forever. † If you meet these requirements, and have 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.540
 In the work of the church, then you can formally become a priest. This basically means 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.920
 You take care of a Catholic church or work with another priest. 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.000
 However, if you want to go further, you need to climb up to stand up to your priesthood. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.490
 That position. 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.950
 Step 2: Becoming a bishop is a more specifically selected group 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.619
 Although there are about 400,000 Catholic priests around the world, there are only about 5,000 bishops. 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.869
 Although the priest has a church, the bishop is the cathedral (bishop's church), which supervises the local from the cathedral. 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:29.380
 Some churches. 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.130
 To promote your class, you must wait for the bishop in your area to be 75 years old. 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.560
 Or the reason for the death is forced to retire and the job is created for you. 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.979
 But you can't apply directly, because there is a list of secret bishops. 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.130
 This list is decided by the current bishops in your area who are updated every three years. 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.399
 a good successor who can replace them 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.810
 In order to be listed on the list, in addition to the most obvious requirement of a devout person, you should 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.200
 and also: 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.500
 At least 35 years old, the priest has been at least five years old. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.119
 Have a theology (or equivalent) doctoral degree assuming you have these things, your name 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.340
 Maybe but not necessarily on the secret list. Local bishops will give the list to your country 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.930
 The ambassador of the pope is the ambassador of the Holy See. 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.500
 The Holy See ambassador selected three priests from the list, in-depth study and interviews 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.840
 And choose the one he thinks is the best. 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.480
 But it is not over, because the Holy See ambassador will send his report to the Vatican City and examine it there. 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.650
 The main parliament from the world's list of bishops 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.379
 If the bishops do not like any of the three candidates, they can tell 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.620
 The Holy See ambassador redo once: Return to the primary election list and choose another three candidates 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.790
 More research, more interviews and delivery results. 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.760
 When the Bishops Conference is satisfied with one of the candidates for the election of the Holy See 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.250
 That name will be given to the Pope, and the Pope will be able to reject the candidate and then go through the process again. 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.730
 So it’s not surprising that the replacement of a bishop’s job may take several months. 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.510
 And sometimes, for years. 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.290
 But suppose the bishop in your area is retiring (or dying), just now you are also 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.610
 Good priest's secret list and the Holy See ambassador pick you up, you also have an interview through him 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.090
 Then the bishop's assembly approved your pope and did not veto you. 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.550
 Congratulations! You become a bishop 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.129
 But you have not yet become a pope. The penultimate action is... 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.849
 The third step: become a cardinal (cardinal). Despite the fancy name and the stylish red dress match 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.879
 Cardinal is not the epistle of the bishop, they are also bishops, just a few extra 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.879
 The most famous job title and more responsibility is to elect a new one. 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:02.230
 Pope. ‡ 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.909
 The only way to become a cardinal is to let the current Pope appoint you as one of them. 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.760
 And 5,000 bishops, only about 200 were former cardinals. 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.710
 But suppose you are not discouraged by being ignored by the Pope and he finally makes you a Cardinal 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.569
 Now it’s your turn to play the game waiting for the Pope’s death or retirement. 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.340
 And the pope is usually dead.... 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.569
 When any situation occurs, the cardinal under 80 will be taken to the Vatican City. 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.530
 They want to be isolated from the world by taking their phones and tablets 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.290
 And the pigeons. Once the seizure is completed, the new pope election can begin. 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.680
 These elections will never be exactly the same because the former pope left behind 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.939
 He wants to choose the description of the successor, but in summary the principle of operation is this: 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.879
 Four times a day, Cardinal goes to the Sistine Chapel to vote for one of the Popes. 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.189
 Get a 2/3 majority vote. 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.870
 There is a key that can't be too fast. Here the cardinal is not raising a hand to vote. 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.260
 Or use a modern excellent election system, but on a piece of paper 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.319
 Write down the name and stand in front of the altar before the official vote 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.670
 Read a long Latin 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.860
 Once all the cardinals have finished, click on all the tickets and burn them again. 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.709
 This is why TV News Channel uses the super-tech HD live broadcast camera to report the pope’s election. 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.299
 Pat the chimney. If the smoke is black, there is no new pope. 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.170
 The high threshold and the slow voting process, which is why it takes so long 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.970
 To choose the new pope. Usually at least four times a day 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.630
 One Saturday (one day prayer) and lasts two weeks, but the longest record lasts for three years. 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.720
 Suppose you end up winning the support of a cardinal companion. You have one to do before becoming a pope. 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.480
 The last thing: take a new name for yourself 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.850
 There are no formal rules, you can name it yourself. 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.470
 But traditionally the names of the previous popes were taken. 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.010
 Once you confirm your name (Princess is over), the ballot is finally burned to make the smoke 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.010
 It was white and announced to the world that a new pope was chosen. 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.760
 So integrate the career path: birth is male 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.510
 Become one of the one billion Catholics, become one of the 400,000 priests, become one of the 5,000 bishops, and become another 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.560
 One of the 200 cardinals, waiting for the current Pope to die or retire, and persuading 2/3 of the cardinal 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.050
 The companion chooses which one you are, the only pope.
