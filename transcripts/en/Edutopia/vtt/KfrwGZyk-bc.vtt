00:00:04.046 --> 00:00:05.366
&gt;&gt;Oli: Today in the next hour or so,

00:00:05.516 --> 00:00:08.796
year nine will be taking part
in their political ignite.

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:13.826
This is the end of a term's
worth of research on key topics

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:17.596
around the London mayoral election,
and they're ready to debate each other

00:00:17.596 --> 00:00:19.416
to make sure they've got
the winning argument.

00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:22.326
&gt;&gt;Because of all the Oracy
that's happening in lessons,

00:00:22.436 --> 00:00:26.156
we have seen students showing an
oral dexterity beyond their years.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:29.346
We've seen them able to be
thrown into different situations,

00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:33.146
to judge the audience, to
understand how to present themselves

00:00:33.256 --> 00:00:34.946
so it both raises standards and
prepares them for the future.

00:00:36.516 --> 00:00:38.236
&gt;&gt;Students: [applause]

00:00:48.236 --> 00:00:49.796
&gt;&gt;Coach: If I have to sum up School 21,

00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:52.946
it's giving young people the
voice they might not be able

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:54.076
to find for themselves.

00:00:54.396 --> 00:00:58.606
It gives them the power to realize that
who they are and who they want to be

00:00:58.606 --> 00:01:02.716
in their voice is the very thing
that's gonna make them successful.

00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:06.166
&gt;&gt;Rummana: Talk is my number one thing
I'm going to be using in my life.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.466
All of us here talk and
everyone's voice matters.

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:12.186
&gt;&gt;Oli: Oracy is the ability
to speak fluently

00:01:12.186 --> 00:01:15.496
and we believe the Oracy speaking is
as important as reading and writing.

00:01:15.586 --> 00:01:19.036
So when they first come in year seven,
aged eleven, we asked them, "Hey,

00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:20.926
we're gonna get you to find your voice."

00:01:20.926 --> 00:01:23.376
&gt;&gt;Girl: I believe that
everyone's voice should be heard,

00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:25.496
even though they're shy, quiet or loud.

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:27.386
&gt;&gt;Oli: And we're gonna make sure
that by the end of the year,

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:30.476
you can do a five minute speech
on a topic of your passion.

00:01:30.516 --> 00:01:36.286
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So your hook should be about
three or four sentences, no longer.

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.846
If I was in the audience
and someone read this to me

00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:41.316
or said this, would I be hooked by it?

00:01:41.786 --> 00:01:44.476
Right, anyone brave enough
to tell me their hook?

00:01:44.926 --> 00:01:47.926
&gt;&gt;Rummana: I remember in primary,
I would never say a single word

00:01:48.406 --> 00:01:51.686
and when teachers used to pick on me,
and I used to sit there thinking, "Oh,

00:01:51.686 --> 00:01:54.966
no, oh, no," because I was
too scared to speak to people.

00:01:55.336 --> 00:01:59.506
And now, I feel like I've
changed and I like my new self.

00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:03.866
&gt;&gt;Who here have dreams and goals
they want to achieve in their life?

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:06.086
Yes. We all do.

00:02:06.946 --> 00:02:07.606
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Stop there.

00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:08.056
That's it.

00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:09.406
That's your hook.

00:02:09.406 --> 00:02:11.296
&gt;&gt;Coach: Everything we do
here is about giving a speech,

00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:15.906
but there is a behind the scene Oracy
framework you're really referring

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:16.406
back to.

00:02:16.696 --> 00:02:18.696
&gt;&gt;Rummana: The full project
was our cognitive,

00:02:18.696 --> 00:02:21.836
physical, linguistic and emotional.

00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:26.406
Now I know what type of things I need in
order for my speaking to be successful.

00:02:26.806 --> 00:02:28.786
&gt;&gt;Matilda: It's a lot to
keep in mind at first,

00:02:29.236 --> 00:02:32.006
but we're practicing it all the
time in every lesson we're in.

00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:36.976
And by the time you get to year
nine, it's almost instinctive.

00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:38.706
&gt;&gt;Director: The familiarity with
the framework and making sure

00:02:38.706 --> 00:02:40.066
that everybody recognizes what goes

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:43.566
into good Oracy has been a
key driver within the school.

00:02:43.846 --> 00:02:47.256
And that means that students give
really clear feedback and critique.

00:02:47.546 --> 00:02:48.666
&gt;&gt;Girl: Let's not be foolish.

00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:51.826
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It teaches them
how to present themselves,

00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:55.826
how to use their bodies,
how to use their voices.

00:02:55.826 --> 00:02:57.736
&gt;&gt;Girl: We must face
the facts and recognize

00:02:57.736 --> 00:02:59.916
that privatization is a
very beneficial thing.

00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:03.006
&gt;&gt;Jawad: You're standing, like, in
the same spot for the whole speech.

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:05.246
You should, like, start walking around.

00:03:05.246 --> 00:03:07.246
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It's because
physical Oracy strands...

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:09.826
In year nine, the theme
has been politics.

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:14.676
We wanted to make it like a quite a
formal debate, so you'd have proposers

00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:17.676
and opposers on each side,
and then you'd have a chair.

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:20.456
&gt;&gt;Oli: We thought the key thing
was to get them to discuss

00:03:20.456 --> 00:03:21.526
and debate with each other.

00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:23.436
&gt;&gt;Students: I pull it to you.

00:03:23.546 --> 00:03:24.366
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Much better.

00:03:24.466 --> 00:03:27.026
&gt;&gt;Oli: You actually don't know how
good your Oracy is until you're put

00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:29.886
into a different context and are
then asked to do something with it.

00:03:30.246 --> 00:03:33.976
&gt;&gt;As with every project,
we've invited some experts

00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:36.016
who are gonna judge the
quality of the talk.

00:03:36.326 --> 00:03:40.156
Your job today is to see if you
are persuaded by the arguments,

00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:41.946
'cause you'll get an
opportunity to vote.

00:03:42.286 --> 00:03:47.366
&gt;&gt;Woman: I'd just like to say huge
good luck and let the best group win.

00:03:47.366 --> 00:03:52.876
&gt;&gt;Jawad: Just because it was the
first debate I've, like, truly done,

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.766
my nerves were getting the
better of my confidence.

00:03:56.426 --> 00:03:57.296
Judge: Good morning, everyone.

00:03:57.806 --> 00:04:03.036
The proposition is all London
transport should be privatized.

00:04:03.036 --> 00:04:06.486
&gt;&gt;Matilda: So, I would like
to start my argument by saying

00:04:06.486 --> 00:04:09.126
that Britain has a reputation of
clinging to relics of the past

00:04:09.256 --> 00:04:12.656
that should have been discarded long
ago, a tradition of nationalization

00:04:12.656 --> 00:04:14.536
that should have been
replaced by privatization.

00:04:14.996 --> 00:04:17.726
We want to be able to be on time
to school, to be on time to work.

00:04:18.186 --> 00:04:20.186
This is what we value and
we shouldn't mind having

00:04:20.186 --> 00:04:22.796
to pay a tiny bit more for it.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:24.336
&gt;&gt;Students: [applause]

00:04:24.636 --> 00:04:26.576
&gt;&gt;Jawad: If we stick with the
government-funded privatizing transport,

00:04:26.576 --> 00:04:29.756
we will only delay the
improvement and health

00:04:29.756 --> 00:04:31.556
of London and especially its people.

00:04:32.176 --> 00:04:35.066
As we all know, three lines have failed.

00:04:35.186 --> 00:04:38.796
If we privatize transport,
then it's out of our control.

00:04:38.796 --> 00:04:40.966
Isn't this country a democracy?

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:43.046
&gt;&gt;Students: [applause]

00:04:43.126 --> 00:04:45.686
&gt;&gt;Matilda: Jawad, why are
you so afraid of this change?

00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:48.186
It's clear to see that
TFL isn't working.

00:04:48.476 --> 00:04:52.836
We are having strikes more and more
regularly, prices are just going up

00:04:52.836 --> 00:04:54.626
and up and it's getting
less and less efficient...

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:59.066
&gt;&gt;What writing speeches has helped
me with is definitely confidence.

00:04:59.196 --> 00:05:02.686
I've been able to perform my
speech in front of a big crowd.

00:05:02.686 --> 00:05:04.896
All that practice really does
pay off, and it's a skill

00:05:04.896 --> 00:05:06.486
that we can transfer to
the rest of our life.

00:05:06.486 --> 00:05:07.596
&gt;&gt;Judge: Reward unto all of you.

00:05:07.646 --> 00:05:09.646
&gt;&gt;All: [applause]

00:05:09.696 --> 00:05:11.486
&gt;&gt;Oli: Oracy gives children
the opportunity

00:05:11.486 --> 00:05:13.826
to gain their confidence
and find their voice.

00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:15.936
&gt;&gt;Girl: We urge to you
to take up this motion.

00:05:16.176 --> 00:05:18.346
&gt;&gt;Oli: A silent classroom is a classroom

00:05:18.346 --> 00:05:20.176
where there's untapped
voices that aren't heard.

00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:23.866
And if we believe in democratic
education, you have to focus on Oracy.

00:05:24.136 --> 00:05:26.676
&gt;&gt;Announcer: The winner of our
first debate, Ruwada and Lily.

00:05:26.676 --> 00:05:27.626
Give them a round of applause.

00:05:27.813 --> 00:05:29.813
&gt;&gt;All: [applause]
