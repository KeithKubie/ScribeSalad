00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.870
 

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.760
Let's think a little bit
about the metric system

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.150
units for volume, or essentially
how much space something

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.460
is taking up in
three dimensions.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.120
So the base unit in the metric
system for volume is the liter.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.500
And there's a couple of ways
that you can visualize a liter.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.310
One way you could
think about a liter

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.910
is if you took a cube that
is 10 centimeters deep, 10

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.470
centimeters wide, and
10 centimeters tall,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.050
then this amount of space
that you're taking up,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.150
this volume is 1 liter.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.870
So this right over
here is 1 liter.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.160
Another way to connect
it to our everyday lives

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.960
is you've probably
gone and bought,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.490
or your parents have bought,
a 2-liter bottle of something.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.780
Oftentimes, it's soda.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.200
So those 2-liter bottles
are-- as I just mentioned,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.750
these are 2 liters.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.550
So let me make my
best attempt to draw

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.480
what those bottles look like.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.490
They look something like this.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.490
At least in the US, oftentimes
soda, and other things,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.100
will be sold in these
2-liter bottles.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.240
So if you take half of this,
you are looking at a liter.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.070
So liter would be
about half of this.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.870
So if it's half full, a liter
would be about that much.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.290
And hopefully,
that is consistent

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.740
or that makes sense relative
to this 10 centimeter

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.330
by 10 centimeter by
10 centimeter cube.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.150
Now, if you want
to measure things

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.662
that are a lot smaller than a
liter, the typical unit used--

00:01:42.662 --> 00:01:44.120
and obviously in
the metric system,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.600
you can always use the
prefixes deci, centi.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.200
But the one that's
most typically used

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.680
is the milliliter--
milli-- the milliliter.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.280
And we've already
seen the prefix milli.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.950
It means 1/1,000.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:08.169
So this means
1/1,000 of a liter.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.410
Or another way of thinking
about it is 1 liter

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:20.430
is equal to 1,000 milliliters.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.650
And if you wanted to visualize
what a milliliter looks like,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.235
imagine taking a cube.

00:02:25.235 --> 00:02:27.700
And instead of making it 10
centimeters on each dimension,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.740
make it only 1 centimeter
in each dimension.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:38.020
So 1 centimeter wide,
1 centimeter deep,

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.411
and 1 centimeter high, and then
you're looking at a milliliter.

00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:45.660
And if you want to think
about the type of things that

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.350
are measured in milliliters,
you might think things

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.840
about dosage of medicine.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.580
So for example, a
typical teaspoon

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.370
that you might see
in your cabinet

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.470
is going to be a little
bit over 4 milliliters,

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.230
almost 5 milliliters.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.710
So that might be good for
medicine dosage or maybe

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.750
small ingredients in
some type of a recipe.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.710
If you want to go larger than
a liter-- and once again,

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.520
you could use all
the metric prefixes.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.080
You could use dekaliter.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.740
You could use hectoliter.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.160
But the one that's most
typically used is kiloliter.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.800
 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.110
And as the prefix
kilo implies, this

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.500
is equivalent to 1,000 liters.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.780
And if you want
to visualize this,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.750
this actually isn't as large
as you might assume it to be.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.440
If you just take a
cube, and this side,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.370
instead of taking each
dimension being 10 centimeters,

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.690
if you were to take a cube where
each dimension is exactly 1

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:55.720
meter, so 1 meter deep, 1
meter wide, and 1 meter tall,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.360
this volume is equivalent
to 1 kiloliter.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.222
 

00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:04.680
So you could imagine
something like

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.740
a kilometer would be very
useful for measuring,

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.991
say, the volume of water
inside of a swimming pool.

00:04:12.991 --> 00:04:13.491
