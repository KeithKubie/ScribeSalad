On your quest to find love, and

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:08.639
possibly have offspring, many of us cringe at the idea of mating with a sibling or any relative really, weird.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.639
But what's the big problem with incest in the first place?

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.789
What actually happens when you inbreed? The first thing to understand is how any trait you have comes about. You have your

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.299
biological mom and your dad who each have their own unique DNA. And,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.089
basically, you get half of your DNA from mom and half from dad. These DNA pairs define everything about you,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.340
but in some cases, certain traits are more

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:36.359
dominant; like brown eyes for example. If your mom has two pairs of the brown eye allele, her eyes will be brown, and if your

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.479
dad has two pairs for the blue eyes, 
 his will be blue as a result, you'll receive one brown gene from mom and one blue

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:52.320
gene from dad but brown eyes just happened to be a dominant trait meaning even though you get one brown and one blue from each parent, your eye color will actually be brown. It takes having two

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.910
recessive alleles to exhibit the other traits in this case if you got two blue alleles,

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.609
you'd end up having blue eyes. So what does this have to do with incest it turns out that many specific diseases,

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.048
or disorders, are recessive and require you to get the gene from both your mother and father.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.219
They can each carry one and be perfectly healthy, making it difficult to know that they are

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.879
carriers. As a result, if your dad has one allele for a disorder

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.580
it's pretty likely that his sibling or relative probably has it too because they would have gotten it from their parents or other

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.299
relatives had your dad decided to mate with a random person in the population, the chance of them having the same recessive

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.679
gene is low, but if he chooses to copulate with his sister, or cousin,

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.589
then your odds of getting both of the recessive genes are much higher; still not guaranteed,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.960
but much more likely. In that sense

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.869
It's important to remember that inbreeding doesn't create genetic mutations or defective offspring itself, but instead

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.869
increases the chance of a rare gene combination in fact even when both parents carry a recessive gene,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.949
there's still a 75% chance that they won't both pass on the gene leading to perfectly healthy kids with respect to that particular

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.269
disorder or disease. So, is inbreeding ever good? Not so much in humans,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.100
but we rely on it in some plants and animals; in fact different dog breeds are the result of reading?

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.000
relatives with similar desirable traits, like coat color, height, or snout size,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.799
but we can even see the risk in dogs with many purebred suffering from hip problems,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.449
eye problems, and more; while mutts or dogs with genetically diverse parents tend to be healthier.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.639
Thanks for tuning in to our video, that's (that is) kind of about incest. We really hope that you enjoyed it

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.360
there's science in everything people. Not just kind of incest, it was fully about incest. Yeah,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.989
fully about incest. If you want to watch more of our videos. We'll put some extras over here.

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.709
Also, make sure you subscribe to our channel, and we will see you next week for another video, peace!
