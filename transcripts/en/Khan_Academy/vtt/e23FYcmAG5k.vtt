00:00:00.216 --> 00:00:01.360
Interviewer: So I'm here

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.421
with Walter Isaacson
of the Aspen Institute,

00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:06.290
and it looks like we're
going to be talking

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.652
about Benjamin Franklin.

00:00:07.652 --> 00:00:09.956
So one question I have is he's

00:00:09.956 --> 00:00:13.210
clearly considered one
of the founding fathers,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.158
but he's the one that was never president.

00:00:15.158 --> 00:00:17.557
So why do we care so much about him?

00:00:17.557 --> 00:00:20.126
Walter: You know he's the
unintimidating founder.

00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:22.220
The one who winks at us
from history's stage.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.692
He's older than the rest,

00:00:23.692 --> 00:00:25.600
so by the time we have a country,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.624
you know, he's in his late 80s,

00:00:26.624 --> 00:00:28.301
a little too old to be president,

00:00:28.301 --> 00:00:32.613
but he's the one who was the
glue who brings us together.

00:00:32.613 --> 00:00:35.406
He also helps invent
the American character.

00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:40.796
That sort of spunky, chatty,
populist, democratic person

00:00:40.796 --> 00:00:44.791
who wants to bring people together and,

00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:47.603
form a new type of
nation based on the unity

00:00:47.603 --> 00:00:51.650
of various different types
of peoples and ethnic groups,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.010
so he gets that America is going

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.799
to be a middle class nation,

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:58.375
more even than George
Washington, or Jefferson,

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:00.377
or Madison, or John Adams,

00:01:00.377 --> 00:01:02.239
who are much more from the elite.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.799
You know, this is a shopkeeper.

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:04.920
He's middle class.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.792
Interviewer: So just to
get a sense of his life,

00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:10.880
we have a timeline up here,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.669
and I drew the timeline ahead of time

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:14.491
because I do find it confusing.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:16.140
He wasn't in America his whole life

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.200
and he wasn't in one town his whole life.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.355
Walter: He was, he lived 84 years,

00:01:21.355 --> 00:01:24.348
and he was America's
best scientist, inventor,

00:01:24.348 --> 00:01:26.525
diplomat, writer, business strategist,

00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:31.771
and one of the most practical
of our political thinkers,

00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:34.644
and he does it in various
phases of his life.

00:01:34.644 --> 00:01:36.124
He is born in Boston,

00:01:36.124 --> 00:01:41.889
the tenth son of a
Puritan refugee to Boston,

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:45.557
and he runs away as a kid,

00:01:45.557 --> 00:01:47.517
so then he goes to London

00:01:47.517 --> 00:01:49.892
for a little while to
buy printing equipment,

00:01:49.892 --> 00:01:52.397
to work and make enough money
to buy printing equipment,

00:01:52.397 --> 00:01:54.341
and then he comes to Philadelphia

00:01:54.341 --> 00:01:58.660
in his early 20s in order to be a printer,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.972
and then he becomes a great businessman.

00:02:00.972 --> 00:02:02.117
He not only has a print shop,

00:02:02.117 --> 00:02:04.397
but he has a newspaper,
a publishing business.

00:02:04.397 --> 00:02:07.844
He franchises his print
shops up and down the coast.

00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:09.909
He creates the American postal system

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.948
in order to tie together a lot

00:02:11.948 --> 00:02:14.515
of his printing and publishing houses,

00:02:14.515 --> 00:02:17.864
and then semi-retires in Philadelphia

00:02:17.864 --> 00:02:19.631
to become a civic leader.

00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:22.000
To do things like his
electricity experiments,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.448
which were very important,

00:02:23.448 --> 00:02:26.962
but also to do things like
founding a lot of civic groups,

00:02:26.962 --> 00:02:30.307
like what becomes the
University of Pennsylvania.

00:02:30.307 --> 00:02:34.299
So most of that period he's
become a middle-class shopkeeper

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.419
and then become sort of the head

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:39.644
of the good business
group in Philadelphia.

00:02:39.644 --> 00:02:41.403
Interviewer: This is a
pretty interesting period

00:02:41.403 --> 00:02:43.439
because as he likes to recount,

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.782
he kinda showed up in
Philadelphia penniless

00:02:45.782 --> 00:02:47.667
at a fairly young age,

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.170
and then over this time period he becomes,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.242
as you just mentioned, kind
of a leader of his community.

00:02:51.242 --> 00:02:52.714
Walter: That is another reason

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:54.681
why he is the American archetype.

00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:56.738
He is a self-made man.

00:02:56.738 --> 00:02:58.922
He's a Horatio Alger myth.

00:02:58.922 --> 00:03:00.626
The rags to riches.

00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:03.993
He does take great pride,
in his autobiography,

00:03:03.993 --> 00:03:06.360
talking about coming into Philadelphia

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.960
with only three coins in
his pocket all bedraggled,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.764
and yet his remarkable rise
in the world as he calls it,

00:03:13.764 --> 00:03:15.987
when he opens a print
shop, does the newspaper,

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:18.259
creates Poor Richard's Almanac.

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.940
Suddenly he's the most
successful business entrepreneur

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.572
in all of the American colonies,

00:03:24.572 --> 00:03:28.884
and that's the first time
we've ever had in our history

00:03:28.884 --> 00:03:32.595
a person who was just a
poor runaway become one

00:03:32.595 --> 00:03:35.611
of the richest and most
successful businessmen.

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:36.693
Interviewer: Just to understand his,

00:03:36.693 --> 00:03:38.214
and we'll in other videos,

00:03:38.214 --> 00:03:39.894
we'll go into more depth
in all these periods,

00:03:39.894 --> 00:03:41.783
but why did he, he ran away,

00:03:41.783 --> 00:03:43.726
he was working for his brother
and he just didn't get along?

00:03:43.726 --> 00:03:45.879
Walter: Well he
apprenticed to his brother,

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.479
and that's something that's interesting

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.175
when you look at the early colonies.

00:03:49.175 --> 00:03:52.422
An apprenticeship is when you sign over

00:03:52.422 --> 00:03:54.887
that you're going to
work seven, eight years

00:03:54.887 --> 00:03:58.422
until you're at least
21 for somebody else.

00:03:58.422 --> 00:04:04.366
You get just at most small
wages, and you're bound.

00:04:04.366 --> 00:04:06.862
It's not, of course, like being a slave,

00:04:06.862 --> 00:04:09.238
but it's also not like being a free man.

00:04:09.238 --> 00:04:10.951
You were bound as an apprentice.

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:12.801
Unseen interviewer: He was apprenticed

00:04:12.801 --> 00:04:14.343
under his brother when he was 12.

00:04:14.343 --> 00:04:16.858
Walter: Who was a printer and
ran a newspaper in Boston,

00:04:16.858 --> 00:04:18.847
and Franklin does not,

00:04:18.847 --> 00:04:20.624
this makes him an American too,

00:04:20.624 --> 00:04:23.392
he doesn't like arbitrary authority.

00:04:23.392 --> 00:04:25.496
He doesn't like his
brother being his boss.

00:04:25.496 --> 00:04:28.919
He doesn't like the theocratic
authority in Boston.

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.544
He wants freedom, so he runs away.

00:04:31.544 --> 00:04:33.280
Interviewer: He literally had to run away

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.968
because he owed his brother
time as an apprentice.

00:04:35.968 --> 00:04:38.470
Walter: Right, he had signed an indenture.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.231
He was apprenticed to his brother.

00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:43.120
He could not legally leave.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.199
He actually pulls off a
little trick on his brother,

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.886
because his brother
has to pretend that Ben

00:04:47.886 --> 00:04:49.894
is running the newspaper
because his brother is

00:04:49.894 --> 00:04:51.582
in a little bit of trouble,

00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:53.237
so with that trick,

00:04:53.237 --> 00:04:54.814
he knew that his brother could not send

00:04:54.814 --> 00:04:56.390
somebody out to capture him.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.687
So late at night he runs away by sea,

00:04:58.687 --> 00:05:01.687
leaves Boston, and ends
up about a week later

00:05:01.687 --> 00:05:05.349
bedraggled and wet and almost
penniless in Philadelphia.

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.109
Interviewer: But then he
immediately goes to London.

00:05:07.109 --> 00:05:08.870
Why does he go to London
in this time period?

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.262
Walter: Well he wants to be a printer,

00:05:10.262 --> 00:05:12.598
and this is the good old days,

00:05:12.598 --> 00:05:14.302
there are about ten
newspapers in Philadelphia.

00:05:14.302 --> 00:05:15.559
He wants to make the 11th.

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:16.605
He wants a print shop.

00:05:16.605 --> 00:05:18.809
He had worked for his
brother as a printer.

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:19.808
His brother was a printer,

00:05:19.808 --> 00:05:21.721
so that's the trade he knew,

00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:23.632
but in order to be a printer,

00:05:23.632 --> 00:05:24.847
you had to have a printing press

00:05:24.847 --> 00:05:26.360
and fonts and stuff like that.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.911
So he runs away to
Philadelphia to set up shop,

00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:32.703
and he realizes he needs to
buy the printing equipment,

00:05:32.703 --> 00:05:35.031
and he wants to go to
London himself to get it.

00:05:35.031 --> 00:05:37.382
One of his backers in Philadelphia,

00:05:37.382 --> 00:05:39.054
an older man he met,

00:05:39.054 --> 00:05:40.511
said he would pay for it,

00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:42.183
but the guy reneged on the deal,

00:05:42.183 --> 00:05:43.975
so Franklin goes to London

00:05:43.975 --> 00:05:46.151
and has to get a job
there in order to make

00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:48.415
enough money to buy
his printing equipment.

00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:50.783
Interviewer: I see, and that's
why he had to stay there,

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:52.103
get the equipment, come back,

00:05:52.103 --> 00:05:53.768
and that's kind of what launched his

00:05:53.768 --> 00:05:54.881
Walter: Yeah, and then he comes back

00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:57.201
with his printing equipment
a couple of years later,

00:05:57.201 --> 00:05:58.601
and that's what launches him

00:05:58.601 --> 00:06:01.018
on his career as a publisher and printer.

00:06:01.018 --> 00:06:02.080
Interviewer: And it was really kind of

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.457
near the end of this phase,

00:06:03.457 --> 00:06:05.024
I guess his midlife,
that as you mentioned,

00:06:05.024 --> 00:06:06.560
he's a civic leader, inventor,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.657
and we'll talk more about that in depth,

00:06:08.657 --> 00:06:10.033
and that's kind of what launches him

00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:12.369
into his role as a,

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:14.247
I guess for lack of a better
word, founding father.

00:06:14.247 --> 00:06:15.358
Walter: Well exactly.

00:06:15.358 --> 00:06:17.957
He becomes a civic leader in Philadelphia.

00:06:17.957 --> 00:06:19.725
He becomes a bit of a political leader

00:06:19.725 --> 00:06:21.429
in Philadelphia in the assembly,

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:24.622
and then Pennsylvania as a colony

00:06:24.622 --> 00:06:27.326
decides it needs an ambassador to London,

00:06:27.326 --> 00:06:28.758
because we're having all the problems

00:06:28.758 --> 00:06:30.551
with the British Parliament
and their ministers

00:06:30.551 --> 00:06:32.062
and they were imposing taxes,

00:06:32.062 --> 00:06:33.801
and they were doing all
sorts of bad things,

00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:35.414
and so he's like being

00:06:35.414 --> 00:06:39.342
an ambassador of the colonies to London.

00:06:39.342 --> 00:06:41.582
He was appointed by the
Pennsylvania Assembly,

00:06:41.582 --> 00:06:43.878
but four or five other colonies,

00:06:43.878 --> 00:06:45.238
Massachusetts and others,

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.061
decided we'll use him too.

00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:48.902
He'll be our ambassador as well.

00:06:48.902 --> 00:06:50.213
You've got to remember,

00:06:50.213 --> 00:06:51.653
we were not one country back then.

00:06:51.653 --> 00:06:53.214
We were just a collection of colonies.

00:06:53.214 --> 00:06:55.637
So each of the colonies had to decide

00:06:55.637 --> 00:06:57.277
who to send as their ambassador.

00:06:57.277 --> 00:06:59.588
So he spends a lot of time, really,

00:06:59.588 --> 00:07:01.869
over almost a 20-year period,

00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:03.749
off and on in London,

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:06.037
acting as an ambassador of the colonies,

00:07:06.037 --> 00:07:09.701
trying to keep us together as an empire,

00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:11.700
prevent the American Revolution.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.845
But in 1775 he basically fails,

00:07:14.845 --> 00:07:18.373
comes back to Philadelphia in 1776,

00:07:18.373 --> 00:07:21.054
becomes part of the Continental Congress,

00:07:21.054 --> 00:07:24.709
and helps write the
Declaration of Independence.

00:07:24.709 --> 00:07:27.069
Then right after they do it,

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:28.452
he has to go to Paris,

00:07:28.452 --> 00:07:30.124
even though he's a bit old by then,

00:07:30.124 --> 00:07:32.653
because in order to make
the Declaration a reality,

00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:35.086
we had to get France in
on our side in the war.

00:07:35.086 --> 00:07:38.349
So there's about nine years in Paris,

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:40.261
acting as an ambassador to Paris,

00:07:40.261 --> 00:07:42.652
and he's successful in getting France

00:07:42.652 --> 00:07:44.660
in on our side in the war,

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.269
and then as a pretty old
man, as he's pushing 80,

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:52.429
he comes back to what is
then the United States

00:07:52.429 --> 00:07:55.053
and helps write the Constitution

00:07:55.053 --> 00:07:56.396
at the Constitutional Convention

00:07:56.396 --> 00:07:59.125
and is a very elder statesman.

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:01.661
Interviewer: Wow! Fascinating life.

00:08:01.661 --> 00:08:05.549
Walter: Oh, it's totally amazing,
and an American life too.

00:08:05.549 --> 00:08:09.549
It helps define what an American
is and what a country is.
