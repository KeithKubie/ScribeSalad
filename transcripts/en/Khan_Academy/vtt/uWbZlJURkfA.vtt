00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.320
I'm going to do one more video
where we compare old and new

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.320
definitions of a projection.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.560
Our old definition of a
projection onto some line, l,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:18.380
of the vector, x, is the vector
in l, or that's a

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:26.500
member of l, such that x minus
that vector, minus the

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:38.540
projection onto l of x,
is orthogonal to l.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.990
So the visualization is, if
you have your line l like

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.360
this, that is your line
l right there.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.950
And then you have some other
vector x that we're take the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.010
projection of it on to l.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.450
So that's x.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.770
The projection of x onto l,
this thing right here, is

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.490
going to be some vector in l.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.060
Such that when I take the
difference between x and that

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.880
vector, it's going to
be orthogonal to l.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.940
So it's going to be
some vector in l.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.190
This was our old definition when
we took the projection

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.990
onto a line.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.460
Some vector in l.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.460
Maybe it's there.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.090
And if I take the difference
between that and that, this

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.090
difference vector's going
to be orthogonal to

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.340
everything in l.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.110
Just like that.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.700
So, this right here would be
it's difference vector.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.650
That would be x minus the
projection of x onto l.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.200
And then, of course, this
vector right here.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.950
This is the one we
were defining it.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.350
That was the projection
onto l of x.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.270
Now, what's a different
way that we could

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.640
have written this?

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.230
We could have written this
exact same definition.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.200
We could have said it is the
vector in l such that-- so we

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.460
could say, let me write
it here in purple.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:14.010
Is the vector v in l such that
v-- let me write it this way--

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.215
such that x minus v, right?

00:02:18.215 --> 00:02:24.340
x minus the projection of l is
orthogonal is equal to w,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:36.660
which is orthogonal to
everything in l.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.730
Being orthogonal to l literally
means being

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.050
orthogonal to every
vector in l.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.180
So I just rewrote it a little
bit different, instead of just

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.800
leaving it as a projection
of x onto l.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.780
I said hey, that's some vector,
v, in l such that x

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.310
minus v is equal to some other
vector, w, which is orthogonal

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.660
to everything in l.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.090
Or we can rewrite that statement
right there as x is

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.250
equal to v plus w.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.670
So we can just say that the
projection of x onto l is the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.470
unique vector v in l, such that
x is equal to v plus w,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.590
where w is a unique vector-- I
mean it is going to be unique

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.460
vector-- in the orthogonal
complement of l.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.080
Right?

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.070
This is got to be orthogonal
to everything in l.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.410
So that's going to be a member
of the orthogonal

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.070
complement of l.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.910
So this definition is actually
completely consistent with our

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.950
new subspace definition.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.820
And we could just extend
it to arbitrary

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.410
subspaces, not just lines.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.390
Let me help you visualize
that.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.630
So let's say we're dealing
with R3 right here.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.890
And I've got some
subspace in R3.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.950
And let's say that subspace
happens to be a plane.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.140
I'm going to make it a plane
just so that it becomes clear

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.290
that we don't have to take
projections just onto lines.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.920
So this is my subspace
v right there.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.140
Let me draw its orthogonal
compliment.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.500
Let's say its orthogonal
complement looks

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.610
something like that.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.100
Let's say it's a line.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.300
And then it goes-- it intersects
right there.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.520
Then it goes back.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.360
And, of course, it would have to
intersect at the 0 vector.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.170
That's the only place where a
subspace and its orthogonal

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.160
complement overlap.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.710
And then it goes behind
and you see it again.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.860
Obviously you wouldn't be able
to you again because this

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.540
plane would extend in
every direction.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.770
But you get the idea.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.330
So this right here
is the orthogonal

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.550
complement of v, that line.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.510
Now, let's have some other
arbitrary vector in R3 here.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.850
So let's say I have some vector
that looks like that.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.180
Let's say that that is x.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:08.670
Now our new definition for the
projection of x onto v is

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:16.540
equal to the unique vector v.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.390
This is a vector v.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.400
That's a subspace v.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:27.240
The unique vector v, that is a
member of v, such that x is

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:43.120
equal to v plus w, where w
is a unique member of the

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.610
orthogonal complement of v.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.120
This is our new definition.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.250
So, if we say x is equal to
some member of v and some

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.490
member of its orthogonal
complement-- we can visually

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.710
understand that here.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.280
We could say, OK it's going to
be equal to, on v, it'll be

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.470
equal to that vector
to right there.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.410
And then on v's orthogonal
complement,

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.670
you add that to it.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.470
So, if you were to shift it
over, you would get that

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.010
vector, just like that.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.310
This right here is v.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.750
That right there is v.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.950
And then this is vector that
goes up like this, out of the

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.340
plane, orthogonal to
the plane, is w.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.940
You could see if you take v plus
w, you're going to get x.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:29.400
And you could see that v is
the projection onto the

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.610
subspace capital v-- so this
is a vector, v-- is the

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.600
projection onto the subspace
capital V of the vector x.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.710
So the analogy to a shadow
still holds.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.640
If you imagine kind of a light
source coming straight down

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.060
onto our subspace, kind of
orthogonal to our subspace,

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.570
the projection onto our subspace
is kind of the shadow

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:51.320
of our vector x.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.880
Hopefully that help you
visualize it a little better.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.430
But what we're doing here is
we're going to generalize it.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.960
Earlier in this video
I showed you a line.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.310
This is a plane.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.000
But we can generalize
it to any subspace.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.920
This is in R3.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.230
We can generalize it
to Rn, to R100.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.630
And that's really the power
of what we're doing here.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.360
It's easy to visualize it here,
but it's not so easy to

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.530
visualize it once you get
to higher dimensions.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.900
And actually, one other thing.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.370
Let me show that this new
definition is pretty much

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.130
almost identical to exactly
what we did with lines.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.950
This is identical to saying that
the projection onto the

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:45.820
subspace x is equal to some
unique vector in V such that x

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:58.290
minus the projection onto v of
x is orthogonal to every

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.900
member of V.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.230
Because this statement, right
here, is saying any vector

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.250
that's orthogonal to any member
of v says that it's a

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.610
member of the orthogonal
complement of v.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.830
So that statement could be
written as x minus the

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:20.450
projection onto v of x is a
member of v's orthogonal

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:21.030
complement.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.310
Or we could call some w.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.210
So if you call this your v,
and if you call this whole

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:31.640
thing your w, you get this exact
definition right there.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.820
You would have w is equal
to x minus v.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.840
And then if you add v to both
sides, you get w plus v is

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.950
equal to x.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.250
We defined v to be, the
orthogonal-- the

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.250
projection of x onto v.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:51.050
w is a member of our orthogonal
complement.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.990
And I don't want you
to get confused.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.560
The vector v is the orthogonal
projection of our vector x

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.080
onto the subspace capital V.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.170
I probably should use different
letters instead of

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.740
using a lowercase and
a uppercase v.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.540
It makes the language
a little difficult.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.890
But I just wanted to give you
another video to give you a

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.040
visualization of projections
onto

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.650
subspaces other than lines.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.570
And to show you that our old
definition, with just a

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.070
projection onto a line which was
a linear transformation,

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.400
is essentially equivalent
to this new definition.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.400
On the next video, I'll show
you that this, for any

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.740
subspace is, indeed, a linear
transformation.
