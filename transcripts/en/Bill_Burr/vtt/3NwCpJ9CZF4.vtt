00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:03.620
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:06.080
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.860
July 17th, 2017 what's going on?

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.110
<v 2>How? Why? Yeah,</v>

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.850
July 17 2017 I'm going to go play that number number.

6
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:19.470
That shit ain't maybe you still do it.

7
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.671
<v 1>Always remember that.</v>

8
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:24.300
If all of a sudden you know somebody's got something like a receipt or something

9
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:26.460
and there was a couple of same numbers,

10
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.820
<v 2>that's what I'm going to play.</v>

11
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.640
I'm going to go down there and play it on the mega bucks.

12
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.260
That's what they had in Massachusetts. Mega Bucks. My favorite one,

13
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.380
best name ever for any lottery I thought was set for life.

14
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.900
That was just the perfect phrase.

15
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.900
Every blue collar working stiff.

16
00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:50.870
That's what they want to just fucking set for life.

17
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.920
Sit sitting there having a fucking beer checks rolling in.

18
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.570
Don't gotta worry about nothing. Set full life, right.

19
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.070
Cause if you work in class, you, you,

20
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:08.180
you work paycheck to paycheck and it becomes a fucking grind

21
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.460
set for life. Dude, I could fucking sit right here,

22
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.800
right? I could fucking sit right here.

23
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.020
Do just fucking staring at my fucking toes and I still got that check coming in

24
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.650
every month for the rest of my life. You know why kid?

25
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.730
Cause I'm set for life. Yeah.

26
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.170
About Mikey Dody hit the fucking set for life. He's fucking set for life.

27
00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:39.970
Kid doesn't have to do shit fucking cock sucker. Um,

28
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.500
God bless them. Um, anyways,

29
00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:47.500
I'm in a great goddamn mood. Why?

30
00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:50.950
Because I got eight hours sleep last night despite the fact that my daughter is

31
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.570
at my daughter, um,

32
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.700
<v 1>just waking up and she's trying out her voice now was [inaudible] remember when</v>

33
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:02.150
Mariah Carey used to hit those really high notes? She's doing that.

34
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.790
And every time I look over like, oh my God,

35
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.910
she's just looking at me and she has like her legs in our are,

36
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.980
everything's like up in the air and she's smiling at you.

37
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:12.890
It's like impossible to get upset. You just start laughing.

38
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.050
So actually riffing about that this weekend in grand rapids going out,

39
00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:18.290
I wonder if that works as an adult,

40
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.600
you cut somebody off in traffic and they look over at you a few.

41
00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:23.870
Some are flexible enough where you could just put both arms and both legs in the

42
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:26.060
air, just give them that fucking baby

43
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.323
<v 2>grin.</v>

44
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.680
<v 1>That might've been the creepiest image I've ever, I've ever thought of.</v>

45
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.740
There you go. It would just creep them out and be like, oh my God,

46
00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:36.000
should that guy even be driving?

47
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.700
I think there's something wrong with them in a mental department there.

48
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.053
<v 2>Um,</v>

49
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.580
<v 1>so anyways, I want to thank everybody that came out to the, uh,</v>

50
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.780
the shows at the Fountain Street church in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

51
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.230
Um, it is, and it is continuing to be one of my favorite gigs I've ever done.

52
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.160
<v 2>Um, I know I always</v>

53
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.130
<v 1>say I'm going to put up pictures. Like I didn't put up a picture of my drum,</v>

54
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.040
like I said it was

55
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.440
<v 2>going to, and I'll tell you why because you know,</v>

56
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.150
I got these simple stands and the ones that I want,

57
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:10.120
I just wanted the single bracket ones. I don't like those double bracket.

58
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:12.070
Like I'm going to go play in a fucking hurricane.

59
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.000
They weigh 9,000 goddamn pounds. Um,

60
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.540
I accidentally ordered those instead of the ones I wanted.

61
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:22.720
So I had to return those. And now today I'm going to pick up the right ones.

62
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:26.200
I just want to have it all set up. When you see it, I want you to see it, right?

63
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.630
I want it to have the fucking right look. I'm not going to have it. Like,

64
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:31.840
you know, here's the car I bought and I don't have this, the fucking,

65
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.320
the tie is on it. So, um,

66
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.790
but speaking of drums, um, my booking agent,

67
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.810
my Ruben Kincade is, uh, you know,

68
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.550
is tell them how much fun I have when I go on the road.

69
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.950
If I find a place where I can go play drums, he goes, you know,

70
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.750
we could put it in your rider that, you know,

71
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:53.380
anytime you do a couple of nights at a theater, they could set up a drum kit.

72
00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:55.930
There. I go, get the fuck outta here.

73
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.690
That sounds like some diva shit he goes to. And he goes, dude,

74
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:02.470
they have music acts there all the time. It's no big deal.

75
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.780
So I was like, all right,

76
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.330
so I show up at the Fountain Street Church and uh, they had a fucking,

77
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.360
they had this Yamaha kit with this fucking horrific white trash,

78
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.510
like leopard skin rap. I don't know what the, I don't even know what to call it.

79
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:27.511
It was like somewhere between the stray cats way back in the day and a

80
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.570
poison maybe, you know,

81
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.620
it actually looked like the fucking stretchy pants that the slutty girls would

82
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:38.170
wear it, they have your metal concerts. It was the same kind of print.

83
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.900
And I'm looking at those things going on like, what the fuck are these?

84
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:43.570
And she goes, don't worry. Everybody always says that. Sit down and play them.

85
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.740
And the kick sounded amazing and I was able to thanks to my drum teacher,

86
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.540
you don't have a game plan.

87
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:53.110
When I try to tune something up and I got this snare to sound great and um,

88
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.330
I went and on those fucking hilarious,

89
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:59.500
I go in there on Saturday to play and I'm like about an hour before the doors

90
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:02.620
open. So I went in there and I was fucking wailing on him.

91
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:05.230
And when I got off the kit, I, you know,

92
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:08.740
I w I was literally like in like the place with the priest dresses and shit,

93
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:12.820
you know, puts on all the fucking flow flowing ponchos and shit.

94
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.940
And I walked out and there was no one in the church and I walked in the parking

95
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:19.240
lot and there was like fucking six of the security guys just standing out there.

96
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.080
I was like, sorry, sorry.

97
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.740
It was still a lot would have been great if they actually had them out on the

98
00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:30.220
stage. I would have left them there for the show, wouldn't have bugged me,

99
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:34.360
but uh, it would have sounded fucking unbelievable. Um,

100
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.330
this giant church and I didn't realize because, you know,

101
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:40.690
last time I played there only played one night. It kinda came in town. I did it.

102
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:43.240
I was like, what the hell was that? That was fucking incredible.

103
00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:48.220
And then I left. But um, this time I was there for like,

104
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.270
uh, two days, three nights, and I was able to read up on like the history of it,

105
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.630
listen to this shit. This is all the people that perform there.

106
00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.200
Because there was no bigger venue that was the biggest venue in the,

107
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.580
uh, I guess western Michigan or whatever, or at least in grand rapids.

108
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.310
So if anybody big came there, they went there. Everyone,

109
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:09.290
Winston Churchill spoke there.

110
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.410
Helen Keller spoke their blind and deaf,

111
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.300
learned how to fucking read and write and speak, somehow figure that one out.

112
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.390
Um, who else? Uh, Amelia Earhart, Malcolm x.

113
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.670
Did I say Winston Churchill? Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald,

114
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.520
Dave Brubeck, led Zeppelin, pink Floyd.

115
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.910
You too. In like 1984 played there.

116
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.840
I think Zeppelin and pink Floyd was obviously on their first tours. And, uh,

117
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:42.530
that's just,

118
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.070
that's just what I can remember trying to picture when I was looking at the

119
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:48.950
wall. Who Else I saw there? I mean, it was fucking incredible.

120
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.960
Eleanor Roosevelt,

121
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.740
and they had like pictures of them and then like the little thank you notes and

122
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:57.770
shit. It was fucking ridiculous. Uh,

123
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.020
BB King and then make,

124
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.860
I think I said that in the video that I took,

125
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:07.970
which I will actually post and I promise you, I'll give you a picture of my, uh,

126
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:12.890
my drum kit, uh, this week. Um, so anyways,

127
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.660
we are on to episode two of F is for family. We're recording the first one.

128
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.401
Just remember this,

129
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:22.400
just remember me telling this recording the first one on Jay,

130
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.400
July 18th,

131
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.800
2017 you wait to see how long it takes before you fucking see it.

132
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.080
Fucking animation man takes forever.

133
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.060
Um, but anyways, let's let me talk about, uh, what should I talk about here?

134
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.750
How about this? How about how great fucking grand rapids is?

135
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:43.070
And it's one of my favorite cities.

136
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.720
I was there with Dean del Ray and he was fucking murdering all week and yet he

137
00:07:47.721 --> 00:07:50.390
hit a bunch of fans, came out to people flying in to see him,

138
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.720
and then he went on to Detroit to go play some rock club like after, uh,

139
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:58.520
after our show Saturday night. But there was this place, I of course I've post,

140
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:01.250
forget the fucking name of it. Um,

141
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.450
but they had all these old video games in there. The fuck was it called?

142
00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:08.750
And why is my stomach still growling? I had a bowl of cereal

143
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.080
trying to stab myself before the fucking acting gig. I'm, oh by the way,

144
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:16.930
thank you for all you guys suggestions,

145
00:08:16.931 --> 00:08:21.770
sec slash criticism of my dieting or whatever. This guy goes,

146
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:24.440
dude, you can't say you're crushing it. You know, you crushed it.

147
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.990
If at night you still having a drink or two, it's like, hey,

148
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:31.250
you fucking don't realize that mom. Yes, I realize that.

149
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.740
Um, but anyways, uh, what was it called?

150
00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:41.060
Stella's assumption. I can't fucking remember. But, uh,

151
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.450
we went down there and they evidently they had a great burger,

152
00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:49.451
which I didn't have went to this healthy place and got this fucking rap right in

153
00:08:51.021 --> 00:08:54.920
a water water. And then, uh, we went over there,

154
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.200
they had all these pinball machines and shit and me and dean,

155
00:08:57.201 --> 00:08:58.890
a fucking oldest shit. And we walked in there,

156
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:03.060
they only had one pinball machine, but they had all these great, um,

157
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.800
old, uh, video games and we showed up. Right.

158
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:11.670
And we sounded like two fucking kids. D just goes, they got asteroids.

159
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.220
I think we blew 10 bucks play in that. Um,

160
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.330
I've never been one of those guys. Never been a video game guy.

161
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.330
Just haven't been, cause they're so fucking awesome. They were like addicting.

162
00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:28.290
But that is something I remember back in the day when you would watch MTV cribs

163
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:32.340
and then like these fucking people would have these video games in their, uh,

164
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.640
in their houses. And, uh, I saw a distinct,

165
00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:38.800
like I always feel like he buy those and then you never fucking use them. Mike.

166
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.250
He use it for like the first day and then it's just like, oh wait,

167
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:46.080
I gotta go to work. You know, I have to work so I can pay for this big giant,

168
00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:50.070
stupid machine that I could've just pumped a couple of quarters into and let

169
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:52.950
somebody else own in deal with the fucking maintenance. How,

170
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.730
if I was ever going to buy one, it would be asteroids.

171
00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.300
And my number two is a game that not a lot of people know about.

172
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.640
And um, I think for the most part they've all disappeared.

173
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.300
Uh, it was a fucking great game. At least I loved it.

174
00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:13.020
It was called elevators and it was basically, it, I,

175
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.590
if I vaguely remember it, it was like spy versus spy kind of thing.

176
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:19.080
You were dressed in white and all the bad guys are dressed in black,

177
00:10:19.081 --> 00:10:23.610
almost kind of looking like dressed like despite our spy from a mad magazine.

178
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.380
And you had to say,

179
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.130
you get in an elevator and on each floor they were these bad guys.

180
00:10:29.131 --> 00:10:30.240
And as you pass the floor,

181
00:10:30.241 --> 00:10:33.900
they'd be shooting at you from the writer to both from the left and yet to get

182
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:36.840
all the way up to the top of the building and get something and then come back

183
00:10:36.841 --> 00:10:37.674
down again.

184
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.600
And the worst was when you were going back down again and you'd be shooting at

185
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:46.320
the guy and the guy would duck any lay down on the floor. And as you went by,

186
00:10:46.321 --> 00:10:49.620
when you couldn't raise your gun up and it was just your head at floor level,

187
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:54.720
he'd blow your fucking brains out. Um, I used to play that one.

188
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.000
I buy either one of those, I guess. No, I wouldn't,

189
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.010
I wouldn't as fucking wasted money.

190
00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:03.150
But I'll go whenever we had a great time and I got to kill a picture of dean and

191
00:11:03.151 --> 00:11:08.130
his total fucking Rockstar pose, play in the game. And,

192
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.840
uh, I think he already tweeted it out.

193
00:11:09.841 --> 00:11:14.310
So if you look at Dean Dell race Twitter thing, you can find that shit.

194
00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:18.210
So we did that and I want to thank people at Dr Grins Comedy Club.

195
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.890
I went down there and uh, did a quick spot,

196
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.790
you know, went up, did some jokes or whatever.

197
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.920
And it was funny when Dean was up there,

198
00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:32.190
he fucking started trashing this woman who is sitting in the front row cause she

199
00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:36.000
wouldn't shut up. And I said to the other comics, go, they're gone. I've like,

200
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.010
it's one of those deals as a comedian,

201
00:11:38.011 --> 00:11:41.160
you'll be on stage and someone's talking and commenting on your jokes and then

202
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.740
you don't realize most of the crowd can hear it.

203
00:11:43.741 --> 00:11:46.740
So if you're kind of supposed to ignore it, I guess,

204
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.820
even though it's driving you nuts. So he just fucking snaps and trashes.

205
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.290
Or when I was sitting in the back of the club,

206
00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:54.070
I said to the other comedians like, you know, it's funny, we

207
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.330
<v 1>couldn't even hear what she said. Um,</v>

208
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.380
he probably should've just kept going. I go,

209
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:02.050
I've made that mistake 20,000 fucking times.

210
00:12:02.051 --> 00:12:06.310
Then I went up next and I did the exact same thing, exact same thing,

211
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:10.090
and I fucking trashed her. And then she got mad, you know,

212
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.800
said she was offended by,

213
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:14.950
for some fucking joke I did about the troops of some shit like that. It's like,

214
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:18.430
no it isn't. No it isn't. I know when you got offended, you fucking EGOMANIAC.

215
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:18.941
When I looked at it,

216
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:22.360
I said something to the effect of why would you think that you have anything

217
00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:26.230
interesting to say was one of those lines, which was just really, you know,

218
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.690
now that I've said it out loud and I've kind of gotten out of the emotion,

219
00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:32.080
it was a, I was really mean and went mean. That's what I did.

220
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.910
I went fucking mean. Um,

221
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.140
so anyways, oh, by the way, somebody tried to scam me.

222
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.250
They tried to scan all freckles. Well,

223
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.950
you think you're dealing with here so fucking red,

224
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.910
bald Ralph malf look motherfucker way you are.

225
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.300
That doesn't mean he can scam me though. They almost did.

226
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.450
If I wasn't so fucking paranoid. Um,

227
00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.260
I'm hanging in the hotel and I get this phone call and I pick it up and it's

228
00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:03.550
just this computer going, oh,

229
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.820
that saying that they were calling from apple and that there was a problem with

230
00:13:06.821 --> 00:13:10.480
my iCloud and somebody might be breaking into it and they go, you know,

231
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.960
call this number, blah blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, Oh,

232
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:17.560
you gotta be fucking kidding me. So I started and they say the number twice,

233
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.000
I can't remember it.

234
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.410
So I just start taking a guess and I punched in like out of the, you know,

235
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.360
10 numbers, you know, one, eight, eight, eight, whatever. I got about six in,

236
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:32.410
in an immediately starts dialing and I somehow get connected now, right there,

237
00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:35.440
that should've like tip me off that these people are just fishing,

238
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.630
looking for somebody to react to it.

239
00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:41.850
So I dialed like six other fucking 10 digits I needed. And then this guys,

240
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:46.810
I got low Dah, [inaudible] Dah. And I was like, yeah, you guys just call it.

241
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.510
Well what is this referring to? It was like, you fucking called me,

242
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.470
it's about my soundcloud or whatever. And they go, Oh yes, yes,

243
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:57.220
you have a security problem, a bomb. And I go, well,

244
00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.340
who's fucking fault is that? I go,

245
00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:05.050
why did you guys set up the cloud if it wasn't going to be like safe,

246
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.860
now you've exposed me all this shit because what I fucking

247
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.940
cause I downloaded the royal blood fucking album.

248
00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:15.430
Now all of a sudden somebody is going to drain my bank accounts.

249
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.680
You computer cons. I wasn't Carson,

250
00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:21.910
but I was flipping out and then he goes, so sir, we can help you.

251
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:25.780
We can help you over the phone. We just need to access your computer. I go,

252
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:29.590
you mean access my computer? And the guy just starts talking. I go, I go,

253
00:14:29.591 --> 00:14:32.410
I don't want to do that over the phone. He goes, sir, this is a very,

254
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.450
this is a secure fucker, blah blah blah. And I go, well how do I, how do I know?

255
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.720
Cause you say so basically I wouldn't fucking do it just because I was looking

256
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.890
at, I was looking at them like they were legit, but I was just like,

257
00:14:47.891 --> 00:14:50.350
well you already got hacked. Why the fuck would I go with you again?

258
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.000
Why don't I just go ahead the

259
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.130
<v 2>store. So literally got to the point, he goes, sir, this is,</v>

260
00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.300
this is a secure Bababababa. And I just kept going like, well,

261
00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.060
I don't even know who you are. You just for,

262
00:15:01.061 --> 00:15:05.680
I know you're one of the guys fucking trying to hack into my computer, dude.

263
00:15:05.681 --> 00:15:08.110
I literally felt like I was in the Bourne identity.

264
00:15:08.111 --> 00:15:10.260
You know when you don't know who to trust, you know,

265
00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:13.570
and you just fucking yelling at the other guy, go, you put your gun down,

266
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.360
you put your gun down first, right? Hmm.

267
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.460
So finally Tiki gives up on and he goes, so here's your case number and a,

268
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.610
you know, I'll fucking, you know, he said some dumb shit.

269
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.290
You've been to Turkey or Jordan recently. It's like,

270
00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:28.011
no, no.

271
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:32.720
I saw the 30 for 30 on Len bias when he fucking went one-on-one against Michael

272
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.300
Jordan. You, you call in Michigan, you fucking asshole.

273
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.990
So anyways,

274
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:43.680
he ends up transferring me and it just fucking hangs up. And then I'm like,

275
00:15:43.681 --> 00:15:44.820
flipping the fuck out.

276
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.080
So I called the guy who produces my fucking show and he just goes, why? He goes,

277
00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:52.470
yeah, apple doesn't call anybody. He goes, Nah, man, that's just bullshit.

278
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.850
So thank God I'm a paranoid jackass or I might've let something happen there.

279
00:15:56.851 --> 00:15:59.790
So I'm just putting that out there. Let you know.

280
00:15:59.791 --> 00:16:03.030
I'm sure all your young guys know what it is and you feel so smart and you're

281
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.830
going to shake your head and laugh your ass off at me on Twitter going,

282
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:10.870
<v 3>hey, Fuckin oh do you know like it's 2017 on.</v>

283
00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.940
I learned that back in 2010

284
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.003
<v 2>did ya?</v>

285
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.260
What else did you learn how not to play a guitar and then still call yourself a

286
00:16:19.261 --> 00:16:23.700
musician? I'll bill. Oh, Bill Cumberland. Let's not be the old guy here. Huh?

287
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.840
I gotta be honest with you. Uh,

288
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.370
del Ray played me some of that Scrillex guy stuff and I fucking really liked it

289
00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.290
and I thought it was way different than anybody else.

290
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.470
And that's what I'm learning. Whenever something new comes out,

291
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.130
as much as your old ears listen to it and say, what the fuck is that?

292
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.880
You just have to know that there's going to be the fucking,

293
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.640
the Jimmy Hendrix, the Richard Pryor, the Tom Brady, the James Brown,

294
00:16:48.641 --> 00:16:50.380
the fucking would they, cause it's going to be,

295
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:55.570
you gotta find out who that person is of the thing that you're listening to and

296
00:16:55.571 --> 00:16:59.200
then you can judge it. Okay? It goes by, I swear to God,

297
00:16:59.201 --> 00:17:01.750
it goes right back to New York pizza. All these fucking dopes.

298
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.590
Get off the fucking plane, the first place. That's his famous New York pizza.

299
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.070
They eat it and then they go, this pizza sucks here. It's like, no,

300
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:13.270
you didn't go to the right place. Okay. You didn't go to the right place.

301
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:14.740
And um,

302
00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:19.840
DJ's are like New York's pizza in that fucking everybody thinks they can do it,

303
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.870
you know, and everybody's claiming that they're the real fucking deal.

304
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:26.980
And everybody saying they're famous. Everybody's famous Ray, the fucking DJ.

305
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.320
And um, I actually, I really liked to, shit, I was like, you know what?

306
00:17:32.321 --> 00:17:35.920
I could actually fucking get in the car and drive, listen to this shit.

307
00:17:35.921 --> 00:17:37.360
Especially at night, like this great.

308
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:42.070
Like driving songs like the Who Eminence Front,

309
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.900
who we a one when a bunch of fucking money playing poker.

310
00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.980
That's it just gets your leave getting

311
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.080
<v 1>your car by yourself,</v>

312
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.320
the fucking window down and you listen to that songs.

313
00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:58.830
You drive up to the desert ted screen, one of the top five moments of your life.

314
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.920
Oh fuck you. I'm old. Anyways,

315
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.190
what else? What else did I want to say? Oh,

316
00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:12.630
did you guys watch all the Mayweather?

317
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:18.450
McGregor pressers as they call them, oversees the press conferences.

318
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.760
It kind of the same thing over and over again with Conor McGregor.

319
00:18:23.761 --> 00:18:25.800
He just kept going like, what the fuck?

320
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.830
What the fuck is wrong with you? He's got on a fucking tracksuit.

321
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.340
That form Voltron thing was dumb and I loved when he trashed him on that,

322
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.840
but I will tell you this,

323
00:18:39.841 --> 00:18:43.770
watching all of those people showing up for a fucking press conference,

324
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.000
they sold at the Barclays Center. They sold out with like the maple leafs play,

325
00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:49.200
I believe in Toronto.

326
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.190
The staples centered people showing up to watch a fucking press conference.

327
00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:56.910
I can tell you this, oh, cynical. Bill's going to ruin the paper view for you.

328
00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.200
Those press conferences are going to be better than the fight, you know,

329
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.440
and the fucking people that are going to order that God damn fight of the same

330
00:19:04.441 --> 00:19:08.580
fucking people that slow down on the highway to watch somebody change a fucking

331
00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:12.720
tire, um, date. It's like,

332
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:17.640
it's just beyond. It's beyond a spectacle and a people go like, hey,

333
00:19:17.641 --> 00:19:20.190
you know, I know it's a spectacle, but you know what? Just get just your,

334
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.660
a word to booking words. Um, yeah, I know I'm getting fucked in the ass,

335
00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:26.370
but hey, what do you see? What it feels like

336
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:29.020
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

337
00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:33.940
<v 1>though, that paper view can go fuck itself, Dude.</v>

338
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:38.050
They're riding on the same plane over the fucking London.

339
00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:42.190
Get the fuck Outta here and all this shit McGregor gives may whether there's one

340
00:19:42.191 --> 00:19:45.580
topic he completely avoids cause it would fuck with ticket sales,

341
00:19:45.581 --> 00:19:49.570
which kind of makes him part of the fucking bullshit of that whole thing.

342
00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.120
You know what I mean? It's just get the fuck outta here. I gave them,

343
00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:57.790
I've given that guy enough fucking God damn money giving them enough fucking

344
00:19:57.791 --> 00:20:02.260
money. I've gotten fucked enough. I've gotten fucked enough by that guy, Wade.

345
00:20:02.261 --> 00:20:05.290
Like it's professional. Boxers can't lay a fucking hand on him and I'm,

346
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.670
I'm fucking not enough.

347
00:20:06.671 --> 00:20:11.520
By the eighth round as he's Poo poo poo pointing them to fucking death. Um,

348
00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.580
now he's going to fight a guy who's not even a bar who used to box.

349
00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:20.020
I love they used to box. Yeah. There's a lot of people used to do stand up.

350
00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:24.730
You want to see them do an HBO special. Um, here's the bottom line.

351
00:20:24.731 --> 00:20:28.030
If they ever met each other in a bar and started swinging and McGregor would

352
00:20:28.031 --> 00:20:28.741
fucking kill him,

353
00:20:28.741 --> 00:20:31.990
he'd take him to the ground and then the Mayweather would know what to do.

354
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:36.490
So they've eliminated all of that. We know, Bill, you've said that.

355
00:20:36.491 --> 00:20:40.210
So I don't know. Um, anyways,

356
00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.790
maybe McGregor's, I mean,

357
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.010
Mayweather's ego maybe tries to knock him out and I'm just not,

358
00:20:45.011 --> 00:20:48.070
I'm not going to fucking watch it. I'm really, I think what

359
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.310
<v 2>I'm going to do is I'm going to get out on the highway when the fucking fight is</v>

360
00:20:51.311 --> 00:20:54.040
on and just cruise down the highway doing 90 miles an hour.

361
00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:56.140
Just looking around going like, this is what it should be like.

362
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.700
Like if I was running shit,

363
00:20:57.701 --> 00:20:59.860
this would be the level of people that were in the world.

364
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:05.200
I was joking on my aunt this weekend in grand rapids

365
00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:05.581
<v 1>saying,</v>

366
00:21:05.581 --> 00:21:10.110
you know what I would do if I was running shit on the night of the Mayweather

367
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.830
McGregor fight, I would turn all the buffalo wild wings into gas chambers.

368
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:20.670
All those fucking mouth breathing morons that were jerseys, you know,

369
00:21:20.671 --> 00:21:25.380
with other men's names on the bag. Oh all day, dude. I called it,

370
00:21:25.381 --> 00:21:28.800
all of those guys just, you just gone.

371
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.080
All of them gone and you'd watch. I bet. I bet the, the main,

372
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.170
the level of maintenance on, on, on the Internet would go down.

373
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:39.183
<v 5>You know</v>

374
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:40.751
<v 1>these five, by the way,</v>

375
00:21:40.751 --> 00:21:44.860
these fucking people now who just sit there and they watch CNN or Fox all day

376
00:21:44.861 --> 00:21:49.270
long and then they show up to you and they just start vomiting out all this

377
00:21:49.271 --> 00:21:52.090
fucking fearful shit that they just watched.

378
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.350
And then after they do that and get you all stirred up,

379
00:21:56.351 --> 00:21:59.200
they don't even have the decency to offer a fucking solution.

380
00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.740
All these fucking morons. It's just like,

381
00:22:02.741 --> 00:22:04.990
why would you sit there and watch Fox News all day? Easily.

382
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:09.370
That's all you're going to do. Watch a little CNN balance out. You fucking lies.

383
00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:14.530
Keep yourself level fucking what's his face?

384
00:22:14.531 --> 00:22:16.270
My buddy was telling me this weekend, you know, it's got to,

385
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:17.740
global warming is going to get so hot,

386
00:22:17.741 --> 00:22:20.230
you know the saying they're not going to be able to fly planes on a LaGuardia

387
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.440
and I'm the, and I'm eating. I'm thinking like, oh,

388
00:22:23.441 --> 00:22:26.470
how the fuck am I going to be comedian anymore? You know? And then that was it.

389
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.960
He didn't offer any fucking solutions. He just let me know like, Hey,

390
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.360
in the future you're going to be able to do your job.

391
00:22:31.361 --> 00:22:33.730
And then I'm starting to fucking think about, you know,

392
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:39.250
me and my family living out in the street. All I want to do is just,

393
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.820
I just want to play a little last rights.

394
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.473
<v 5>You know,</v>

395
00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.960
<v 1>if you don't have a fucking solution, don't bring up the goddamn problem. Okay?</v>

396
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.390
Like I brought the Connor McGregor Mayweather,

397
00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.390
<v 5>alright?</v>

398
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.060
<v 1>I said it's a fucking problem. I gave you your solution.</v>

399
00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:59.710
You drive on the highway 90 miles an hour and you turn the buffalo wild wings

400
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.890
into a gas chamber. See that? See that? I'm a good guy.

401
00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:08.440
Everybody else is an idiot in my world. I'm the smartest person in the,

402
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:13.010
<v 2>sorry. Well we went for the fuck. Do you want for me? You know,</v>

403
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:18.170
watching my kid all day today, my wife's fucking tired. He,

404
00:23:18.171 --> 00:23:20.420
I can't type in my God damn password. I'm not watching it now,

405
00:23:20.421 --> 00:23:23.860
obviously while I'm doing the, the podcast.

406
00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:25.240
But that's only because I curse so much.

407
00:23:25.241 --> 00:23:26.980
I'm trying not to do that in front of her,

408
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:30.370
which I know I'm going to fail fucking miserably. Um,

409
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:35.110
do I get to take something to be like being a dad is just shit. It really is.

410
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.950
I fucking love it. It's, the best thing about it is watching kids shows,

411
00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:44.050
I dunno if I'm a fucking moron or whatever, but I am legitimately entertained.

412
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:48.810
We started watching cars this morning. It's tremendous. I mean,

413
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.110
you know what it is. I haven't watched cartoons. It's so fucking long.

414
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.100
It's like the level of animation on those things. It's crazy.

415
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.030
Like I think I saw one of those toy stories, one or two of them.

416
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.740
But you know, when, when you, when you don't have a kid, it's like, you know,

417
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.480
why would you go see one of those

418
00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:10.710
<v 1>unless you smoke weed? Like, hey man, let's get high and go see fucking toys,</v>

419
00:24:10.711 --> 00:24:14.760
man. Right. Or, you know, you're dating a woman.

420
00:24:14.761 --> 00:24:16.740
They always like seeing those. They're cute.

421
00:24:16.741 --> 00:24:20.940
I like to message and he ended up going there and you just sit in there.

422
00:24:20.941 --> 00:24:23.580
I just fucking, um, I remember I saw one of those toys stories,

423
00:24:23.581 --> 00:24:26.930
like they were going down something and they will all get this conveyor belt and

424
00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:31.320
they went into a pit of flames and the level of fucking anxiety that it brought

425
00:24:31.321 --> 00:24:34.260
me, I got like angry at the movie. Like, this is a fucking kid's movie.

426
00:24:34.261 --> 00:24:35.430
I shouldn't be feeling this way.

427
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.590
<v 2>Why do I care so much about these goddamn toys? Um,</v>

428
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.770
which is one of the reasons why I don't watch movies is because I,

429
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:45.540
I take the fucking ride.

430
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:48.520
<v 1>You know, when people watch scary movies, they go to,</v>

431
00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.880
that movie didn't scare me. They all scare the fuck out of me cause I just, I,

432
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.430
I take the fucking ride.

433
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:54.930
<v 2>Okay.</v>

434
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.990
<v 1>I never just, I never fucking pull myself out and look around the theater.</v>

435
00:24:57.991 --> 00:25:00.420
Gonads, it's just a movie. There's no reason to get this fucking upset.

436
00:25:00.421 --> 00:25:03.420
This is stupid. That's just an actor. I want how many takes they did.

437
00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:06.030
I don't do that. I get sucked in and it's fucking over.

438
00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:07.691
<v 2>It's fucking over.</v>

439
00:25:07.691 --> 00:25:11.770
And then I ended up getting freaked out and I walked to my car,

440
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.960
you know, and I'm thinking of the fucking Blair, which is going to get me. Um,

Me Trying to read out loud. All right. Frame. Bridge everybody. Okay.

449
00:25:40.691 --> 00:25:44.650
Could you do me a huge favor and handle this big pain in the ass fucking job?

450
00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:46.683
Um,

451
00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.270
but if you're actually cool and you don't want to do that to your wife or your

452
00:25:49.271 --> 00:25:51.760
husband or your fucking transgendered person, whatever,

453

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.350
maybe a real Gore phobic and asexual

455
00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.110
<v 2>split personality. Don't do it together. Person in you. Okay?</v>

456
00:26:01.111 --> 00:26:02.830

years. I don't even know where it is.

488
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:59.210
It's on a hard drive in the back of my closet and I took so many fucking

they should have a fucking website, a useless cell phone picks.

493

You know those ones you just have.

494
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.420
You took a screenshot of something because you needed to remember a phone number

495
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.870
and then like months later you're scrolling back trying to find that picture.

496
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.000
You when you got on the hang glider and one of the photos,

497
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.130
you got to scroll past this,

498
00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:32.210
the fucking one 800 number for the smokey Robinson cds, you know,

499
00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:35.280
I don't know.

500
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.490
Would that be funny to sit there and look at the top 10 worthless cell phone

501
00:28:38.491 --> 00:28:42.090
photos of the day and then people would do it on purpose so it probably be cool

Show Chad sleep like everyone else. So why is your mattress?

510
00:29:11.461 --> 00:29:14.190
Why is your mattress one size fits all?

511
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:19.670
Because a truly customized mattress will cost you five to 10,000 bucks until

512
00:29:20.191 --> 00:29:23.460
now. I can't believe that's the right number.

00:29:40.221 --> 00:29:44.950
nomics and mechanic experts. The results our robot shows up to the door,

518
00:29:44.951 --> 00:29:48.760
punches you in the face through the mattress that you ordered and becomes you.

519
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:53.230
Sorry. The most comfortable mattress you've ever slept on.

520
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:59.110
Helix customers report a 30% improvement in overall sleep quality and for

521
00:29:59.111 --> 00:30:01.450
couples, they customize each side of the mattress.

522
00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:03.640
That's the end of the relationship right there.

523
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:05.650
You're starting to build separate lives.

I'm just kidding. Nobody who drinks wine is a women.

567
00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:48.980
Do women drink wine after they put the kids down, right?

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.300
And they pull it out a fucking bite.

598
00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:34.040
I didn't even talk about the f one race. Did you guys watch it?

599
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:38.330
Did you check it out? Louis Hamilton closing the gap.

600
00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:43.190
Only down by one point. Catching up on Sebastian Vettel.

601
00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:47.990
What happened to the Ferrari's out there in fucking Great Britain

602
00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:53.150
or was it Kimmie raking in whatever his fucking name is, he's driving,

603
00:34:53.151 --> 00:34:55.700
he's in third place. He's loving life for second place,

604
00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:00.440
whatever he was in his front tire bough fucking blows out with like fucking four

605
00:35:00.441 --> 00:35:04.700
or five laps to go and then he fucking gets on the radio. The towns,

606
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:08.750
they're like Gaba B man. He goes to for the fucking front to tie. Right.

607
00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.090
So he's got to go in Vettel moves up.

608
00:35:11.091 --> 00:35:15.410
He's going to be on the podium as much as fucking a Lewis.

609
00:35:15.411 --> 00:35:17.270
Hamilton's going to pick up 25 points.

610
00:35:17.271 --> 00:35:21.350
He's going to pick up at least fucking 15, if not 18. Right. Who knows?

611
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:23.930
You know, and all of a sudden fucking two laps ago,

612
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:29.060
his fucking tire goes up front left one. Right. And then all the towns,

613
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:32.420
you're like, mom, mommy. Yeah. Right. And fucking Vettel's all God damn pissed.

614
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.470
I think I have. I think I know who my favorite fucking driver is though.

615
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.870
I liked that. I,

616
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:41.290
<v 2>how have you seen his first name? Black Veltin. Valtteri uh,</v>

617
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:45.240
[inaudible] that guy. That guy can fucking drive.

618
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.370
He went from ninth place all the way to second place.

619
00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.110
Now I know I've talked about Lewis Hamilton and these guys go in from fucking,

620
00:35:52.111 --> 00:35:55.080
you know, nights like, uh, what's his face yesterday?

621
00:35:55.081 --> 00:35:57.630
The Australian fucking dude, they're the good,

622
00:35:57.631 --> 00:36:02.520
the happiest guy in fucking Formula One. Uh, uh, Jesus Christ by,

623
00:36:02.521 --> 00:36:04.300
I swear to God up and all the fucking names in front of me.

624
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.960
You know what as it said, raking in, there's too many Rs.

625
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:10.980
There's too many fucking like crazy fucking the nerve of these people

626
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:15.940
[inaudible] from like other cultures is, it was a date is a Dave. They fucking a

627
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.880
Jesus guy. I only met the fucking guy. I've only been rooting for them.

628
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:22.500
Daniel Ricardo. There we go.

629
00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.450
The fuck it would pop back into my head as much as those guys have gone from

630
00:36:27.451 --> 00:36:30.390
like 19th to fucking, you know, seventh or eighth,

631
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.710
the 15th to whatever it is.

632
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:35.910
I think it's harder to go from ninth all the way up to second because you get

633
00:36:35.911 --> 00:36:40.911
into like the best of the best drivers to fucking go pass driver number five,

634
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.470
four three to get all the way up to that.

635
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:47.280
Starting as far back as he did with the Mercedes. Once again,

636
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:48.960
having a gearbox issue.

637
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:52.440
That's what happens with Mercedes state fabric gearbox issue.

638
00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:56.940
When they get a five spot fucking penalty and evidentaly I don't know who the

639
00:36:56.941 --> 00:37:00.990
fuck it is that's supposed to be working on that fucking shock absorber on the

640
00:37:00.991 --> 00:37:04.010
front left hand side of the car where the fin or the fucking tire,

641
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.730
whatever the fuck it is. One of those guys.

642
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.670
Where are the underoos with the helmet on in the pit.

643
00:37:08.671 --> 00:37:10.170
Somebody back there is getting a fucking,

644
00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:15.480
he's getting no pasta this week on the Ferrari team. So, um,

645
00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:20.100
what's his face? Vettel was up by like, I don't know how many fucking points.

646
00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.490
Um, I forgot what place he came in.

647
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:29.060
I think he got like six or eight points and he was up by like t he was up by 20

648
00:37:29.161 --> 00:37:31.260
points before the race started. I can do the math here.

649
00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:34.650
And by the end of the race, he was only up by one. Uh,

650
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:39.000
this is like a fucking math test. So Lewis Hamilton got 25 points,

651
00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:44.700
so he outscored him by fucking 24. So what do you come in? 10th Place?

652
00:37:44.701 --> 00:37:48.930
He got one point. No, that'd be 24.

653
00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:54.630
He got four points. All right, so he came in, he came in like eighth, right?

654
00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:57.390
I think he came in eighth. All right. Whatever. Why,

655
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:58.350
why the fuck would you care?

656
00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:01.650
So they got one more race before they take the break in the summertime.

657
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:05.940
Like they're like their lives on fucking great enough. They're part of like,

658
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.260
like literally 20 people who can do this in the fucking universe. All right.

659
00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:13.370
They get to take the fucking summer off. I'm like, these poor bastards.

660
00:38:13.371 --> 00:38:16.930
I played fucking baseball who got to pay like fucking six to seven games a

661
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:22.320
goddamn week. You know, these guys get to take the summer off.

662
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:27.090
Granted the you have to still diet, you know, but you know,

663
00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:29.870
even if they have like a shake, then they can, they can fucking get rid of it.

664
00:38:29.871 --> 00:38:33.410
Bang in a supermodel, you know, fuck sweat it out of them. I mean,

665
00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:37.620
their lives are unbelievable. Louis Hamilton and fucking, uh,

666
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.200
what's his face? Botox. They both live in Monaco. It's unbel. It's like,

667
00:38:41.201 --> 00:38:44.710
it's not enough that you get know he's got the private jet.

668
00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:48.430
Like these fucking guys lives are unbelievable. It's fucking tremendous.

669
00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:51.000
God bless them. Hey, what's going on with the fucking,

670
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.540
the other red bull team that's not red bull. The blue ones. The fucking

671
00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:01.030
what the hell? What the, what did they do that the Toro Rosso fucking team,

672
00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:04.090
whatever the fuck they're called. Jesus Christ.

673
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:07.390
They were doing their impression of the force India team fucking slamming into

674
00:39:07.391 --> 00:39:10.420
each other. I love when that happens. I love that.

675
00:39:10.421 --> 00:39:14.370
And reminds me that fucking a, that movie stepbrothers.

676
00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:18.670
They doing like the Formula One version of putting their balls on will Ferrell's

677
00:39:18.671 --> 00:39:21.670
drum kit. Oh No, he put it on the other guy's drum kit. That's right.

678
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:24.880
I don't know. Anyways, let's get to the fucking questions this week.

679
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.153
<v 8>Um,</v>

680
00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:31.920
<v 2>oh, by the way, all things comedies own Iresha fears, new double Netflix,</v>

681
00:39:31.921 --> 00:39:34.010
special airs Tuesday [inaudible],

682
00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.293
<v 8>um,</v>

683
00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:41.510
<v 2>July 18th, both double negative, uh, both, uh,</v>

684
00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:46.570
both double negative children and double negative adulthood will be available in

685
00:39:46.791 --> 00:39:51.200
190 countries. That's incredible, Huh? The reach,

686
00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:55.550
the sheer reach of Netflix. All right. Feminism. Everybody.

687
00:39:55.551 --> 00:39:58.370
Let's do some fucking reets here for the Goddamn Week. Shall We?

688
00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:02.390
I got 20 minutes left here in this fucking podcast. Um,

689
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:04.583
all right. Feminism.

690
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:09.620
Bill a on a recent podcast when discussing stewardesses and air travel,

691
00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.190
you mentioned that you sometimes thing,

692
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:15.500
I think you meant to say think feminism

693
00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:20.420
<v 1>is a way for ugly women to get jobs that attractive women used to have.</v>

694
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:24.680
I said that. Why do you guys take anything? I say seriously? You understand?

695
00:40:24.681 --> 00:40:27.860
I'm just riffing for a fucking hour and I'm trying to make you laugh by saying

696
00:40:27.861 --> 00:40:31.090
ridiculously over the top things somebody's going to write me in a few weeks ago

697
00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:33.080
. Hey Bill, a few weeks ago on your podcast,

698
00:40:33.081 --> 00:40:36.200
you suggested turning buffalo wild wings into gas chambers.

699
00:40:36.201 --> 00:40:40.730
On the night of the Mayweather McGregor fight. Uh, just to let you know,

700
00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:43.400
I am a parent. I am not a fight fan,

701
00:40:43.401 --> 00:40:48.200
but I do enjoy the fucking Jalapeno balls,

702
00:40:48.201 --> 00:40:49.170
whatever the fuck they're called

703
00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:55.220
<v 2>at buffalo wild wings. And what if I was there anyways?</v>

704
00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:57.300
<v 8>Um,</v>

705
00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.100
<v 1>I wonder if, okay, you,</v>

706
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:02.760
I Vanilli I said that feminism is a way for ugly women to get jobs that

707
00:41:02.761 --> 00:41:06.600
attractive women used to have. That's fucking hilarious.

708
00:41:06.601 --> 00:41:09.240
I don't necessarily believe that, but there is an element of truth to that.

709
00:41:09.241 --> 00:41:11.040
Like, you know, when they are always bitching, like, you know,

710
00:41:11.041 --> 00:41:15.750
Hollywood creates this impossible image of beauty. It's like, no,

711
00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.100
you can't. You can't.

712
00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:18.490
<v 2>Okay.</v>

713
00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:20.860
<v 1>You, your fear of fucking EGOMANIAC. I don't think,</v>

714
00:41:20.861 --> 00:41:24.190
when I look at a Brad Pitt or whoever the fucking guy is now,

715
00:41:24.191 --> 00:41:27.100
Brad Pitt's like in his fifties now, so wherever the fucking shredded,

716
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.970
who's the guy from say by the belt? Mario Lopez. You know when I don't,

717
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:34.640
when I looked at him with his pigment at his fucking abs and all that,

718
00:41:34.641 --> 00:41:39.050
I don't fucking go, God, this is an impossible fucking oh Jesus,

719
00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.810
this is an impossible standard for me to,

720
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:47.710
to a standard for me to hold up to and therefore Mario Lopez should be on

721
00:41:48.711 --> 00:41:53.120
fucking TV anymore. I just understand that. Yeah. You know what?

722
00:41:53.121 --> 00:41:57.410
On a good day, maybe I'm a six. Okay. That's what I am.

723
00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:02.660
Not Everybody can bet clean up in the order. Okay. If you fucking bad nature,

724
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:05.930
quit your crying and get on base. That's it.

725
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:08.780
Maybe I do believe that on some level anyways,

726
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:13.990
I wonder if you know that this is actually rush Limbaugh's undeniable truth of

727
00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:19.331
life number 24 specifically that feminism was established so as to allow

728
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:24.791
unattractive women to access access to the mainstream of society.

729
00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:31.850
Um, here's the thing I'm saying this shit,

730
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.650
I'm like 90% joking.

731
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:37.250
There's always like an element of truth that guy as far as I could tell,

732
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:41.090
cause I don't know what his act is. It might all just be an act, you know,

733
00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:44.150
so he can eat cause he is in show business. So I have no idea.

734
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:47.780
It could just be an act. But if you actually truly believe that I don't,

735
00:42:47.781 --> 00:42:52.010
I listen, I don't believe that. Okay. Um,

736
00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:57.140
feminism came about because men were not allowing women to pursue their dreams.

737
00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.333
Okay.

738
00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:03.140
But like any cause any cause for whatever reason along the way,

739
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:07.280
a lot of the times you end up becoming what the fuck you have fighting. Okay.

740
00:43:07.281 --> 00:43:10.130
And that's not this unique thought. I realized that's a hacky thought,

741
00:43:10.131 --> 00:43:11.420
but it's fucking true.

742
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:16.690
The level of bullying that goes on on the Internet and trying to get people to

743
00:43:17.841 --> 00:43:21.380
get fired and trying to create firestorms and trying to,

744
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:26.560
trying to show the power of women buy a lot of times attacking people who you're

745
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:32.360
deliberately and knowingly taking what they said out of context and causing them

746
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:36.750
to not have a fucking job is fucking reprehensible. All right.

747
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:41.770
And they in a lot of ways do the same Reptilian,

748
00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:47.000
if the ends justify the means corporate fucking mentality,

749
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:51.890
just some of the shit that that is set out there. Um, yeah, look, I,

750
00:43:51.891 --> 00:43:55.100
I don't think that it's actually that, but sometimes they think it's that,

751
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.670
you know, there are jobs that you should only get if you're good looking.

752
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:05.000
You know, I, I really believe that like, uh, like when when you, you know,

753
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:10.040
the first person that they're going to fucking walk in the top of your order,

754
00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.500
you got to go with Ricky Henderson. You know,

755
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:14.720
you gotta get somebody who's going to get on base,

756
00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:21.260
you're gonna put the fucking picture up. You know?

757
00:44:21.261 --> 00:44:25.790
And I, I feel like I can say this because of how I look. Mike,

758
00:44:25.791 --> 00:44:28.490
if I ran a company, I'm not putting me on the front desk.

759
00:44:28.491 --> 00:44:33.390
Like I'm the first person you're going to say, why would you do that?

760
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:37.230
We're trying to make money here. You know,

761
00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:41.550
I don't like high schools over, look in the mirror, love yourself,

762
00:44:41.551 --> 00:44:45.150
but I have a sense of humor about yourself. Know that you're not perfect.

763
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:46.990
And just know that it's okay. And you know what?

764
00:44:46.991 --> 00:44:51.390
A lot of times if you steer into that shit and you have a sense of humor about

765
00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:56.310
yourself, you're fun to be around. How many times do I call myself a pasty,

766
00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:01.260
bald, freckled fucking jackass telling you,

767
00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:05.250
you fucking stare into it and you fucking age gracefully. All right?

768
00:45:05.251 --> 00:45:06.600
You start to lose your fucking hair.

769
00:45:06.601 --> 00:45:09.630
You just shave you fucking head and just be that guy. Everybody's like,

770
00:45:09.631 --> 00:45:13.020
what the fuck and that. But you know what? You deal with the that people fought,

771
00:45:13.021 --> 00:45:16.440
they respect Ya. Okay, this guy came down the pike.

772
00:45:16.441 --> 00:45:17.730
He didn't even try to shake it off.

773
00:45:17.731 --> 00:45:19.630
He took the pitch right to the side of the head area.

774
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.880
Is he standing on first base? Good for you. You ugly bald son of a bitch,

775
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:27.760
right? And this is the thing too. I know that they need us,

776
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:30.750
we bald son of a bitches in movies and I'll just audition for that.

777
00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.710
At the end of the fucking day, I'm in a movie. Am I really going to complain?

778
00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.030
You know, I feel fucking

779
00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:43.250
fucking bald. Freckled red head should be starring, right. More movies.

780
00:45:43.251 --> 00:45:44.780
It's like, Oh yeah, you want to put your money,

781
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:49.160
put your money where your mouth is, you go finance that fucking movie. Uh,

782
00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:51.790
yeah. And a lot of ways,

783
00:45:51.791 --> 00:45:56.630
that's one of those things where it's everybody should get like a, a, a ribbon.

784
00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.960
I mean, I don't know what the solution is, but you like,

785
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:04.840
competition is a good thing. Okay. And the best,

786
00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.990
you know, the best should, should win.

787
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:10.583
<v 5>Right?</v>

788
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.611
<v 1>Mike? I'm, I'm,</v>

789
00:46:12.611 --> 00:46:15.740
I'm all with it as far as everybody should have the same opportunity,

790
00:46:15.741 --> 00:46:19.310
but after that, go fuck yourself. Whoever's the best gets it,

791
00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:21.530
you know, not like, well,

792
00:46:21.531 --> 00:46:25.490
we have enough of these people or enough of those know who are the fucking best.

793
00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:28.100
Okay. When we have to keep doing that, because at some point,

794
00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:31.860
if the aliens aren't already here, they're coming here and we,

795
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:33.860
we need to have an all star fucking team,

796
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:38.180
not a team that makes everybody feel represented. All right, Dan, we go.

797
00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.360
I hope I explained myself or you know, I'll,

798
00:46:41.361 --> 00:46:44.150
I'll know if I'm right if I don't get a call from the rush Limbaugh show asking

799
00:46:44.151 --> 00:46:48.140
me if I want to be a guest. Alright.

800
00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:52.210
Brother x feminine. Dear Billy Boyo,

801
00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:56.670
a relative, relatively new fan here. I love humor. My tea.

802
00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:59.260
Love your material and I hope to see you live one day. I'll thank you.

803
00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:00.400
Before I start,

804
00:47:00.401 --> 00:47:05.401
I want to say that I don't care if my brother is gay to each his own is my

805
00:47:05.651 --> 00:47:09.430
motto. Okay. Now for the back story. There you go. That's what I do.

806
00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.271
You've established,

807
00:47:10.271 --> 00:47:13.540
you've given yourself credibility because you said that you're a good person.

808
00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:16.600
All right. I'm 17 about to be a senior in high school.

809
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:20.050
My brother is 11 and is about to start middle school.

810
00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:24.520
I feel like other kids will view him as an easy target for a few reasons. First,

811
00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:28.720
he doesn't have many guy friends and he hangs out with a lot of ladies. Second,

812
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:33.190
I do. I try to do masculine things with them. I played baseball,

813
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:37.420
so I always ask him to play catch with me and I even offered to teach him how to

814
00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:39.070
play the sport.

815
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:43.510
He usually says no when I try to do any sort of physical activity with them.

816
00:47:43.511 --> 00:47:47.350
He rejects my requests and just does his own thing. Third,

817
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:50.740
his body language is quite feminine. He sits like a girl,

818
00:47:50.741 --> 00:47:54.850
talks like a girl and moves his hands like a girl. You know what I'm saying?

819
00:47:54.851 --> 00:47:59.830
And the thing that ladies and gay guys do with their hands, oh,

820
00:47:59.831 --> 00:48:00.431
you know what I'm saying?

821
00:48:00.431 --> 00:48:03.130
The thing that ladies and gay guys do with their hands when they talk,

822
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:06.490
my gut tells me to sit down and have a talk with him,

823
00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.910
but I don't want to come off too blunt and hurt his feelings. Then again,

824
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:14.680
that could be what he needs. A, I think if I tell him what I'm thinking,

825
00:48:14.681 --> 00:48:18.190
he'll just blow it off just like me. He's very hot headed.

826
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.710
I'm sorry about the hyphen.

827
00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:25.960
I personally blame his behavior on the pussification of society over the past

828
00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:29.650
few years and the very progressive environment of modern day schooling.

829
00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:32.710
He's a good kid and he's got a good head on his shoulders.

830
00:48:32.711 --> 00:48:35.470
So I'm not worried about anything else. I'm just looking out for them.

831
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:38.530
I don't want any dickheads messing with him. I used to get bullied,

832
00:48:38.531 --> 00:48:41.170
so I know how it feels. What do you thinks, uh,

833
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.870
thanks for your help and go fuck yourself. All right.

834
00:48:43.871 --> 00:48:48.130
I think you're 17 and I think you love your brother and you're trying to protect

835
00:48:48.131 --> 00:48:48.964
him.

836
00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:55.200
<v 8>Um, here's the deal dude. Uh,</v>

837
00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:00.480
<v 1>I mean your brother is who your brother is. You got to accept that.</v>

838
00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:03.330
<v 8>And um,</v>

839
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.450
<v 1>I don't know how you handle the bullying thing,</v>

840
00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:11.700
which is I what I really think is what you see when you look at your brother's

841
00:49:11.701 --> 00:49:13.530
like this kid's going to get the shit kicked out of them.

842
00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:15.913
<v 8>Um,</v>

843
00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.270
<v 1>which is, uh, you know, sad to say, you know,</v>

844
00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:25.030
hopefully not as much as when I was coming up, but yeah,

845
00:49:25.031 --> 00:49:29.380
that is, uh, that is a, it's a legit concern. Um,

846
00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.230
<v 8>but, um,</v>

847
00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.540
<v 1>I don't think you listen, people are born how they're born. Okay.</v>

848
00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:38.550
I don't know if this kid's gay or not. I don't know what,

849
00:49:38.551 --> 00:49:40.950
but if he doesn't want to play catch, he doesn't want to play catch.

850
00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:45.960
And if he's hot headed, you know, he sounded, he said he's a smart kid,

851
00:49:45.961 --> 00:49:47.580
he's hothead, he knows what he wants.

852
00:49:47.581 --> 00:49:51.510
So just let him be himself and you support them.

853
00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:55.080
And there is no reason why this kid, he doesn't like to do physical shit.

854
00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:56.730
I was gonna say, take him down to with Dojo,

855
00:49:56.731 --> 00:50:00.270
teach them how to fuck somebody up and um,

856
00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:03.780
the fact that he is a feminine, if he goes and fuck somebody up,

857
00:50:03.781 --> 00:50:06.480
that's going to be humiliating for the other person and then nobody else is

858
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:09.000
gonna want to fuck with them cause they don't want to get beat up by him.

859
00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:11.490
Bruce Lee used to do that. Bruce Lee used to, I've read this book,

860
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:14.520
used to walk around and he would act all the feminine and then these guys would

861
00:50:14.521 --> 00:50:17.480
come up and fuck with them and then he would kick the shit out of him.

862
00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:19.470
People ask them, well why would you do that? He said, well,

863
00:50:19.471 --> 00:50:23.580
if I just walked up like a regular dude, you know, they got their ass kicked,

864
00:50:23.581 --> 00:50:24.850
they could get over it. But if, you know,

865
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:28.190
they thought they got their ass kicked by his sissy, you know,

866
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:33.030
<v 2>it stays with them. And unfortunately that is something with guys, if,</v>

867
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:37.550
if you know, if people were more progressive or whatever the fucking word is,

868
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:39.890
they wouldn't think that. And they'd just be like, well,

869
00:50:39.891 --> 00:50:42.110
it doesn't make a difference if you're a feminine or masculine.

870
00:50:42.111 --> 00:50:45.800
If you can fucking throw hands over there with a couple of feet seas,

871
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:48.560
I can, I can accept a loss.

872
00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.113
<v 8>Um,</v>

873
00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:54.270
<v 2>I listen, I would just, uh, if anything,</v>

874
00:50:54.271 --> 00:50:58.740
I would try to have a closer relationship with my younger brother and um,

875
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:03.040
and I would ask him how his days are going and I would just literally ask him,

876
00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:07.560
has anybody at school fucking with you or whatever. And uh,

877
00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:10.190
if they are, I don't know. I would go down and have a fucking till.

878
00:51:10.191 --> 00:51:12.570
I don't know if he could do that. I don't know what to do. I Dunno what to do.

879
00:51:12.571 --> 00:51:14.550
But that would, that as an older brother that would kill me,

880
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.090
knowing that somebody could be fucking with my younger brothers.

881
00:51:17.091 --> 00:51:21.960
So I think you come from a good place, uh, your ideas of, uh,

882
00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:26.800
you know how to cure him of that are understandable because you're 17.

883
00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:31.230
I don't think it's society's fault. Um, I,

884
00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:35.230
I just think that's just how he's born. And I think if you accept it,

885
00:51:35.290 --> 00:51:39.850
he will accept it and he'll keep a, a good feeling about himself. But,

886
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:41.140
um,

887
00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.810
unfortunately the bullying is going to come and he's going to have to learn how

888
00:51:43.811 --> 00:51:48.130
to stick up for himself. I mean, that's just the truth of it. And, um,

889
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:49.933
<v 8>okay.</v>

890
00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:53.170
<v 2>There's all kinds of things that you could do that I'm not allowed to say on the</v>

891
00:51:53.171 --> 00:51:58.171
podcast as far as what he could do in those moments because somehow I become

892
00:51:58.391 --> 00:52:01.300
this fucking bad person. But, uh,

893
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:05.460
I'm just going to tell a random story here.

894
00:52:05.461 --> 00:52:07.860
I remember what show the late Charlie Murphy rest his soul.

895
00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:11.760
He told me to do what to do if you ever go to jail. And I just,

896
00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:18.240
he was like, you know, not let, I could still survive.

897
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:21.720
He just like, Yo, this is what you do. He goes,

898
00:52:21.721 --> 00:52:24.270
the first motherfucker that steps to you, he goes,

899
00:52:24.271 --> 00:52:28.560
you just turn into a wild animal fraud than at the mouth and you just fucking

900
00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:32.770
swing for the fences and everybody, you know what I,

901
00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:36.090
I'm over simplifying what the fuck he said. And um,

902
00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:40.050
you know, that's just a story he told me.

903
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:44.220
That has nothing to do with what I just fucking read. Okay.

904
00:52:44.221 --> 00:52:47.460
I want to do that so I stay free and clear. I don't know what to tell you buddy.

905
00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:51.630
All right. Uh, let him be who he is and um, you know,

906
00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:54.240
I would watch some MMA events with them and maybe he'll want to learn how to

907
00:52:54.241 --> 00:52:57.210
fucking do it. I Dunno. I Dunno. Cause I watched some,

908
00:52:57.211 --> 00:53:01.590
some cool videos of some kids that were way out of their own way class.

909
00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:06.660
This one fucking kid. Fuck this kid up, jumped up, put them in a fucking arm.

910
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:09.810
This kid, he didn't know what the fuck to do. Um,

911
00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:14.340
maybe you can help them out with that, but uh, yeah,

912
00:53:14.341 --> 00:53:17.670
I would let go of all that other shit that you're going to fucking, I mean, if,

913
00:53:17.671 --> 00:53:22.110
if like your be who you are. I mean, if somebody,

914
00:53:22.111 --> 00:53:23.610
when you go out in the driveway and,

915
00:53:23.611 --> 00:53:25.980
and still learn how to twirl a baton just would still

916
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.780
<v 1>be you. But you'd know how to twirl a baton.</v>

917
00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:32.070
I don't think it would change how you walked or behaved or who you hung out

918
00:53:32.071 --> 00:53:35.590
with. Um, you're wired how you wired. All right. Uh,

919
00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:37.620
girlfriend wants to move back to her home.

920
00:53:37.621 --> 00:53:39.030
That's like those fucking people that, you know,

921
00:53:39.031 --> 00:53:43.520
they would try to cure gay people. You know, they think that they can, like,

922
00:53:43.521 --> 00:53:45.440
it's a, like they have the mumps or something,

923
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:50.840
a girlfriend wants to move back to her home country. Uh,

924
00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:53.300
<v 4>all right.</v>

925
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:57.530
<v 1>Hey, Bill Hill. If the guy took the woman's last name in marriage, that's funny.</v>

926
00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:02.300
All right. Longtime listener. First Time advice seeker. I live in London.

927
00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:07.680
I met my girlfriend online a year and a half ago. She's 25 and I'm 24.

928
00:54:07.681 --> 00:54:10.020
She's from Switzerland. See this is what happens now.

929
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.470
All these fucking dating apps, fun fact about Switzerland,

930
00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:17.700
they have enough nuclear bunkers to accommodate their entire population.

931
00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:23.250
Uh, yeah. This because they're so close to fucking Germany. Um,

932
00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:27.330
they moved here a few years ago to get a music. Uh,

933
00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.370
she moved here a few years ago to get a music degree in. Graduated,

934
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:34.260
graduated last year. She was going to move in with a friend a few months ago,

935
00:54:34.261 --> 00:54:36.810
but her best friend did a one 80 at the last second.

936
00:54:36.811 --> 00:54:40.260
So we decided to move in together as we enjoy each other's company.

937
00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:41.910
Here's the shit part.

938
00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:44.910
She always said that she misses her family and her friends a lot,

939
00:54:44.911 --> 00:54:46.530
which is of course understandable.

940
00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:50.010
But recently she's been mentioning that she wants to move back to Switzerland

941
00:54:50.011 --> 00:54:53.880
once our lease is up next year. I completely get why she want to do this.

942
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:55.890
She doesn't have many friends here,

943
00:54:56.790 --> 00:55:01.530
a as many over college friends have moved back home.

944
00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:02.341
The thing is,

945
00:55:02.341 --> 00:55:05.280
I have established an established career here and I don't want to leave my

946
00:55:05.281 --> 00:55:09.510
friends or job behind to go move to a country where I don't speak the language

947
00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:14.280
I've tried, but there are hardly any courses for Swiss. Slash. German.

948
00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:15.450
<v 4>Okay.</v>

949
00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:17.790
<v 1>I'm in the market for my skills is much smaller.</v>

950
00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.530
I'm a magician and academic tutor,

951
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:27.090
Jesus is a fucking Combo. Uh, whenever she brings it up,

952
00:55:27.091 --> 00:55:29.820
I answer with very variations of, well, uh,

953
00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:32.790
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it,

954
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.820
but I'm pretty sure I'm never going to come around to the idea.

955
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:40.230
She has made the point a couple of times that this would be me choosing my

956
00:55:40.231 --> 00:55:43.920
career and friends over her, which makes it sound worse than it is.

957
00:55:43.921 --> 00:55:44.910
What should I tell her?

958
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.930
Thanks and go fuck yourself while she's choosing her country and her family over

959
00:55:48.931 --> 00:55:52.860
you. So I would say nicely, listen,

960
00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.400
you keep saying that this is me choosing my career

961
00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:01.960
and you know, what'd just want you to say Mike and Friends over her?

962
00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:04.740
<v 4>Um,</v>

963
00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:07.950
<v 1>do you know that feeling you have when you live here in London?</v>

964
00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:10.980
That's what I'm going to feel like when I'm in Switzerland.

965
00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:15.990
Do you want me to feel that? No. Well good. I don't want to feel that either.

966
00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:19.830
So one of us has to make a sacrifice here.

967
00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:24.130
Are you willing to live here? And if she says no,

968
00:56:24.131 --> 00:56:27.220
then you have to be willing to live there. And if you're not willing to do that,

969
00:56:27.221 --> 00:56:29.410
then you guys need to break up. It's simple as that.

970
00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.530
<v 8>Simple as that. Um,</v>

971
00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:40.510
<v 1>I would, I would fucking, that's it dude. You know, you got to fucking,</v>

972
00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.090
<v 8>yeah,</v>

973
00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:46.430
<v 1>Goddamn kids today, you know, fucking swiping left and XNL. Yeah.</v>

974
00:56:46.431 --> 00:56:51.290
My girlfriend lives in fucking Bangladesh and as she's really missing some of

975
00:56:51.291 --> 00:56:53.540
the food over there and I, you know, and I fucking, you know,

976
00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:56.330
whatever the fuck I do over here, I mean these are,

977
00:56:56.331 --> 00:57:00.590
these are like modern day relationship fucking problems. Yeah, that's it.

978
00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:01.850
One of you guys has to move,

979
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:04.730
but don't let her guilt you and she not choosing her and her friends,

980
00:57:04.731 --> 00:57:06.080
you're doing what she's doing.

981
00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:10.250
You're living where you want to live next to the people you love and you can't

982
00:57:10.251 --> 00:57:13.670
get mad at her for wanting to do the exact same thing. All right? But you know,

983
00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:16.760
she's trying to mind. Fuck. You know, for me, I,

984
00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:21.140
you feel like you're choosing this. Go Fuck Yourself. All right,

985
00:57:21.141 --> 00:57:23.570
well go back home then. Send me some chocolates.

986
00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:26.090
We'll bang every once in awhile. We'll meet in Paris. How about that?

987
00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:29.190
<v 8>That's it. I don't know what to tell you.</v>

988
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:34.060
<v 1>All right, girlfriend, you, you came to my place, not the other way around. Uh,</v>

989
00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:37.970
girlfriends, belly hangs, pastor tits out. Jesus.

990
00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:39.910
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

991
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:43.720
<v 1>hey there. Hey there. Billy Willy freckled cheeks. Love the podcast.</v>

992
00:57:43.721 --> 00:57:45.820
Especially when you and Nia do the podcast so that I know,

993
00:57:45.821 --> 00:57:46.840
and I gotta get her around here more,

994
00:57:46.841 --> 00:57:49.840
but it's just like when I do what she has to watch the kid and the other way

995
00:57:49.841 --> 00:57:51.700
around. All right, I got a problem then.

996
00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:54.040
I'm hoping you and Nia may be able to help you with.

997
00:57:54.041 --> 00:57:57.430
I love my wife of seven years dearly. We have fun together,

998
00:57:57.431 --> 00:57:59.980
make each other laugh, et cetera. She's my best friend.

999
00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:03.700
We're an in her early thirties, have no children and are very affluent,

1000
00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:05.890
crushing it except for the sex.

1001
00:58:05.891 --> 00:58:09.010
The sex is bad because we have become fatty fat fats.

1002
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:12.200
We've been together for a decade. Uh,

1003
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.370
and this has only become a problem over the past six months.

1004
00:58:15.371 --> 00:58:19.840
I'm five 11 and two 40 with a lot of muscle and a lot of fat. She's five,

1005
00:58:19.841 --> 00:58:22.420
four and 200 and has no muscle mass.

1006
00:58:22.421 --> 00:58:25.510
I'm ashamed to say that even though I love her fiercely,

1007
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:29.140
she's no longer physically attractive to me. Well, I mean, what the fuck?

1008
00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:33.300
Let me just being honest, I'm sure you're not as attracted to her,

1009
00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:36.420
although you did give yourself some props for having a little bit of muscle.

1010
00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:40.380
You didn't quite say you was as big a mess. I'm ashamed to say that he, okay.

1011
00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.710
Um, she probably feels to say okay. If he said that she probably feels the same.

1012
00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:48.300
She used to be one 40 tops and was curving and all the right places.

1013
00:58:48.301 --> 00:58:51.540
I used to be cut like a Greek God. Our sex life was amazing.

1014
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.190
She'd have one to three orgasms. Jesus Christ.

1015
00:58:55.191 --> 00:58:59.810
Every time we had sex one to three times per weeks and now maybe we have sex

1016
00:58:59.811 --> 00:59:04.220
once a month. She can't climb anymore because she gets too tired. Jesus,

1017
00:59:04.221 --> 00:59:08.060
over the past six weeks, I've cut 10 pounds and exercise six times a week.

1018
00:59:08.061 --> 00:59:09.710
I'm trying, but I have a long way to go.

1019
00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:13.280
She hasn't tried to eat right and is not interested in exercising with me.

1020
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:15.350
I know sex tends to dwindle over time,

1021
00:59:15.351 --> 00:59:19.190
but I'd like for us to be in good enough shape that we don't need a

1022
00:59:19.191 --> 00:59:22.850
nitroglycerine pill every we try to do the dirt.

1023
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:25.820
Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself.

1024
00:59:25.821 --> 00:59:29.750
You have to sit down and have an honest conversation with her. Okay.

1025
00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.270
I would leave the sex life out of it.

1026
00:59:32.271 --> 00:59:36.800
It's just like she's not going to live long. All right. Um,

1027
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:39.760
it five, four, 200 pounds. Uh,

1028
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:44.730
maybe you could start by going for quote romantic walks and a,

1029
00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:48.020
you hold her hand. Didn't need you try to pick up the pace and drag along.

1030
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:54.350
I would just, yeah, I would talk to her, um, about it. And,

1031
00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:57.260
uh, if she chooses not to get in shape,

1032
00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.160
then I w I would not alter what you're doing.

1033
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:05.900
I would go back to being the Greek God that you were. And um,

1034
01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:10.940
if she doesn't want to get in shape, then you know, what are you supposed to do?

1035
01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.420
Watch her eat herself into an early fucking grave.

1036
01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:17.500
You supposed to be with somebody that you're not sexually attracted to anymore.

1037
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:18.620
I mean, that, that's fair man.

1038
01:00:18.621 --> 01:00:23.621
If somebody puts on almost like she put on almost half her body weight.

1039
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.580
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1040
01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.530
<v 1>I mean, that's not a, that's not fair.</v>

1041
01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.960
It's not fair to yourself and it's not fair to the person you're in.

1042
01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.560
You gotta be making an effort to, to, to still look good. You know,

1043
01:00:33.561 --> 01:00:36.680
when people have a tendency, men and women to do that, to become, you know,

1044
01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:41.710
do you know, just walking around fucking shitty looking clothes,

1045
01:00:41.711 --> 01:00:44.050
just being a tub of shit and it's just like that whole,

1046
01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.540
you should accept me for whatever I am.

1047
01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:49.360
That means I'm going to be the least of who I could be.

1048
01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:52.630
Nobody ever says that when they're there the best. Yeah.

1049
01:00:52.631 --> 01:00:55.960
I'd like to accept you fucking going to the Goddamn Gym. Same Way.

1050
01:00:55.961 --> 01:01:00.910
You'd like me to not fucking have my belly hanging down past my junk. Um, yeah,

1051
01:01:00.911 --> 01:01:05.740
I'd have a conversation with her. Just sit down at, you know what? Maybe a,

1052
01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:10.330
my beautiful daughter is asleep. Maybe uh, Nia could come in and help.

1053
01:01:10.331 --> 01:01:14.890
Hang on a second. Let me hit pause here. Yeah. She can't do it. She can't do it.

1054
01:01:14.891 --> 01:01:18.790
Sorry. Sorry to get your goddamn hopes up. So, uh, just know that, um,

1055
01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.540
that you just got advice from a guy.

1056
01:01:22.541 --> 01:01:26.950
So what I would do is I would ask a woman in your life,

1057
01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.970
not her advice on how to, how to drop in. Okay.

1058
01:01:30.971 --> 01:01:33.130
Cause this is one of these relationship conversations.

1059
01:01:33.131 --> 01:01:37.540
It's like when a spaceship is reentering the atmosphere of the space shuttle,

1060
01:01:37.541 --> 01:01:41.590
that if it wasn't at the right fucking angle, you know,

1061
01:01:42.070 --> 01:01:44.350
well you lost a couple of those fucking shingles on the bottom.

1062
01:01:44.351 --> 01:01:47.800
You could fucking burn up on reentry. All right.

1063
01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:50.560
Did I really have to bring up that tragedy to make my point. I don't know.

1064
01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:54.700
Maybe I didn't. All right. Girlfriend has severe halitosis Jesus Christ.

1065
01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.120
The women are getting destroyer ladies. Ladies, you got to write in next week,

1066
01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.210
okay? You got to write in next week. Okay.

1067
01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.690
Stop being sweethearts and tell me what the problem is with the guys. This is,

1068
01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.900
this is not fair and balanced like Fox News

1069
01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:11.870
or CNN. Um,

1070
01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:16.660
I love that chick that cried on CNN, the one with the Mary Lou Retton haircut.

1071
01:02:16.661 --> 01:02:17.980
When Trump got elected. It's just like,

1072
01:02:18.070 --> 01:02:20.280
there was one of the most unprofessional journalistic moments

1073
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:24.240
<v 2>I've ever seen in my fucking life. How did we go from Walter Cronkite to that?</v>

1074
01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:27.720
Like, I literally know who you voted for. You're not a journalist. All right.

1075
01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:31.830
Hey, their op ed piece. All right. Girlfriend has severe halitosis.

1076
01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:36.330
Dear Billy Bats, I saw you perform at hilarides in the land.

1077
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.100
The worst fucking nickname. The land.

1078
01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:45.660
The land of what? Jesus Christ. That's so fucking bad.

1079
01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:48.540
And you had me in stitches. Please come back the land.

1080
01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.840
They had tee shirts back there. Defend the land.

1081
01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.800
Do you know for half a second in Boston, they split.

1082
01:02:55.801 --> 01:02:59.940
They lose people calling it the bean, which said, don't do that.

1083
01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.710
Beantown was bad enough. We don't make beans there anymore.

1084
01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:08.220
Any more than Porchester still makes fucking lifesavers,

1085
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:12.150
although grand rapids still makes furniture. Um,

1086
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:16.860
I can't. Anyways, I'm 23 year old man and recently began dating a girl.

1087
01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:20.160
I met on a dating app. We've been on two dates and she has bad breath.

1088
01:03:20.161 --> 01:03:24.930
Dumper Jesus Christ over the fuck. Do you care?

1089
01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.530
It's not your problem. Anyways,

1090
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:29.730
you've been on two dates so far and they both went great.

1091
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.570
We went to a couple of museums for how far away were you standing from her?

1092
01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:37.730
Were you standing there going, uh, is that our breadth of the artifacts?

1093
01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:46.910
Is that our breadth of that fucking Willy Mammas statue that they dug out of the

1094
01:03:46.911 --> 01:03:49.970
fucking ice 2000 years ago anyways?

1095
01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:53.720
Well actually willy man was for fucking 4 billion BC. Go Fuck Yourself.

1096
01:03:53.721 --> 01:03:57.110
All right. We have a good conversation in this great chemistry overall,

1097
01:03:57.111 --> 01:03:58.250
but when she smiles,

1098
01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:02.510
the sight and smell indicates years of not brushing or flossing. Dude,

1099
01:04:03.050 --> 01:04:05.780
I don't know. I don't even know the fact that you need advice on this.

1100
01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.820
There is thick, dark yellow buildup a longer gumline Oh my God,

1101
01:04:10.821 --> 01:04:15.710
I'm going to Puke and she talks loud so her breath travels a long way.

1102
01:04:15.711 --> 01:04:17.500
Kissing is difficult to enjoy.

1103
01:04:20.530 --> 01:04:23.270
Oh my God, this is gross.

1104
01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:24.973
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1105
01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.920
<v 2>I almost just gagged there.</v>

1106
01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.060
I almost just gagged there dude.

1107
01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:35.230
What kind of fucking low self esteem do you have? What is my advice?

1108
01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:39.250
Either break up with her or take her to one of those self power washes,

1109
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:43.750
car wash things and tell her to smile in fucking blast or right in the fucking

1110
01:04:43.751 --> 01:04:47.640
grill. Okay. Jesus fucking Christ.

1111
01:04:47.641 --> 01:04:49.860
That's the most disgusting visual.

1112
01:04:51.610 --> 01:04:52.840
<v 8>Oh my God.</v>

1113
01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.700
<v 2>What the fuck?</v>

1114
01:04:58.510 --> 01:04:59.343
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1115
01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.160
<v 2>What is my advice? I don't know what.</v>

1116
01:05:01.161 --> 01:05:04.220
You know what I might advice it states they should make a stamp for you cause

1117
01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.510
you're a God damn saint.

1118
01:05:08.290 --> 01:05:09.520
<v 8>Oh my God.</v>

1119
01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.780
<v 2>Kissing is difficult.</v>

1120
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.073
<v 8>Ugh,</v>

1121
01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:19.960
<v 2>I've got, I think I got to walk this one off. Buddy did.</v>

1122
01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:23.530
Does plenty of fucking fish in the fucking seat.

1123
01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:25.890
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

1124
01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:28.740
<v 2>Jesus. Oh my God. That's okay. I'm gonna to, speaking of fish,</v>

1125
01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:31.680
that's like having a Goddamn eel going along your goddamn gum lines.

1126
01:05:31.681 --> 01:05:34.740
I'm sorry guys. I don't know why. Yeah, dude, I would just, that's it.

1127
01:05:34.741 --> 01:05:36.690
It's over. I, there should be. No, no.

1128
01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:45.090
I mean you're going to hang in there with this one. What the fuck do you say?

1129
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:50.170
Hey, what are you doing Thursday night? No, nothing.

1130
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:51.460
You want to go to the dentist?

1131
01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.460
Let's get his or her cleanings.

1132
01:06:00.450 --> 01:06:05.200
Oh my God, Dude. If, if, if that looks like that, what is,

1133
01:06:05.201 --> 01:06:08.950
what is the fucking basement gonna look like, Dude. Oh my God.

1134
01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.033
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1135
01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:14.040
<v 2>Oh my God. Hey God bless you dude. Yeah, I get her to a dentist.</v>

1136
01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:18.510
However the fuck you bring that up. I don't know. Some questions are beyond me.

1137
01:06:18.570 --> 01:06:21.680
All right. Jesus Christ. All right. That's the, uh,

1138
01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:25.810
I've never had to stop reading an email before.

1139
01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:32.240
I haven't done that. I haven't them come that close to puke.

1140
01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:37.030
And since opie and Anthony, the baby bird when I was in that fucking room,

1141
01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:37.930
and I still to this day,

1142
01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:40.630
could not tell that story without fucking gagging and coughing.

1143
01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:45.280
And if you puke easily, do not fucking go look up opie and Anthony. Baby Bird.

1144
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:49.360
All right. That's it. That's the podcasts. Go fuck yourselves.

1145
01:06:49.361 --> 01:06:51.940
I will check in on you on Thursday.

1146
01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.970
I am back to watching a little bit of baseball.

1147
01:06:54.971 --> 01:06:57.460
I did miss the a Yankees don't care. I was working the whole weekend.

1148
01:06:57.461 --> 01:07:00.550
I think the Yankees got the better of us. I know we did one game.

1149
01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:05.020
Yankees are in third and the fucking devil race. I'm moving up there.

1150
01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:05.981
Only a half a game out.

1151
01:07:05.981 --> 01:07:09.190
So I'm gonna try to watch what playing the fuck's in Toronto. Blue Jays. Bam,

1152
01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:13.570
Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam. Fucking um, Toronto Blue Jays there.

1153
01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:17.980
That was my reference to a whatever that fucking song is by rush.

1154
01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:21.260
That is the Morse code. Y,

1155
01:07:21.261 --> 01:07:25.960
Y,Z for Toronto's airport. Somehow they came up with a guitar. Riff for that.

1156
01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:29.770
All right. That's something Kevin Murphy would try to do on F is for family.

1157
01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:34.420
Huh? Season too on Netflix. Look at that. Coming out of that disgusting story.

1158
01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.360
Promoting his show. Telling you to go fuck yourselves.

1159
01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.280
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
