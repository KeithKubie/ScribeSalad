00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.475
Now let's turn to feedback. How would you let a user know

00:00:03.475 --> 00:00:07.830
when something was done? How does the user know that the action has

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.860
been completed? So now, now you're going to do the exchange. So

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.110
now you're exchanging with someone. How do you know when it's been completed?

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.440
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.050
&gt;&gt; You know what's funny about these questions, is they seem obvious. Like,

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.770
duh, right, but actually when you're the designer, you have to think about this.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.020
&gt;&gt; What happens that shows it's done?

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.090
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.270
&gt;&gt; The numbers change. Does anything else happen?

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.060
Do they see the numbers change? If you view

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.320
this like some Apple products sometimes, like when

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.380
you delete something, the little piece moves into the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.770
trash can. You know, that's feedback. Right? But

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.490
it's also feedback that showed what happened. Like this

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.320
thing didn't just disappear, it moved into this

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.840
other folder that you can actually go to. [SOUND]
