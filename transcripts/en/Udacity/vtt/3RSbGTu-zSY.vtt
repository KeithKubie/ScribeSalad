00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.087
12/36 reduces to 1/3, 9 and

00:00:03.087 --> 00:00:08.420
14 don't have any factors in common so
it can't reduce any further.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.980
So the answer here is just 9/14.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.160
15/75 can be reduced to 1/5, and 8 and

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.340
11 don't share any common factors so
it'll just stay 8 over 11.
