00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.070
We'll refer to this field
as telehomecare, but

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.260
that implies a more passive role for
the patient than is appropriate and

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.220
technologically possible today.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.130
What has also happened as
telehomecare has evolved?

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.435
Patients are less capable of
sending data to their physicians.

00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:21.031
There's an increasing interest
in consumers assuming more

00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:22.729
active roles in their care.

00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:26.366
Patient operated devices of
today are more inexpensive,

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.400
mobile, and user-friendly.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.300
A and B, B and C.
