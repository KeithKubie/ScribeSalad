00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.320
Studying while battling depression is one of 
the hardest things to do

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.620
It's difficult enough getting out of bed

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.700
but depression steals away your energy

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.660
motivation and concentration

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.474
It's like having a cloudy memory and 
struggling to survive each and every day.

00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:28.889
How can you possibly get through school 
while dealing with depression?

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.890
One : Use a planner

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.660
Depression leads to disorganization and 
foggy memory

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.620
In school, it's critical to remember when 
you have assignments, presentations and tests

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.820
Bring a planner with you to your classes and 
write down everything you need to remember

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.308
So you won't forget anything or 
end up brushing an assignment last minute

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.480
Two: Study and do homework on time

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.660
Studying without motivation is hard

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.160
But by doing a little every day,
 you can lower your stress levels .

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.480
There may be days when studying feels impossible

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.773
But if you studied a bit every day before that

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.600
it's okay to take a day off once in a while
 when things get really rough

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.180
When you have depression 
having some free time to rest is essential

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.100
Three: Space it out

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.580
Divide your study material into small chunks and 
review it continuously over long periods of time

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.360
This will increase your chances of learning the material

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.790
Additionally, review each lesson 
before starting a new one

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.520
Four: Don't pull all-nighters

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.260
By staying up all night,your depression will worsen and the symptoms will become more severe

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.400
Suicidal thoughts may also increase drastically

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.133
Instead, organize your schedule in a way

00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:41.040
where you're not staying up all night to 
complete your assignments

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.540
Five: Take breaks

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.260
Don't study or do homework for hours on end

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.930
Depression lowers your energy

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.080
And if you don't take breaks in between study sessions, you will burn out

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.700
The trick is to study for 30-minute intervals with 
10-minute breaks in between

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.780
Everyone's a little different though

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.775
so test out different time schedules to 
see what works best for you

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.780
and adjust the intervals accordingly

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.140
Six: Keep a binder or notebook

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.760
People with depression can have trouble 
staying organized

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.660
By buying binders or notebooks

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.040
and using dividers,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.520
it's easy to separate your study materials

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.380
This will allow you to 
feel less overwhelmed

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.240
Seven: Stay away from negative people

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.260
It's already hard enough to 
stay optimistic with depression

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.340
So surrounding yourself with 
pessimistic people won't help you

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.360
it'll bring you down and
 affect your school performance

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.420
Remember : you are studying so 
you can have a career you love

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.682
so spend time with people

00:02:35.682 --> 00:02:38.680
who support you and 
push you towards your goals when life gets hard

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.420
Eight: Consume brain foods

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.500
Depression makes you crave junk food

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.100
and even though it's okay to 
treat yourself every now and then

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.940
don't make a habit out of it

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.820
Instead, stay away from sugars

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.000
Stay hydrated and eat nutritious food

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.100
which will increase your energy and 
improve your focus

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.400
Nine: Find a study buddy

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.320
Figure out which one of your classmates 
is more responsible and stick to them

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.040
Create study groups where 
you can ask each other questions

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.720
But be careful of lazy students who 
may try to use you

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.160
as their pessimistic nature will affect your mood

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.980
Ten: Highlight

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.620
People with depression can easily feel overwhelmed

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.380
especially when they're taking a course 
with lots of material

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.900
When you feel stuck

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.360
buy different color highlighters to 
divide the material by main topic,

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.080
subtopic, 
important information etc

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.560
Eleven: Take care of yourself and find hobbies

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.480
If all you do is study, 
you'll feel more depressed

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.180
so don't forget to treat yourself

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.300
Take some time to pursue hobbies and 
practise self-care

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.160
to improve your overall mood

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.300
Watch a movie or 
eat at your favorite restaurant

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.500
Have fun with friends, 
take a breather

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.460
and then you can continue studying

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.240
Society puts a lot of pressure on students

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.300
especially when it comes to their studies

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.440
Remember : your mental health comes first and 
grades don't define you

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.040
Failing a course doesn't make you a failure

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.480
We're all human

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.400
so don't feel bad if you need to 
take a break

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.180
to regain your mental health

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.700

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.756
