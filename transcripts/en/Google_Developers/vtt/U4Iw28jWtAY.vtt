[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:19.835
JOANNA SMITH: Hey everybody and
welcome to today's episode

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:22.860
of Google+ Developers Live,
targeted sharing with

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.020
interactive purpose.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.400
I'm Joanna Smith and I'm a
developer programs engineer

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.630
for Google+.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.660
SILVANO LUCIANI: And I'm Silvano
Luciani and I'm also a

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.380
developer programs engineer
for Google+.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.570
And today, what we want to
show to you is how to use

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.470
interactive posts to help your
users to bring the people that

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.970
care to your app.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.170
JOANNA SMITH: So interactive
posts help your users prompt

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.150
their friends to take specific
actions in your app from a

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.440
Google+ post.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.510
In addition to the standard
content links, interactive

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.480
posts introduce a prominent call
to action button that's

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.460
designed to drive actions in
your app from users in the

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.165
Google+ stream.

00:00:58.165 --> 00:01:00.060
And so we're going to bring
those users into your

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.230
app from our own.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.120
And this is a really powerful
tool for you because clicking

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.650
these buttons brings recipients
directly, not just

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.570
to your app, but within your app
to a specific place in the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.060
app to perform a specific
action.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.250
Maybe they want to listen to
a particular song that was

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.090
shared instead of just listening
to music in general.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.040
And so Silvano, do you want to
go ahead and show us how easy

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.110
it is to do this?

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.270
SILVANO LUCIANI: Of course.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.320
It's very easy like all the code
that you need is in our

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.853
developers doc, at
developers.googl

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:28.103
e.com/plus/web/s
hare/interactive.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.080
It's easy to find.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.930
JOANNA SMITH: So simple.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.960
SILVANO LUCIANI: You can find
the snippets that will allow

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.950
you to load our JavaScript into
your page and then ran

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.750
the interactive post button
into your page.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.880
But the first step is to create
a project in the Google

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.910
API console.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.100
JOANNA SMITH: As always,
this is your step one.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.770
Go to the API console.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.830
And of course, we have explicit
instructions for how

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.050
to get started with this.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.460
SILVANO LUCIANI: So we
can show this to you.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.180
The API console is at
developers.google.com/console.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.449
You can create a new project
using the select drop down on

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.130
the top left corner.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.630
We will call this project Demo
GDL and this name is just for

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.930
you have to remember what
this project is about.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.430
Let's wait a second.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.820
So now we are in the familiar
service list and we can choose

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.730
which APIs we want to
use in this project.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.430
So in our case for the
interactive post, what we need

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.450
is the Google+ API.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.610
And let's click on
to activate it.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.990
Remember that the first time
that you use a specific API

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.220
when you do this, you will see
the terms of service of the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.800
API and you will have to accept
the terms of service

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.480
before actually start
using it.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.940
JOANNA SMITH: And we recommend
that you actually take a few

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.430
moments to read that instead of
just clicking through like

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.030
you are probably inclined to
do because we do hold you

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.580
accountable to our
terms of service.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.330
We try to do what's right for
our users in those and our

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.884
spam and abuse team probably
will find you.

00:02:59.884 --> 00:03:01.090
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yeah.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.760
So now we can go to API
access and create an

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.480
OAuth 2.0 client ID.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.620
And it's easy as clicking
on this big blue button.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.960
At this point, product name--

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.200
I will use, again, GDL demo but
here use something that is

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.750
meaningful for you and for the
user because this is the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.900
branding information.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.590
So it's what will be shown to
the user in the content dialog

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.710
when they go through
the OAuth process.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.640
So the same is with the logo.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.180
If you have a logo,
use a compelling

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.280
logo for your product.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.080
And also, the home page URL
where the user can check more

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.900
details about your app.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.370
In the next window, what we do
is choose an application type

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.320
for our client ID.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.440
In our case, it's a web app.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.295
And what we have to do now is
add options for our site or

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:52.620
host name for the JavaScript
origins and the redirect URI.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.740
Be careful with the scheme.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.050
As always, if you're using the
HTTP select HTTP, and if

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.550
you're using both HTTP and
HTTPS, use two entries for

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.760
both schemes.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.220
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.500
is published on localhost so
what we need to do add

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.370
localhost here and we can now
create the client ID.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.700
JOANNA SMITH: And so now that we
have our API console ready

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.070
to go and all set up, it's
really very simple to get

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.010
started with interactive post
because, once again, we

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.130
provided code snippets in our
documentation that you can

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.920
just copy directly.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.680
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yeah.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.930
Going back to the page in the
developer docs, there is

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.900
adding the share button
to the page.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.290
So if you click the link, you
go to the snippet that is

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.130
including our JavaScript
in your source code.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.900
So let's copy and paste
these first.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.990
And then the second step is
actually called copying and

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.410
pasting the code that
will render the

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.090
button in your page.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.600
JOANNA SMITH: So while he's
copying and pasting this, I

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.060
think we should take a moment
to go over some of these

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.230
attributes, right?

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.620
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yes.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.710
So the first one that you can
see is the class and it's

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.960
g-interactivepost.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.880
This is telling our JavaScript
that after if has loaded, all

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.320
the element on the page with
this class needs to be

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.400
rendered as interactive post.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.700
The styling, you can choose the
styling for the button.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.240
We will just attach the behavior
to an element with

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.420
this class.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.090
Content URL is the URL that
points to the object that

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.810
you're sharing.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.890
And that URL needs to contain
the scheme of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.940
markup that is describing
the object.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.720
So a title, a description,
an image.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.510
And this will populate the
snippet like a standard share.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.280
Content deep link ID is the
same but for mobile apps.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.450
JOANNA SMITH: So let's take a
moment to talk about what deep

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.340
links are before we go on about
the actual ID for them.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.230
Because if you haven't used deep
linking before, you might

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.290
be a little confused here.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.870
But what deep linking does is it
allows the Google+ app on a

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.260
mobile device to direct clicks
on an interactive post into

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.710
the mobile app for your users.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.150
So if the user has your app
installed and they click on a

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.230
deep link, they'll be taken
straight to your app, but also

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.480
within your app.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.260
And if they don't already have
you app installed, they get

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.210
prompted to go ahead and install
it which is pretty

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.300
powerful as far as a user
experience is concerned.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.550
But if you plan to use deep
linking in your mobile apps,

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.410
you need to create a client ID
for each of your platforms

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.800
that all live in the same
API console project.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.460
And that's a really key
thing to remember.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.820
They need to be in one API
console project, but you would

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.830
have one for each platform
like Android or iOS.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.500
And then the Google+ app is
going to magically route all

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.300
of these clicks to the
appropriate place.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.900
So if you have your deep link
set up for both Android and

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.660
iOS, we're going to figure out
where to send the user.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.220
We're going to take it from
there and handle all that

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.010
logic for you which is
also pretty powerful.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.450
SILVANO LUCIANI: Very good.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.150
So and back to our parameters,
we have the client ID which

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.170
we'll replace soon with the
client ID from the project

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.380
that we just generated.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.010
And this is because we need
to know that your app is

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.350
accessing the JavaScript.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.780
The cookie policy, you
might know this

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.380
from the sign in button.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.150
This is a complex parameter.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.080
Check the docs on the website
and we will have

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.540
a GDL on this soon.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.730
But for now, just use
single_host_origin or check

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.580
the recommendation that is
explaining to you which one is

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.440
the value that you should use.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.160
Prefill text.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.720
This will allow your app to
prepopulate the text in the

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.420
snippet so that you can send
the user a message that is

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:41.420
meaningful and compelling, and
that is actually letting them

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.150
interact with your app.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.870
The call to action label, that's
what will appear as

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.690
text in the button, the call
to action button, which is

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.700
what you're trying to engage
external the user for.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.470
JOANNA SMITH: And where you see
the word create here, we

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:00.080
actually have over 100 verbs
pre-defined and ready to go.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.150
And so you can find that
list on documentation.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.530
But the reason we have all of
these verbs already chosen is

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.020
because we've also
localized them.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.700
So that, depending on your
user's location, we'll make

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.110
sure it's in the right language
for your user our of

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:12.780
any of our 60 supported
languages.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.350
So that's a pretty
cool thing too.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.340
SILVANO LUCIANI: The
call to action URL.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.140
This is where the user will land
if they click the action

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.800
on the interactive post.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.100
And the call to action deep link
ID is the same from the

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:26.700
mobile app.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.310
So as we were telling, is this
way of actually having them go

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.890
to a specific part of the app
where they can do an action

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.650
for which their friends call
them into your app.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:41.530
So now all we need to do is
get from the Google API

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:46.910
console the client ID that we
have just generated, copy it,

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:51.330
paste it back to our
source code.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.160
And now we can see a demo
of the interactive post.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.340
JOANNA SMITH: Before we demo,
can I [INAUDIBLE] the prefill

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.330
text and the verb?

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:57.740
SILVANO LUCIANI: Of course.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.150
JOANNA SMITH: OK.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.160
So I want it to say Joanna
is the best.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.260
SILVANO LUCIANI: Joanna
is the best.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.630
JOANNA SMITH: Because I
am, let's not argue.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.920
And in the verb it should be to
confirm because everybody

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.010
should that I'm the best and
agree with that statement.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.130
SILVANO LUCIANI: I do agree.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:12.490
JOANNA SMITH: All right.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:13.530
We're good then.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.790
No arguments here which means
nobody's arguing.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.900
SILVANO LUCIANI: So now if we
load the demo, this big gray

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.470
button that you can see, as we
said, this is in your control.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.710
You can style it as you want.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.480
We have some branding guidelines
that will tell you

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.840
what you can do and what you
can't do, but aside from that,

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.230
it's all yours.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:41.770
When you click it, it's going
full screen for the content.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.280
And now we can see the
interactive post on the page.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.850
And as you can see, the text has
been pre-filled with what

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:49.460
Joanna wanted.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.350
JOANNA SMITH: Because Silvano,
this app wants to tell the

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.630
world how cool I am.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.410
SILVANO LUCIANI: And the call
to action is now a confirm.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.680
And now I can tell Joanna's
[INAUDIBLE] demo, for

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.240
instance, or anyone else
to actually go--

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.230
myself, I will do
it with myself--

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.040
JOANNA SMITH: You should
all [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.860
SILVANO LUCIANI: Confirm that
Joanna is the best.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.110
And in that way, they will start
using our app and check

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.376
[INAUDIBLE] the app is.

00:10:17.376 --> 00:10:18.330
JOANNA SMITH: All right.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.840
So the other cool thing is you
saw how Silvano is choosing

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.575
his recipients, but you as a
developer can choose some of

00:10:23.575 --> 00:10:25.620
those recipients for your
users directly.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.000
And what you can do is you can
actually prefill up to 10

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.020
direct recipients.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.150
And what that means is that
those 10 people are going to

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.360
get a notification and that's a
really powerful tool to help

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.940
drive engagement for you.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.370
And the other thing that's
really cool about this is you

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.200
can add recipients
by either Google+

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.530
ID or by email address.

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.300
So just as in a normal share
when you can send somebody a

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.750
post through email if they're
not on Google+, you can still

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.980
do that same thing as a
developer to prefill that

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.970
email address.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.530
So let's go ahead and look at
how incredibly simple it is to

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.550
get this going.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.920
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yeah.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:03.010
I have a simple PHP that is
using a new function that we

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:07.170
added to the Google+ API which
is people.list that will allow

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:13.300
you to get a list of the users
in the circle of the user

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.490
visible to your app.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:22.985
And this is the code that is
showing how actually easy it

00:11:22.985 --> 00:11:26.210
is to call this function
from the Google

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.510
API PHP client library.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.470
We need to go list people.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.230
Me, as you know, is the key word
to say that we want this

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.100
code for the user that
is logged in now.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.980
Visible is to indicate that we
want the collection of user

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.890
that is visible to yourself.

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:47.960
And I'm also using an optional
parameter which is order by

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.150
and setting it to best.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.940
This means that the order of
the friends will be by

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.810
interaction.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:12:00.060
So in the first places I will
get the people with whom the

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.910
user interact the most.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.180
JOANNA SMITH: Now the other
thing to remember here is that

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.980
we're not exposing the
user's circles.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.680
We're just providing a flat list
of people that the user

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.380
has added to a circle that
they've shared with you

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.590
through consent dialog.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.800
And so when we order by best,
it's not the best of this

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.840
circle or that, it's best
overall from any interaction.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.850
But also, that entire list is
going to be a flat list for

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.650
our developers so that we can
enable our developers and

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.320
protect our users at
the same time.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:27.580
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yeah.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.660
We don't expose any circles
information to the developers.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:36.380
Then you can add a maximum of
10 recipients and when you

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.710
have a list of multiple
recipients, it becomes a comma

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:44.130
separated list of either Google+
IDs or email address.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.130
So in this case, what I'm doing
in the PHP sample is

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:51.190
just taking the first 10 and
then building an array and

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.580
then it's imploding that array
to a comma separated list and

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.830
we can use it.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.780
We need to add the parameter,
the other recipients to our

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.390
markup and just putting
the string as

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.430
value of the parameter.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:11.480
So back to the new sample
which is their PHP.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.660
As you can see now, the
recipients are pre-populated

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.000
with a list that comes
from my demo page.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.210
And those are lists that are
in order the friends I

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.300
interact the most with.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.980
JOANNA SMITH: So you might be
used to seeing this list come

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.330
back alphabetically but because
we used the order by

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.010
best parameter, it's ordered by

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.280
interactions, like we explained.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.630
And so depending on what your
app is, either one of those

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.170
might be the right
choice for you.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.870
The other thing I want to
do now that we're showed

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.210
you the demo is--

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.260
before we go, I want to take a
look back at the attributes

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.690
that we were showing
off earlier.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.430
And I want to talk
about why some of

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:49.690
them look really familiar.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.240
Things like cookie policy we've
seen in our sign in

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.010
button too.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.840
And can we take a look
at the similarities?

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.110
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yeah.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.780
So there is a number of
attributes that the

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.090
interactive post inherits
from the sign in.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.850
And this is because, as you've
seen it briefly in the first

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:12.530
example, I had to go through
the authorized dialog.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.900
This is because your user
needs to be signed in to

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.680
Google before they can use
an interactive post.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.820
So if you have an app where
you have both sign in and

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.530
interactive posts, what you
want is to have the same

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.610
attributes for the sign in
because you want to replicate

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:29.810
the same behavior.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.190
You want to have access
to the same scope.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:37.050
You on the same type of access
online or offline whether it's

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.220
your choice.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.390
You want to call the same call
back to perform the same

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.820
action on the app.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.790
So for example, in PhotoHunt,
which is our end to end sample

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.250
application, in the main page,
in the landing page, we have a

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.230
sign in button, but we also
have an interactive post

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.350
button, invite your friends
that can be

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.250
used to invite friends.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.790
So at that point, if you click
invite your friends before

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:04.050
signing in, we want to go
through the same call back

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:07.390
that will then hide the sign in
button, show your profile

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:11.050
image, show your profile
picture, and all the other

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.530
personalization that we
apply to the page.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.830
Show photos from your friends,
show the list of your

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.260
friends, and so on.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.050
So this is very important that
you do the same things and the

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:25.010
same flow whether you are
signing in using the signing

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.330
button or the interactive
post button.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:31.350
One difference is you can do
over the air install when

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.070
you're using interactive
posts.

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:37.830
So that's now a packaged name
that will allow you to specify

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.820
this is my app and this is what
I want to install on your

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.150
Android device when you sign
into my application.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.060
So if you really want that, what
you have to do is don't

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.665
show interactive posts before
the users have signed in.

00:15:50.665 --> 00:15:51.040
JOANNA SMITH: Right.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.460
SILVANO LUCIANI: Sign in and
then show and apply all the

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.720
interactive posts
in your page.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.970
JOANNA SMITH: And what we
showed you when we were

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.800
explaining some of this is a
page from our documentation

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.090
that really goes over
these parameters.

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:04.300
But if you want to learn more or
maybe refresh some of this

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.680
because we did talk about a
lot of things in a really

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.180
quick time-frame, you can go
to our documentation at

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.930
developers.Google.com/plus
and you can read to

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.980
your heart's content.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.590
And it will definitely
help maybe clarify

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:17.120
some of these things.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.970
And of course, if you have any
questions or if you kind of

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.950
just want to talk about some of
this stuff, check out our

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.710
Google+ Developers community.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.770
We hang out in there every day
and we also have a lot of

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.830
really amazing external
developers in that community

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.080
who they foster great
conversations.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.800
They're bouncing ideas off
of each other and they're

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.790
discussing things that they
find with our API.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.970
And it's a pretty powerful
place to maybe get some

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.640
questions answered or just make
some good connections.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.960
So check it out.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.570
SILVANO LUCIANI: Or if you'd
like to see more codes and

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.910
more samples, we are on GetApp,
GetApp.com/Google+.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:51.150
You will find all our quick
steps which are the samples

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:55.110
that get you up in five minutes
on different languages

00:16:55.110 --> 00:17:01.010
like Java, Python, PHP, Ruby,
Go, JavaScript, and maybe I

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.240
think I'm forgetting one.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.099
And also we have--

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:04.339
JOANNA SMITH: C#?

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:05.130
SILVANO LUCIANI: C#.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:05.440
JOANNA SMITH: C#.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.609
SILVANO LUCIANI: That's it.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:10.849
And also we have PhotoHunt which
we mentioned is our end

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.849
to end sample application that
is showing you all the

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:16.060
functionalities that we recently
introduced with

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.640
Google+ Sign-In.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.589
We have a backend written in
Java that comes bundled with

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:23.819
the JavaScript frontend and
we also have two mobile

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:27.140
frontends, one Android
and one iOS.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.140
And also we are every day on
Stack Overflow so if you have

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.730
any questions just ask your
question with the tag

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:41.680
Google-plus and we will reply
as soon as we can which is

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.140
usually one afternoon.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:43.460
JOANNA SMITH: Yeah.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:43.780
SILVANO LUCIANI: Maybe?

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.070
One hour?

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.960
JOANNA SMITH: It's usually
the same day.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.970
SILVANO LUCIANI: Two hours?

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:47.610
JOANNA SMITH: And then, of
course, if you have an issue,

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:49.750
if you find something that's
wrong with our API, let us

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.900
know in our issue tracker.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.680
Or if you have a really great
idea for a feature request and

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.390
if there's already one in there
that you like, you can

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.850
start and you'll get updates and
it will let me know that

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.850
it's important to
more developers.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.990
For example, the order by best
parameter I discovered through

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.210
an issue reported in
the issue tracker.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:07.450
It was broken and we fixed
that just recently.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:09.810
And so, it can be a really
powerful tool for you to

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.070
communicate something to us
that's not quite right or

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.710
something that you would
really like to see.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.270
So definitely check that out and
you can always let us know

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.450
how you're feeling about
it by talking

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.370
about it in the community.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.370
But it can be really
powerful tool.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:23.620
And that's all that we
have for you today.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.090
So if you have any questions,
feel free to

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:26.466
ask them in the community.

00:18:26.466 --> 00:18:27.716
SILVANO LUCIANI: Bye.

00:18:35.126 --> 00:19:06.787
