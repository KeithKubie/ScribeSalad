00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:02.282
Charlie: Salman Khan is here.

00:00:02.282 --> 00:00:03.789
He's the founder of Khan Academy,

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:05.246
the online learning tube that has

00:00:05.246 --> 00:00:06.769
reached and taught millions.

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:10.535
Forbes Magazine calls it the
largest school in the world.

00:00:10.535 --> 00:00:13.459
Bill Gates calls him a true pioneer.

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.784
Khan Academy's goal is to provide a free

00:00:15.784 --> 00:00:19.422
world class education for anyone anywhere.

00:00:19.422 --> 00:00:21.092
Salman Khan has written a book describing

00:00:21.092 --> 00:00:23.554
how such a vision might be achieved.

00:00:23.554 --> 00:00:25.791
It is called The One World School House,

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:27.388
Education Reimagined.

00:00:27.388 --> 00:00:29.558
I am pleased to have him
back on this program.

00:00:29.558 --> 00:00:30.166
Welcome.

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.285
Sal: Great to be here.

00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:32.728
Charlie: When you were
here, we talked about

00:00:32.728 --> 00:00:34.577
how this whole thing started for you

00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:35.645
and the development with your niece

00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:38.007
who was down in Louisiana and you were

00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:41.707
teaching her and you used
YouTube and all of that.

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:44.180
Where is it now?

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.942
Sal: Yeah, I think when we last spoke,

00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:49.291
I think it was about 18 months ago,

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:50.594
I think we were reaching on the order of

00:00:50.594 --> 00:00:52.528
about a million students every month.

00:00:52.528 --> 00:00:54.953
We're now at 6 million
students every month.

00:00:54.953 --> 00:00:56.755
The team is growing ... I
think when we last talked,

00:00:56.755 --> 00:01:00.626
it was a 5% team, we're
now approaching 40 people

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:02.725
and it's really about not just the videos,

00:01:02.725 --> 00:01:04.793
although the videos are still
a big part of what we do,

00:01:04.793 --> 00:01:07.066
I'm not the only person
making videos anymore,

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.001
we're now translating the videos into

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.235
every major language in the world,

00:01:11.235 --> 00:01:14.787
our software platform is
being used in classrooms

00:01:14.787 --> 00:01:18.037
and outside of classrooms
around the world.

00:01:18.037 --> 00:01:23.024
It's just where it was before,
but maybe 10 times bigger.

00:01:23.024 --> 00:01:24.490
Charlie: You think you were born to teach?

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.506
Sal: I enjoy it. (laughing)

00:01:30.506 --> 00:01:33.941
I wasn't born to play
basketball. (laughing)

00:01:33.941 --> 00:01:36.548
Charlie: Me neither. (laughing)

00:01:36.548 --> 00:01:39.048
But fact that you did
have a passion for it,

00:01:39.048 --> 00:01:42.699
you had a technique for it and you found

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:45.760
more love for it than you did being,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.991
obviously because you left being in

00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:49.426
the hedge fund world.

00:01:49.426 --> 00:01:52.869
Sal: Most people don't
realize the commonality

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.677
between what I was doing before and what

00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:56.386
I hope I'm doing now.

00:01:56.386 --> 00:01:58.881
Even at the hedge fund
world, it was actually

00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:01.134
an intellectually intriguing job.

00:02:01.134 --> 00:02:02.470
In some ways, it wasn't
different from what

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.416
you're doing now.

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:06.381
You have to context switch
from one space to another,

00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:07.720
you're constantly learning,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.279
you get to talk to a lot of
people to learn from them,

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.433
and so for me, a big
fun part of that job was

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:14.053
I always got to learn stuff.

00:02:14.053 --> 00:02:15.092
I couldn't communicate it as much

00:02:15.092 --> 00:02:17.218
as I might have wanted to.

00:02:17.218 --> 00:02:19.154
Now I get the chance to do both.

00:02:19.154 --> 00:02:21.569
Charlie: Where can you take this?

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.467
Sal: A couple of things
that we're working on,

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:25.296
I mentioned we're translating the videos,

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:28.174
but we're also internationalizing
the entire site.

00:02:28.174 --> 00:02:30.712
We already have partners;
the Carlos Slim Foundation

00:02:30.712 --> 00:02:34.214
in Latin America, The
Lemon Foundation in Brazil,

00:02:34.214 --> 00:02:36.299
we recently took a trip down to Brazil

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.648
and there's national interest,
the president had asked,

00:02:38.648 --> 00:02:40.556
"What are we going to
be able to do together?"

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:41.141
Charlie: In Brazil?

00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:44.473
Sal: In Brazil. I think in the next year

00:02:44.473 --> 00:02:46.045
you're going to see Khan
Academy going global

00:02:46.045 --> 00:02:48.128
in a much more significant way.

00:02:48.128 --> 00:02:49.879
I think you're going to see,

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.223
it started with videos,
we've had an online

00:02:51.223 --> 00:02:53.684
component exercises, we
can give people feedback

00:02:53.684 --> 00:02:55.069
on where they are, but we're going to make

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.299
that much, much more serious.

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.087
The 48 states have adopted
the common core standards.

00:03:00.087 --> 00:03:01.349
There aren't any assessments out.

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.622
There are some groups out there that are

00:03:02.622 --> 00:03:05.053
going to be developing assessments.

00:03:05.053 --> 00:03:05.969
Through this whole transition,

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:07.136
you're going to have teachers, parents and

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:08.160
students wondering about how do they

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.269
navigate the switch and
what we hope to do is

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.883
take our exercises and turn them into

00:03:12.883 --> 00:03:15.303
really rigorous
assessments so that you can

00:03:15.303 --> 00:03:17.634
go to the site and get a
really strong diagnostic

00:03:17.634 --> 00:03:19.642
of what you know and what you don't know

00:03:19.642 --> 00:03:20.940
so we can narrow you in,

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.523
"Here's what you need to work on."

00:03:22.523 --> 00:03:25.228
We can kind of coach you
through that process,

00:03:25.228 --> 00:03:26.582
the tools for the teachers will get better

00:03:26.582 --> 00:03:28.665
and we also want to figure out a way

00:03:28.665 --> 00:03:31.194
for you to get credit for what you know.

00:03:31.194 --> 00:03:33.081
Charlie: How far away are you from that?

00:03:33.081 --> 00:03:35.438
Sal: We've had a lot of
interesting conversations.

00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:37.821
Charlie: What's the resistance?

00:03:39.267 --> 00:03:41.382
Sal: Maybe we're just
not seeing the resistance

00:03:41.382 --> 00:03:43.866
because we're not that far along yet,

00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:46.855
but especially if you
talk about some of the

00:03:46.855 --> 00:03:50.136
core college courses or the
late high school courses,

00:03:50.136 --> 00:03:52.630
right now you have 70% of students who

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.928
go to community college
have to take remedial Math.

00:03:54.928 --> 00:03:56.291
They usually don't find
that out until they

00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:58.045
show up and start paying tuition.

00:03:58.045 --> 00:03:59.880
This is something that
no one wants to happen

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.569
and it's the biggest predictor of whether

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.608
they're going to be able to finish or not.

00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:05.374
If we can address that so ahead of time

00:04:05.374 --> 00:04:07.211
someone could show,
"Look, I know my Algebra.

00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:08.880
I know my pre-Algebra,
I know my Trigonometry.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.490
I'm ready to engage," if someone can prove

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.157
that even at the professional level,

00:04:13.157 --> 00:04:15.116
"Hey, I can program a
computer. I might not

00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:18.199
have the four year degree,
but I'm employable."

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.710
We think that could have
huge implications for;

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.430
one, someone who doesn't have a chance to

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.861
a traditional university
or even some of the

00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:26.073
structural unemployment issues.

00:04:26.073 --> 00:04:27.907
We think it's, structural unemployment,

00:04:27.907 --> 00:04:29.742
there's a skills gap,
but we think it's even

00:04:29.742 --> 00:04:30.909
more a singling gap that ...

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:31.795
Charlie: Signaling ...

00:04:31.795 --> 00:04:33.412
Sal: Singling gap ...
That you do have people

00:04:33.412 --> 00:04:35.185
who actually do have skills and there's

00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:36.912
no way for them to prove it.

00:04:36.912 --> 00:04:38.109
Right now we have that problem where

00:04:38.109 --> 00:04:39.945
people are learning to
do stuff on Khan Academy

00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:42.131
and they want to prove it to the world,

00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:43.458
but there's no way for
them to prove that ...

00:04:43.458 --> 00:04:44.043
Charlie: That they know something.

00:04:44.043 --> 00:04:45.027
Sal: That they know something.

00:04:45.027 --> 00:04:46.824
We have accounting videos on Khan.

00:04:46.824 --> 00:04:48.754
You can actually learn
on a pretty decent level.

00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:51.383
We have a lot more to
do, but there's no way

00:04:51.383 --> 00:04:54.210
for them to validate that,
so we imagine a world

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.594
where a few years out
someone will be able to.

00:04:56.594 --> 00:04:58.464
Charlie: Who would set the standard?

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:02.477
Sal: I think for any type of credential

00:05:02.477 --> 00:05:04.058
the key is, who is going to be consumer of

00:05:04.058 --> 00:05:06.355
the credential? Who does it matter to?

00:05:06.355 --> 00:05:08.061
For someone wanting to prove that

00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:12.167
they know Algebra, we
have to go to universities

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:13.554
and make sure that you feel this is

00:05:13.554 --> 00:05:16.660
a credible standard that
someone has attained.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.013
If you're talking about does someone know

00:05:19.013 --> 00:05:20.056
how to program or does someone have good

00:05:20.056 --> 00:05:22.892
critical thinking skills
or does someone write well,

00:05:22.892 --> 00:05:24.277
I think you go straight
to the employers and say,

00:05:24.277 --> 00:05:28.112
"Would you respect this
type of a credential?"

00:05:28.112 --> 00:05:29.641
The thing we point out is even today,

00:05:29.641 --> 00:05:32.475
a very expensive credentials have limited

00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:33.557
information in them.

00:05:33.557 --> 00:05:36.480
You could go to a fancy
university and when

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.095
a company like Google or
Microsoft interviews you,

00:05:39.095 --> 00:05:40.429
they still assume very little.

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:41.813
They make you go through a very ...

00:05:41.813 --> 00:05:43.725
The first interview is,
"Go write Bubble Sword

00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:45.864
on the whiteboard," which
is what you typically

00:05:45.864 --> 00:05:48.331
learn the first three weeks
of Computer Science class

00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:50.225
and this someone who's
gone through four years.

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:52.364
To some degree, if you
could take that process

00:05:52.364 --> 00:05:54.855
and turn it into a credential,
and tell the rest of the world,

00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:56.701
"You don't have to go
to a fancy university,

00:05:56.701 --> 00:05:58.069
but if you can get to this threshold,

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.066
you get to round three
of the interview process

00:06:00.066 --> 00:06:06.599
at Software Company X or
Fortune 500 Company Y,"

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:07.736
it could be a powerful thing.

00:06:07.736 --> 00:06:08.737
Charlie: This is not a silver bullet,

00:06:08.737 --> 00:06:10.374
but there is some magic here.

00:06:10.374 --> 00:06:13.602
What is it that you
understood about learning

00:06:13.602 --> 00:06:16.338
when you taught your niece way back when?

00:06:16.338 --> 00:06:17.552
Sal: Yeah, and I'll
emphasize that it's not

00:06:17.552 --> 00:06:19.874
a silver bullet. (laughter)

00:06:19.874 --> 00:06:21.176
The biggest criticism we get is,

00:06:21.176 --> 00:06:22.069
"This is not a silver bullet."

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:24.352
It's like, "I agree!"

00:06:27.167 --> 00:06:29.484
Charlie: What I mean
by that is that there's

00:06:29.484 --> 00:06:31.864
no easy way here, you're
just helping people

00:06:31.864 --> 00:06:32.703
learn better.

00:06:32.703 --> 00:06:33.785
Sal: Right.

00:06:33.785 --> 00:06:35.672
Charlie: Or helping them learn themselves,

00:06:35.672 --> 00:06:36.953
teach themselves to learn.

00:06:36.953 --> 00:06:38.448
Sal: That's the key and
that's what we always

00:06:38.448 --> 00:06:42.028
want to point out is that for us, for me,

00:06:42.028 --> 00:06:43.965
to really educate someone doesn't mean

00:06:43.965 --> 00:06:46.268
to try to pour information
into their brain

00:06:46.268 --> 00:06:48.241
and hope that they can regurgitate it out,

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.085
it's to really allow
them, give them the tools

00:06:50.085 --> 00:06:52.076
so that they can take agency
over their own learning.

00:06:52.076 --> 00:06:53.720
We all say that's the real skill.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.201
If you can factor a
polynomial, that's nice,

00:06:56.201 --> 00:06:57.523
but if you can go out into the workforce

00:06:57.523 --> 00:06:59.035
and some new technology emerges or

00:06:59.035 --> 00:07:00.756
some new issue comes and you can take

00:07:00.756 --> 00:07:02.035
ownership of it and learn it,

00:07:02.035 --> 00:07:03.530
that's what you want people to be at.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.780
I think what we tapped into,

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.339
initially it was me making
stuff for my cousins,

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:13.453
is put stuff out there
that respects the learner,

00:07:13.453 --> 00:07:16.451
that's approachable,
that's conversational,

00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:18.621
that really gives people
the thinking behind

00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:21.403
something, not just the formula and you

00:07:21.403 --> 00:07:23.754
let them access it on their own terms.

00:07:23.754 --> 00:07:26.244
There's huge need for that.

00:07:26.244 --> 00:07:28.520
Charlie: Can you monetize this?

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.085
Sal: It's an interesting question.

00:07:31.085 --> 00:07:33.085
We're not-for-profit, so that means

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:35.369
no one owns Khan Academy,
but still we have to

00:07:35.369 --> 00:07:37.393
sustain ourselves in some way.

00:07:37.393 --> 00:07:38.903
Not-for-profit doesn't mean that you can't

00:07:38.903 --> 00:07:42.595
generate revenue, universities
do that quite well.

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:46.061
(laughter)

00:07:46.061 --> 00:07:48.100
On top of being not-for-profit,

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.946
we have in our Mission Statement

00:07:48.946 --> 00:07:51.309
a "free world class education
for anyone anywhere"

00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:52.698
so we've kind of limited
ourselves in terms of

00:07:52.698 --> 00:07:53.686
we're not going to charge.

00:07:53.686 --> 00:07:57.081
We're committed to not
charging for the learning part.

00:07:57.081 --> 00:08:00.653
So far, we're philanthropically supported

00:08:00.653 --> 00:08:01.926
and hopefully that can
always make that case,

00:08:01.926 --> 00:08:05.589
it's hard to have a
more scalable social ROI

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:09.206
return on your investment,
but we are discovering

00:08:09.206 --> 00:08:11.287
that we've inadvertently built a brand.

00:08:11.287 --> 00:08:14.466
With that brand, we are
starting to license the content,

00:08:14.466 --> 00:08:16.432
we're starting to do
some brand partnerships,

00:08:16.432 --> 00:08:17.517
people will start hearing more about that

00:08:17.517 --> 00:08:19.100
in the next couple of
months, that are actually

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.850
helping pay for a significant amount

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.410
of our operating budget.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.437
Charlie: How about Corporate America

00:08:23.437 --> 00:08:24.857
or Corporate World?

00:08:24.857 --> 00:08:27.437
Sal: I think there's a few companies ...

00:08:27.437 --> 00:08:28.251
Charlie: The training of workforce is a

00:08:28.251 --> 00:08:29.544
crucial ingredient of what you do.

00:08:29.544 --> 00:08:32.100
Sal: Yes, so there's two elements of that.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.845
One is a lot of corporations feel that

00:08:33.845 --> 00:08:36.050
they're not able to find
the talent that they need

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.147
to fill certain slots.

00:08:38.147 --> 00:08:40.778
So we can either help the world ramp up

00:08:40.778 --> 00:08:42.476
with those skills and then help prove that

00:08:42.476 --> 00:08:44.012
they know those skills
... And then I think

00:08:44.012 --> 00:08:45.447
what you're eluding to is this idea of

00:08:45.447 --> 00:08:47.486
even in corporate training itself,

00:08:47.486 --> 00:08:50.208
this whole self-paced model
makes a lot more sense.

00:08:50.208 --> 00:08:51.091
You're sitting at your desk,

00:08:51.091 --> 00:08:52.046
you want to improve your skills

00:08:52.046 --> 00:08:54.004
in one vertical or another,

00:08:54.004 --> 00:08:55.099
you do it at your own time and pace.

00:08:55.099 --> 00:08:56.492
It is something that we've talked to some

00:08:56.492 --> 00:08:58.124
people about, corporate training.

00:08:58.124 --> 00:09:00.205
A lot of corporations
are starting to realize

00:09:00.205 --> 00:09:02.075
that the best thing they
can do for the customer

00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:04.180
is educate the customers about the domain

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.567
that they're in, so we're starting to

00:09:05.567 --> 00:09:06.293
do stuff there as well.

00:09:06.293 --> 00:09:07.375
Charlie: Why did you call this

00:09:07.375 --> 00:09:08.957
"The One World School House?"

00:09:08.957 --> 00:09:13.683
Sal: This was the working title at first

00:09:13.683 --> 00:09:16.212
and it was the working title because

00:09:16.212 --> 00:09:18.724
I always used to say the irony is a lot of

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:19.981
what you're talking about is going back

00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:21.550
to the one-room schoolhouse where you have

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.106
multi-age classrooms,
much more interactive,

00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:27.894
kids taking agency,
responsibility for each other,

00:09:27.894 --> 00:09:29.238
It was like, "Yeah, but
there's some neat things here.

00:09:29.238 --> 00:09:31.929
Any kid in the world can access this.

00:09:31.929 --> 00:09:34.019
We can connect any student in the world."

00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:36.747
There's another element
to it which I talk about.

00:09:36.747 --> 00:09:38.638
I want to take the lecture off the table

00:09:38.638 --> 00:09:39.977
in the classroom so that the classroom

00:09:39.977 --> 00:09:43.215
can engage with the world
in a more relevant way.

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:45.048
It just sounded kind of a fun,

00:09:45.048 --> 00:09:47.343
instead of one room
schoolhouse, one world.

00:09:47.343 --> 00:09:48.775
Charlie: That goes to the core here and

00:09:48.775 --> 00:09:51.276
I really am interested
in the experience from

00:09:51.276 --> 00:09:52.724
the learner's standpoint.

00:09:52.724 --> 00:09:56.195
Obviously the part of your notion is that

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:59.861
what we understood, as
the classroom method

00:09:59.861 --> 00:10:01.994
of teaching is not preordained,

00:10:01.994 --> 00:10:03.527
as the best way to teach.

00:10:03.527 --> 00:10:07.398
Sal: Absolutely. If you
go back 400 years ago

00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:09.361
and you saw the few
people who were getting an

00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:13.028
education 400 years ago, it
pretty much private tutor.

00:10:13.028 --> 00:10:14.252
Private tutor was self-paced,

00:10:14.252 --> 00:10:15.507
you master a concept, now let me ...

00:10:15.507 --> 00:10:17.613
Charlie: And mastery's crucial.

00:10:17.613 --> 00:10:19.875
Sal: Mastery's crucial.
If you don't master

00:10:19.875 --> 00:10:22.154
pre-Algebra, it's kind
of nuts to expect you

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:24.221
to understand Algebra or Trig-,

00:10:24.221 --> 00:10:27.192
but right now you can barely pass Algebra

00:10:27.192 --> 00:10:28.423
and they're going to
stick you in Algebra II

00:10:28.423 --> 00:10:30.298
or they're going to stick you in ...

00:10:30.298 --> 00:10:33.366
What happened is about 200,

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:36.084
and I go into the history
a bit in the book about,

00:10:36.084 --> 00:10:38.590
a little over 200 years
ago, the Prussians,

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:42.643
now somewhat part of Germany,
were the first to say,

00:10:42.643 --> 00:10:45.591
"We want a large labor force,"
and it's the beginning of

00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:49.341
the industrial revolution, "Let's
have universal public education."

00:10:49.341 --> 00:10:51.922
It's actually a pretty
profound thing that they did,

00:10:51.922 --> 00:10:54.616
but then say, "How do we do
it in an economical way?"

00:10:54.616 --> 00:10:57.813
They said, "Well, maybe we
batch students together,

00:10:57.813 --> 00:10:58.986
we see how some of these factories are

00:10:58.986 --> 00:11:01.696
starting to get built, how
do they do things at scale?"

00:11:01.696 --> 00:11:02.832
We batch students together,

00:11:02.832 --> 00:11:05.501
moving them in a line as a set pace,

00:11:05.501 --> 00:11:07.634
we try to pour knowledge into their heads,

00:11:07.634 --> 00:11:09.058
some kids it'll stick, some it won't.

00:11:09.058 --> 00:11:14.097
At some point we start
sorting the oranges;

00:11:14.097 --> 00:11:15.332
these kids are going to be juiced

00:11:15.332 --> 00:11:16.619
and these kids are going
to go to whole food.

00:11:16.619 --> 00:11:20.286
(laughter)

00:11:20.578 --> 00:11:23.447
There's an element of
even the old Prussian

00:11:23.447 --> 00:11:26.576
model of some degree of indoctrination.

00:11:26.576 --> 00:11:30.594
And then in the mid-1800s,
the US famously said,

00:11:30.594 --> 00:11:32.447
"We want to have universal
public education."

00:11:32.447 --> 00:11:33.096
It's no coincidence.

00:11:33.096 --> 00:11:34.442
Charlie: So we base it
on the Prussian model?

00:11:34.442 --> 00:11:35.563
Sal: We base it on the Prussian model.

00:11:35.563 --> 00:11:36.782
The Japanese too, it's no coincidence.

00:11:36.782 --> 00:11:38.993
These are the industrial
superpowers that emerged

00:11:38.993 --> 00:11:41.927
because they had a middle
class that was educated.

00:11:41.927 --> 00:11:43.457
They fundamentally
didn't rethink the model.

00:11:43.457 --> 00:11:45.296
I talk about it in the
book, it was actually

00:11:45.296 --> 00:11:46.471
a discovery to me when I was doing some

00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:50.000
of the research ... Why
do they always teach

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.192
Physics in the 12th grade?

00:11:51.192 --> 00:11:52.688
Why do they teach Chemistry
in the 11th grade?

00:11:52.688 --> 00:11:54.835
Where did this come from?

00:11:54.835 --> 00:11:57.064
It came from literally a group of 10 men

00:11:57.064 --> 00:12:00.773
about 120 years ago,
before the internet or DNA

00:12:00.773 --> 00:12:02.504
or anything, that said people should learn

00:12:02.504 --> 00:12:04.001
Geometry in the 10th grade,

00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:07.307
people should have three years of English,

00:12:07.307 --> 00:12:09.270
and it hasn't changed.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.344
It's pretty much frozen there.

00:12:11.344 --> 00:12:13.913
What we're saying is a lot
of the ideas aren't new.

00:12:13.913 --> 00:12:14.911
Let's master a concept,

00:12:14.911 --> 00:12:17.079
let's personalize the
instruction to the student,

00:12:17.079 --> 00:12:18.748
this is what would have
been the gold standard

00:12:18.748 --> 00:12:20.761
300 years ago and even 50 years ago.

00:12:20.761 --> 00:12:22.036
If you said, "What's the best?"

00:12:22.036 --> 00:12:23.596
"Well, personalized instruction."

00:12:23.596 --> 00:12:25.218
Now could you do that for every student?

00:12:25.218 --> 00:12:27.961
No, it's very expensive. You'd have to

00:12:27.961 --> 00:12:29.983
hire a teacher for every student.

00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:31.755
What's interesting
about technology is that

00:12:31.755 --> 00:12:34.003
now we can go through the
same thought experiment

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:36.011
and say maybe we can do personalized

00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:39.005
instruction for every
student if we rethink

00:12:39.005 --> 00:12:41.172
the role of the teacher,
if we move them up

00:12:41.172 --> 00:12:42.756
the value chain instead of them just being

00:12:42.756 --> 00:12:45.101
a lecturer, we let them see data where

00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:46.535
every student is, every student is going

00:12:46.535 --> 00:12:48.219
at their own pace mastering concepts.

00:12:48.219 --> 00:12:49.902
We leverage the fact that the students

00:12:49.902 --> 00:12:51.434
can teach each other,
this is kind of where

00:12:51.434 --> 00:12:53.053
the one-room schoolhouse comes in.

00:12:53.053 --> 00:12:54.794
That's another mid-level skill that

00:12:54.794 --> 00:12:56.165
I think is lost today.

00:12:56.165 --> 00:12:57.836
It nice to be able to factor a polynomial,

00:12:57.836 --> 00:12:59.083
but the ability to take leadership

00:12:59.083 --> 00:13:01.571
and the ability to
actually manage your peers,

00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:03.746
if you're a 16-year-old,
you're now leading

00:13:03.746 --> 00:13:06.522
some 12-year-olds, you're
teaching them things.

00:13:06.522 --> 00:13:09.218
Can we start to leverage in that way?

00:13:09.218 --> 00:13:10.562
Everything we're writing
here is like, yeah,

00:13:10.562 --> 00:13:12.180
I think we can, and not only can we,

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.226
we're doing it, we're seeing it.

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:15.977
Khan Academy is a part
of it, but we're able

00:13:15.977 --> 00:13:17.477
to work with schools today that are

00:13:17.477 --> 00:13:18.696
actually experimenting here.

00:13:18.696 --> 00:13:20.533
Charlie: You also say that face time

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:22.898
should be separate, it's a separate thing

00:13:22.898 --> 00:13:24.671
from mastery of concepts.

00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:28.170
Sal: Right now face time and seat time,

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.555
whatever you want to call it,

00:13:29.555 --> 00:13:31.938
it's there at the university level,

00:13:31.938 --> 00:13:33.721
so the point that your units are called,

00:13:33.721 --> 00:13:36.143
they're literally seat time
units, three credit hours,

00:13:36.143 --> 00:13:39.895
six credit hours is how many
hours you sat in a chair.

00:13:39.895 --> 00:13:41.560
What we're saying is, "Why don't you go to

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.891
a competency model where it's not how long

00:13:43.891 --> 00:13:46.056
you sat in the chair, but did you learn

00:13:46.056 --> 00:13:47.979
the material at a level of mastery

00:13:47.979 --> 00:13:50.314
whether it took you five days to do it

00:13:50.314 --> 00:13:52.227
or five years to do it, that's irrelevant,

00:13:52.227 --> 00:13:54.172
you got to the level."

00:13:54.172 --> 00:13:55.787
The other is when you get human beings

00:13:55.787 --> 00:13:58.040
together in a room, a lot of people say,

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.460
"This video lecture stuff, I enjoy it,

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.624
but I love my college lectures where

00:14:03.624 --> 00:14:04.914
I could ask a question."

00:14:04.914 --> 00:14:06.368
I'm like, "Hey, that's exactly the point.

00:14:06.368 --> 00:14:08.376
Instead of questions being 5% of the time,

00:14:08.376 --> 00:14:10.034
it should be 100% of the time.

00:14:10.034 --> 00:14:11.871
There should be none of the students just

00:14:11.871 --> 00:14:15.094
sitting passive and whether
you have 10 students

00:14:15.094 --> 00:14:16.289
in the room, 20 students in the room

00:14:16.289 --> 00:14:17.703
or 2,000 students in the room,

00:14:17.703 --> 00:14:18.870
if you're having a passive lecture,

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:19.624
it doesn't matter.

00:14:19.624 --> 00:14:20.955
There's no interactivity.

00:14:20.955 --> 00:14:22.663
We've all sat in a college lecture,

00:14:22.663 --> 00:14:24.596
even in high school and
we're all in the room

00:14:24.596 --> 00:14:26.710
together, but we're not
able to talk to each other.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:28.455
It's actually incredibly dehumanizing that

00:14:28.455 --> 00:14:30.934
you're getting no interactivity.

00:14:30.934 --> 00:14:33.001
What we're saying is
a lot of your exposure

00:14:33.001 --> 00:14:35.274
to the concepts, and once again,

00:14:35.274 --> 00:14:37.167
humanities have been doing
this for a long time,

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:38.173
"Go read the chapter and we're going to

00:14:38.173 --> 00:14:39.600
discuss it when we come to class.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.730
We're going to have an interactive thing."

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.772
Charlie: What's the
difference or why students

00:14:43.772 --> 00:14:46.921
feel more passionate about their sports

00:14:46.921 --> 00:14:49.684
coaches than they do
about their Math teachers?

00:14:49.684 --> 00:14:52.478
Sal: Yes, this is something
that I feel strong ...

00:14:52.478 --> 00:14:55.250
I saw it in high school.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.355
You're in 10th grade Algebra class,

00:14:57.355 --> 00:15:00.061
the teacher asks the
students to do six problems,

00:15:00.061 --> 00:15:02.729
"Oh my God," they're
groaning and they're like,

00:15:02.729 --> 00:15:05.139
"He's the meanest guy
on the planet," and then

00:15:05.139 --> 00:15:07.393
three hours later, we're
at wrestling practice

00:15:07.393 --> 00:15:10.269
and the teacher says, "I want you to do

00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:13.055
50 pushups followed by
running three miles,

00:15:13.055 --> 00:15:15.273
followed by another 50
pushups," and they're like,

00:15:15.273 --> 00:15:17.144
"Yes Sir! Yes Sir! Push me harder!

00:15:17.144 --> 00:15:18.885
I wanna collapse!" Literally, sometimes

00:15:18.885 --> 00:15:21.409
people would collapse they're
willing to work so hard.

00:15:21.409 --> 00:15:22.210
Charlie: What's the difference?

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.514
Sal: The difference is that they feel that

00:15:23.514 --> 00:15:25.091
the coach is on their side, that the coach

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.639
is preparing them for battle.

00:15:27.639 --> 00:15:28.721
Charlie: It's in their
interest to do what he says.

00:15:28.721 --> 00:15:30.644
Sal: It's in their interest.
They're training me.

00:15:30.644 --> 00:15:31.976
While the unfortunate
thing is that even though

00:15:31.976 --> 00:15:34.581
the Math teacher cares
just as much or more

00:15:34.581 --> 00:15:37.147
about the student, the
Math teacher's viewed

00:15:37.147 --> 00:15:39.039
as an adversary, "This is the person who's

00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:40.876
going to keep me from passing. This is the

00:15:40.876 --> 00:15:41.875
person that's trying
flunk ... ," even though

00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:44.332
that's not what the
motivations of the teacher are.

00:15:44.332 --> 00:15:47.428
What we're advocating, what we're seeing

00:15:47.428 --> 00:15:49.235
is working well and the teachers we've

00:15:49.235 --> 00:15:50.749
worked with really love it is,

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:53.837
become that coach and
you don't have to become

00:15:53.837 --> 00:15:57.292
both the assessor and the
lecturer and the coach,

00:15:57.292 --> 00:15:59.124
be that coach figure, be that mentor.

00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:01.419
You'll form a deeper
connection with the students,

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:04.087
and you're preparing them
for an outside world.

00:16:04.087 --> 00:16:06.417
It's a very subtle but
powerful mindset change.

00:16:06.417 --> 00:16:07.832
Charlie: You have pathway to excellence.

00:16:07.832 --> 00:16:12.806
Sal: Exactly. I had a
dinner, I happened to be

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:15.171
sitting next to Wendy
Kopp, Teach for America,

00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:17.640
and we just randomly
started talking about,

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.532
"What do you notice amongst
the Teach for America

00:16:19.532 --> 00:16:22.448
teachers that are really
able to move the dial?"

00:16:22.448 --> 00:16:24.138
She says, "It's actually
surprising, most people

00:16:24.138 --> 00:16:25.665
think it would be about content delivery;

00:16:25.665 --> 00:16:27.043
who can give the best
lecture, who could ... "

00:16:27.043 --> 00:16:28.952
Charlie: Who has magic as a teacher?

00:16:28.952 --> 00:16:31.779
Sal: Yeah, because movies try to ...

00:16:31.779 --> 00:16:33.609
And they do have magic,
but it's a different

00:16:33.609 --> 00:16:34.548
type of magic."

00:16:34.548 --> 00:16:37.274
It's the teachers who can change the

00:16:37.274 --> 00:16:40.024
students' mindsets, who
can be that older brother

00:16:40.024 --> 00:16:42.289
or father or that mother figure and say,

00:16:42.289 --> 00:16:44.437
"Look, this is a do or
die situation and if

00:16:44.437 --> 00:16:46.803
you want to be able to
survive in this world,

00:16:46.803 --> 00:16:49.129
I'm here for you, but it's
your decision to make."

00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:51.360
The same type of psychology
that a coach does.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.774
Those are the ones, once
you get the student,

00:16:53.774 --> 00:16:55.077
once it clicks in their brain,

00:16:55.077 --> 00:16:55.942
"Wait, I have to take ownership here."

00:16:55.942 --> 00:16:57.548
Charlie: On a football team
you got to learn the plays.

00:16:57.548 --> 00:17:00.298
Sal: Exactly, and you have to
take ownership for yourself.

00:17:00.298 --> 00:17:03.185
"It's not me, it's you. You're
going to make it or you're not

00:17:03.185 --> 00:17:04.793
and I'm just here to help
you." That changes the ...

00:17:04.793 --> 00:17:05.587
Charlie: "I can't play the game for you,

00:17:05.587 --> 00:17:06.382
you have to play it yourself."

00:17:06.382 --> 00:17:07.987
Sal: Exactly.

00:17:07.987 --> 00:17:10.264
Charlie: So when you look
at the next five years,

00:17:10.264 --> 00:17:13.090
where might I see Khan
Academy in five years?

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:15.367
I mean, is it simply a multiplier effect

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:17.407
of how many kids you can reach?

00:17:17.407 --> 00:17:19.731
Sal: It's definitely
that, so in five years

00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:22.025
I hope we're reaching
50, who knows what might

00:17:22.025 --> 00:17:24.202
happen with internationalization.

00:17:24.202 --> 00:17:26.192
I hope that you see,
especially even in places

00:17:26.192 --> 00:17:27.805
where they don't have access, although I

00:17:27.805 --> 00:17:29.088
think the access issue is going to get

00:17:29.088 --> 00:17:29.979
solved to a large degree in the next

00:17:29.979 --> 00:17:33.802
five years with cheaper
tablets and more internet ...

00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:34.843
Charlie: Throughout education?

00:17:34.843 --> 00:17:37.689
Sal: Throughout education,
but even outside

00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:39.990
of formal education systems, NGOs are

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.927
going to be able to give tablets to kids.

00:17:42.927 --> 00:17:47.094
I think it'll be some of
the ideas in the book that

00:17:47.094 --> 00:17:50.028
right now like, "No more
lectures in the classrooms?"

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:51.877
I think they're going to
start being maintstream.

00:17:51.877 --> 00:17:52.679
I think you're going to start seeing

00:17:52.679 --> 00:17:54.593
top institutions realize
that it's in their

00:17:54.593 --> 00:17:57.077
best interest to not define themselves by,

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:59.097
"I gave a good lecture that's passive,"

00:17:59.097 --> 00:18:01.486
but what's the formal experience that

00:18:01.486 --> 00:18:03.175
I do on my campus?"

00:18:03.175 --> 00:18:04.762
I think when you do
that, when people realize

00:18:04.762 --> 00:18:05.948
that it's not an either or,

00:18:05.948 --> 00:18:07.977
that these are tools
that will help students

00:18:07.977 --> 00:18:09.646
take ownership, then it frees up

00:18:09.646 --> 00:18:11.813
the physical environment to go deeper.

00:18:11.813 --> 00:18:14.259
I think that'll be a
mainstream thing in five years.

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:15.053
Charlie: Where are we in terms of

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:18.064
online education in the evolution,

00:18:18.064 --> 00:18:19.589
because it didn't deliver what many

00:18:19.589 --> 00:18:21.343
people thought it would once they

00:18:21.343 --> 00:18:23.931
understood that it could be a tool?

00:18:23.931 --> 00:18:26.432
Sal: Yes, you had a first wave in the late

00:18:26.432 --> 00:18:29.229
'90s, early 2000s, it was kind
of obvious. The internet's

00:18:29.229 --> 00:18:31.513
about disseminating
information ...hey, education.

00:18:31.513 --> 00:18:32.579
Charlie: It came along
when the development

00:18:32.579 --> 00:18:33.863
of the PC, I assume?

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:36.440
Sal: Steve Jobs famously
originally thought

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.021
that the personal computer was going to be

00:18:39.021 --> 00:18:40.379
the treadmill for the brain.

00:18:40.379 --> 00:18:41.774
He thought that was the killer app for

00:18:41.774 --> 00:18:44.038
the computer; it ended up
being for other things,

00:18:44.038 --> 00:18:46.041
and obviously it helped
people learn as well,

00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:48.687
but it didn't really hit
the nail on the head there.

00:18:48.687 --> 00:18:50.442
Then with the internet, even pre-computer,

00:18:50.442 --> 00:18:51.723
the radio people thought was going to be

00:18:51.723 --> 00:18:53.049
the killer app for education.

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:56.075
They thought TV, VCR, these are all ...

00:18:56.075 --> 00:19:00.264
TV's here, it's On Demand now. (laughter)

00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:02.149
I think what happened in maybe about

00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:04.606
five, six years ago,
you can't underestimate

00:19:04.606 --> 00:19:06.775
YouTube's power here where it really

00:19:06.775 --> 00:19:09.267
lowered the cost of streaming video,

00:19:09.267 --> 00:19:10.893
producing and streaming
video close to zero

00:19:10.893 --> 00:19:12.115
to the point that a guy in his closet

00:19:12.115 --> 00:19:13.730
could start making it
for his cousins and ...

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:14.399
Charlie: That's you ...

00:19:14.399 --> 00:19:18.018
Sal: That was me, and
start getting traction.

00:19:18.018 --> 00:19:20.945
I think that helped
kind of show people that

00:19:20.945 --> 00:19:22.426
there's a demand here and not just for the

00:19:22.426 --> 00:19:24.235
videos, but for the whole interactive

00:19:24.235 --> 00:19:27.048
immersive experience, so this past year

00:19:27.048 --> 00:19:29.352
you've had these moocs emerge,

00:19:29.352 --> 00:19:31.150
these massively openly online courses,

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.761
Harvard, MIT, edX, there's a group

00:19:33.761 --> 00:19:35.359
from Stanford, other folks who have been

00:19:35.359 --> 00:19:37.638
doing it, and what really seems ...

00:19:37.638 --> 00:19:38.897
Charlie: For credit?

00:19:38.897 --> 00:19:40.098
Sal: Right now, for the most part,

00:19:40.098 --> 00:19:41.320
they're issuing certificates, although

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.837
they are starting to partner with a few

00:19:42.837 --> 00:19:44.841
institutions for credit as well.

00:19:44.841 --> 00:19:47.176
So it's really different this time.

00:19:47.176 --> 00:19:49.904
It looks like all of the players,

00:19:49.904 --> 00:19:51.349
including us, are looking at how do we

00:19:51.349 --> 00:19:53.944
systemically become
important to the system?

00:19:54.544 --> 00:19:55.726
With a blank slate ...

00:19:55.726 --> 00:19:57.154
What is the whole point of education?

00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:58.818
What is the whole point of a credential?

00:19:58.818 --> 00:20:01.087
How do we do that in
the best possible way?

00:20:01.087 --> 00:20:04.681
Either outside of the system
or in partnership with it.

00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:06.148
Charlie: Thank you. Great to see you.

00:20:06.148 --> 00:20:07.316
Sal: It's great to be here.

00:20:07.316 --> 00:20:09.427
Charlie: The One World
Schoolhouse Education

00:20:09.427 --> 00:20:14.735
Reimagined, Salman Khan, Khan Academy.

00:20:14.735 --> 00:20:15.816
Thank you again.

00:20:15.816 --> 00:20:16.813
Thank you for joining us.

00:20:16.813 --> 00:20:19.000
See you next time.
