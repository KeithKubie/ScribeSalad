00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.480
They say time flies when you're having fun,

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.480
and in a grueling industry like Showbiz it's important to make time for a little fun here and there.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.730
A well timed joke can go a long way in lightening the mood on set. What the f*** is the line

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.250
I forgot. And after weeks of working 16-hour days laughter is a sacred thing. Dun dun dun duun

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.299
It's no surprise that actors are charming, it's a huge part of their job

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.179
but going the extra mile to put a smile on everyone's face,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.919
that's above and beyond. The world is an intense place right now, and we could use a little pick-me-up.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.969

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.788
So here are 10 movie bloopers that will make you giggle like a child, but before we get started

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.939
can you guess the movie from these emojis? Stay tuned for the answer.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.680
Avengers: Age of Ultron

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.300
Given that

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.730
they're a team of actors who reunite often, it's not a surprise that the stars behind the avengers are all super

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:03.359
BFFs

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.719
And the movies are better because of it. Their comfort translates to the screen and the chemistry between them doesn't just look real,

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.629
it is real. When that many friends are together in the same place

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.009
they're bound to have a good time. That means there's lots of fodder for the outtake montage.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.430
Why am I going over here?

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.549
To see him on the thing, and tell him, you know. But don't be going all stealth mode motherf***er.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:34.829
Passengers. Filmmaking is often a comedy of errors. Dozens and sometimes hundreds of crew members have to work in unison in an environment that is

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.729
ever-changing. Just in case you're not fully appreciating how difficult that would be,

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.479
imagine trying to corral 20 feral cats into a bathtub.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.829
It's that impossible; so when tensions inevitably run high, there's nobody more well suited to lighten the mood than Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.810
Bet you can't do that.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.500
Star Trek Beyond. Not only is Dr. Leonard H. McCoy one of the sassiest doctors in history,

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.559
he has the coolest nickname. 'Bones' takes his job seriously, but despite being a rather stern looking dude

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.600
he is responsible for a ton of Star Trek's comedic relief. Played by Karl Urban in the modern cinematic

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.749
franchise, Bones is always hounding Kirk for one reason or another.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.910
And since Urban is so good at thinking on his feet, the filmmakers let him make up some of his lines.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.900
It's a real shame

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.510
they couldn't all make it into the final cut, but they definitely add a little spice to the gag reel. You look like crap Jim.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.309
Thank you, Bones. I noticed your Andorian herpes has come back again, why don't you pop by the Med Bay.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.419
Listen I'm going to have to reduce your Cialis prescription, there's too much blood flow to your groin. Now look, you gave Nurse Chapel

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.420
the Gangorian Clap. I know.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.030
She's not happy about it, Jim.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.959
Fast Five. It's said that English is one of the hardest languages to learn.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.760
When compared to other dialects the word order is out of whack.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.709
Homonyms trip up even the most seasoned speakers, and our idioms are totally nonsensical.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.670
So really you can't blame Gal Gadot for getting all tangled up in a tongue twister,

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.359
it's not her first language after all. You were t.. you were

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.049
Wow, what's going on with me? You were a two pack a m...

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.013
You are a two pack a.. a men? Can we do it again really fast? You were a two pack a men, huh? A day, yes.

00:03:35.013 --> 00:03:39.230
The Other Guys. There are all sorts of thrill-seekers in this world

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.719
but some people need a little nudge to get going. When it comes to jumping off a dock, cliff or simply into a pool, these

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.349
cautious folk prefer to plunge in pairs. In any movie about cops

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.339
there's bound to be a few action shots, and one scene from 2010's, The Other Guys,

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.999
required The Rock and Samuel L. Jackson to hop off a ledge to safety.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.699
In any group of people who make a pact to jump into a cold lake at the exact same time,

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.280
there's always one person who violates the agreement.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.710
The Usual Suspects. Over the course of history humankind has disagreed on just about everything;

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.739
politics, gender and religion to name a few; but since the dawn of time little boys and girls everywhere have agreed on one thing:

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.510
farts are funny as hell.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.299
They don't depend on timing or context to be funny,

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.720
but... it helps.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.980
While the stars of The Usual Suspects were filming the police lineup scene,

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.390
Benicio Del Toro let one rip, and the giggling that followed was all legitimate.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.609
Dr. Strange. There's a whole lot of smart talking going on in the movies these days, and the ability to navigate a script's linguistic labyrinths

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.710
is exactly why actors get paid the big bucks.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.130
2016's Doctor Strange, is no exception, as the ancient one, Tilda Swinton, was responsible for most of the heavy lifting.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:04.659
When news of the actress' was casting reached fans, many levelled accusations of 'whitewashing', given that the original character is a Tibetan man.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.330
The dialogue was complex and Swinton fumbled one line so many times she ended up dropping a big

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.979
'ol F bomb while the cameras were still rolling. But every miracle

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.680
every medical miracle

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.080
perpetuated the illusion [that]

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.370
inflated your ego

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.410
Perpetuated the illusion that, delusion that, you can, f*** it, what do I say?

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.499
21 Jump Street. If you've seen any of his movies

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.640
you'll know what we mean when we say that it's hard to keep up with Jonah Hill. The actor has a

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.459
PhD in Insults from Entertainment University and can spar with the best of them. But when filming 21 Jump Street in

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.730
2012, suddenly the cat grabbed his tongue. There were a lot of

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:49.419
complicated lines that required specific timing to pull off, and sometimes he just couldn't get the jokes out. If my coolness and your coolness had

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.110
to fight

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.110
It's impossible to get this joke out.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.049
Nevermind, I forgot where I was. The Martian.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.259
We're not weapons-grade

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:05.609
geniuses or anything, so we can't speak to the science of it all, but we do know that movies where Sean Bean's character doesn't die

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.750
are rare, so a movie like The Martian is statistically significant, even if it's not

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:17.789
scientifically perfect. Technology is a necessary component in stories about outer space, and it's prevalent in nearly every one of the Martian scenes. Okay,

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.239
Let's ask for the 200 million. I'm sorry five hundred

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.820
That's a five? It is.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.160
They should give workshops on that kind of thing beforehand.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.240
Captain America: Civil War. Like we said at the top, the cast of the Avengers movie are a pretty close-knit bunch. Working in show business

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.639
means that some of your shifts might look kind of weird,

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.510
especially if there's a green screen

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.030
involved. That's doubly true

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.609
if you're working on a superhero movie, because on top of all those sensors and green spandex, there's going to be grown men

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:57.419
rocketing across the set on wires. Captain America: Civil War had a few of those men, and the stunts didn't always go smoothly.

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:07.079
And the answer to the movie emoji is... did you get it right? We bet you did, you smarty pants, you.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.760
What do you think about bloopers, are they funny or overrated? We're interested in your opinion,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.049
