00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.690
AdWords allows you to create ads
that are designed especially for

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.000
mobile users.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.450
With the prevalence of mobile users
across the world, optimizing for

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.760
ads on mobile is a great way
to acquire new customers.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.895
There are a ton of options on AdWords
to appeal to your customers on mobile

00:00:15.895 --> 00:00:19.735
including text ads,
image ads, app promotions,

00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:24.405
call only ads, not to mention all the
other ad options you have within actual

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:26.640
apps on different phones and tablet's.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.420
Now, think about your audience
when determining what type of

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.700
ad you want to use.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.160
Think about where they are when
they're viewing your ad.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.470
For example, people seeing your ads on
mobile are more likely to want to know

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.010
where you are and how to call you, so

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.070
you can consider using a text
ad to show your location and

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.110
your phone number, with location
extensions and call extensions.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.350
Or you can use a call only ad, which
will include a call button in your ad.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.800
Now think about it,
when you're looking for Starbucks and

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.830
you search the term on your
mobile phone, how easy is it to

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.000
click on the location extension and
go directly to your nearest Starbucks?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.680
Also creating ads devoted to
people on mobile devices.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.650
For example, using the mobile version
of your website as your landing page.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.490
And your regular text ads may
appear differently on mobile.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.590
So keep that in mind when
you're designing them.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.170
Check out the instructor notes for
more information on that.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.360
One perk of Image ads, is you don't
actually need to change anything on

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.670
mobile, except a link
to your mobile site.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.450
These ads are the same ads that
are going to show up on your desktop.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.410
You just want to make sure you're
linking to the right landing page.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.330
However, you're going to need to opt in
to the display network in your settings.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.210
Or search network with display selected.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.700
We'll talk more about
display networks later.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.910
App promotion ads, or also known as
click to download ads, are one of

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.190
the best ways to get your app downloaded
easily and efficiently for customers.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.890
These are designed to show up on
devices that will have the most impact.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.870
So you're not going to see these
popping up on your desktop.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.010
Determining the right options for you
is all about knowing your audience and

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.850
what devices they're going to be using.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.500
So you can design your
ads appropriately.
