00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.077
The keyID property is going to represent the Ask E value of the key that was

00:00:03.077 --> 00:00:06.770
pressed by the user. For this next quiz what we'd like you to do is exercise

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.890
what we've talked about in action. You need to create an element array of 256

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.670
named keyState, whenever the user presses or releases a key you should mark

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.025
that state in that array. To do this, make sure you utilize the code that we've

00:00:19.025 --> 00:00:22.822
already written. For capturing and hooking up the listeners for KeyDown and

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:27.060
KeyUp. Finally, inside of the update function, make sure that you're querying

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.415
the keyState to determine whether or not you should or should not drop the

00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:33.129
beat, in proper fashion.
