00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.840
Let's think about what
it means to take 8/3

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.790
and divide it by 1/3.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.500
So let me draw a
number line here.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.010
So there is my number line.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.510
This is 0.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.880
This is 1.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.230
And this is 2.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.610
Maybe this is 3 right over here.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.210
And let me plot 8/3.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.560
So to do that, I just need
to break up each whole

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.800
into thirds.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.380
So let's see.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:35.520
That's 1/3, 2/3, 3/3,
4/3, 5/3, 6/3, 7/3, 8/3.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.390
So right over here.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.690
And then of course,
9/3 would get us to 3.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.456
So this right over here is 8/3.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.980
Now, one way to think
about 8/3 divided by 3

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.920
is what if we take this length.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.700
And we say, how
many jumps would it

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.950
take to get there, if we're
doing it in jumps of 1/3?

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.790
Or essentially, we're
breaking this up.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.690
If we were to break up
8/3 into sections of 1/3,

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.510
how many sections would I have,
or how many jumps would I have?

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.220
Well, let's think about that.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.560
If we're trying to
take jumps of 1/3,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:17.500
we're going to have to go 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 jumps.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.080
So we could view
this as-- let me

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.630
do this in a different color.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.713
I'll do it in this orange.

00:01:22.713 --> 00:01:25.390
So we took these 8
jumps right over here.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.530
So we could view 8/3 divided
by 1/3 as being equal to 8.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.640
Now, why does this
actually make sense?

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.480
Well, when you're dividing
things into thirds,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.460
for every whole, you're
now going to have 3 jumps.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.680
So whatever value
you're trying to get to,

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.040
you're going to have that
number times 3 jumps.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:57.000
So another way of thinking about
it is that 8/3 divided by 1/3

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.526
is the same thing
as 8/3 times 3.

00:02:03.526 --> 00:02:05.150
And we could either
write it like this.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.250
We could write
times 3 like that.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.130
Or, if we want to
write 3 as a fraction,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.725
we know that 3 is the
same thing as 3/1.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.110
And we already know how
to multiply fractions.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.770
Multiply the numerators.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.930
8 times 3.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.870
So you have 8-- let me
do that that same color.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.410
You have 8 times 3 in the
numerator now, 8 times 3.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.585
And then you have 3 times
1 in the denominator.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.080
Which would give you 24/3, which
is the same thing as 24 divided

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:52.424
by 3, which once
again is equal to 8.

00:02:52.424 --> 00:02:54.090
Now let's see if this
still makes sense.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.130
Instead of dividing by 1/3,
if we were to divide by 2/3.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.875
So let's think about what
8/3 divided by 2/3 is.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.370
Well, once again, this is
like asking the question,

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.800
if we wanted to break up
this section from 0 to 8/3

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.580
into sections of
2/3, or jumps of 2/3,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.910
how many sections, or how many
jumps, would I have to make?

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.210
Well, think about it.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.350
1 jump-- we'll do this
in a different color.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.595
We could make 1 jump.

00:03:27.595 --> 00:03:29.960
No, that's the same
color as my 8/3.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.520
We could do 1 jump.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.230
My computer is doing
something strange.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.490
We could do 1 jump, 2
jumps, 3 jumps, and 4 jumps.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:49.270
So we see 8/3 divided
by 2/3 is equal to 4.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.770
Now, does this make sense in
this world right over here?

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.974
Well, if we take 8/3 and we
do the same thing, saying hey,

00:03:56.974 --> 00:03:58.890
look, dividing by a
fraction is the same thing

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.920
as multiplying by a reciprocal.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.950
Well, let's multiply by 3/2.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.505
Let's multiply by the
reciprocal of 2/3.

00:04:07.505 --> 00:04:09.380
So we swap the numerator
and the denominator.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.830
So we multiply it times 3/2.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.460
And then what do we get?

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.930
In the numerator, once again,
we get 8 times 3, which is 24.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.250
And in the denominator, we
get 3 times 2, which is 6.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.400
So now we get 24 divided
by 6 is equal to 4.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.604
Now, does it make sense
that we got half the answer?

00:04:29.604 --> 00:04:31.520
If you think about the
difference between what

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.850
we did here and
what we did here,

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.447
these are almost the same,
except here we really just

00:04:36.447 --> 00:04:37.030
didn't divide.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.070
Or you could say you divided by
1, while here you divided by 2.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.600
Well, does that make sense?

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.160
Well, sure.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.270
Because here you
jumped twice as far.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.300
So you had to take half
the number of steps.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.160
And so in the first
example, you saw

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.500
why it makes sense
to multiply by 3.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.100
When you divide by a
fraction, for every whole,

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.280
you're making 3 jumps.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.070
So that's why when you
divide by this fraction,

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.200
or whatever is in
the denominator,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.720
you multiply by it.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.120
And now when the numerator
is greater than 1,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.910
every jump you're
going twice as far

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.970
as you did in this first
one right over here.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.090
And so you would have to
do half as many jumps.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.150
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.030
It's easy to think
about just mechanically

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.480
how to divide fractions.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.350
Taking 8/3 divided by 1/3 is
the same thing as 8/3 times 3/1.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.940
Or 8/3 divided by 2/3 is the
same thing as 8/3 times 3/2.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.660
But hopefully this video
gives you a little bit more

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.310
of an intuition of
why this is the case.
