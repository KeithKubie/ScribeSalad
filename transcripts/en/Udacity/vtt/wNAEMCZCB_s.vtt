00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is what we have to pass in is the start state--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
you've got to know where you're starting from, a successor function--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
you have to know where you can get to from the start state,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and a goal function--you have to know when you're done applying successors.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That's it. We don't need to pass in any other actions or states or paths,

00:00:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
because those can all be generated from these three.
