00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.889
With this telegraph, a device invented way
back in the mid-1800s, I can communicate with

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.490
you, even if you’re hundreds of miles away.
I can update you on stock prices or the movements

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.700
of enemy troops.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.760
Or who's going to the next week on Ru Paul's Drag Race!

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.800
What’s harder to do is make you laugh, tell
you a long story, sing you this metal song

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.309
I wrote, or show you this hilarious cat who’s
terrified of this little toy rabbit—it’s

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.760
adorable, trust me!

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.390
For that more emotional, audiovisual mode
of communication, let’s ditch the telegraph

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.620
and leverage some basic scientific discoveries
about sound, light, and electricity made during

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.960
the nineteenth century.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.640
*Hank sings the Crash Course theme*

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:57.320
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.060
The telephone, invented in the 1860s and ‘70s,
took personal communication to the next level.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.140
Both Scottish–Canadian inventor Alexander
Graham Bell and American engineer Elisha Gray

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:13.420
created working telephone systems in 1876,
and the priority dispute between them is fascinating.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.969
But the telephone didn’t lend itself to
popular entertainment. It was a one-on-one

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.079
technology, not a way of communicating to
the masses.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.340
So it wasn’t until the invention of commercial
sound recorders and motion picture cameras,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.679
in the late 1800s, that you could consume
the same media as other people around the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:31.679
globe.

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.649
And for those devices, we need to head back
to the Menlo Park laboratory of Thomas Edison.

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.829
Who was, by the way, also working on the telephone!

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:44.590
Edison developed the phonograph, which literally
means “sound writing,” in 1877, shortly

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.349
before the lightbulb and electrical power
system that made him famous.

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:52.130
Maybe Edison was interested in recording,
amplifying, and playing back sounds because

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.859
he was hard of hearing. He might have imagined
alternative strategies for recording that

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:58.959
hearing people wouldn’t have thought of.

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:03.979
Edison’s team invented a recording cylinder,
which offered good sound quality. It worked

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.050
by vibrating a thin membrane wrapped around
the cylinder, and then amplifying those vibrations,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.349
or making them louder.

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.060
But other inventors created the commercially
popular record—a big, flag disc that stores

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.260
audio information easily by using the ridges
of records to encode sound waves.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.640
Either way, phonographs are pretty simple
and durable—and still in use! All of you

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.709
“long play”-collecting vinyl heads are
enjoying a fancier version of the phonograph

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.510
every time you start your turntables.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.040
Edison’s cylinders were originally used
mostly for office dictation by big companies

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.189
and had little impact on the consumer market.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.849
In fact, Edison invented a lot of stuff that
consumers would either ignore or outright

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:42.849
despise.

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.220
Probably the funniest example of an Edison-fail
was the talking doll, created in 1890. The

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.010
doll had a recorder in its chest that could
play back “Mary Had a Little Lamb” and

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.530
other kid-friendly hits.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.530
But the sounds grew faint quickly, making
an already creepy object that much creepier.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.700
Even Edison called the dolls his “little
monsters!”

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.090
And Edison’s magnetic ore separator—which
was basically a big electromagnet that could

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.329
pick up tiny bits of ore left behind by conventional
mining—straight-up bankrupted him!

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.109
That said, this was actually a brilliant application
of the new science of electromagnetics.

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.719
Just too far ahead of its time to work efficiently
in practice.

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:25.909
Edison had better luck—post-doll, post-ore
separator—with moving pictures.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.760
As with his other inventions, he wasn’t
the first inventor, just the one who made

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.440
a practical commercial system.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.459
Today, historians credit French artist Louis
Le Prince with the first workable movie camera.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.799
In 1888, he created the first known movie,
a very short one showing off Roundhay Garden

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.940
in Leeds... it's apparently a good garden... haven't seen it myself.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:53.620
Then, Le Prince disappeared from a train and was never seen again, so… ThoughtBubble, show us how Edison

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:54.920
made movie magic:

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.160
As with the lightbulb, Edison didn’t do
the inventing himself, but relied on hiring

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.400
creative experts. Still, he was the self-proclaimed
Napoleon of technology.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.469
So in the 1890s, Edison and Scottish inventor
William Dickson rolled out the Kinetograph,

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.200
the first motion picture camera, which Dickson
invented at Menlo Park.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.420
Film movie cameras work by taking lots and
lots of photographs called frames. When they’re

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.840
played back quickly, they give the illusion
of motion, because the human brain can only

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.620
process so many images per second before it
just gives up.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.000
Edison also created the prototype for the
Kinetoscope, the first device for individual

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.020
movie viewing, in 1891. He debuted this device
in Brooklyn in 1893. And in 1895, Edison created

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.710
the Kinetophone, adding sound to his movies
via a cylinder phonograph.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.800
Edison’s early movies were not exactly Oscar-worthy,
although perhaps YouTube-worthy. They were

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.280
only one minute long, and they often lacked
elements we associate with cinema today, such

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.280
as plot.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.620
One of his early movies, for example, simply
depicted three of his blacksmiths, doing some

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.099
smithing. Other memorable Edison productions
included “The Kiss,” “Fred Ott’s Sneeze,”

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:08.550
Annie Oakley shooting glass balls, “Frankenstein,”
and everyone’s favorite, “Professor Welton’s

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.610
Boxing Cats!”

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.500
Most of these were shot in the first movie
studio, the Black Maria, which was created

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.110
at Edison’s bigger, newer lab in West Orange,
New Jersey.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.930
One notable exception was “Electrocuting
an Elephant” which was filmed at Cony Island in which the

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.639
aging elephant Topsy was killed using alternating current. It was sad and

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.680
weird, and also popular.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.729
Thanks Thoughtbubble!

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.690
Kinetoscope and Kinetophone movies took off
in saloons. And to Edison, this was enough.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.789
Movies didn’t need to be long or complex:
they’d never make any money that way! And

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.110
besides, people have short attention spans.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.169
Other cinematic entrepreneurs had different
ideas. Unfortunately for them, Edison was

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.830
an enormous patent troll! He had the patent
on the camera, so he kept suing other movie

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.379
makers on the east coast.

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:59.160
Which is one reason why they kept moving to
Los Angeles, the eventual epicenter of the

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.461
movie industry. The other reasons were the
better natural lighting and weather, and the

00:06:03.461 --> 00:06:07.400
larger number of very good yoga studios-slash-juiceries.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.139
Dickson left Edison Studios to found Biograph
Pictures, and the French kept innovating.

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:17.960
Brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière invented
the cinematograph in the 1890s with the idea

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.630
of holding mass screenings.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.500
And, finally, in 1902, the U.S. Court of Appeals
ruled against Edison, finding that his company

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.259
couldn’t hold the patent on all movie cameras,
just the specific model Dickson invented.

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:36.470
But by then, cinema had moved to the west
coast, and the world would finally be able

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.440
to bask in the glory of Point Break.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.730
Radio came decades after cinema. Which may
sound odd—it’s just sound, after all.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:50.319
But radio waves have to travel long distances
without losing fidelity, or accuracy. Whereas

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:53.630
movies were carted around using physical reels
of film.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:59.889
Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell predicted
the existence of radio waves back in the 1860s.

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:05.789
But German physicist Heinrich Hertz discovered
in 1885 that a wire carrying an electric current

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:10.909
will radiate, or give off, electromagnetic
waves when it’s swung back and forth.

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:12.639
That is, he made an antenna.

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:17.439
Hertz researched the waves that antennae give
off, becoming the first person to show in

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:21.880
an experiment how to make and detect electromagnetic
waves.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.060
His work led directly to radio.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:29.610
Today we measure the frequencies of electromagnetic
waves in units called hertz. Radio waves—the

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.419
longest type of electromagnetic wave—are
measured in kilohertz, megahertz, or gigahertz.

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:39.550
Inspired by Hertz’s research, a young Italian
inventor engineer named Guglielmo Marconi

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:44.379
worked in the 1890s on how to send telegrams
wirelessly.

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:49.750
Many people were interested in wireless communication,
but it was Marconi who first developed a working

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:54.469
system. At home in Bologna, he sent and received
the first radio signals.

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:59.780
Soon after, Marconi traveled to Britain to
commercialize his system. By 1899, he sent

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.259
the first wireless telegraph signal across
the English Channel.

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:08.729
And by 1901, he was able to send a single
letter, “S,” across the Atlantic Ocean,

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:10.669
from England to Newfoundland, Canada.

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:17.750
In this humble, sibilant way, radio was born!
And so Marconi won the Nobel in 1909.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:22.379
In fact, Nikola Tesla developed a working
radio system even before Marconi, but it was

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:24.699
Marconi’s that took off commercially.

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:29.319
That process took a long while. Regular radio
broadcasts began in 1920, in Pittsburgh, at

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:32.240
the 100-watt station KDKA.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:38.060
And the British Broadcasting Corporation created
the first radio network in 1922. Radio broadcasts

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.610
soared in popularity and became profitable
thanks to advertising.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.940
By 1936, three quarters of American households
owned a radio. Unlike a telephone, a radio

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.820
worked without laying expensive copper wires.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:56.580
So this invention, and the automobile, connected
cities to rural areas and changed how people

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.880
consumed music and sports.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:04.620
Radio also became a tool of political propaganda
and an indispensible way of communicating

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.620
important news.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:12.280
The greatest example of this occurred on October
30, 1938, when Orson Welles directed an adaptation

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.630
of H. G. Wells’s novel, “War of the Worlds,”
in which terrifying Martians invade earth

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.090
and subdue humanity.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:25.520
Some people didn’t understand that this
was a drama - maybe they like, flipped on midway through, and mistook the realistic radio

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.860
announcements for actual news, causing a panic.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.460
As radio was taking off, television was invented
and built on the infrastructure that supported it.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:38.160
And, like radio, TV would take a long time
to move from prototypes to commercial networks.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.540
Numerous people contributed to its development,
but one name stands out. Scottish engineer

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.440
John Baird invented a mechanical TV in the
early 1920s.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:53.450
He used transparent rods to transmit images
of only thirty lines at at time, or pretty

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.540
low resolution.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:00.540
Baird demonstrated the first televised images
in 1924, and moving ones in 1926. In 1928,

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.290
he transmitted an image of a human face across
the the Atlantic Ocean.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:09.640
A year later, the BBC began broadcasting Baird’s
TV system. He even worked on color

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.150
TV before 1930—a tech that wouldn’t become
standard until the 1950s.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:19.580
But in the end, the BBC switched to electronic,
rather than mechanical TV, adopting a system

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.090
by Marconi’s company in 1936.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:28.270
Still, TV was expensive to produce, and receivers
were expensive. World War Two caused an intervening

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:32.580
distraction, so television didn’t take off
as an industry until the 1940s.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:37.560
Telstar, the first satellite for global broadcast,
was launched in 1962.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:44.100
And then, on July 20, 1969, people all over
the world watched as a human set foot on the

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.020
moon. We’ll get to space soon!

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:51.970
Think of all of the communications technologies
required to enable almost everyone alive to

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:56.110
watch the same Super Bowl, World Cup, or EuroVision
final!

00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:01.291
These technologies emerged from intensive,
competitive corporate research programs. Corporate

00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:07.440
invention at Menlo Park set the stage for
later R&amp;D hubs at Standard Oil, General Electric,

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.340
DuPont, Bell Labs, IBM Labs, and Google X.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:16.370
These places sought to, and seek to, turn
basic scientific discoveries about electromagnetism

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.700
into patents and profits.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:24.700
Next time—we’re probing our own gray matter:
it’s the birth of psychology and psychiatry!

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.780
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.230
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is
