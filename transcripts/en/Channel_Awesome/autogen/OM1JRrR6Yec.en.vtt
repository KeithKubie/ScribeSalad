00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
that much in Batman Superman but I do
 

00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:55.830 align:start position:0%
that much in Batman Superman but I do

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
like the idea that he's the last Son of
 

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
like the idea that he's the last Son of

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:58.330 align:start position:0%
Krypton because of his own actions and I
 

00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
Krypton because of his own actions and I
think<00:17:58.539><c> that's</c><00:17:58.690><c> interesting</c>

00:17:59.100 --> 00:17:59.110 align:start position:0%
think that's interesting
 

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.889 align:start position:0%
think that's interesting
so<00:17:59.559><c> I</c><00:17:59.590><c> think</c><00:17:59.770><c> that's</c><00:18:00.010><c> not</c><00:18:00.190><c> something</c><00:18:00.490><c> that</c><00:18:00.520><c> we</c>

00:18:00.889 --> 00:18:00.899 align:start position:0%
so I think that's not something that we
 

00:18:00.899 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
so I think that's not something that we
we<00:18:01.899><c> get</c><00:18:02.080><c> a</c><00:18:02.140><c> lot</c><00:18:02.350><c> another</c><00:18:02.850><c> portrayal</c><00:18:03.850><c> is</c><00:18:03.970><c> good</c>

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:04.090 align:start position:0%
we get a lot another portrayal is good
 

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.110 align:start position:0%
we get a lot another portrayal is good
man<00:18:04.240><c> so</c><00:18:04.419><c> I</c><00:18:04.659><c> I</c><00:18:04.929><c> don't</c><00:18:05.770><c> mind</c><00:18:05.950><c> it</c><00:18:06.070><c> I</c><00:18:06.190><c> think</c><00:18:06.460><c> plot</c>

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
man so I I don't mind it I think plot
 

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.029 align:start position:0%
man so I I don't mind it I think plot
wise<00:18:07.299><c> he</c><00:18:07.870><c> had</c><00:18:08.110><c> the</c><00:18:08.200><c> reasons</c><00:18:08.500><c> to</c><00:18:08.559><c> do</c><00:18:08.710><c> it</c><00:18:08.740><c> and</c><00:18:08.980><c> I</c>

00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
wise he had the reasons to do it and I
 

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
wise he had the reasons to do it and I
think<00:18:09.100><c> semantically</c><00:18:09.730><c> it</c><00:18:09.820><c> works</c><00:18:09.970><c> really</c><00:18:10.120><c> well</c>

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:10.210 align:start position:0%
think semantically it works really well
 

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:12.570 align:start position:0%
think semantically it works really well
so<00:18:10.330><c> cool</c><00:18:11.200><c> semantically</c><00:18:11.919><c> I</c><00:18:11.950><c> mean</c><00:18:12.279><c> as</c><00:18:12.370><c> far</c><00:18:12.520><c> as</c>

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:12.580 align:start position:0%
so cool semantically I mean as far as
 

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
so cool semantically I mean as far as
the<00:18:12.730><c> story</c><00:18:12.940><c> goes</c><00:18:13.059><c> I</c><00:18:13.360><c> could</c><00:18:13.480><c> see</c><00:18:13.630><c> how</c><00:18:13.779><c> that</c>

00:18:13.799 --> 00:18:13.809 align:start position:0%
the story goes I could see how that
 

00:18:13.809 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
the story goes I could see how that
would<00:18:14.020><c> work</c><00:18:14.080><c> but</c><00:18:14.799><c> Superman</c><00:18:15.309><c> I</c><00:18:15.640><c> mean</c><00:18:15.880><c> yes</c><00:18:16.120><c> he</c>

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:16.330 align:start position:0%
would work but Superman I mean yes he
 

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.450 align:start position:0%
would work but Superman I mean yes he
