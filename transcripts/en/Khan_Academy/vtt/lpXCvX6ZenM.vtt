00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.070
We're on part b.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.960
The region R is rotated about
the x-axis to form a solid.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.120
Find the volume, V, of
the solid in terms of k.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.060
So this is our
region R, and it's

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.680
going to be rotated
around the x-axis.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.120
It's going to be rotated around
the x-axis to form a solid.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.860
So that solid is going to
look something like this.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.110
It's going to look like this.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.818
This is going to be
this end of the solid

00:00:22.818 --> 00:00:25.350
when it's rotated
around, and it's

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.760
going to look
something like this.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.540
Let me do my best attempt
to draw our solid.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.340
And then that side is going
to look something like that.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.830
It'll look a little
bit like a loudspeaker.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.996
And so let me shade
it in a little bit.

00:00:39.996 --> 00:00:41.620
So that's going to
be our solid and you

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.630
can imagine that maybe this
right over here is our y-axis.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.000
That is our y-axis.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.310
And then going straight through
the center of the solid,

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.230
you have your x-axis.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.120
If the solid was
slightly transparent,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.220
you would see the other side of
this opening right over here,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.990
and the x-axis goes
straight through the center.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.460
So how do we find the
volume of this solid?

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.810
Well, we could think about
each of the individual disks

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.105
of this solid right over here.

00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:15.230
So think about it this way.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.770
Let's take a disk
right over here.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.670
Let me take this
disk right over here

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.300
so that you can imagine this
little bit of a cross section.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.280
It's a little bit of a
cross section of this solid.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.250
So this disk right
over here, it's

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.010
going to have some area,
some surface area, and then

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.589
it's going to have some depth.

00:01:31.589 --> 00:01:32.380
I'll draw the edge.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.970
You can imagine
the depth is kind

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.820
of the edge of the quarter,
while the surface area is kind

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.700
of the face of the
quarter, the area

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.010
of the face of the quarter.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.710
So what's going to be the
volume of this white disk

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.524
right over here?

00:01:43.524 --> 00:01:44.940
Well, it's going
to be the surface

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.010
area of the disk
times the depth.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.110
So what is the surface area?

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.165
Well, surface area of a circle
is pi times the radius squared.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.320
So it's going to be pi times--
and what's this radius?

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.470
Well, the radius is the
height between the x-axis

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.630
and the function.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.930
So this radius is
e to the 2x power.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.650
So the area of each
of these disks,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.520
for this x right over
here, for this value of x,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.315
is going to be pi times
e to the 2x squared.

00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:23.440
And then if we want the
volume of this entire disk,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.580
we then multiply the
area times the depth.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.070
So times dx.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.550
So this would be the volume
of this little disk over here

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.540
that has a very small
infinitesimally wide depth.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.050
What we want to do is
sum all of these disks.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.810
We want to have a
bunch of these disks,

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.274
that we want to
sum up all of them.

00:02:42.274 --> 00:02:43.690
So we want to take
an infinite sum

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.010
of these infinitely thin disks.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.750
So essentially we're just going
to take the sum of all of these

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.010
from x is equal to 0, all
the way to x is equal to k.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.080
Right, because this
right over here,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.780
this is x is equal to k,
this is x is equal to 0,

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.250
we take the sum
of all the disks.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.069
We will get our actual volume.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.360
So we can actually evaluate
this integral analytically,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.780
it's not too bad.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.970
Because either--
let me rewrite it.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.190
Pi times-- e to the 2x squared
is e to the 4x, just 2x times

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.040
2.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.990
And then, if we want
to take the integral,

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.035
you might be able to do
this just by inspection,

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.410
but if you want
to say, hey look,

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.670
I have a little
function here, I want

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.490
its derivative sitting
here, what we can do

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.410
is we can multiply
this expression by 4,

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.310
and we can also divide it by 4.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.320
If you multiply something
by 4 and divide by 4,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.569
you haven't changed its value.

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.190
You've multiplied it by 1.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.210
But what this does
is it gives us--

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.070
let me rewrite it a little bit.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:49.030
We can rewrite this as pi
over 4 times 4e to the 4x.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.100
I just rewrote this.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.529
I multiplied and divided by 4,
multiplied and divided by 4.

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:55.320
And the reason why I
did that is so that we

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.730
have the derivative of 4x
sitting right over here,

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.860
we have this 4.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.320
Pi over 4 is a constant, so
we can actually take it out

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.600
of the integral.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.160
And so we can say that this
expression right over here

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.740
is the same as this
expression right over here,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.670
from pi over 4 times the
integral from 0 to k of 4e

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.130
to the 4x dx.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.579
And so the whole reason why
I multiplied and divided by 4

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.220
is I have something here,
I have its derivative.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.050
So I can really just pretend
like this is an e to the x

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.700
and you can take the integral,
or the anti-derivative,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.610
with respect to 4x.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.360
So the inside is e to the 4x.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.250
And you can verify.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.000
If you take the
derivative of e to the 4x,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.820
it is the derivative of 4x,
which is 4, times e to the 4x.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.340
So this right here is the
anti-derivative of that.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.310
And we're going to evaluate it.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.930
We are going to
evaluate it from 0 to k.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.210
All of that times pi over 4.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.590
And so when you evaluate
it at k, it's e to the 4k.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.700
So this is going to be pi
over 4 times e to the 4k minus

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.880
e to the 4 times 0, which is
e to the 0, which is minus 1.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.850
So this is our volume, pi over
4 times e to the 4k minus 1.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.970
So that is part b.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.180
We did that.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.890
Now part c.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.480
I think we have time for this.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.850
The volume, V, found in part
b, changes as k changes.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.730
If dk, the derivative of k
with respect to t is 1/3,

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.760
determine the derivative
of V with respect

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.830
to t when k is equal to 1/2.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.530
So this is straight up
from the chain rule.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.700
So the chain rule will tell us--
and if you view differentials

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.150
as just very, very
small numbers,

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.670
it actually seems like a
little bit of common sense--

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.790
the rate of change of V,
so a very small change

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.400
in V with respect to a
very small change in t

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.910
is equal to a very small
change in V with respect

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:02.840
to a very small change in k
times a very small change in k

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.440
divided by a very
small change in t.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.770
Or the derivative of
V with respect to t

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.270
is equal to the derivative
of V with respect to k times

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.091
the derivative of k
with respect to t.

00:06:12.091 --> 00:06:13.840
And the reason why I
said this makes sense

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.640
if you view a differential as
a small number is you would--

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.206
and that's not a very
rigorous way of doing it,

00:06:20.206 --> 00:06:22.580
but it's a good kind of common
sense way of just thinking

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.220
about things-- is that
these guys would cancel out

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.820
if these were
numbers, and then you

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.040
would have dV dt on both sides.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.610
So that's why I said that
this is slightly common sense.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.145
You can kind of
view it that way.

00:06:33.145 --> 00:06:35.520
But this essentially gives us
everything we need to know.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.230
We need to solve for dV dt.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:45.340
They already gave us dk dt at
1/3 when k is equal to 1/2.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.140
So they're already
telling us the rate

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.602
of change of k
with respect to t.

00:06:50.602 --> 00:06:52.560
We already know that this
thing right over here

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.790
is going to be 1/3.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.700
And we can figure out the
derivative of V with respect

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.460
to k very easily because we
have V as a function of k right

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.010
over here.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.600
So let's figure that out.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.850
So the derivative of
V with respect to k

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:13.830
is equal to pi over 4 times
the derivative in here.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.160
And the derivative of
this is just 4e to the 4k.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.560
The derivative of
negative 1 is just 0.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.790
So this is times 4e to
the 4k, is the derivative.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.120
These guys cancel out.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.540
So it's equal to pi
e to the 4k, that's

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.700
the derivative of V
with respect to k.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.270
We want to find it
when k is equal to 1/2,

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.820
so we could write
V prime at 1/2,

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.960
or when k is equal to 1/2 dV dk.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:50.020
dV dk is going to be equal to
pi times e to the 4 times 1/2

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.430
which is equal to pi e squared.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:58.610
So this part right over
here is pi e squared.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.970
And so the derivative
of V with respect to t

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:06.800
when k is equal to
1/2 and the derivative

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.720
of k with respect to t is
1/3 is going to be just

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.340
pi e squared times 1/3.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.280
So let me just
rewrite it over here.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:19.030
So dV dt is going to be
equal to 1/3 times this,

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:23.490
or we could write
pi e squared over 3.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.440
And we're done.
