00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.380
It's really hard to describe how
difficult the circumstances are for

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.060
living out here in Skid Row. There are so
many people who are battling mental illness.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.340
A lot of people got triggered
just by seeing us with our cameras.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.460
– You’re gonna get your *ss killed on Skid Row about that camera!

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.600
We've seen syringes in the street. We've seen feces in the street. You can smell the lack of sanitation.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.040
So not only is this a major homeless crisis, it's a public health crisis and a mental health crisis too.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.220
When you hear "Los Angeles," you probably think movie stars, beaches and endless shopping.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.100
What you don't hear, though, is that this is ground zero of America's homelessness crisis.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.080
I'm on Skid Row, which is the epicenter of it, and I'm

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.360
about to tour these 50 square blocks
where folks have hit rock-bottom.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.820
L.A.'s homeless population is exploding. The number of people living on the streets

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.939
and in shelters has soared by 75 percent in the
past six years. There are up to 60,000

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.380
homeless people in L.A. County on any
given night. The largest concentration of

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.680
them live here on Skid Row, a sprawling
tent city in the heart of downtown L.A.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.640
A UN official described living conditions
here as "shocking."

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.700
Suzette Shaw has lived on Skid Row for six years. She used to live in the shelters, but now has a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.270
government-subsidized apartment. I asked her to take me on a tour of her neighborhood.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.000
All of these people in this
very condensed population ... again, where do

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.460
you see trash cans? Where do you see
water fountains? Where do you see food?

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.079
Law enforcement, they don't like the
tents up during the day. But then, look, we

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.819
have all of these people out here
on the concrete that are subjected to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.040
the heat and the sun and all the
other ills of the street.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.180
Just a block away, police closed off the street as workers conducted a massive cleanup of the sidewalk.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.060
Tell me what we're seeing right now.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.720
So this here are the hazmat street-cleaning teams that come out. And they do street cleaning, and it's

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.720
periodically done. They have been known at times to confiscate people's belongings,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.310
from their prescription drugs to
sometimes people have, like, birth

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.420
certificates and all of that mixed in.
But along with that, people are carrying

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.860
a lot of other personal items that are deemed hazardous, and therefore they end up throwing them away.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.630
The street cleaning is done ostensibly to stop the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.140
spread of diseases, as living in these
encampments poses several human health risks.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.730
There are only nine public toilets
for about 2,000 unsheltered homeless

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.250
people on Skid Row. Most don't have soap, toilet paper or paper towels.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.410
Port-a-potties used to be here and they took them out.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.160
They recently, you know, installed a
couple of more, but there's been a it's

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.610
been a huge fight and pushback from
the community in regards to the fact

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.820
that there's no public toilets.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.820
Because where else are people supposed to go to the bathroom?

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.380
Because where are people supposed to go?

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.780
The lack of sanitation
largely contributed to a deadly

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.370
hepatitis A outbreak that started in San
Diego and spread to Los Angeles last

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.330
September. On top of that, the streets are
littered with needles that get reused,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.380
further increasing the risk of spreading
diseases like HIV and hepatitis C.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.260
It's estimated that more than half of
homeless people in L.A. County struggle

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.350
with substance abuse, and about a quarter suffer from mental illness. Life

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.860
expectancy here is 48 years compared to
the average American, who lives to 78.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.400
The homelessness crisis is made worse by a cycle of people going from prison and jail to the streets.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.260
They don't qualify for food programs, housing and so forth.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.380
And so then that puts them at the mercy
of being on the streets.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.200
And once here, they face further criminalization from law enforcement. We saw a heavy police

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.630
presence on Skid Row, and while it's
meant to deter violence and crime,

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.280
residents here feel targeted. Police give
tickets for minor things like jaywalking,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.000
and when people fail to appear in court,
an arrest warrant is issued.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.980
Oftentimes, former inmates with mental
illness end up homeless, without access

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.900
to medical or psychiatric help. The death
of 43-year-old Charley Keunang, who was

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.379
previously treated in a prison
psychiatric hospital, brought this issue

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:17.079
to national attention. In 2015,
Charley was shot and killed by LAPD

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.460
after a confrontation over a suspected
robbery. The situation quickly escalates

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.669
when officers force Charley out of his
tent and tase him.

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.180
They take him to the ground, and that's
when police say he reached for an officer's gun.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.800
He’s got my gun! He’s got my gun!
[shots fired]

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.500
Prosecutors said the officers acted in self-defense, and

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.760
a police commission ruled that they were
justified in the shooting.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.480
Suzette took me to the spot where Charlie was killed.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.020
Obviously maybe we should've had a

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.440
mental health team out here to maybe
help the situation before then we chose

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.540
to pull Charley Keunang out of his tent,
taser him and then kill him.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.700
Women are a growing population on Skid Row. Nine out of ten women here have experienced

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.660
physical or sexual violence in their lifetime.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.280
I actually felt preyed upon at times. Because, if you're a woman living out here, then you must be you must be a

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.060
prostitute. You must be a ho.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.620
Women have to become tough to survive Skid Row, even with each other.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.200
Run some more. I don’t open my legs, b*tch. I don’t open my legs.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.220
The irony of Skid Row is that it exists
against a backdrop of glittery downtown

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.720
L.A. The area has rapidly developed and
gentrified in the last decade. Trendy

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.410
cafes, high-end lofts and upscale
restaurants have popped up everywhere,

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.660
and buildings are being converted into
luxury housing. All of this is driving up

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.010
rent prices and making apartments
unaffordable. Adam Murray is the

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.910
executive director of the Inner City Law
Center. He works with people who are

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.800
homeless on Skid Row and helps them
fight evictions and find permanent housing.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.860
Why do you think the homeless
population is exploding the way it is here?

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.410
I'd say more than anything else,
it's the disconnect between people's

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.640
incomes and the cost of living in Los
Angeles. In the past 15 years, the

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.750
median rent has gone up by 28 percent in Los Angeles and the median renter income

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.680
has gone down by 8 percent. So you literally have hundreds of thousands of people

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.160
every month who are struggling to pay
the rent. And then when you add in those

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.190
other factors that are going on in their
lives, there's just not a safety net to

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.720
keep them from ending up on the streets.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.680
Is the city just not doing enough, in your opinion?

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.700
The city is definitely not
doing enough. The county is not doing

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.120
enough. Individually we're not doing
enough. Communities aren't doing enough.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.740
In 2016, L.A. voters passed a ballot
measure to provide $1.2 billion

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.280
in funding for the construction of
10,000 affordable housing units over the

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.840
next 10 years. But where to build them is
now the problem.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.070
Part of the challenge is in a lot of resistance, NIMBY resistance, "not in my backyard" resistance, to any new

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.540
housing that goes in, especially
affordable housing. That needs to change.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.780
The American homeless population
increased last year for the first time

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.010
since 2010. On any given night, about half
a million people in the U.S. were living

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.000
on the streets or in shelters. Meanwhile,
President Trump and congressional

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.680
Republicans want to cut spending on
social safety net programs, including

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.020
federal housing assistance. In his budget
request, Trump included work requirements

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.820
for people who receive public housing
subsidies, food stamps and Medicaid.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.540
He also proposed cuts to housing voucher programs that have helped people like

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.680
Suzette find a stable place to live. Skid
Row is an extreme case study example of

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.570
homelessness in the U.S. – and how, for now, the problem seems intractable. Most

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.110
people here are chronically homeless,
meaning they've been living as such

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.360
at least a year, or repeatedly.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.140
What do you think is really misunderstood about a place like Skid Row?

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.040
We oftentimes
pathologize poor people. We see them as

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:52.180
lazy. We see them as not really trying to ...
Yet we don't see the resolve the

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:57.520
resolve that it takes to actually sustain
out here. To have hope when there is no

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:03.760
hope. I've met women who are nurses,
Stanford graduates that come from

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.590
families. I met people who are connected to celebrities, living out here.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.560
And we lack the seeing that these people are actually human, that we're human.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.940
Because I live here.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.980
Hey guys, it's Dena and I'm on Skid Row.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.520
So that's a glimpse of L.A.'s homelessness crisis.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.960
