JAMES GRIME: Yeah, we're doing
sexy maths today, right?

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.030
So we're talking about
sexy primes.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.790
Well, I'm not really qualified
to talk about sexiness.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.440
I've come dressed as a salsa
teacher tonight.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.750
So hooray.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.450
But I am qualified to talk
about prime numbers.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.440
Fortunately for me, though, in
this case, sexy means another

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.700
word for six.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.720
So it's sixy primes.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.160
That's what we're going to do.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.000
Let's be honest.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.440
The reason we're doing this
video is because it has a

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.290
funny name.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.040
But let's see what
a sixy prime is.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.720
OK.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.240
So a sixy prime--

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.204
or two primes, actually,
that differ by 6.

00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:43.430
So if I pick 5--

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.700
that's a prime number--

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.690
and 11, those are two prime
numbers, and the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.550
difference is 6.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.420
So they called sexy primes.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.820
We can pick another example.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.854
Let's pick 7, and
let's add on 6.

00:00:57.854 --> 00:00:59.060
I get 13.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.560
So a slightly bigger
one, then.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.880
Let's pick 251.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.450
That is a prime number.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.380
And let's add on 6,
and we'll get 257.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.000
Let's pick some sexy triplets.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.750
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.410
It's getting more exciting
all the time, isn't it?

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.960
This is 5, 11, and 17.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.500
So those are three prime
numbers, difference of six

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.610
between them.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.920
These are sexy triplets.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.624
Another one might be--
let's pick this.

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:34.060
I picked that one on purpose
so I could use it again.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.750
251, 257--

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.990
let's add on 6 again,
and I get 263.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.420
All right, sexy quadruplets.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:51.270
Let's pick 5, 11, 17, and
add on 6 again, 23.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.200
Those are all prime numbers,
and they are sexy.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.230
Sexy quintuplet.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.170
You're absolutely right.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.560
5, 11, 17, 23, 29.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.710
Those are all prime numbers, and
that's a sexy quintuplet.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.000
BRADY HARAN: That's not going
to the next level,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.360
that one, is it?

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.810
DR. JAMES GRIME: No, it isn't
going to go to the next level.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.289
You're right.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.770
If I add on 6 again, I get 35,
which is divided by 5.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.160
It's not a prime number.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.220
And in fact, that one is the
only sexy quintuplet.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.540
That is the only one
that exists.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.030
And I can prove to you that it's
the only one that exists.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.630
Can I?

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.850
Imagine you're going to
pick a quintuplet.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.190
We'll call the first
one a, OK?

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.270
And the next one, well, you
add on 6, don't you?

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.340
a plus 6.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.550
So the next one is a plus 12.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.350
And the next one is a plus 18.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.830
And the next one is a plus 24.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.680
These are my sexy quintuplets.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.160
Now, these are all
prime numbers.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.900
Now, if you had a remainder of
0 when you divide by 5, that

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.560
means it's a multiple of 5.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.570
Do you remember that
from school?

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.100
When you divide by 5, a
remainder of 0 means it's a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.520
multiple of 5.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.620
If you had a remainder of 5 or
10 or 15, that's another way

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.720
of saying it's a
multiple of 5.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.820
If a has a remainder of 0, then
it's a multiple of 5, so

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.980
5 would work.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.260
And we know what this is then.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.010
If this is 5, we get
11, 17, 23, 29.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.190
If it's a different multiple
of 5, though, if it's 10 or

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.540
15, it's not a prime, right?

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.180
So we can get rid of that.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.650
What about when you divide by
5, you get 1 left over?

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.450
By which I mean, what
if it was 11, right?

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.770
You divide by 5, and you have 1
left over, a remainder of 1.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.150
If that was true, this one
over here would have a

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.420
remainder of 25.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.610
And if it has a remainder of
25, it's a multiple of 5.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.140
So it's not a prime.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.050
We can keep going.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.590
If that has a remainder 2, that
has a remainder 20, and

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.610
it's a multiple of 5.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.960
It's not prime.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.270
If that has remainder 3,
that has remainder 15.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.260
It's a multiple of 5.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.290
It's not prime.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.190
If that has remainder 4,
that has remainder 10.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.440
It's a multiple of 5.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.149
It's not prime.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:24.300
It can only work if the first
number had a remainder of 0,

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.800
and that only works if it's 5.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.480
I've got something else
about sexy primes.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.270
So sexy primes, again, it's
a funny name, right?

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.960
So they have a difference
of 6.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.940
There's a similar idea with
other prime numbers, though.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.880
If they differ by 2, they're
called twin primes.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.910
If they differ by 4, they're
called cousin primes.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.400
We have missed out 3's though,
if they have a

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.910
difference of 3.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.760
I don't think they
have a name.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.640
We'll call them triplet
primes.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.330
Let's call them that.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.340
But if you think about it, if
they're different by 3, one of

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.940
them has to be even if they're
different by 3.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.550
Now, there's only one
even prime number.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.800
It's 2.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.910
So the only triplet prime
will 2 and 5.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.710
That's the only one.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.070
But we can keep going.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.060
If they have a difference
of 5, what are we

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.720
going to call them?

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.980
Quincy primes.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.330
Quincy--

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.940
that reminds me of Quincy
solving crimes on a boat.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.430
So if they have a difference
of 5, same reason though.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.610
They have to have one
of them even.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.520
So 2 and 7 are going to
be Quincy primes.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.920
If you keep going, we've talked
about sexy primes.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.240
So let's talk about
difference of 7.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.980
That's going to be a
septic prime, which

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.010
doesn't sound very nice.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.940
Septic prime.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.940
One of them has to
be even, so 2.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.590
Add on 7, you get 9,
which isn't prime.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.040
There aren't any
septic primes.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.690
We've shown there's
no septic primes.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.220
If you keep going, I think
the next one's

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.290
the best one, though.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.960
Difference of 8.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.180
What do you think that's
going to be called?

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.640
Octimus Prime!

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.140
I think we can get a difference
of 8, yeah.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.305
Let's try it.

00:06:04.305 --> 00:06:06.704
Let's have 3 and 11.

00:06:06.704 --> 00:06:08.480
BRADY HARAN: And 19.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.990
JAMES GRIME: There you go.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.570
We've got an Octimus
Prime triplet.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.980
Hooray!

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:18.350
2 and 11 will be non,
noni, noni--

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.080
nonlet.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.570
BRADY HARAN: But surely
it goes forever.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.820
Lookit, we've got a whole
industry to make here.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.730
JAMES GRIME: I think the viewers
are going to have fun

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.410
making up their own names now.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.630
7 times 8 divide by 2.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.640
That's 56 divided by 2.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.660
How many--

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.850
how many arrows do you want?

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.810
So the next one, let's
say we did 3--

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.210
Same thing.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.860
--to the power of,
to the power of--

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.115
oh, arrow, arrow, arrow--

00:06:42.115 --> 00:06:42.370
Divide by 2--

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.660
--or whatever you want
to call this.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.075
--and that will give you the
third perfect number for--
