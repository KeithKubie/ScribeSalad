1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,390
So today, uh, we will
talk about the bluest eye.

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,443
Yeah.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:13,350
This novel has a lot to do
with the questions that John
Barth was thinking about

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,490
in a very different register
in lost in the fun house.

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:24,030
This is of course the story of a little
girl who is totally remade by a story

6
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:32,740
that's told to her.
And I just want to point this out to you.

7
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,980
On page one 82 of the bluest eye.

8
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,190
This is the letter that,

9
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:43,720
so pet church rights to
God explaining his action.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,651
Um,

11
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:49,651
he has remember tricked Pichola into
thinking that if something happens to the

12
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:56,260
dog that he sends her out to feed,
uh,

13
00:00:56,261 --> 00:01:01,261
it will be a sign that God has
answered her prayer for Blue Eyes.

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,020
And of course what she's given,
uh,

15
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,840
what he has given her to
give to the dog is poisoned.

16
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:12,790
So of course the dog dies
and this convinces Pichola
that her prayers have been

17
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:16,390
answered and it pushes her
over the edge into, uh,

18
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:18,430
into something like schizophrenia.

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,380
But so pet is very
satisfied with his work.

20
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,600
And this is how he describes that work.

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,240
I looked at that ugly little black
girl and I loved her. I played you.

22
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,470
He says to God, and it
was a very good show. I,

23
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,310
I have caused a miracle.
I gave her the eyes,

24
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,320
I gave her the blue, blue
to blue eyes, cobalt blue,

25
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:54,270
a streak of it right out of your own
blue heaven. No one else will see her,

26
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:55,590
uh,
her blue eyes,

27
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,770
but she will and she will
live happily ever after.

28
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,870
I have found in meat and right.

29
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,620
So to do that last line meet and rights,

30
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:09,880
so to do is from the Anglican Liturgy or,
uh,

31
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,770
I may also occur in the Catholic liturgy.
Um,

32
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,090
it refers to the last supper. Uh,
it is meat and rights, so to do,

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,460
to commemorate Christ's last supper
with his disciples through the,

34
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,570
the sacrament of the Eucharist.

35
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,840
So he makes that story.

36
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:32,841
He tells her one into a sacramental
story as if he is giving her God's gift.

37
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,330
But it is very patently a story.

38
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:47,331
And we get that because he says
she will live happily ever after.

39
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,940
So what he has invited her to do is to
fully inhabit the dream of the white

40
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:59,811
aesthetic that her mother has absorbed
through the movies and has used in naming

41
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:03,934
her.

42
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,200
Remember in the novel were told that um,

43
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,100
pechal his name is close to a name
from the 1934 movie imitation of life,

44
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,990
which was a,
it has a complicated story,

45
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:24,991
but it's about race relations and it
features a little girl named Payola who

46
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:30,850
ends up passing for white because she
so hates the blackness of her mother.

47
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,850
So pet cola is mother
absorbed that white aesthetic,

48
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:42,210
projected it onto her daughter and her
daughter finally so longs to inhabit that

49
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,520
story that she goes to.
So pet church,

50
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:53,170
and this is how she ends up and the
cost of inhabiting that story is

51
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:54,010
derangement.

52
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,600
If John Barthes characters
inhabit stories,

53
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,670
stories that preceded them in the world,

54
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:07,930
remember this is why it's important that
the narrator of the first story in that

55
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:09,880
collection is the sperm.

56
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,390
The sperm comes already stocked with
the phrases and patterns of prior

57
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:20,020
literature.
Well,

58
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:25,050
Toni Morrison advances and
analysis that is not so different.

59
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,290
Pichola came into the world essentially
through her mother and the society that

60
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:37,660
surrounded her stocked with
the story of white aesthetics.

61
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,260
The story that told her that she and
her family were ugly and irredeemable.

62
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,900
The quality of Morrison's fiction could
not be more different from the quality

63
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,220
of Barthes fiction.

64
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,940
And I want to suggest to you that
that's because in Morrison's fiction,

65
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,280
this is her first novel begun in the
early sixties published in 1970 in this

66
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:10,750
novel.

67
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,900
She is absorbing something
from that sixties culture
reflecting on it that Barth

68
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:19,210
kept very much at arm's length.

69
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,500
So the abstract question of what kinds
of narratives produce the identity of a

70
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:28,840
person becomes for Morrison.

71
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,940
A political question.

72
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,220
Remember that divide I was
describing in 1960s um,

73
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,250
political in the 1960s political world
where some activists by the mid sixties

74
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:48,040
began to drop out of activism because
they were convinced that it was more

75
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:53,041
important to know themselves then to
actually go and try to promote a positive

76
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:56,470
program in the world.

77
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,500
And there was the
counterculture gaining steam,

78
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,520
advocating a playful engagement with
the world that would be uninterested in

79
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:12,530
questions like the Vietnam War.

80
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Turn your back on the wars
has says Ken Keasy drop out,

81
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,980
drop acid.
That's the thing you should be doing.

82
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:23,960
Well,

83
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,960
the cultural politics of the late
sixties try to merge these two kinds of,

84
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,650
uh,
resistance to convention.

85
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,060
So it merges the cultural
focus of the counterculture.

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,530
That's why it's called
the counter culture.

87
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,920
It produces a culture against the
prevailing culture and that politically

88
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:55,541
activist body of thought coming out of
the civil rights movement and the black

89
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:58,070
power movement in the 60s

90
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,330
so this produces a cultural politics,

91
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,480
the cultural politics of the late sixties
and into the 70s and I would say even

92
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:09,620
up through the culture wars of the,

93
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,770
of the 1990s this is the legacy
of the 1960s in literature.

94
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,520
So Morrison takes the insights of Barth
and she turns them to political purpose.

95
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,590
One of our questions today is going to
be why does Tony Morrison in 1970 sit

96
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:36,851
down to write a novel instead of a tract?

97
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,160
Why is she interested in literature as
opposed to something like sociology?

98
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,700
She has such a strong and passionate
desire for justice for African Americans.

99
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,500
Why is literature her chosen venue?
Now I'm sure there are a thousand reasons,

100
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:58,334
but we're going to,

101
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,390
I'm going to bring some of them out of
the novel that we can read right there.

102
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:05,300
Just without going into
biography or psychology,

103
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,430
we're going to think about how the novel
presents itself as doing a kind of work

104
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,500
in the world that Barthes
writing never tries to do.

105
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,940
So.
That's where I'm going to go today.

106
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,320
Let me also point out that like pension
Morrison wants to imagine the novel as a

107
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:33,830
medium that can hold the human within it.

108
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,320
So a second question that I want to
get at today is given that commonality,

109
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,840
remember I ended my lecture on pension
by arguing that sentiment remained

110
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:52,991
important in pensions work
despite all that word play,

111
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,460
all that self conscious
irony of the story,

112
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:59,370
all that humor at the level of names.

113
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,740
What really finally mattered
was not that search for meaning,

114
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:09,741
but the moment when you could touch
another human being and pension is

115
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:16,161
interested in certain kinds of essences
like dandelion wine or tears or the

116
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:23,631
sailors mattress that hold in them in
suspension the cycles and movements of

117
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:25,434
human life.

118
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,620
Morrison has that same desire
to hold the human in her fiction

119
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,080
and so this is one reason why
Morrison chooses the novel.

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,890
This is the first of the reasons to hold
the human in suspension in the novel

121
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,550
now takes a very particular form and if
you think to the passages about Pauline,

122
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,250
there's the section on
Piccolos mother Pauline,

123
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,180
where we see large blocks of
Italics of her voice coming to us.

124
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,740
This is a very obvious example of
how that works in Morrison's fiction.

125
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,790
This is an effort to let the voice of
the unheard speak through her fiction,

126
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,260
so why write a novel instead of writing,

127
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:23,640
attract or becoming a
sociologist or a politician?

128
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,420
One reason for Morrison is that the novel
allows the voices of the oppressed to

129
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:33,600
speak in a way that they
could not otherwise.

130
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,040
This entails a certain assumption
about her own position as a writer.

131
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,930
She writes from within a black community,
she knows well,

132
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:46,920
this novel is set in
Lorain, Ohio, her hometown,

133
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,940
and so she takes on that task because
she feels she is equipped for it.

134
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,840
She can speak in a communal voice or
she can make her voice available for the

135
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:06,360
voices within the community
that she knows. Now,

136
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:09,930
how many of you have
read beloved? Ah, great.

137
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,100
I usually don't put it on the syllabus
because I assume most people have read it,

138
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,840
but if you recall,

139
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:21,300
this effort to recover the voice of
the unheard is absolutely central to

140
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:23,790
beloved.
It is the premise of beloved.

141
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,240
Tony Morrison found an account of a woman
in a newspaper in the mid 19th century

142
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,060
who tried to kill her children instead
of allowing them to be recaptured into

143
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:36,894
slavery.

144
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:42,260
And she thought about what kind of story
that woman would have to tell about her

145
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:47,631
life or what kind of story could be told
about that woman that the papers that

146
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:53,571
historians would never know and would
never be able to recover fiction because

147
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:55,510
it is imaginative,

148
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,840
gives you a way to get at what academics
have the traditional kind cannot

149
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,920
transmit about the past,

150
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:10,690
but also in this novel
about a life that is more,

151
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,470
that is closer to her current moment.
The moment of writing.

152
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,440
Yeah.

153
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,080
So by including Pauline's voice,

154
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,950
she allows Pauline to begin to tell her
own story of how she became married to

155
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:32,001
Charlie Breedlove and how she evolved
into the fairly hateful woman that we see

156
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,550
her to be when we see
her as Piccolos mother

157
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,850
you might find,
and I have to admit,

158
00:12:41,851 --> 00:12:46,851
I myself find that particular example
quite clunky in a literary sense.

159
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,340
Why did Morrison suddenly turned
to those Italic sized blocks?

160
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:57,600
And I don't know if you read the, I
think you have the, the um, postscript,

161
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,280
the afterward that Morrison appended
to this edition of the novel.

162
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,610
If you haven't read it, I would suggest
that you do. It's quite interesting.

163
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,750
She notes there that she herself is very
unhappy with that section of the novel.

164
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:14,040
She herself finds it Clunky from
the perspective of 20 years later.

165
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:19,041
She writes the afterword in 1993
so it's unsatisfying to her,

166
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,750
but there are more successful versions
of it and you see that, for example,

167
00:13:24,751 --> 00:13:29,610
when the women are gathered around aunt
Jimmy's bed in there talking as she is

168
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,720
in her final sickness and they're talking
with one another about their aches and

169
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:38,370
pains. That's one example of how
those voices come into the novel.

170
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:45,010
There are, there are just
many dozens of these examples,

171
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:47,620
so anytime you hear a
character begin to speak,

172
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,120
you have that sense that you're hearing
something that you wouldn't otherwise

173
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:57,270
hear if Morrison was not there to open
your ear to it and to embody those

174
00:13:57,551 --> 00:13:58,240
voices.

175
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,020
It's one of the great strengths of her
writing is that ability to embody the

176
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:02,854
voice.

177
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,850
So that's one reason why you write a
novel instead of being a sociologist.

178
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,590
Another reason is to push the
boundaries of what's credible,

179
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,240
to push those boundaries so far that
you can see the abject very clearly in

180
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:26,980
front of you within a literary form.

181
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,070
And so,
uh,

182
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,100
she chooses Pichola as the ugly child.

183
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,080
She seems to have no
redeeming intelligence.

184
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,100
She has no one who really loves her except
maybe a few whores who live above her

185
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:50,850
house.
Um,

186
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,610
she has no conversation
that we really recall.

187
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,940
She doesn't say anything
particularly witty.

188
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,370
Probably what we remember her for is
simply that desire to have blue eyes.

189
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,170
We don't really get inside her head even.

190
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,340
And so this is a place where Morrison's
desire to speak for those who can't

191
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:19,640
speak for themselves,
runs up against a wall,

192
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,670
but she's very interested in what happens
when the imagination hits up against

193
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:26,204
that wall.

194
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,840
How far can we go towards inhabiting the
subject position of an abject person?

195
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,320
That's what she's testing in this novel.

196
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,890
And she herself speaks of a
silence at the heart of it.

197
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,360
And that silence is in part the silence
about Piccolos experience of the rape

198
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,910
when she's raped by her father. We don't
really get a sense of what she thinks,

199
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,410
what she experiences.
If you think,

200
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:58,910
again back to Barth,

201
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:04,060
remember that quotation of silence
at the very center of mental ad.

202
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:11,230
So Morrison is again engaging a problem
that other writers are engaging at this

203
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:13,430
time,

204
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:18,430
but she's setting it in a very specific
historical moment with very specific

205
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:24,341
historical and political connotations
and implications coming out of her

206
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:26,780
examination.

207
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,280
So silence is at the heart but it's
hedged around so that we can see it as a

208
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:38,870
silence.
So extremity does that for her.

209
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,410
I would argue that

210
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,180
the third reason she uses
the novel instead of attract
is to generate sympathy.

211
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,530
And this again I was arguing
is part of pensions project.

212
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,740
Usually someone like Morrison is separate
in people's categories of contemporary

213
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:08,240
fiction from writers
like Barth and pension.

214
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,200
I'm going to argue that they actually
occupy much of the same space.

215
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:18,200
What does sympathy look like in Morrison?
Well,

216
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,500
she sets herself a task that I would
say is almost as hard as the task that

217
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,800
Novakof has set himself.

218
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,280
And in fact maybe it's
even harder back off.

219
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:36,260
Set himself the task of making
us like Humbert Humbert.

220
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,200
Now,
how many of you like temper in the end?

221
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,680
He's getting less popular as
the, as the weeks go by. Um,

222
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,920
more of you seem to like him when we were
in the, in the throes of reading his,

223
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,870
his seductive voice,

224
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,830
but Nebraska off set himself the task
of seducing us with Humberto Voice

225
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,300
Morrison as part of this novel,

226
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,420
sets herself the task of making us
sympathize with a drunk who has no verbal

227
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,380
capacities.
Who raped his own daughter.

228
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,120
Now, does she succeed? Well,
let's, let's take a look

229
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,440
on page one 46 we get,

230
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,180
we're a little ways into the
story of Charlie Breedlove

231
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,210
and this is in the scene

232
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:31,763
where

233
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,520
he has just left the funeral of his aunt
with a girl named Darlene and they're

234
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,630
playing and flirting and a
and making out in the field.

235
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,670
She's gotten her clothes dirty.

236
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,220
You ain't dirty. He says to
her, I am to look at that.

237
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,940
She dropped her hands from the ribbon
and smoothed out of place on her dress

238
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:04,990
where the grape Steen's were heaviest.
Charlie felt sorry for her.

239
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,180
It was just as much his fault.

240
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,070
Suddenly he realized that aunt Jimmy
was dead for he missed the fear of being

241
00:19:12,071 --> 00:19:12,904
whipped.

242
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,120
There was nobody to do it except uncle
Oh v and he was the bereave to let me,

243
00:19:18,431 --> 00:19:21,790
he said, and he rose. He
said he rose to his knees,

244
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,580
facing her and tried to tie her ribbon.

245
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,990
Darlene put her hands under his
open shirt and rub the damp skin.

246
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,440
When he looked at her in surprise,
she stopped and laughed.

247
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,500
He smiled and continued nodding the bow.

248
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,810
She put her hands back under his shirt.

249
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,040
These little gestures that Morrison
grants to Charlie in this scene,

250
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,480
tiny gesture of tying the girls bow,

251
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,250
leaning over her,

252
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:55,570
concerned for her looks as
she goes back to her mother,

253
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,400
telling her,

254
00:19:57,401 --> 00:20:02,401
reassuring her that she's not dirty and
in a novel that is so full of demonized

255
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,280
cleanliness,

256
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,440
his gentle assurance that her dress,

257
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,560
those stained is not
dirty in the moral sense.

258
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,310
This is a mark of kindness,
a mark of humanity.

259
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,120
So Morrison begins with small details
like this to build up our sympathy for

260
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:28,984
Charlie.

261
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,880
It gets more intense when
he meets his father in,

262
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,720
uh, in the city. This is on page one 55.

263
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,370
This is when he first

264
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,420
sees him, uh, playing
craps in the alleyway.

265
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,130
Yeah.

266
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,130
Amanda, the Light Brown jacket
stood at the far end of the group.

267
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,030
He was gesturing in a quarrelsome
agitated manner with another man.

268
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,040
Both of them had folded their faces
in anger, Charlie edge round two,

269
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:10,280
where they stood hardly believing
he was at the end of his journey.

270
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,970
There was his father,
a man like any other man,

271
00:21:13,971 --> 00:21:18,620
but there indeed were his eyes, his
mouth, his whole head, his shoulders,

272
00:21:18,621 --> 00:21:23,240
lurch, alert. Beneath that
jacket, his voice, his hands,

273
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,530
all real.

274
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,670
They existed really existed
somewhere right here.

275
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,150
Charlie had always thought of
his father is a giant of a man.

276
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,620
So when he was very close,

277
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:36,740
it was with a shock that he discovered
that he was taller than his father.

278
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,550
In fact, he was staring at a
balding spot on his father's head,

279
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,890
which he suddenly wanted to stroke.

280
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,450
While this fascinated by the pitiable
clean space hedged round by neglected

281
00:21:47,451 --> 00:21:52,160
Tufts of wool, the man turned to
hard, belligerent face to him.

282
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:55,010
And then he assumes that Charlie has come,
uh,

283
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,630
at the behest of a woman that he slept
with two to squeeze money out of it.

284
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,493
Hmm.

285
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,910
So in this scene,

286
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:07,410
we once again see that humane touching

287
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:12,210
impulse.
He wants to touch his father's head,

288
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:14,760
touch the sign of his father's mortality.

289
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,860
The fact that his father's growing older,
he sees in his father's body,

290
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:22,410
his own face, hands, voice,

291
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,470
and we can feel that with him.

292
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:32,830
And then when he flees from that
scene finally and soils himself,

293
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:42,340
he becomes another one of those abject
characters you go as to hide under a

294
00:22:43,401 --> 00:22:46,910
pier.
Finally bathes in a river at night.

295
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:52,340
This kind of detail gives us two things,

296
00:22:52,341 --> 00:22:57,341
both the beginnings or another iteration
of the reason why he becomes who he

297
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:00,440
becomes,

298
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:05,340
the drunk,
the rapist.

299
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:10,430
But it gives us more than that.
It gives us a sense of his complexity.

300
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:13,850
It makes us want to like him.
And in fact, by this point,

301
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:18,800
I would argue that probably most of, uh,
most readers do like him at this point

302
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,173
in the novel.

303
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,910
Ken Morrison Sustain this

304
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,210
to the very end. Well, in a
way I want you to be the judge.

305
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,670
But if we look on two oh six,

306
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,240
I would argue that we're
beginning to see that effort.

307
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,100
This at the very end

308
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,920
of the novel,
speaking of Pichola,

309
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,100
oh some of us loved her and
that love is in quotations,

310
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,640
the Maginot line.
And Charlie loved her.

311
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,620
I'm sure he did.

312
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,900
He at any rate was the one who
loved her enough to touch her.

313
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,190
Enveloper give something
of himself to her.

314
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,600
But his touch was fatal in
the something he gave her,

315
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,540
filled the matrix of her agony with death.

316
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,020
Love is never any better than the lover.

317
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:27,480
Wicked people love wickedly
violent people love violently weak.

318
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:31,140
People love weekly stupid
people love stupidly.

319
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,260
But the love of a free man is never safe.

320
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,200
There is no gift for the beloved.

321
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,650
The lover alone possesses
his gift of love.

322
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:45,060
The loved one is shorn,
neutralized,

323
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,810
frozen in the glare of the lovers inward.
I

324
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,880
for one thing,

325
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:57,170
Morrison and Dow's these sentences with
a lyrical quality that makes us feel

326
00:24:58,181 --> 00:24:59,020
their power,

327
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,320
but there's one line she uses to describe
Charlie that I think trumps all the

328
00:25:07,361 --> 00:25:11,840
others and that's this one
about the love of a free man.

329
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,620
The love of a free man is never safe.

330
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,420
Safety is not exactly a value

331
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,970
in this novel.

332
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:28,860
If it were the safe white household in
which Mrs Breedlove works would look a

333
00:25:30,401 --> 00:25:32,380
lot more appealing than it does.

334
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,700
Yeah,

335
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,700
there's a certain safety for Frida
and Claudia in their intact household,

336
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:46,910
but there too.
It is fraught with suffering.

337
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,640
Their mother is cruel to them.

338
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:55,630
She yells at the safety is not really to
be had there and the safety that is had

339
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,400
comes at great cost when
Charlie is described as having
freed himself earlier in

340
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:07,910
the novel.
Part of that story,

341
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,310
which we don't get explicitly,

342
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:15,790
is that he has learned to turn his
hatred finally against the white men,

343
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:21,610
symbolized by the white men who
discover him making love to Darlene.

344
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,210
In that earlier scene,

345
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,780
we're told that initially he hates her
instead of the white men because hating

346
00:26:29,211 --> 00:26:34,211
the white men would undo him to such
an extent he was not ready to see that

347
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:40,780
oppression for what it was later in his
life were told he kills three white men.

348
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,240
We don't know the circumstances,

349
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,140
and at that moment we're
told that he's a free man.

350
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,760
Freedom when applied to a black man
cannot be a wholly negative quality in the

351
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:04,011
context that Morrison evokes of a
society still plagued by the remnants of

352
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:12,351
slavery to call Charlie free
can't be to dismiss him.

353
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,240
It gives a certain honor
and weight to his anger.

354
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,200
Okay.

355
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,300
And to revoke that word,

356
00:27:22,301 --> 00:27:26,770
to come back to that word in
describing his love for the daughter,

357
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:29,710
he rapes I think is quite controversial.

358
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:37,050
It suggests that there was some value
in the thing of himself he gave to her.

359
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,383
Yeah.

360
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:45,420
Now this is not exactly what you'd
want to call a feminist position,

361
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,910
although Morrison certainly is,

362
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:54,060
I would say a feminist writer in
the largest sense of that word.

363
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:00,250
But what she has tried to
do here in keeping with the
challenge that I think she

364
00:28:00,251 --> 00:28:01,840
must have set for herself,

365
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,850
is to make us see Charlie complex,

366
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:10,150
Lee enough to sympathize with him
even after he commits this crime.

367
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,440
So she takes a certain kind of risk,

368
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,710
but that's why she does it.

369
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,640
She wants us to see him
in a sympathetic light.

370
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,310
This is what a novel can do.

371
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,430
It requires that lyrical quality of voice.

372
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,560
It requires the buildup of history,

373
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,570
and it requires in this scene,
the return to that precise language.

374
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,090
So a very common literary technique.

375
00:28:40,091 --> 00:28:44,740
We see it all the time in the things
that we read together is to return to the

376
00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:49,600
terms you use in an earlier moment to
ring the changes on those terms. Again,

377
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,060
to use that word well,

378
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:56,980
that's what Morrison uses to produce
this sense of value in Charlie at the end

379
00:28:56,981 --> 00:29:00,670
of the novel.
In this sense,

380
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:05,700
it participates or is in conversation
with a tradition of the 19th century novel

381
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:06,994
in America.

382
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,360
So one of the most prestigious novels
of the 19th century is of course,

383
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,100
Harriet Beecher Stowe
is uncle Tom's cabin.

384
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:20,280
Hugely successful novel abolitionists
novel whose aim was to create a sense of

385
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,510
the slave's humanity for white readers

386
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:34,630
so that white readers would become
inspired to the abolitionist cause.

387
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,550
Okay.

388
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:41,550
What was repulsive about that novel to
someone like Morrison is the starched

389
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:51,930
white virtue and the starched white
culture to which the African American

390
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:57,160
characters in the novel were recruited.

391
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,220
So in that novel,

392
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:05,221
their humanity and the sympathy that that
would evoke from the reader dependent

393
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:11,020
on they're looking as white as possible.
And therefore there was this, uh,

394
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,740
great privileging of the light
skinned black in that novel

395
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:22,350
and a sense of Christian value
redeeming the darker skinned characters.

396
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:30,310
They needed it more, it seems,
than the light skinned characters.

397
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:34,990
So the darker your skin is in uncle
Tom's cabin, the more religious you are.

398
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,210
Yeah.

399
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,740
So it's a whitewashing

400
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,470
of the African American figure.

401
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:48,580
So Morrison takes something
of the sympathetic project
of uncle Tom's cabin and

402
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:52,730
that tradition of the 19th century novel,

403
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:59,140
but she transforms it by making us
sympathetic to someone like Charlie,

404
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,720
who Harriet Beecher Stowe would put
so far outside the Pale of humanity.

405
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,780
We wouldn't,
he wouldn't even be visible on her screen.

406
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,190
Yeah.

407
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,720
So this is her project.
Sympathy,

408
00:31:16,721 --> 00:31:17,500
however,

409
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,500
relies on some darker and more ambiguous
techniques that Morrison is also

410
00:31:24,731 --> 00:31:28,360
committed to. And one of those is
what I'm going to call negativity.

411
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,710
Morrison is very,
uh,

412
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:37,980
careful in this novel especially
to talk about what people are not.

413
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:45,630
And you see an example of this on page
55 when she's describing the prostitutes.

414
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,093
Yeah.

415
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,510
This is after she's been telling stories.

416
00:31:54,511 --> 00:31:59,511
A Marine Ms. Murray has been telling
stories to Pichola about her husband.

417
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,200
They did not belong.
This is at the bottom of the page.

418
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:11,201
They did not belong to those generations
of prostitutes created in novels with

419
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:16,400
great and generous hearts dedicated
because of the horror of circumstance to

420
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:21,200
ameliorating the luckless bear in life
of men taking money incidentally and

421
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:22,670
humbly for their understanding.

422
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:28,220
Nor were they from that sensitive breed
of young girl gone wrong at the hands of

423
00:32:28,221 --> 00:32:29,054
fate,

424
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:32,740
forced to cultivate an outward bitterness
in order to protect her springtime

425
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,740
from further shock.

426
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,610
But knowing full well she was cut out for
better things and could make the right

427
00:32:37,611 --> 00:32:41,090
man happy.
Neither were they the sloppy,

428
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:44,600
inadequate whores who are unable
to make a living at it alone.

429
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,640
Turn to drug consumption and traffic or
pimps to help complete their scheme of

430
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:50,540
self destruction.

431
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,580
Avoiding suicide only to punish the memory
of some apps and father or to sustain

432
00:32:55,581 --> 00:33:00,581
the misery of some silent mother except
for Maria's fabled love for Dewey

433
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:05,630
prints. These women hated
men. All men without shame,

434
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,490
apology or discrimination.

435
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,470
They abuse their visitors with a
scoring grown mechanical from youth use,

436
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,490
black men, white men, Puerto Rican,
Mexican Jews, Poles, whatever.

437
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,410
All were inadequate and weak.

438
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,010
All came under their jaundiced eyes
and we're the recipients of their

439
00:33:22,011 --> 00:33:23,330
disinterested RAF.

440
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:27,260
They took delight in cheating
them on one occasion.

441
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:31,130
The town well knew they lured a Jew up
the stairs, pounced on him. All three,

442
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,300
held him up by the heels,

443
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,720
shook everything out of his pants
pockets and threw him out of the window.

444
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,400
Neither did they have respect for women
who, although not their colleagues,

445
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:44,990
so to speak, nevertheless deceived
their husbands regularly or irregularly.

446
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,660
It made no difference.
Sugarcoated whores.

447
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:50,690
They called them and did not
yearn to be in their shoes.

448
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,650
They're only respect was for what they
would have described as good Christian

449
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:58,450
colored women. The women whose
reputation was spotless and two,

450
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,530
tended to her family, the woman, sorry,

451
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,460
whose reputation was spotless and who
tended to her family who didn't drink or

452
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:08,630
smoke or run around. These women had
their undying, if covert affection,

453
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,450
they would sleep with their
husbands and take their money,

454
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,100
but always with a vengeance.

455
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:17,480
Nor were they protective and
solicitous of youthful innocence.

456
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:21,380
They look back on their own youth as a
period of ignorance and regretted that

457
00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:22,880
they had not made more of it.

458
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,040
They were not young girls
in Horace clothing or whores
regretting their loss of

459
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:28,850
innocence.

460
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:33,850
There were whores in horse clothing
whores who had never been young and had no

461
00:34:34,941 --> 00:34:39,941
word for innocence whores
in whores clothing.

462
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:45,110
That's the negativity,
one version of the negativity.

463
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:50,380
It refuses all those conventional stock
stories of what horse can be in the

464
00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:58,040
novel. So the very first instance
of it singles out the novel,

465
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,930
they did not belong to those generations
of prostitutes created in novels with

466
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:04,790
great and generous hearts and so on.

467
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,240
But all those other versions are
equally fictional types of prostitutes.

468
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:12,800
Yeah,

469
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,180
so she rejects the stock.
Literary cupboard

470
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:23,650
have stories about prostitutes.
They were whores and whores clothing.

471
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:28,150
There is an assertion of
their opacity right there.

472
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:33,220
They are opaque to literary embellishment.
They are what they are.

473
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,280
They just are whores.

474
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,280
But the negativity,
the repeated knorrs,

475
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,790
neither were they this nor were
they that they were not this,

476
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:49,791
they were not that it is a kind of engine
of narrative and it limbs the place

477
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:57,080
where they might come to stand in and
of themselves without embellishment.

478
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:05,150
So the effort to help us to
sympathize with marginal characters,

479
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:10,970
Charlie Breedlove prostitutes
is an effort at limbing,

480
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
a space where they can stand in and of
themselves and it creates narrative for

481
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:22,590
us to sympathize through.
It creates a credibility for her voice.

482
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:27,570
It creates a sense of where
they can occupy a space.

483
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:28,860
These characters.

484
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,140
Yeah.

485
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,660
What's more Murray,
as we know,

486
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:40,670
is the one person who really
tells stories in this novel.

487
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,860
So Morrison also gives her a
special gift as a character,

488
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,760
a gift that Morrison's own gift echos.

489
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:54,080
She's allowed to tell stories for pickles,
delight.

490
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:59,690
She's the only one who does that
sort of thing for this child.

491
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,190
Okay.

492
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,140
Pichola herself though,

493
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,200
is the ultimate negativity and this
is on two oh five you can see how this

494
00:37:11,321 --> 00:37:12,154
works.

495
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,240
Yeah,

496
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,080
this is in the B. In the middle
of that page, all of our waste,

497
00:37:18,081 --> 00:37:22,610
which we dumped on her in which
she absorbed all of our beauty,

498
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,110
which was hers first,

499
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:28,520
and she gave to us all of us all
who knew her felt so wholesome.

500
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:32,870
After we cleaned ourselves on her,
we were so beautiful.

501
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:37,790
When we stood a stride, her ugliness,
her simplicity decorated us.

502
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,780
Her guilt sanctified us.
Her pain made us glow with health.

503
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:44,810
Her awkwardness made us think
we had a sense of humor.

504
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,350
Her inarticulateness made
us believe we were eloquent.

505
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:52,310
Her poverty kept us generous,
even her waking dreams.

506
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:57,311
We used to silence our own nightmares
and she let us and thereby deserved our

507
00:37:58,191 --> 00:38:02,000
contempt. We honed our
egos on her, padded,

508
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:07,001
our characters with her frailty and
yawned in the fantasy of our strength.

509
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,960
Pichola is the embodiment of the negative,

510
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,190
so she represents all that.

511
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:21,250
The community does not want in
itself the excess blackness,

512
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,460
the ugliness that the white aesthetic
says can't be changed or redeemed.

513
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:34,090
She represents the poverty that they all
strive to escape or at least keep us at

514
00:38:34,431 --> 00:38:35,264
bay.

515
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:42,150
So Piccola as the negativity is through
the whole novel and the structure of the

516
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:48,190
whole novel, the absence that
keeps the narrative engine working,

517
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:54,060
it has to keep working because she's
always there as the negative pole

518
00:38:55,990 --> 00:39:00,990
waiting to be touched even in the
least bit by the narratives revelation.

519
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,110
Yeah,

520
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,480
so she embodies that.

521
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,210
The desire to know another person,

522
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:18,770
which in men Alayah if you'll
remember is mentally is his undoing.

523
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,570
He did doubles on and on
his voice asking why, why?

524
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:29,430
Why did you choose me, Helen? Why? Why
do you love me? He can't take any answer

525
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,520
and it makes him ridiculous
and it ruins his marriage.

526
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:42,550
That effort to know another person is
much more than a diddling on in Morrison.

527
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:49,750
That effort to know another person
isn't by definition put off limits in

528
00:39:50,841 --> 00:39:54,350
Morrison.
The effort at trying as far more honored,

529
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,470
the alienation from self,

530
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:02,500
which produces a kind of irony and a
pleasure in humor in both Barth and

531
00:40:03,681 --> 00:40:04,514
pension.

532
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:10,120
That self consciousness that you see in
both novels is not a source of humor in

533
00:40:12,321 --> 00:40:17,321
Morrison because the alienation
is produced by an unjust society.

534
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,050
It's not a laughing matter.

535
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:26,170
It's not so much the universal
human condition as it is
in Barth to be alienated

536
00:40:27,711 --> 00:40:28,640
from yourself.

537
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:34,090
The self alienation that Piccola in
bodies as the negative is the product of

538
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,870
oppression,
racial oppression.

539
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,760
If there is

540
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:50,510
an opportunity for humor
in Morrison's work,

541
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,400
it's not going to come from
that fountain of, of irony.

542
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,760
So is is irony dead in Morrison?

543
00:40:58,761 --> 00:41:03,761
Well maybe if we see
irony in Morrison's work,

544
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,150
it's in the specific local
language of the characters.

545
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,810
And I would submit to you that
where we see something funny,

546
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,790
it's always with a tinge
of darkness as in um,

547
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:20,240
Claudia and freed mother
when she complains,

548
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:25,450
I dunno if you remember this scene when
she complains about Pichola drinking all

549
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:26,774
the milk.

550
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:32,710
She goes on and on and on in this
Baroque Aria of of indictment,

551
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:43,330
and it's funny and what we're told about
this mother is that on her grumpy days,

552
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,520
this is what she does.

553
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,930
She complains about the whole world
until she got everything covered.

554
00:41:50,931 --> 00:41:55,850
She's covered every complaint she could
possibly have and then she sings and the

555
00:41:55,851 --> 00:42:00,851
fact that she turns to singing after
having done that suggests a kind of

556
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:06,431
continuity that there's an operatic
artistic quality to the complaining and

557
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:13,001
Morrison gives it to us in her voice
and that is the kind of pleasure that

558
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:16,550
Morrison's novels give us.

559
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:18,590
Yeah.

560
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:22,400
That's the kind of humor
that her novels give us.

561
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,010
It's not going to be the funny,

562
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:29,720
sad situation of the
perpetually alienated Ambrose.

563
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:34,880
It's going to be a woman in her
kitchen who's out of milk now,

564
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
doesn't know where she's getting the next
court and yet and yet uses that verbal

565
00:42:41,721 --> 00:42:44,810
facility to make something in its place,

566
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,940
in the place of the milk that's not there.

567
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,750
Something to entertain her
daughters as they listen.

568
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,063
So

569
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:02,950
there is a deeper even darker side I would
suggest to the generation of sympathy

570
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:08,450
in Morrison's novels.
And that's um,

571
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:13,630
the last point I want to make for you
today and I think we can see it most.

572
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:20,830
Well, I'm going to show you one example
and then quick flip to it to the more

573
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:23,620
important one on one 76 when,

574
00:43:23,621 --> 00:43:27,580
so head reaches for his ink to
write his letter from to God.

575
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,010
Yeah.

576
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:35,010
A bottle of ink we are told was on
the same shelf that held the poison.

577
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:40,810
Writing and poison are
extremely close in this novel.

578
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:42,910
And what's more,

579
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:47,911
something like reading and being
raped are very close to one another.

580
00:43:49,901 --> 00:43:51,040
And you can see this

581
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,770
on
200

582
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:03,910
in the conversation between Piccola
and her alienated other self.

583
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:11,830
That other voice keeps prodding
her about a second rape.

584
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,080
The second time keeps
saying the second time.

585
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,290
We are not shown that in the narrative.

586
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:21,710
So why is this something
that enters into it here?

587
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,250
The other voice says to her,

588
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:33,900
I wonder what it would be
like referring to the rape.

589
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,220
Horrible says Pichola his
voice. Really? Yes. Horrible.

590
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:42,240
Then why didn't you tell Mrs Breedlove?
I did tell her,

591
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,700
I don't mean about the first time.

592
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,600
I mean about the second time when
you were sleeping on the couch.

593
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,540
I wasn't sleeping.
I was reading.

594
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,140
Okay,

595
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,760
this is a weird moment.

596
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,780
You could read that as an od detail.

597
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:04,310
She really means that there was a second
rape and it happened not when she was

598
00:45:04,311 --> 00:45:09,290
sleeping, although she'd said that before,
but when she was reading on the couch.

599
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:14,570
But I think there's a darker meaning
to this that it's actually the act of

600
00:45:14,571 --> 00:45:18,740
reading that is folded in
to the act of being raped.

601
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:25,340
And this is not, I think foreign
to the whole setup of this novel,

602
00:45:25,341 --> 00:45:27,860
that reading of that little passage.

603
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,090
Because of course,
as you will have noticed,

604
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,240
you have the Dick and Jane primary at
the beginning of each chapter made into

605
00:45:38,151 --> 00:45:40,190
nonsense by being run together.

606
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:45,910
So remember in the first few pages of
the novel you have here is a house.

607
00:45:46,311 --> 00:45:50,420
It is green and white. It has a red
door. It is very pretty. And then mother,

608
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:51,470
father,
Dick and Jane.

609
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:55,820
This is the white aesthetic
embodied in the primer.

610
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:02,590
The message is that when you learn to
read you our inbox in imbuing yourself,

611
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,730
imbibing the white aesthetic,

612
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:12,080
if you are a young black
girl learning to read,

613
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:17,830
you are bringing into yourself
a deadly kind of poison

614
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:25,780
and it's the poison that destroys pickle
his mother and Pichola herself in her

615
00:46:27,231 --> 00:46:28,670
desire for the blue eyes.

616
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:32,863
Yeah,

617
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,520
the primers run together so that we can
see how it becomes nonsensical in the

618
00:46:38,981 --> 00:46:42,040
context of Pichola his life,

619
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,960
but there is a profound indictment of
reading and so you have to ask yourself,

620
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:49,840
what kind of reader does Morrison want?

621
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:54,220
And this I think has a complex answer.

622
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,400
It is not just that Morrison wants
to indict a certain kind of reading

623
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:06,520
on the Dick and Jane Model.
It's deeper than that.

624
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,550
In her Nobel Prize winning speech,

625
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,660
she writes about her ideal reader.
Actually,

626
00:47:13,661 --> 00:47:16,030
I think it's either in one of
her essays were in that speak.

627
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:20,650
In that speech she writes about her
ideal reader being what she calls the

628
00:47:20,651 --> 00:47:22,210
illiterate reader.

629
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:29,010
By that she means the reader not
stocked up already with the imaginative

630
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,990
inventory of the western Canon.
Our reader,

631
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:38,080
who instead has some sense
of an oral tradition,

632
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,980
but there's more to it than that too.

633
00:47:42,981 --> 00:47:47,981
Imagine a reader who is that poorly
prepared to meet a novel of the ambition

634
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,600
that Morrison's novels body.
If you read beloved,

635
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,560
without knowing how to close
read the way we do in class,

636
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,320
it's extremely hard to
get a lot out of it.

637
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,700
You were very difficult
passages in that novel.

638
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:09,890
She learned a lot from Faulkner.

639
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:15,280
That's one of the ways that she learned
to incorporate voices into her novel in

640
00:48:15,861 --> 00:48:20,390
a way that they would sit by themselves
seemingly on mediated by a narrator.

641
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:23,000
She learned a lot from Virginia Woolf.

642
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:28,001
She wrote her m a thesis on Wolf and
Faulkner on suicide in wolf and Faulkner.

643
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,860
So she herself is highly educated,

644
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:38,000
deeply trained in the
modernist avant garde,

645
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:44,290
and yet she looks for a reader that has
rejected all of that that she calls on.

646
00:48:46,281 --> 00:48:47,420
So skillfully

647
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:54,860
reading is such a vexed activity for
Morrison that she represents both reading

648
00:48:58,471 --> 00:49:03,471
and writing as something like the
equivalent of being the victim of rape

649
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:11,740
that pushes the idea of sympathy
into another register altogether.

650
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:14,130
Yeah.

651
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:19,130
It's a text that is essentially
theorizing itself as reaching out to you,

652
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:26,210
not in the sense just of making you feel
like Charlie's and okay guy that he's

653
00:49:26,581 --> 00:49:28,920
human and not some monster,

654
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,700
but actually reaching out to you and
doing to you what Charlie did to pick.

655
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:37,403
Hola.

656
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,310
That's an odd thing to
do to your own book.

657
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:49,430
So I want you to think about the kind of
reader that Morrison imagines and what

658
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:53,520
her novel is trying to
do within to that reader.

659
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,980
Um, I will come back to some of these
themes when we talk about woman warrior on

660
00:49:58,981 --> 00:49:59,490
Wednesday.
