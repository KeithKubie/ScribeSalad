00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.851
Recall also the related idea of neuroplasticity from the brain lesson. Neurons

00:00:04.851 --> 00:00:10.408
grow and develop when they're used and stimulated by experience. And of course,

00:00:10.408 --> 00:00:14.612
our favorite, Hebb's Law. Neurons that fire together, wire together. Our brain

00:00:14.612 --> 00:00:17.384
neural growth are shaped by experience especially in the first few years of

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:21.198
life. Neural growth is rampant in the womb and during the first year or two of

00:00:21.198 --> 00:00:26.024
life. But not all of this growth is happening just because of experience. Some

00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:29.186
of it happens just because we have such big, complex brains and they need to

00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:33.900
develop. All of this random neural growth ultimately does have a price to pay.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.844
These random neural connections that are not stimulated and strengthened due to

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:42.535
experience end up dying off. Or in other words, they're pruned. And this is

00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:43.969
know as neural pruning.
