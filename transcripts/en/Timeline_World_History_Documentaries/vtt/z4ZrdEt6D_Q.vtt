00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.840
It takes its name from the Arabic word for emptiness al Zahara

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.480
But the Sahara is really a collection of deserts and the most remote is the Tenere

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.980
I sit had to cross the ténéré in the way caravans have done for a thousand years

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.229
it'll mean a journey of 1,200 miles over rock and sand by vehicle camel and on foot and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.510
It's a dangerous journey

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.779
For in the sweltering dessicated furnace death strikes the week the ill-prepared or the unlucky

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.758
They call it the land of fear

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:52.438
My name is David Adams and as a photojournalist, I've made a point of going to some of the world's most remote places

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.470
My journey starts in the African Republic of nazir a former French colony where the Tenere meets the iya mountains

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.279
Which is why I'm in the ancient city of Agra des

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.629
AGGA des is a mud city and there seems no end to the patterns that clay and straw can achieve

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.359
It's also a holy city of Islam

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.609
This mosque claiming to have one of the highest mud minarets in all of Africa

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.999
It's a city that got rich on trade less than a hundred years ago

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.889
Slaves gold and ivory were sold here in the Agadez markets

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:53.789
Just love the chaos of these markets in Africa, you can get absolutely anything and everything's being bargained and it's all over the place

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.979
sugar cane onions brain from Niger and then there's this stuff salt has actually been the mainstay of

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:09.239
This whole area of Africa for probably more than a thousand years and it's the great salt caravans that bring it here

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.850
This is Caravan central first port of call after crossing the wilderness

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.040
From north south east and west they converge on Agadez

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.540
Because it straddles one of the great desert crossroads of africa

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.540
Everything about these markets is geared to caravans

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.230
clothing footwear head wear even a haircut

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.610
Meat drinks and fruit for a lengthy desert crossing and of course food for the camels, too

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Doesn't look very happy do they I

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.159
Think you probably really upset because he can't eat it

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.559
It's sort of the reverse of having a carrot hanging in front of you if you've got lunch on your back and you can't do

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.560
Anything about it?

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:18.190
This is truly stepping back in time here, we are at the dawn of a new millennium and there are still people wearing swords

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.020
They're called the Tuareg

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
Not people that you'd want to mess with

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.269
Only 18 months earlier they were in full armed rebellion against the nisha government

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.129
So if you want to travel to the desert and survive you need their help

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.819
Which is why I've got to go a hundred and twenty miles to the north

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.010
That's 200 kilometers to chammiya a place famous for its camel races

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.060
Here, I'll find the people. I need to get me across the Tanner a

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.939
So these are the people I'd come to meet the

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.579
Legendary warriors of the desert and they wouldn't look out of place in a Star Wars movie either

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:40.180
The Tuareg once ran an empire that controlled the central Sahara no caravan could pass without their say-so

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.060
There are many theories about their origins some say they're one of the Lost Tribes of Israel

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.790
Others that they were originally Christian hence the prevalence of the cross as a Tuareg motive

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.580
But today they're Muslim and in stark contrast of the Islamic norm

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.779
It's the men who cover their faces while the women live there is unveiled

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:25.510
The Tuareg are fiercely competitive many of them riding up to four days just to take part in this race

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:39.730
And today that's all it is Oh grace not long ago that have lined up like this for a warrior's charge

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.729
They're off and there's lots of just links the league which sometimes leads to accidents

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.360
In what an awesome sight

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.619
these are the sentence of desert pirates who as recently as the

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.030
1990s were still raiding caravans with Lars and sword

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.460
Somehow I don't think nature ever designed a camel to gallop

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:42.639
It's more of an awkward wallop half Kanter half trot not very comfortable for the rider

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.399
And it isn't a race for the faint-hearted

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.169
The course is just over two miles of three and a half kilometres

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.820
Plodding across the tannery with a caravan won't be quite like this

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.490
It takes ten minutes to cross the line

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.230
And when they do it'll be to the chairs of their women and the jeers of their rivals

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.820
It's going to be interesting crossing the desert of men like these

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.530
There'll be many races today and in between the dancing a

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.429
Chance for the Warriors a little stain and for me a chance to take some photographs

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.320
Perfect moments like this when there's an amazing picture and your camera breaks

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.319
This is my panoramic and there's no working

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.050
Will never happen again

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:16.539
Bond they dance until the prize-giving and this is the prize a

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:24.999
Legendary sword of the Tuareg the takabe, and it's certainly not a toy

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Every Tuareg month

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:41.169
But today they're more for show he says a symbol of manliness

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:48.339
But for a weapon that's just a symbol. It's extraordinarily sharp the perfect prize for a warrior

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:59.560
So these racers are about more than just rewarding winners they're about creating legends

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:26.840
It's as if we're back in the Middle Ages in the time of the Moors prasada Knights and tales of chivalry and honor

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.770
And

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:45.199
Preparing to cross the desert to help me a team of Tuareg will show me the way to the tannery and beyond

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:55.939
Camping equipment tools spare wheels and spare parts of diesel fuel medical suppliers

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.910
rations for three weeks and of course

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.460
plenty of water

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.060
We decided not to take tents

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:12.229
It hasn't rained in the Tenere for 15 years and it isn't likely to for another 15, but I did bring these

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.100
Anywhere without the old skis

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:39.659
We're heading north into bandit country, our route takes us through the hard measures higher mountains

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:44.219
This was a crier egg stronghold during the rebellion

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:58.318
It's desert, all right, but just in case you're wondering where the sand dunes and mirages are

00:11:58.899 --> 00:12:04.499
Well relatively little of the Sahara is sand you and a hell of a lot of it is mountainous

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:16.229
Some of these Arab peeps are over 7,000 feet high I wanted to explore them

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:20.400
I wanted to go deep into them when no European had ever gone and

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.679
To do that I had to start in the isolated town of if you are

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:38.609
Here everything is improvised buckets become drums wires become toys and an old plastic container will do as a soccer ball

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:23.669
If I'd have been walking down these streets 18 months earlier there's a fair chance but have been kidnapped and held for ransom

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:32.069
This was a Tuareg headquarters during the rebellion today all is quiet and I'm just a figure of curiosity

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.059
Word was getting out that there was a stranger in town

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:43.650
Maybe I'd like to ride a camel. If so, wouldn't I like to buy a saddle?

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.590
Or maybe one of those murderers Tuareg so

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.200
This is a really old one. Looks like these are the old alchemy moon symbols

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.379
That would show you only find on the really old swords

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.330
An answer in selling anything

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:14.369
But why would I want to buy it when I can get one made to order

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.630
These must be some of the world's last sword smiths to make swords for combat a

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:32.010
Blade of the finest cutting steel which 500 years ago would have come from European cities like Toledo or Padua

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:39.540
Today's taco bar is more likely to have been forged out of Toyota bumpers

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.649
I'm looking for a guide

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:06.958
Yeah, because I want to go from from million across the mountains into the tin rain I can do yeah

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:10.768
Yeah, do you have camels have coming because I would like to go either today or tomorrow?

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.880
Okay

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.929
And that's how I came to meet Koya abdul rahman

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:27.419
Irr a man who become my guide and mentor a man has helped me to understand

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.940
about tuara culture

00:15:38.649 --> 00:15:45.748
That in the desert lawyers family live a nomadic life moving from Camp to camp with their animals in search of feed

00:15:45.939 --> 00:15:48.539
So the family has been here for three weeks

00:15:49.149 --> 00:15:51.129
They need to be near water

00:15:51.129 --> 00:15:57.269
Not too near an old custom forbids Tuareg to camp nearer than five miles from water

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.149
List their children go up taking it for granted

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:09.809
It's rare that one gets the chance to meet the Tuareg at firsthand. Oh and what a greeting

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:17.219
It means how are you? How are your parents your family your children your grandparents and so on

00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:21.749
David

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.829
The third one is my my wife

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.130
His name was Carla, I was quite a bizarre heat

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.819
Absorbed oh, yeah absorbs out. And what does it mean?

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.640
What is although he I?

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:05.400
Give him this name depend his color. Yeah, so also means white the white up. So it's white but not very white is

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.839
Not very very white is near white. Ha ha ha

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.880
So it's on absol that I'll ride into the ténéré

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:23.609
perched on a Tuareg saddle with what looked like sharp trident shaped handlebars the

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.240
Spikes for these ones

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:37.170
Protection for inaudible from the sword also when they were fighting this is so that you didn't get captured by. Oh I

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:42.210
Thought it was for me to hang on to

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:51.630
Saddle cloths provisions and a traditional water bottle made of goat skins, but there's something missing and

00:17:54.670 --> 00:18:00.119
Where are the stirrups, there are no stirrups master. Ok

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:07.020
Camels and committees and this one looks particularly well designed

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:13.589
Also go very good temperament I think now this is the easy way of mounting a camel

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.620
If you want to do it the Tuareg

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:25.559
Just grab its chin climb up on its neck and spring into the settle before it bites you easy

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:39.270
So off we ride into the mountains towards one of the highest peaks in the ayah, add Ratan gak

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:47.669
As we go Oya sings me songs about his Tuareg heroes and their exploits in battle

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.280
And I demand an RBI

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:08.350
Oh

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.290
Honest

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.010
I mean

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.950
Is love

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.110
Shekhar

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:15.119
We're heading up a dry riverbed through the town gack corridor the start of a major caravan route to the tannery

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:20.310
So it's a bit of a surprise to get our feet wet quite so soon

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:30.119
It was the last water we'd see for over a week

00:20:42.979 --> 00:20:50.019
By now, I'm getting to know her not long ago. He was a wealthy man who owned over a hundred camels

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:59.919
But he got caught up in the Tuareg rebellion against the nisha government had absolutely ruined him leaving him with just these two

00:21:00.229 --> 00:21:03.909
Cameras in the rebellion many of his friends were killed

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.900
Not a lot

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:22.299
As I was to discover Islam is central to Hoyas life when our spray it means I was

00:21:23.899 --> 00:21:29.739
Take contact with good I pray for him. I must do this for ham fine. I would ask him

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.120
What I'm what I want

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:45.569
That night hire brood a part of strong Tuareg minted tea which has to be poured back into the pot three times

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.610
Why do you poured three times three times is something?

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:58.680
We see with our ancestors if it was embodied one T or two was not happy. It's not good. It's not a good thing

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:03.030
It's a tradition for our ancestors

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:25.829
Next morning, we've got company a family of baboons appears from nowhere in the middle of this iron mountain wilderness

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:32.310
It's a big one. Yeah, I see it in before the chief is sitting on this big stone here suppose

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.369
This is the big black ones. There are at once - yeah

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.069
they didn't stay together because

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.250
There they fight again, right?

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:49.470
And that's not a yawn it's a threat his way of letting you know that you've come quite close enough

00:22:56.110 --> 00:23:01.800
But what's so amazing is that they're here at all in an arid place like this as

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.369
It happens their relics from a different age

00:23:09.309 --> 00:23:14.219
Wow looks like a whole family. It's a family thing

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.030
Maybe around

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:31.959
Their animals long gone from this desolate wilderness yet. Their images have been faithfully recorded in stone

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:44.089
It just goes to show the power of climate change

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:49.579
When Tutankhamun sat on the Egyptian throne and King Solomon ruled Israel

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:54.830
This would have been lush savanna land with plenty of game for hunter-gatherers

00:23:55.679 --> 00:23:58.699
Whoever carved these seven to ten thousand years ago

00:23:59.309 --> 00:24:05.149
Sat here in a very different landscape than I do because what he saw out on the plains was giraffe

00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:10.999
Ibex and all the other animals here on these rocks and all I can see is Jones

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:23.059
There before me is what I've come all this way to see the great tenor a desert

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:28.969
Washing like a gigantic ocean of sand across the rocky coastline of the air mountains

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:43.849
So reunited with my vehicles we head off into the desert with Hoya coming along as my guide

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.500
Towards midday in the 10r a

00:25:49.539 --> 00:25:57.089
burning Sun heats the sand her over 110 degrees not good for driving even for our Tuareg friends and

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.749
They're some of the world's best desert 4-wheel drivers

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:14.220
Oh, it's what I think it's not so easy we might be having lunch

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:34.130
Problem is that the Sun is so hot at the moment that all the sand is really really light

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:38.120
And so the kind of attraction we may even have to wait till late in the afternoon

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.920
So we let air out of our tires

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.630
deflated tires cover more surface area and gain more traction and

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:58.220
Once into the real desert we can get up quite a speed

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:22.339
Once into the Tenere all the desert is a road where each car makes its own track

00:27:23.039 --> 00:27:27.528
But Wyrick always drive information always inside of one another

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:32.659
Yet you can get lost in a mirage long before you ever reach the horizon

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.279
Here the sand is firm and the drive is easy

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:43.319
But where the dunes are soft and steep that's where their driving skills really kick in

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.840
The trick seems to be to run up to the crest

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:54.719
Break at the very last moment and then let the car gently slide down and there you go

00:27:59.659 --> 00:28:02.528
But sometimes even the Tuareg get it wrong

00:28:12.559 --> 00:28:17.678
It was our first accident and we're 400 miles from the nearest service station

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:29.739
Pull it down into the compartment when they hit the ground it also ripped out the tire from underneath

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:35.320
And when they collected the ground in front, it's actually bend up this really large bumper bar

00:28:36.289 --> 00:28:39.309
It's serviceable, but I think it's going to cost us quite a bit

00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:49.059
It was a rather violent introduction to some of the most serene sand dunes on earth

00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:53.049
This is actually a giant meteorite crater

00:28:53.929 --> 00:28:58.298
Eric ow, and right now the light is absolutely perfect

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:07.670
I have to say

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:12.729
I've been waiting all my life to come and sit here and watch a sunset like this across these dunes

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.190
These are some of the biggest in the world

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:21.160
And for the next couple of hours in early tomorrow morning the colors and these shapes will just change and change and change

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:23.150
and for this

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:26.859
And taking the photos here is absolutely heaven 3

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:40.709
The shapes are incredibly sensual curves and ripples made crisp in the red evening light

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:53.090
And as the last rays of Desert Sun slip over the horizon and the sand dunes cease to glow a

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.820
Revel in this photographers dream

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.809
Okay the next morning

00:30:05.809 --> 00:30:13.638
I wanted to have a crack at the world's highest sand dune and do it on skis my friends thought I was absolutely crazy

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:21.259
This sand hill is a little over

00:30:21.659 --> 00:30:28.789
300 meters high that's almost a thousand feet and the Tuareg told me it has never been skied before

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:47.670
The trouble is the nearest ski lift is over 2,000 miles away and it was hot very hot

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.650
Every step I take here seems to be

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:05.370
Two steps back and this Ridge seems further and further away. Hey, every time I take the next step

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.530
Getting up here on the ridge this view is absolutely incredible

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:36.420
These dark riches behind me that just burn in this Sun and then turns away into the distance across this amazing crater

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.420
I can see everything

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.000
Fantastic, huh ready? That's harder than snipers. Yeah

00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:57.538
Just having gone up there and skied down on your legs kind of get really tired because you can't move properly. I

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:03.179
Don't know if anybody's done that before but um, I had a hat off to him if they had. Oh

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.880
I love some water. Please somebody

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.820
Say I've been really stupid or taking it up

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:27.669
One week into our desert journey and we're now well into the tannery and I have a caravan to catch

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:39.539
We're heading into the heart of Nazir's sand ocean and the analogy isn't a bad one

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:45.120
Here in the middle of North Africa, it feels as if you're really crossing the sea

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:52.259
The Tenere takes its name from the Tuareg word for nothingness

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:59.760
So we're crossing a nothingness the size of France in the middle of an emptiness the size of the United States

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:13.420
Donavan sometimes they're comers who died during the caravan there comers who died. This is one of them

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.280
Yeah

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:22.030
Death Comes quickly here in the ten rang go without water for eight hours and you start to die

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:27.309
And your body doesn't rot. It's so dry out here even bacteria

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.860
struggle to survive

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:35.560
No wonder they call it the land of fear

00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:47.689
Yet for centuries Tuareg caravans have been crossing it and we're on the trail of one right now

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:10.540
Caravan truck see. Oh, yeah Caravan proxy. We don't know exactly would I want to I will go and see whether

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:22.779
No need for Global Positioning satellites out here they use organic navigation camel droppings

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:27.310
Look Seth looks dry

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.710
Looks dry how many days three days I don't maybe three days

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:39.880
So not so far by the car I don't under the metal sweetheart, okay

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.449
Then in the middle of nowhere we see bales of hay

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:55.629
It's a camel take out our supply duck. Our Caravan can't be far ahead now

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:14.199
On and on for the nothingness we go until a strange shimmering line starts to resolve on the horizon

00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:19.329
It's the caravan

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:37.929
Once more it seems as if time has Stood Still things have hardly changed since the Middle Ages

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:49.299
With satellites high above here. They are navigating their way with pinpoint precision

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.810
Through the turnaround and not a compass in size

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:07.080
This is the same Caravan that's been dropping off. Hey all along the route so when they return they can feed their camels

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:14.940
Using the Sun the wind and the Stars to guide them they'll find it again easily

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:33.899
But they have a problem a boy with a badly infected hand luckily as part of our supplies, we have a medical

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:54.629
Kits now look we can do with him and he probably needs pretty serious attention to it

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.079
But hopefully we can stop the infection and clean it up

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:07.680
But it's much better treatment than he'd normally get out here in a place where the nearest medical help is hundreds of miles away

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:22.080
And it's nothing good he'll he will lose his arm if his wound turns gangrenous could be a stark choice

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:25.350
amputation

00:38:40.299 --> 00:38:43.649
All of this brings the dangers of desert travel into sharp focus

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:56.250
While the ténéré is awesomely beautiful, there's no margin for error no support something goes wrong

00:39:05.179 --> 00:39:11.079
By now endearing one of the most isolated outposts in the country of Lisieux the town of Billman

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:21.969
And how's this for water ski practice well at least there aren't any sharks out here

00:39:31.549 --> 00:39:33.549
Deal

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:47.310
We've done about two hundred and twenty miles across this sand ocean and my Tuareg friends have navigated us perfectly

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:49.710
No, thanks to this though

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:51.460
and

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:57.510
Again on a maritime note, what would you expect to see on the other side of an ocean but a lighthouse?

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.770
It's just that the real ocean is a thousand miles away

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:12.659
It was part of a whole string of them built around the ténéré in the 1930s

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:17.070
It's abandoned now, but it had a distinctly colonial purpose

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:24.060
Because this wasn't actually built for the Tuareg because they don't need

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:29.429
Navigation in the desert they've got their own it was built for the French army, so they wouldn't get lost

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:41.170
This is the oasis town of Bill Maher and here there's plenty of fresh water

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:50.390
It bubbles out of the ground crystal-clear turning the desert into a tropical garden

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.299
But it's surprising to discover that most of this fresh water is turned into salt water

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.240
deliberately

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:08.089
Because there's so much salt in the ground water is poured into these pools to leach it out the burning Sun does the rest

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:20.839
In temperatures of way over 110 degrees or 50 degrees Celsius the water quickly evaporates leaving the salt behind

00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:32.839
It's here that an old Bible story comes to life they make pillars of salt

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.999
You're looking at an industry that hasn't changed for thousands of years

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:44.659
There's a shortage of salt in the Sahara

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:52.819
so Bill Mersault still finds its way to just about every corner of North Africa, which is why Bill Maher attracts the caravans

00:42:00.729 --> 00:42:02.729
Not far from the salt pans

00:42:02.739 --> 00:42:10.468
It's a mass of bellowing fighting cud-chewing camels all waiting to start a two-week journey back across the tannery

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:15.660
There's a caravan leaving soon

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:21.809
Laura and I will be joining it but first he needs to buy some salt for his animals back home

00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:30.958
Now I discover something else about my companion he's fussy about his salt

00:42:31.509 --> 00:42:35.159
So much that he literally puts it to the litmus test

00:42:35.919 --> 00:42:40.499
if it's a good fault, it will come orange if it is not good you to explain like

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:55.619
That was the easy no now comes the haggling and we're only talking about a deal worth $6

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:08.879
It harks back to the days when salt was a common in and out here it still is

00:43:09.459 --> 00:43:13.678
Indeed the word salary comes from solarium Latin for salt

00:43:14.019 --> 00:43:18.119
The money that was paid to the Roman legions to buy their salt rations

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:28.390
In all my travels I don't think I've ever seen so many camels

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.420
every year they reckon some

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:33.970
25,000 pass through Billman

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:43.630
Each of these salt pillars weighs about 65 pounds or 30 kilos

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:49.390
So with a six pillar load on a good strong camel, that's nearly a quarter of a ton

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:55.840
So it's not surprising there's a great deal of complaining at loading time

00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:01.959
But once loaded they settle down our Caravan finally gets underway

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:13.449
How many times have you because the generator

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.140
Since you were this big

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.140
we've just embarked on a

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:30.920
370 mile trip across the channel that's 600 kilometers a journey of more than two weeks

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:37.400
When walking with caravans lesson number one, never underestimate its speed

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:45.709
While camels amble at what seems to be a dignified pace their legs are long and you need to walk briskly just to keep her

00:44:58.509 --> 00:45:03.059
So, how many camels are we go? Yeah, and here's lesson number two

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:07.650
That's maybe 300

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:12.890
We didn't

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:17.569
Know but you know the back it is a number of nobody will

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:23.090
Force period yeah, it's not good

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:30.949
I touched on a Tuareg nerve if you count your camels one may die. So it's better to remain ignorant

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:48.259
And during a caravan you soon realize how effective Tuareg robes are they preserve moisture

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:52.729
So how much water would these men drink every day riding on the caravan?

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:04.160
Just three cups of water each day. Well, I was drinking the nearly gallon or more than five litres

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:10.130
There's a Tuareg saying it's too hard to talk. So they're like a camel a

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:13.340
hundred miles down

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:17.210
275 more to go that's about 500 kilometres

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:50.739
But many of these caravans go a lot further

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:58.389
Right across Africa without any regard for international borders and the borders on a problem. You just cannot release no problem in

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:04.550
Because Touareg like

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:10.449
Freedom you think that there is no board from him in his mind. There's no board

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:13.090
Everywhere is for him

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:21.249
At last I was beginning to get a handle on these proud of desert travelers gentle and hospitable, but

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.480
Fiercely independent and it's something they're prepared to fight for

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:32.560
So what does it mean to be a Tuareg? Is it freedom simply or is there more there are more?

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:35.600
freedom fest

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.600
anything

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:45.580
Anything to terrorize the deep desert, yeah the desert tannery and there is so many I

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.300
Don't know kill kill kill

00:47:55.640 --> 00:48:01.300
Which means really and the Tuareg obligation to respect

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:19.829
The following morning as the blue pre-dawn Twilight spreads across the Tenere hundreds of camels are on the moon

00:48:20.859 --> 00:48:24.269
Silently crossing this remarkable desert in both directions

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:34.840
And

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:39.929
If you ever thought that the middle of the Sahara was the middle of nowhere we'll think again

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:42.660
This nowhere is a superhighway

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:46.439
The Tenere is alive with caravans

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:14.709
It would be a mistake to think of caravans in terms of crude Western commerce

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:19.810
To a Tuareg the caravan is a symbol of the journey of life

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:31.379
No one here is a complete man until he's crossed the desert with a caravan at least once

00:49:40.999 --> 00:49:44.829
So on I go day after day night after night

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:50.799
falling further under the spell of this Tuareg sense of freedom and independence and

00:49:51.559 --> 00:49:52.690
with Hoyas help

00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:55.569
I have completed this rite of passage and

00:49:56.059 --> 00:50:01.748
Crossed one of the world's remotest deserts on another of my journeys to the ends of the earth
