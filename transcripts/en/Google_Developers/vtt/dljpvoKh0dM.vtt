BRIAN MOROZ: Hello, and welcome
to our fifth and final

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.000
installment so far of
the Creative Sandbox

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.260
Live Hangout Series.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.560
We have a little bit of
a special treat today.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.270
We're going to start with
Goodby, who will be seen via

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.290
Hangouts, but we actually have
McCann in the house sitting

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.940
right next to me, that you
can't see quite yet,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.440
but you will soon.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.340
So this is truly live.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.280
My name is Brian Moroz.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.220
I work with Creative Agencies
here at Google.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.930
If you haven't joined any of
these before, you're going to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.000
learn about a couple of really
fantastic uses of Google

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.850
technology.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.220
Today's focus is on Geoproducts,
and I'm going to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.790
introduce now my colleague Josh,
who is out in Mountain

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.780
View, who is a Geoproducts
expert.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.446
Josh?

00:00:59.446 --> 00:01:01.020
JOSH LIVNI: Hi, folks,
and thank you.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.110
So I'm Josh Livni.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.349
I'm part of our Maps Developer
Relations Team, and we're

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:06.599
basically [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:09.880
Maps platform [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.240
Geoproducts [INAUDIBLE] is
accessible and easy to use by

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.526
third parties [INAUDIBLE], and
all the developers who would

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:19.660
want to use Maps [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.820
So that includes chatting with
people, supporting them

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.590
online, making [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.430
examples are useful, and
hopefully inspiring

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.006
[INAUDIBLE] people who have
a nice story to tell.

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.520
[INAUDIBLE] projects
like [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.170
it's a lot of really exciting
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.420
different angle [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.580
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.840
And so having Josh on the
line means two things.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.660
Josh can ask questions of the
folks on the call, but more

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.560
importantly, the agencies who
have worked with the Maps

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.220
products, please feel free to
ask anything you'd like of

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.270
Josh, demand things,
request things.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.760
So that's why he's here.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.220
No need to be shy.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.680
So with that, let's go ahead
and take a look at the work

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.660
that Goodby did.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.340
We'll take a look at a video,
and then we'll have an

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.035
introduction round and start
asking some questions.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.650
Oh, which video, I'm
being asked?

00:02:18.485 --> 00:02:19.480
Hold on.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.730
This is live.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.570
So Goodby, if you guys
could tell us what

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.640
we're seeing here.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.092
ANDERS GUSTAFSSON: It should
be the back bridges

00:02:45.092 --> 00:02:53.830
walk-through and this is
basically just [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:03.780
and you see that snake of
bridges, and how you added a

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:12.100
bridge using Google Maps,
and also, [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.540
snake, you can see the user's
social media accounts and what

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.376
they logged in [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.440
or Twitter or Facebook.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.240
And that should be up.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.450
BRIAN MOROZ: Yep, so we just saw
a series of bridges being

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.910
built, and the total length of
the bridges as it was added.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.030
So first of all, let's go ahead
and introduce the folks

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.890
from Goodby who are online.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.890
Can you guys just introduce
yourself, and let us know what

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.690
role you play at the agency?

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.460
ANDERS GUSTAFSSON: Well, I can
start, because I talked

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.000
[INAUDIBLE] the demo
you just saw.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.320
My name is Anders Gustafsson.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.026
I'm a Creative Director
at Goodby.

00:03:52.026 --> 00:03:56.070
I work across the agency, but I
worked on this project with

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.600
the rest of the team.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.850
Great.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.115
HANNA WITTMARK: My
name is Hanna.

00:04:03.115 --> 00:04:04.892
I'm an art director
here at Goodby.

00:04:04.892 --> 00:04:08.145
GRAHAM LEWIS: Graham Lewis,
copywriter at Goodby across

00:04:08.145 --> 00:04:12.340
accounts, and was lucky enough
to work on this one.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.060
MARGARET BRETT-KEARNS: And I'm
Margaret Brett-Kearns, and I'm

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.950
the Interactive Producer
on this project.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.300
And we also actually,
maybe Michael, you

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.100
can introduce yourself.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.640
So this is the famous
[INAUDIBLE], and they were the

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.630
developers of this.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.130
MICHAEL: Hi guys.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.400
I'm Michael, and I'm the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.490
Interactive Director at Famous.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.216
BRANDON: And I'm Brandon,
and I'm the lead

00:04:36.216 --> 00:04:37.466
developer on the project.

00:04:39.925 --> 00:04:42.390
BRIAN MOROZ: All right, so we
have the whole gang there, it

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.630
sounds like.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.770
Let me ask you guys just
initially, where did

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:46.660
the idea come from?

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.460
What was the seed of the idea?

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.450
And how did you guys work
through it and come to this

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.950
final piece, which is almost
like an art piece of sorts?

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.780
Where did it generate,
and how did it build?

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.840
ANDERS GUSTAFSSON: Well, I'll
just kick this off, and then

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.920
Hanna and Graham can fill in.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:15.150
I think we got some partnerships
with Google, like

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.350
[INAUDIBLE], and we're always
looking at new and interesting

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.070
technology.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.920
I think in this case, it was
just super relevant because

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.000
the Golden Gate Bridge 75th
anniversary, and we wanted

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.260
everyone in the world to
be able to participate.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:39.040
So the Maps API, it's just such
a great platform now that

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.290
everyone uses, almost on a daily
basis, so it made total

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.920
sense to do something
based on this API.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.705
And Hanna and Graham can talk
some more about the idea and

00:05:52.705 --> 00:05:55.090
how that came to be.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.670
GRAHAM LEWIS: Yeah, kind of
going off of what Anders was

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.330
saying with really wanting
something that could go across

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.635
all these different types
social media, because

00:06:06.635 --> 00:06:10.730
obviously, the big thing for
us was the possibility of

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.270
really wanting everyone to
participate, even if they

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.790
weren't as savvy with different
things online.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.000
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.980
for us was [INAUDIBLE] that was
familiar, and really was

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.400
able to bring people together
and allow anyone to

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.650
participate.

00:06:27.096 --> 00:06:27.580
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.200
So it sounds like it started
from the idea of the bridge

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.330
itself, then moved into the
technology that people use

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.690
very commonly, and then the
concept of the social element,

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:38.610
a lot of people to kind of play

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.750
together, was the direction.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.382
Is that accurate?

00:06:43.382 --> 00:06:45.800
ANDERS GUSTAFSSON: Yeah.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.090
HANNA WITTMARK: And also, when
we started to do research

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.090
about bridges, it felt pretty
natural that bridges were made

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.430
to bring people together, and
today we have the social

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.790
media, and it's like
the bridges

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.000
today across the world.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.250
BRIAN MOROZ: Right, as a
metaphor, but also as a

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.660
physical object, and also as a
digital object that you can

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.400
then start to combine
and play with.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.000
So let me ask you guys on the
developmental front, the idea

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.900
seems pretty clear and it
seems like one that once

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.020
you're hit with it, it seems
so natural and easy to

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.360
understand.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.480
But on the technical side, it's
actually patching things

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.010
together, being able to connect
both the people

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:28.390
socially, as well as build the
bridge physically as an object

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.410
that you're seeing
on the screen.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.510
How did that process go?

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.130
Was it fairly smooth sailing?

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.580
Were there certain technical
hurdles that you

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.770
guys had to deal with?

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.730
Did you already have a lot of
experience with mapping

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:40.380
applications?

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.920
How did that work?

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.010
MICHAEL: So it was definitely
a challenge.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.890
Sorry.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:54.520
It was definitely a challenge
from the beginning, figuring

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.600
out how we were going
to get all of these

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.410
bridges to line up.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:03.480
We kind of prototyped it using
just paper at first, just to

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.190
figure out how the line crosses
through the tile, and

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.100
how we were going to get all
these different lines going in

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.262
different directions
to kind of line up

00:08:10.262 --> 00:08:12.990
and form the bridge.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:16.800
Luckily, during the prototyping
phase, Brandon was

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.445
actually able to come up with
a system for actually lining

00:08:20.445 --> 00:08:24.190
these up and creating that
snake, that smooth,

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.692
never-ending snake.

00:08:25.692 --> 00:08:26.118
BRANDON: Yeah.

00:08:26.118 --> 00:08:32.929
So basically, what we determined
was [INAUDIBLE],

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.773
you can use two points and have
Google Maps draw a line

00:08:35.773 --> 00:08:37.916
through those two points, that
line will always go through

00:08:37.916 --> 00:08:40.760
the center of the image that
you request from Google.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.965
And so that leads us to
basically four types of tiles,

00:08:43.965 --> 00:08:47.330
bridge tiles, that can
be determined.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.690
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:57.200
basically two types of bridges
that can be determined, and so

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.570
certain bridges cannot be
overlapped on certain other

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.240
bridges, so we had to determine
which bridges can

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.490
and cannot overlap.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.810
So you have a Type One bridge
that goes like that, and a

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.130
Type Two bridge that
goes like this.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.510
These can go and touch each
other, no problem.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.880
[INAUDIBLE] a Type Three
bridge that goes this

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.760
direction, with a Type Four
bridge that goes this

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.055
direction, a Type Four bridge
cannot be overlapped with Type

00:09:29.055 --> 00:09:33.200
Three bridge, [INAUDIBLE] see
where we cut off part of the

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.310
bridge, and so we can't
allow that.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:41.130
So those are the rules
that they basically

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:47.440
figure out and solve.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.970
BRIAN MOROZ: And did you guys do
that essentially in house,

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.260
or did you have--

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.110
just out of my own curiosity,
did you guys work with folks

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.360
like Josh at Google, or do
you have your own ways of

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.610
figuring that out?

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.190
MICHAEL: So we did a bit of
investigation on our own at

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.840
the outset, just kind of
gleaning what we could from

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.020
the documentation and the
APIs, and just kind of

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.410
experimenting during the
prototyping phase.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:17.850
And then later on, once we had
more in-depth questions, being

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.600
able to speak with someone like
Josh at Google was kind

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.270
of critical for us to get past
certain hurdles, like for

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.820
example, the zoom level.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.450
BRIAN MOROZ: Gotcha.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.600
And the reason I ask that is
certain people over the last

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.660
week, some have worked heavily
with Google, some have just

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.720
been like, nope, the
documentation was there for

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.270
us, we figured it out,
we had it done.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.270
So it's just interesting to
hear from circumstance to

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.710
circumstance, how things
got done when you

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.410
actually hit that wall.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.980
So I have one more question,
then I'll turn it over to Josh

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.870
to see if he has any questions
for you guys.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.470
I guess my final question is,
how did you determine who at

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.070
the agency was going to come
together to work on this?

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.700
So you have a lot of diverse
roles here on the call.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.830
I imagine there are people
who are not on the

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.280
call who were involved.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.550
How did you put that
team together?

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:14.250
ANDERS GUSTAFSSON: Well, I
mean, the bridge, it's a

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.690
client that JSP had been working
with for a long, long

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:21.600
time, and Rich Silverstein was
very involved with the city

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:26.230
and the bridge and the
national parks.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.820
So it's basically a
pro bono project.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:34.810
And whenever you get a pro bono
project, the way you put

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.480
the team together is you try
to find the creatives that

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.450
really have got the energy,
and they want to work with

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:48.020
this, and they really feel like
this is something that

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.940
they want to get involved in.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:55.780
It's kind of almost determined
by who really wants to do it.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.870
I think there's some people
missing from the team right

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.780
now, and I don't think that it
was necessarily a traditional

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.692
creative team, in the sense that
you have one writer, and

00:12:05.692 --> 00:12:08.290
one art director, and one
designer, and so forth.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.980
It was just a bunch of people
that really wanted to do

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:18.040
something cool for the
bridge, and felt the

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.225
love for this project.

00:12:20.225 --> 00:12:23.010
That's how it turned out.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:23.530
BRIAN MOROZ: Interesting.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:27.300
So it was definitely a
nontraditional team

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.610
formatting, but obviously,
it was successful.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.200
So always good to see that.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.750
Josh, did you have any questions
for these guys?

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.350
How they did it, any of the
technological stuff, just

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:38.496
anything generally for them?

00:12:38.496 --> 00:12:38.920
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.330
Well first of all, we chatted
quite a few times.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.825
I have to say, it's really
nice to see you guys in

00:12:43.825 --> 00:12:45.290
person, [INAUDIBLE] faces,
that is, rather

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.640
than on just email.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.930
We had a lot of great
conversations, and the main

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:54.710
thing that I enjoyed was just
the crazy ideas that were

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.765
coming through [INAUDIBLE]
people out there.

00:12:56.765 --> 00:13:00.705
I remember there was an idea of
having people actually draw

00:13:00.705 --> 00:13:03.980
[INAUDIBLE] in Google Street
View, then they would be

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.036
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:05.036 --> 00:13:07.850
How could we get that
live, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.440
All kinds of really
great stuff.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.035
I guess my main question
[INAUDIBLE], I'd be curious if

00:13:15.035 --> 00:13:16.803
there's features that could
have been in the API that

00:13:16.803 --> 00:13:19.350
would have made your life
easier, or other things that

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.820
we could do.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.860
It's easier for agencies like
yourselves to dive in and

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:24.480
[INAUDIBLE]

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.610
things you want.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.725
It's not just putting markers
on [INAUDIBLE], kind of a

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:29.975
canvas [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:33.675 --> 00:13:36.150
BRANDON: One thing that would
have been really helpful is if

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:41.350
Google had an API to pull
bridges, essentially.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:47.480
That was one of the main
challenges, because Google and

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.290
Margaret had [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:52.450
a list of all possible bridges,
and there was no way

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:53.930
to do that.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:57.230
One thing we looked into was
doing that list of bridges for

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:02.520
the National Traffic Safety
Board, or something like that,

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.060
but that turned out
to be not really

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.220
feasible in this situation.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:12.180
So definitely, getting a list of
bridges and other types of

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.170
roads would be a nice
feature for the

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.080
Google Maps API to have.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.080
MICHAEL: It's kind of a
specialized use case, but I

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.600
think for us, it might
have made things

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.510
a little bit easier.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:22.970
MARGARET BRETT-KEARNS: Yeah.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.140
I actually agree with that.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.880
It was one of the challenges
we had on the creative side

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.320
when we were thinking about,
how are people going to use

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.990
this, and we wanted it to be
something that was easy for

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.420
people to find a bridge without
having to use too many

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.060
brain cells.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:44.190
But it's actually turned out to
be an interesting series of

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:49.910
months on this project to see
how the bridge has evolved and

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:53.270
how it's traveled through
different countries, and we

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.670
seem to be having,
for example, a

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.240
burst now in Russia.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.294
There are a lot of Russians
who are participating, and

00:14:58.294 --> 00:15:02.035
we've had bursts in
Southeast Asia.

00:15:02.035 --> 00:15:04.790
We started with a giant
burst in Brazil.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.330
So maybe in the end, not having
that list of bridges

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.335
wasn't a terrible thing, but
it would have been nice to

00:15:13.335 --> 00:15:16.206
have it to begin with.

00:15:16.206 --> 00:15:17.510
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, that's
really good feedback.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.430
I think more generally,
providing people more in-depth

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.790
access to the features that
underlie the map is a comment

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.400
that we get quite a
bit for all kinds

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.930
of different reasons.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.620
People are interested in more
than just, say, for example,

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.920
places, we expose
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.460
businesses and other
[? entities ?] around you.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.360
So maybe yours is a specialized
case, but it's

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.169
definitely a good thing to
request, so good call.

00:15:44.662 --> 00:15:46.465
ANDERS GUSTAFSSON: I've got
a question for you, Josh.

00:15:46.465 --> 00:15:50.700
Have we actually created a big
database of bridges for you

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.570
now that you will use
in the future?

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.150
Because it feels like we've
actually done the

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.465
labeling for you.

00:15:58.465 --> 00:15:59.640
MALE SPEAKER: It's for sale.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.890
It's very inexpensive.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.550
We can make a trade
down the line.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.690
Yeah, I haven't actually
looked at that.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.210
That's an interesting other
point, which is you guys are

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.080
storing all of your data
on App Engine.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.580
You guys created a fairly
straightforward but really

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.660
nice little App Engine site
where people [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.330
and metadata [INAUDIBLE]
stored.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.870
Obviously, we don't look in
there, but it is a useful data

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:23.500
set to have.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.210
It's an interesting thing to
think about, when your project

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:31.510
is finished, is there ways you
could make any kind of use of

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:32.760
that information.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.480
BRIAN MOROZ: Cool.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.488
GRAHAM LEWIS: Another thing that
had come up, one of the

00:16:40.488 --> 00:16:41.580
other art directors,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:46.560
that worked on this project with
us had noticed that one

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.210
hurdle that we had was figuring
out how we could

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.100
legally use some of the images
from Google Maps itself,

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:57.380
because there is some variance
just in terms of usage and

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.107
cropping and rotating and
things like that.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:07.970
Looking at really clear cut
rules for usage, or maybe

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.240
seeing about [INAUDIBLE],
because I know that, I think,

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.150
certain areas, the images are
owned by different sections,

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.220
which is kind of like the
universal [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.310
Having it be unified
like that.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.319
BRIAN MOROZ: That's an
interesting point, and that's

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:29.200
something that we run across,
or at least I do when I work

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.180
with agencies somewhat
frequently.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:35.010
It's not even so much, can you
do it, as, is the policy

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.190
accepting of that usage?

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.510
So that's a great point, making
that stuff crystal

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:42.190
clear and very cut and dry.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.400
So lots of great information.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:44.980
Thank you guys.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.970
If you don't mind, please hang
out for a little bit longer so

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.190
that we can all ask questions of
everyone at the end of the

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:52.150
session here today.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.020
But from here, we're going to
go ahead, and we'll switch

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.170
over to McCann.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.600
So let's take a look at
is their reel, and

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.025
then we'll jump in.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:20.850
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.100
MALE SPEAKER: This is to
keep the bears away.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.130
Oh, look at that.

00:19:18.836 --> 00:19:20.086
[MUSIC - FLEET FOXES,
"RAGGED WOOD"]

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:49.786
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:49.786 --> 00:20:53.600
BRIAN MOROZ: OK, so going
from bridges to trails.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.500
I have our friends from McCann
sitting here with me in studio

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.470
live today.

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.260
I'm a little disappointed the
didn't bring us a bear stick

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.780
to keep the bears away,
but I'm going to let

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.460
that one go for now.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.860
Can you guys just give a quick
introduction and tell us who

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.560
you are, what you do
at the agency?

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.210
BRAD: Hi, I'm Brad.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:09.710
I'm a developer at [INAUDIBLE],
and I helped lead

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.160
the project on the
development.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.510
CATHERINE PATTERSON: I'm
Catherine Patterson, I'm the

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:17.660
Executive Producer at McCann
for the Integrated Group.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:18.260
MATT: And I'm Matt
[INAUDIBLE].

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.160
I'm a Group Creative
Director at McCann.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.850
BRIAN MOROZ: So I'm going to ask
you guys the same question

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:27.140
that I initially asked of
the bridge project.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.550
Where did the idea come from?

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.870
I mean, clearly the client in
this case is not a pro bono,

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.330
this is something to do with
nature, it's a granola bar, so

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.400
you have that kind of natural
element, but you guys went

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.610
somewhere really unique
and really specific.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:39.850
How did that happen?

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.670
MATT: You know, I always start
out answering this question by

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.760
almost giving credit to Nature
Valley, just from the

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.900
standpoint that they do a thing
once a year called Bold

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.090
Experiments where they
essentially put out to their

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:54.150
partner agencies this sort of
grand mission of, give us

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:57.180
something from a marketing
standpoint that isn't in the

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.360
regular calendar year of
marketing, and is something, a

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.610
bigger, sort of interesting
notion that can live in a

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.910
bigger space and in
a bigger way.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:08.570
So I think we were lucky from
the standpoint that Nature

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:12.380
Valley was on the forefront of
marketing and wanting to do

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.100
interesting and cool stuff.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.530
So for us, it was a bold
experiment that was kind of

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.490
put to us, and this was kind
of the solution that

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:21.070
we came back with.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.570
There was a number of brands
that they asked for Bold

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:26.670
Solutions for, and Nature
Valley was one of them.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.730
BRIAN MOROZ: And what led to
the idea of mapping these

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.130
trails specifically?

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:35.320
MATT: So in terms of coming to
that conclusion of mapping

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.700
trails, it was almost a little
bit, it seemed like kind of a

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.750
natural progression for us.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:47.270
Nature Valley has had, for the
past three years, a great

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.130
relationship with the
National Parks.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.780
They do a program called
Preserve the Parks, and it

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.400
seemed like a natural
fit for us.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.190
If they're doing a Preserve the
Parks program, why would

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:00.110
we not actually digitally start
to preserve these parks?

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:03.950
So the notion of marrying Street
View with what we're

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.330
calling Trail View seemed
like a very natural

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:07.450
progression for us.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:12.270
It was ultimately fun for us to
go out and do, and seemed

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:13.280
very cool for us.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:13.950
BRIAN MOROZ: Yeah, it
looked like fun.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.040
Those camera units looked
crazy, like satellites,

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.800
basically, on top of these
guys' backpacks.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.690
Super, super cool stuff.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.870
So on the technical front, what
were the challenges that

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.200
you guys found?

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.910
What was the basic technology
that you laid down to use, and

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.080
where did you kind of come into
areas where you stumbled

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.810
and overcame them?

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:32.150
BRAD: Right.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:35.580
So I've used Google Maps a bunch
on a couple of projects

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:40.670
beforehand, and right around
October of last year, Street

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:43.060
View become actually enabled
with WebGL, and it

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.640
gave us a 3D view.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.730
And that was actually
exposing the API, so

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:49.510
I didn't look back.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:53.100
I just went ahead and selected
that as a platform of choice.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:57.662
And then the second hurdle was
basically processing all the

00:23:57.662 --> 00:23:59.420
data, all the footage.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:01.920
We made a little infographic
of this stuff.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.370
We basically had 12 terabytes of
video and six gigabytes of

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:09.930
GPS data, not all of which
was necessarily clean and

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:11.600
accurate, given to satellite
coverage on

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.180
the trails and parks.

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:18.250
So just mapping those trails,
looking at them every day for

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.440
almost six months,
was a [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.550
experience.

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:22.630
BRIAN MOROZ: Get to know
them very well.

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:24.020
You don't have to
ever walk them.

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.477
BRAD: Well, I have to
just go there now

00:24:25.477 --> 00:24:26.260
and see if it's true.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.830
MATT: [INAUDIBLE]
them virtually.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:29.630
BRIAN MOROZ: Very cool.

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.970
And how did the interactive
process work when it came

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.800
from, here's our ideas,
OK great.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.560
Now, here's the technical piece,
now here are the people

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.040
we're hiring to walk
the trails.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.150
Who was involved at one time?

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:40.700
How tight was that?

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.160
MATT: I'll turn it over to Cat,
but that, for me, was the

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.850
super interesting part, just
the notion that we can have

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.573
this great idea and turn it over
to someone like Cat, and

00:24:48.573 --> 00:24:51.460
watch her actually figure out
how to do this, which is the

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.690
really difficult part.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.370
CATHERINE PATTERSON: One of the
things that we focused on,

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:55.270
obviously, it takes
a lot of different

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.380
disciplines and teams.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:00.820
So the first order of business
was, who as the field team is

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.240
going to be capable of going out
and capturing hundreds and

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.570
hundreds of miles?

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:08.200
Who is our home team, who will
be adequately trained to

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.410
participate in those hundreds
and hundreds of miles, in

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:11.880
terms of capture?

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.110
So we obviously partnered
with [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.420
first as our design team,
development team.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.390
Our next order of business was
looking for the appropriate

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.400
field team, the production team,
and then looking at the

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.180
camera technologies that we were
going to be implementing

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:26.900
on the trails.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.830
So we needed to look at
different things, we needed to

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:32.150
look at elevation, we needed
to look at temperatures.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:35.820
We got into some discovery
questions around, what happens

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:39.450
if you have this camera rig on
a human body and you walk him

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:42.600
into the Grand Canyon and he's
been there for 12 hours, at

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.540
what point does your camera
equipment start to

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.270
malfunction?

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.250
So we had all kinds of really
interesting, logical,

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.580
operational testing questions.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.110
And then we needed to look at,
how does this really work as

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:54.960
an army coming together with
all of these elements?

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.830
We're going to go out to these
very remote locations, which

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.800
means we need a SWAT team on the
ground out there capable

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.570
of capturing very aggressive
content.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:04.850
We're going to bring
that content back.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:09.490
We need an unbelievably gifted
development team and post

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:12.940
processing team able to take
that content, process it, and

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.210
build it into a technology
platform.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:18.550
And then obviously, a big design
element was also a big

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:23.310
part of the platform is for us
enabling people to experience

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:27.650
very, very high end visual
POIs, Points of Interest,

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.410
inside these trail
environments.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:32.690
So the camera, the design
direction in terms of

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:33.440
photography--

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.770
which was led by Your Majesty,
by [? Yann's ?]

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:37.610
Carlson, who's their
ECD there--

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:40.530
was very much focused on, how
do we give you a very deep,

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.900
immersive experience of these
POIs and bring all those

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.350
things together into
the platform.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.445
So it's a lot of elements coming
together, but it made

00:26:47.445 --> 00:26:48.935
it very fun to work on.

00:26:48.935 --> 00:26:50.840
BRIAN MOROZ: Yeah, quite
a lot of elements.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.990
So a quick reminder to the folks
who are watching this

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:56.490
live, if you have questions,
you'll be seeing a link

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.825
popping up now and again that
you can enter questions into

00:26:58.825 --> 00:26:59.570
our Moderator tool.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:03.010
So you can ask anything of
either agency, or of Josh.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.770
And speaking of Josh, Josh, what
are your questions for

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:10.970
these guys on this application
that they created, this whole

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:12.908
immersive world that
they built?

00:27:12.908 --> 00:27:15.348
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, well first,
it's a really beautiful site.

00:27:15.348 --> 00:27:18.520
I think it's such a nice idea,
and put together so well and

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:18.890
so smoothly.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.430
I think it looks great.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:23.920
I'll cheat and use the same
question I had before, which

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:28.080
is, you obviously had a lot of
moving parts, one of them was

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.200
integrating with the API, and
most of the time, when we see

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.550
people do what we call
custom [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:36.060
within the API, it's just
a few snapshots, maybe

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.250
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.560
business, or if it's a hike, it
would be one or two shots

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.495
along the hike where they
have [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:44.385
interactive.

00:27:44.385 --> 00:27:47.170
But you guys went to a
whole nother level.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:51.207
And I'd be curious to know if
the API was there for you, or

00:27:51.207 --> 00:27:53.710
other things we could do to make
it easier and better for

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.690
the next super exciting thing
that you guys want to

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:58.530
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:58.530 --> 00:27:59.270
BRAD: Yes, definitely.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.175
I mean, the API is constantly
evolving.

00:28:02.175 --> 00:28:05.361
I actually haven't looked at the
recent docs, but I'm sure

00:28:05.361 --> 00:28:07.488
there are a couple of features
that are currently enabled.

00:28:07.488 --> 00:28:12.140
But when I started, I was having
a pretty interesting

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.880
translation problem between
designs and what

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.350
could the API offer.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:19.000
And I ran into a couple of
very technical, specific

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.470
hurdles, [INAUDIBLE] your
strokes on Path, or spatially

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:29.353
putting markers in the 3G view
so you can pinpoint mountains,

00:28:29.353 --> 00:28:32.532
or really accurately pinpoint
points of interest and place

00:28:32.532 --> 00:28:34.790
them there.

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:38.275
I think we've had a couple
discussions, and this seems to

00:28:38.275 --> 00:28:44.812
be community-wide requests and
features that are of interest,

00:28:44.812 --> 00:28:48.270
and in Phase Two, hopefully
we can tackle this stuff.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:51.728
But producing a quality design
like the one we did with all

00:28:51.728 --> 00:28:53.220
the moving parts was
very challenging.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.770
It was a big integration process
between adding custom

00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:01.720
menus and elevation charts,
so it functions as both a

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.865
navigational device
and it gives you

00:29:03.865 --> 00:29:06.180
an idea of the topology.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.640
There's so many features that
we can actually keep asking

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:14.417
you guys for, but we pushed it
to the limit, and I think we

00:29:14.417 --> 00:29:17.560
did a pretty good job enabling
all these things.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.500
It's pretty massive.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.640
Each trail is about
50,000 frames.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.691
We tried to do an Auto
Play feature.

00:29:24.691 --> 00:29:27.040
That's what you guys do, but
you guys seem to have the

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.194
secret sauce and we don't,
so hopefully you'll

00:29:29.194 --> 00:29:31.042
give it over one day.

00:29:31.042 --> 00:29:33.590
Just to be able to cruise along
a trail, just navigating

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.715
and seeing all this high res
photography will be fantastic

00:29:35.715 --> 00:29:38.480
one day, and I think we're
getting closer with the web

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.410
moving forward.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:43.590
BRIAN MOROZ: Josh,
make that happen.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:45.960
What was the timeline like for
you guys on this project,

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.475
because oftentimes, these things
come up and then--

00:29:48.475 --> 00:29:50.920
in this past week when we've
had these Hangout sessions,

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.435
I've just been amazed at
how short sometimes

00:29:53.435 --> 00:29:54.390
the time frame is.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:56.390
How was it for this project,
given that it was so

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:56.990
complicated?

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:59.005
MATT: Cat can probably
speak to schedule.

00:29:59.005 --> 00:30:02.740
I know it's been almost two
years now since we first

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.790
started the project.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:06.390
CATHERINE PATTERSON: I think
what's really interesting

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:09.190
about a platform like this--
this is obviously a very deep,

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:10.690
integrated platform
development--

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:13.280
is that there are three
timelines, right?

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.130
There's a timeline that's an
18-month timeline, and inside

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.020
that, we sort of looked
at it as three

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.130
marathons with hurdles.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:23.990
The first was defining the
content that we wanted to

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:27.070
capture and going out and
capturing the content.

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:30.050
The next was bringing it home
and laying out the platform

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:31.200
foundation.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.010
And then really doing the site
build, really doing due

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:37.850
diligence and looking at
editorial and content layers

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:40.280
and making it richer
and deeper.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.190
So from a producing point of
view for our teams, we were

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:47.570
very focused psychologically
on the idea that these were

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:52.190
key markers and that we needed
to get to each one of these

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:56.830
delivery points and then be in
a state of mind to go into

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:58.680
that next platform
development.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.540
But overall, we've been working
on this platform, it

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:04.480
will be two years in February,
and we're continuing to work

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.710
on evolving the platform with
stuff that is planned and in

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:13.200
production, and will continue to
pretty much late summer in

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.575
the end of 2013.

00:31:14.575 --> 00:31:14.960
BRIAN MOROZ: Wow.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.760
So this is a really
long term project.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.310
This is something you guys--

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:19.700
you've used the word "platform"
a few times, and I

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.890
think that's a key thing
to bring up.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:24.880
This wasn't like a campaign,
where you're like, this is

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.800
just going to run,
and it's great.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.030
It's a platform that you want
to have that's going to live

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:32.860
for a long period of time, and
that's going to be built on

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.040
and changed over time.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.340
CATHERINE PATTERSON: I think
one of the things that is

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:40.440
really important about the way
we approach this work for the

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.440
brand, for us as creatives and
producers inside it was

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.510
talking about a philosophical
principle that we were going

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:50.520
to do it against many,
many times over.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:54.120
So it was about connecting
with nature, creating a

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.910
platform that allowed people to
experience nature in unique

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.120
and evolved ways using these
technologies, and then

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.170
building on that and iterating
against that so that the

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:07.530
mandate was always, how do we
enable you and empower you,

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:09.485
whoever you are, to
enjoy nature in

00:32:09.485 --> 00:32:10.660
these different ways?

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.620
MATT: It was also, I think
building on that, it was

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:17.930
almost a natural for us just
because Nature Valley already

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:20.440
had this kind of ongoing
promise to

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.280
these National Parks.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.960
They had this Preserve
the Parks program.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.280
So for us, it was almost like
this was a really great,

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.110
creative expression
and extension of

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:31.850
that natural platform.

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:35.610
So the notion of building a
digital expression of that

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:38.730
promise seemed like a really
cool challenge for us.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:39.710
BRIAN MOROZ: Very, very cool.

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:43.730
And in the video, you notice a
little bit of a social element

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:46.170
to it, and that's just the
magic word for everything

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:46.870
these days.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:48.420
If you have a client
who doesn't ask for

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.890
social, you're like what?

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:50.640
Why?

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.670
But the word "social" is
such almost a non-word.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:57.600
Its definition is so broad as
to be almost meaningless,

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.660
depending on the context.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.490
Clearly you have an
element there.

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:01.970
How did you bake
that piece in?

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:05.160
How did you come up with how
that was going to be a social

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.040
thing, and then

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.740
technologically make it happen?

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:10.840
MATT: I'll start, and then
Cat will jump in.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.170
CATHERINE PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:12.730
MATT: Cat and I do this
all the time.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:14.380
CATHERINE PATTERSON: Tag team.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.960
MATT: So I think the notion of
adding a piece involving

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.140
people was always something that
has been in the back of

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.940
our minds, and as Cat was
saying, it was such a daunting

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:29.110
and massive mission to start to
lay the groundwork for the

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:32.200
project and actually physically
go out and capture

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.480
for the first round
300-some-plus miles, and

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.620
hundreds more that we're adding
on now, that it was

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:41.600
very important for us to get
that groundwork laid.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.200
And we always knew that the
next phase is to actually

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:45.840
bring people.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.840
We have the groundwork laid,
and then you need to invite

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.330
people to play and
be a part of it.

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:54.860
So we do have an element of
social where you can send

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:58.220
actual, specific points and
people can jump directly into

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:01.230
360 degree views, and
you can tweet and

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:02.610
Facebook it and stuff.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:06.360
But I think that's even the
start of our next big

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:10.570
challenge in terms of, how
exactly a much bigger social

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:14.033
layer really lives on the site
and allows people to be a part

00:34:14.033 --> 00:34:15.880
of it in a very big way.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.159
CATHERINE PATTERSON: And just
to add to [INAUDIBLE],

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:23.670
philosophically, the idea was,
we are all the stewards and

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:25.659
the preservationists of
this park and this

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:26.850
culture and this heritage.

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:31.739
It is our territory to have
responsibility for that.

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:35.510
Now, we're empowering you to
have community and integrated

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:40.340
community around that, and
following on that, we are

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.179
literally charging you with
becoming stewards and

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:46.639
preservationists in your own
right of these national parks.

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:48.690
So these are tools that we're
currently working on in terms

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:51.820
of evolving the platform from
something that's very

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.949
immersive and experiential into
something that's very

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:57.760
tactical and utility-driven in
terms of, here's what you can

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.160
now do yourself in this park,
in these regions, as these

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.510
communities, to be part of
this incredibly important

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:08.470
cultural heritage that we feel
everyone should be involved in

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.250
and engaged with.

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.190
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.650
So a couple more questions for
you guys, and then we'll open

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:17.090
it up to any questions
from the folks

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:18.780
who have been watching.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.230
But something that I definitely
need to know.

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:24.190
Were there any bear attacks
during the filming of this, or

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:27.020
were any hikers injured during
the creation of this?

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:30.900
CATHERINE PATTERSON: Ironically,
none of our hikers

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.120
were injured or attacked.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.610
We saw many, many
wild animals.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:39.210
We're obviously rubes,
[? outland ?] rubes going out

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:41.500
into the wilderness, should have
been its own behind the

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.820
scenes movie.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.860
But we saw amazing,
amazing wildlife--

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.340
snakes, bears, bison--

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.970
incredible, incredible nature.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:59.230
It took us from a place of
braggadocio anxiety into just

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.720
having our minds completely
blown.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.890
And for us and for the teams,
having that experience

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:08.960
empirically really made
us understand,

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.790
you must be in nature.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:14.240
We were so blown away by those
types of engagements without

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.220
injury that we really were
jazzed about getting people

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:20.250
not just to get into the
platform, but get

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:21.100
out to these parks.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:22.840
These parks are amazing.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.840
MATT: I think we were all just
really surprised about--

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.000
when we finally got out there
and started doing this, I

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.900
think we always liked the notion
of this platform, but I

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.470
think we were all very surprised
by how much it

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:37.400
actually personally affected us,
being able to actually be

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:41.650
in, as Ken Burns says, America's
greatest idea for as

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:42.380
long as were.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.180
And we were very lucky, and
it was a pretty humbling

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.382
experience, actually.

00:36:46.382 --> 00:36:47.650
BRIAN MOROZ: Very cool.

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:47.920
All right.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.440
So my last question is,
given the scope of

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.790
this kind of a project--

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:55.110
manpower, ideas,
technologically--

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:58.630
I'm going to ask you guys
separately from the creative

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:01.150
ideation putting it all together
standpoint, and then

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:02.480
from the technology standpoint,
and we'll start

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.140
with technology.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:06.990
If you had one piece of advice
to give to anyone who was

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:09.450
trying to do something that was
somehow similar to this

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:12.610
project, what would be the one
thing you should say, just be

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:15.380
aware that you should always
do this, or never try that?

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.770
What's the one important thing
you can tell them?

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.160
BRAD: If it's a fellow
developer, read the docs

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:22.870
really well.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:24.020
That's the first thing.

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:27.080
You will discover a lot
of answers there.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.710
And second, I would
say, experiment

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.230
and try to poke more.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:37.140
But I know that the maps, the
API doesn't offer all the

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:41.100
features that we'd like, but I
would say, there's a great

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.010
community out there, and if you
keep peeking and pushing,

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:47.220
Google maybe from Mountain View
will respond and give us

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.630
some good stuff one day.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:51.219
BRIAN MOROZ: We'll post Josh's
personal email up

00:37:51.219 --> 00:37:52.006
at the end of this.

00:37:52.006 --> 00:37:54.635
BRAD: On the other hand, I think
the problem we faced was

00:37:54.635 --> 00:37:55.830
just a massive [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:58.580
of footage, it was really
unconventional.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:03.400
And I would say, if you can
shoot that much and bring it

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.240
back to the lab, that's great,
but take your diligence in

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.550
picking the right format, and
be patient in producing the

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:12.220
highest quality imagery, and
then the API will be there to

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.470
carry you all the way through.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:16.780
Just an anecdote.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.870
I mean, if you're actually
wondering what to select, and

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:22.340
this might sound like a plug for
you guys, but we looked at

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:25.260
some other mapping engines, and
most of them worked like a

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.580
crab, so you traverse the world
like a crab in 2D view,

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.790
and that's not acceptable
anymore these days.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:34.080
So I encourage everyone
to play with

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:34.870
the maps if you haven't.

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:37.660
I know most of the experiments
are placing markers on a map,

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.950
but there's a lot more you can
do, and there's a bunch of

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:45.300
opportunities that are coming up
every day, so keep playing.

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.680
BRIAN MOROZ: And one piece of
advice from your guys' side,

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:51.270
from the idea, development,
and production of this?

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:53.580
MATT: Have Cat involved.

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:57.520
No, I mean, the thing that I
was constantly amazed about

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.530
was we collectively
as a team--

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:03.190
Leslie Sims, Jason
Schmall and I--

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:07.750
had an idea, and it's one thing
to have an idea, but

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:10.110
then it's completely another
thing just to

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.410
watch it come to life.

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:14.210
We had no idea if this was
possible, how to do it, and

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:16.670
just surround yourself with the
best people, and that's

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:17.350
what we did.

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:19.890
CATHERINE PATTERSON: And just
from Production, learning from

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.360
Creative and all team
integration.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.260
The best note that we got was in
the cab going to the Great

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:28.070
Smokies on the way out to
the first day of trails.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.820
We were sitting in the back
of the car with Creatives.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.540
And Creatives was like,
you know what I think?

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.850
I think you're going to make
the show that you want,

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:36.360
because it's going to get
canceled anyway someday.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.880
So go for broke.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.440
Make exactly the platform that
you want, because sooner or

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.670
later, life moves on.

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:46.910
So that was really, for us,
inspiring in terms of being

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:48.630
like, hell yeah, we're
going for it.

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.610
We're going to get every hurdle
because we're going to

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:52.710
make it exactly what we want.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:55.920
So we were very focused on
troubleshooting and problem

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:59.340
solving because we knew exactly
what that show was

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.800
that we wanted, just to
use a traditional.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:06.270
But I would say, go for the big
idea, the big picture, and

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:08.410
be very brave and know that it's
in you and it's in your

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:10.486
teams to accomplish those
things for sure.

00:40:10.486 --> 00:40:11.180
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:13.706
We've heard that general
sentiment a lot this week, but

00:40:13.706 --> 00:40:15.940
this is the first I've heard
it with the negative

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:19.000
reinforcement of, it's going to
eventually die anyway, so

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.475
why not make something
super cool?

00:40:20.475 --> 00:40:23.140
MATT: That is the built-in
pessimism of my old partner,

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:26.040
Jason Schmall and I.

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:26.540
BRIAN MOROZ: All right, great.

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:27.700
So thank you guys.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.120
Thanks, everyone, for
being on this call.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.940
I think this was very
illuminating, two totally,

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.010
completely different uses of
this technology, both of which

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:39.110
are beautiful and engaging and
shrewdly social, and just

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.880
lovely to look at, and very
complicated to make.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:42.860
So it was great to
have you guys.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.880
Let's take a look at the
questions that have come in.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.480
And anyone who wants to answer
these from any quadrant,

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.780
please just jump in.

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.030
Let's see.

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:00.420
I'm refreshing my page here.

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.250
We have several questions.

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:05.590
So here's one from [INAUDIBLE],
Wisconsin.

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:07.710
As more people interact with
the campaigns, will there

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:10.560
continue to be this same user
experience, or are more

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.480
elements being added?

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.330
Let's talk about the bridge
project first.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.020
Are you guys going to be adding
to that, or is that

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:18.420
something where it's an art
piece that's just kind of

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.270
growing naturally, or are
you going to be adding

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:23.054
functionality?

00:41:23.054 --> 00:41:25.710
MARGARET BRETT-KEARNS: At this
point, we're not planning on

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:27.600
adding functionality to it.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:32.530
The anniversary event was at the
end of May, and it's just

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:35.560
been really interesting to see
how it's traveled around the

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.330
globe and grown organically
on its own.

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:45.290
So at this point, we'd love
to optimize some of the

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:50.970
functionality, but it's a pro
bono project, so we're always

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:53.490
in a tight budget situation.

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:57.270
What's been interesting is as
more and more people have

00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:03.200
participated and more and more
bridges have been added, we've

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:09.690
had a little bit of slow down in
the experience as a result,

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:13.660
because we're almost a victim
of our own success.

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:15.921
So that would be the one area
that I'd like to see us

00:42:15.921 --> 00:42:17.297
improve upon.

00:42:17.297 --> 00:42:17.764
BRIAN MOROZ: Right.

00:42:17.764 --> 00:42:19.980
And the actual nature
of the project is

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:22.090
it does grow naturally.

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:27.010
It, by its very nature, changes
each day or each week

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:29.070
as people add and build
it further.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:31.820
And from the trails side, I
think we heard the answer was

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:32.780
essentially, absolutely.

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.660
You guys are really looking to
push it and take it further.

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:38.360
So great question.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.080
Any parks or trails in
particular that stood out to

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:44.284
you city slickers that you'd
recommend visiting?

00:42:44.284 --> 00:42:47.230
MATT: I'll let Cat.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:53.350
Cat has hiked all 400 plus
miles, so she's seen every

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:55.000
inch of this, so I'll
let her handle that.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:55.840
CATHERINE PATTERSON:
Well, that's a

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.560
question we love the most.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.790
Our ambition is to hike every
mile in every park as a

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:02.850
culture, as a team.

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:04.990
So what we look at, again, from
a production point of

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:07.740
view is, how do we get diversity
in terms of the

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:11.340
geography, the types of parks,
content that we're capturing?

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:14.700
We're skewed a little bit on the
west right now, so we're

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.840
looking at different
parks and areas.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.230
We look very much at parks at
risk as well, parks that are

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.190
very frequented.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:23.960
So those are all things that
start to inform what our

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.900
recommendations are about where
to go next in the parks

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:27.440
environment.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.000
MATT: Personal favorite?

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.020
CATHERINE PATTERSON: My
personal favorite?

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.790
Yellowstone for sure.

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:34.220
So far.

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:34.480
BRIAN MOROZ: OK.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.590
Another question is another one
for the trails project.

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:40.460
In terms of risk management,
what were

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.710
your initial concerns?

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:44.380
Software hurdles, hardware
selection deployment, legal

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.890
issues he says regarding image
capture, but I think there's

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:49.110
other legal issues as well.

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:51.106
What if one of the hikers
broke his leg?

00:43:51.106 --> 00:43:54.110
Did your initial risk assessment
cover the issues,

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:57.220
or did things come up in the
process that you had to then

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.070
scramble to cover?

00:43:58.070 --> 00:43:59.890
CATHERINE PATTERSON: Those
are all great questions.

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:03.940
We again, likened it as a state
of going to war in a

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.440
positive way.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.500
What is every variable that we
can consider, human, software,

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.880
hardware, operational, on the
ground sort of stuff?

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:16.010
Let's solve for it
intellectually, theoretically,

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:17.190
and then let's see
what happens.

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:21.210
So one example, we had a
wonderful camera rig, an

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:22.360
incredible cameraman--

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.440
Brandon is fantastic--

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.900
looking at who the
talent can be.

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.460
Who is going to be able to carry
80 pounds of freight 15

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:34.800
hours a day and sleep on the
rocks, is a very big question.

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.230
So all of those questions
were key.

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:42.570
So we tried to logically solve
as best we could, and then it

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:45.760
was incredibly important to have
a very strong morale and

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.390
shared intent in the team,
because when we

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:50.850
did encounter problems--

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:53.930
for example, many of us did not
have freestyle climbing

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:54.600
experience.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.402
We needed to move camera rigs
off our backs and just

00:44:58.402 --> 00:45:01.090
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:03.320
on some freestyle climbs.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.045
We were all terrified.

00:45:04.045 --> 00:45:07.910
We were like, oh my god, I can't
move, hanging onto the

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:08.790
rocks and so on.

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:13.500
So those were very difficult,
and in every instance, there

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.420
were things that we
had to solve for.

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:20.160
In terms of risk, our legal team
was very concerned that

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.450
we were taking a bunch of people
out, that bears were

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:24.930
going to attack us, that people
were going to fall off

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:29.430
the cliff, and all of these
things were legitimate risks.

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:31.990
So we did three things.

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:34.660
We purchased unbelievably

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:36.230
expensive production insurance.

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:37.880
That was the first thing
that we did to manage

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.360
risk for the client.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.550
Then we mandated--

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:41.670
and this is something
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:43.130
has referred to earlier--

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:46.470
that if you intend to be in this
field team, you will be

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:47.910
training for three months.

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:50.690
That means you need to be
prepared to go out there

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:53.940
nutritionally, physically,
psychologically, emotionally,

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.070
on every level.

00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:57.900
If you show up day one out there
and you're not ready,

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.410
we're going to send you home.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:02.380
And it's up to you to really
want this, to be able to be

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.820
ready, and then to be able to
endure all these different

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:05.910
sorts of circumstances.

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:08.560
So there were at least three
months of very serious

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:12.300
training for everybody who was
in the field team, and we took

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.940
that very seriously as well.

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:16.110
MATT: My partner and I started
to really question what we had

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:17.400
done at that point.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.510
When Cat told us that we had to
actually physically go out

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:22.680
and train, we knew that we are
onto something interesting,

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.550
just because I never in a
million years would have

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:27.980
thought being in advertising
would have required me to

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.090
actually go out and
physically train.

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:32.390
But it was incredibly important,
and Cat was right,

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:35.460
because hiking those
miles was grueling.

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.510
BRIAN MOROZ: So I hope, then,
that BASE jumping view is not

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:39.350
in your 2013 plan.

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:39.940
MATT: We'll see.

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:40.990
Who knows?

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:43.990
BRIAN MOROZ: So I have a quick
question for Josh, and then I

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:45.860
have a final question from
Brazil, I think is a great

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:47.400
question to wrap up
the entire week,

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.950
I'd like to ask everyone.

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:52.290
But quickly for Josh, we have
a question saying, what's up

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:54.370
and coming from Google
in the Maps space?

00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:56.130
Is there any insights we can
give into what we're going to

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:59.890
see in 2013, or can we give any
little hints or previews,

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:02.190
or even things that maybe are
public but kind of quietly so

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:04.490
that we can talk about?

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:07.443
JOSH LIVNI: Well, as you
probably know, we have a habit

00:47:07.443 --> 00:47:09.560
of not really pre-announcing so
we can keep the excitement

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.020
up, but we do have a bunch
of exciting things

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.135
I'll tell you about.

00:47:13.135 --> 00:47:14.815
I want to just [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:14.815 --> 00:47:17.460
earlier, though, in terms of
deciding what exciting things

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:20.465
to put into our API [INAUDIBLE]
platforms, we

00:47:20.465 --> 00:47:23.490
definitely consider quite
a lot of the feedback

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:24.710
[INAUDIBLE].

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:27.170
We have a public [INAUDIBLE]
tracker, where you can list

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:29.940
the things that you're
interested in seeing,

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:33.296
requests, and we look at that
really seriously every month.

00:47:33.296 --> 00:47:34.830
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:36.540
answer.

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:38.922
But you can star the requests,
and if you have things that

00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:41.170
you want to see and you can get
some other developers on

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:45.360
the same page as you, those are
much more likely to occur,

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.520
and we [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.570
people.

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:52.102
That said, we'll keep on trying
to make it as useful as

00:47:52.102 --> 00:47:54.270
possible, and more and more
data, and all of that.

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:55.570
BRIAN MOROZ: So we can't give
too many hints, but you can

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:56.670
make requests, and
that's off of the

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:57.580
Developer page, you said?

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.550
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, if you go
just to our [INAUDIBLE],

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:04.030
you'll see an [INAUDIBLE]
tracker, and in there, there's

00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:06.920
a list of some bugs you
might see, or feature

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:07.740
requests you might see.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:09.196
And we look at those
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:09.196 --> 00:48:12.190
top starred [INAUDIBLE]
requests, and that we take

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:14.480
pretty seriously, and
every quarter, we

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.680
answer some of those.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:16.890
BRIAN MOROZ: Great, OK.

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:20.410
So if you guys on the call have
ideas, have thoughts, put

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:20.660
them in there.

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.740
And my last question,
and let's start

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:25.200
actually with Goodby.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.205
And this is a very broad
question, and it's a good one

00:48:27.205 --> 00:48:28.235
to end with.

00:48:28.235 --> 00:48:30.260
We've only got a couple minutes,
so you're going to

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:31.970
have to be quick.

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:33.960
This comes from Emmanuel
in Brazil.

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.660
What is your concept
of creativity?

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:46.640
It's really easy, right?

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:48.990
If you were going to define
creativity, or describe your

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:52.080
take on what that word means,
what would it be?

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.170
GRAHAM LEWIS: I think creativity
is just time you

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:59.325
can look at a problem a little
bit differently than people

00:48:59.325 --> 00:49:03.610
have previously approached it,
and just applying the most

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:10.240
simple solution to it without it
feeling basic, [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.120
And working on this project, I
kind of naturally found myself

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:14.620
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:17.675
feeling simple, that I needed to
add things to it to make it

00:49:17.675 --> 00:49:19.240
feel more interesting,
but it really just

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.610
was complicated things.

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:23.910
I think the key is really having
something that's very

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:27.390
simple and easy to communicate,
but is ultimately

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:31.160
this universal truth that people
can relate to on a lot

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:31.950
of different levels.

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:33.040
BRIAN MOROZ: Got it.

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.570
HANNA WITTMARK: And I think
that has been the trend.

00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:39.497
In the beginning, when we
started [INAUDIBLE] stuff, it

00:49:39.497 --> 00:49:42.860
was really simple, and then
when everyone started to

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.106
understand it and work with
it, everyone, like Graham

00:49:45.106 --> 00:49:47.960
said, wanted to find new
technology and add

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:48.800
[? creative ?] things.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:53.160
So I think going back right
now to make it even more

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:55.660
simple, it was hard for us.

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:59.000
And it was really good to have
Rich Silverstein and Anders

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.890
Gustafsson as our creative
directors because they have

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:05.300
been working so much longer.

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.220
So they were almost
cutting us off.

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:10.025
They were like, no, this
is a good idea.

00:50:10.025 --> 00:50:12.158
Don't add more layers to it.

00:50:12.158 --> 00:50:15.440
BRIAN MOROZ: Don't bury
it under the icing.

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.990
Very, very good answer, I think,
and I think your point

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:19.715
is very well taken.

00:50:19.715 --> 00:50:21.800
It's very easy, especially when
you start playing with

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.305
technology, to go, oh, and we
can make it 3D, and then we

00:50:24.305 --> 00:50:26.650
can make it turn inside
out, and it will glow.

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:28.710
Keeping it simple and
understandable and clear to

00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:31.160
people, I think, is a great
piece of advice.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.640
And for you guys, what
are your thoughts?

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.900
If you were going to define your
concept of creativity,

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:37.040
what would it be?

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.880
MATT: For me, it's
pretty simple.

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.610
It's always trying to think of
something that hasn't been

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:43.340
thought of before, and if it has
been thought of before and

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.430
you're going to execute it,
execute it in a way that

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:46.740
hasn't been executed before.

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.610
CATHERINE PATTERSON: For me,
it's using the example in

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:59.850
creative technology of being
very free to imagine anything.

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:04.090
For example, submarines and
elevators once were considered

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:08.310
to be preposterous notions, but
they're completely normal.

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:11.930
And all sorts of interesting
technology and innovation is

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:14.580
the result of someone saying,
you know what I'm going to do?

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.730
I'm going to do this
berserk thing.

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:18.710
It's going to happen, and it's
going to be amazing.

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:22.350
So that, for me, is what
creative thinking as about.

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:23.210
BRIAN MOROZ: Beautiful.

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:23.600
All right.

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.030
So thank you guys so
much, both here in

00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:29.620
studio and on the call.

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:30.850
It has been an absolute
pleasure.

00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:32.800
Both of these projects
are fantastic.

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.660
If those of you listening would
like to learn more about

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.500
them, you can go to
creativesandbox.com, where

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.760
you'll find examples like
these and many others.

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:45.420
Thank you guys again so much for
being our final Hangout.

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.810
I hope those of you who have
watched from home or from the

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:50.570
office have enjoyed the series,
and we'd love to hear

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:53.760
from you and hear if you'd like
to see more of these.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.740
Otherwise, I want to wish
everyone a wonderful weekend,

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.860
and for those in the US, a happy
Thanksgiving next week.

00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:01.570
And we'll say adieu.

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:02.150
Bye, everybody.

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.770
MARGARET BRETT-KEARNS:
Thank you.

00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:04.750
Bye bye.

00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:06.000
CATHERINE PATTERSON: Bye.

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:31.333
