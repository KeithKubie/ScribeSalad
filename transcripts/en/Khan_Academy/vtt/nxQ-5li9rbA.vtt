00:00:00.437 --> 00:00:02.612
Voiceover: All right, we're on question,

00:00:02.612 --> 00:00:04.195
on this one right over here.

00:00:04.195 --> 00:00:06.535
We often hear people say
if you're teaching math

00:00:06.535 --> 00:00:08.189
in this country, there's
no way you haven't

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.443
heard of Salman Khan.

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:11.068
That's a little bit surreal
to me if that's true.

00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:13.362
How does your Khan Academy model work

00:00:13.362 --> 00:00:18.012
for less concrete subjects,
say creative writing?

00:00:18.012 --> 00:00:20.329
It depends where you want
to go on the spectrum

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:21.786
into kind of subjective subjects.

00:00:21.786 --> 00:00:26.527
I think if we go into
something like history,

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:27.874
if there are lectures,

00:00:27.874 --> 00:00:29.536
and clearly there are history lectures,

00:00:29.536 --> 00:00:31.417
I've experienced many of them,

00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:34.132
we think, once again, that those shouldn't

00:00:34.132 --> 00:00:36.463
necessarily happen during class time;

00:00:36.463 --> 00:00:37.936
that those are better
at the student's pace,

00:00:37.936 --> 00:00:39.079
at the student's time.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.133
Then if you get them out of the way,

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.998
using something like the Khan Academy,

00:00:42.998 --> 00:00:47.002
then class time can have
a richer discussion.

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:50.000
On top of that, right
now our exercise platform

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.255
for the math, it generates math problems,

00:00:52.255 --> 00:00:55.331
it's harder for a
computer to automatically

00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:58.271
generate a history
question, or even, frankly,

00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:00.168
some types of math questions.

00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:02.269
So what we think we can
do is probably create

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.671
a repository of questions
that have appropriate

00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:07.751
data with them: How hard are they?

00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:09.267
How long does it take someone to do?

00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:11.465
How relevant are they to a specific topic?

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:16.251
We can quiz people on
topics like history so that,

00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:18.601
we don't have that yet
but that's something

00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:20.900
that we would like to do
in the not too far future,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.233
so that someone can, with the lectures,

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:25.333
get a basic scaffold
of their understanding

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.004
of history through the videos,

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:29.875
and they can get practice
so that they make sure

00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:31.665
that they at least have the basic,

00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:33.575
they understand when World War I was,

00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:34.738
when World War II is,

00:01:34.738 --> 00:01:36.208
what's the difference
between the League of Nations

00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:37.895
and the UN, and all of
these type of things.

00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:39.673
So when they go to class time,

00:01:39.673 --> 00:01:41.403
if they have access to a classroom,

00:01:41.403 --> 00:01:43.970
the classroom can be there
for really rich discussion

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.810
and the teacher or the professor knows,

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.398
because they're going to have data

00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:49.667
based on how people perform
on the Khan Academy,

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:52.864
what videos they watch and how
they perform on the questions,

00:01:52.864 --> 00:01:55.136
the teacher will know
how prepared the class is

00:01:55.136 --> 00:01:57.218
for a richer discussion.

00:01:57.218 --> 00:02:00.007
For something like creative writing,

00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:03.091
and creative writing, I'd
put that probably with

00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:09.629
music composition and art,
painting art, or studio art,

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.931
things that are purely creative,

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:14.932
I would say that if
there are any lectures,

00:02:14.932 --> 00:02:16.927
so if right now in a
creative writing class,

00:02:16.927 --> 00:02:20.464
there are teachers
giving basic lectures on

00:02:20.464 --> 00:02:21.998
just things to think about,

00:02:21.998 --> 00:02:24.334
we think that those things can be taken

00:02:24.334 --> 00:02:26.894
out of class time, that
those can be done in a video.

00:02:26.894 --> 00:02:29.259
I'm probably not the
right person to do it,

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:30.400
but we'll be able to find people

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.611
who can do those creative
writing lectures.

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:35.130
Also, even in creative writing,

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.019
there is a basic skill
set that you want to have

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.330
in order to be a
respectable creative writer;

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.800
basic grammar, vocabulary,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.347
doing a critical analysis
of other writing.

00:02:49.347 --> 00:02:52.373
Some of that can be done
in a video form factor.

00:02:52.373 --> 00:02:54.802
Everything we want to do is to enable

00:02:54.802 --> 00:02:59.052
the class time to be all about
writing and getting feedback

00:02:59.052 --> 00:03:01.659
and getting assessment
and critically analyzing

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.051
other peoples' work so it's actively ...

00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:07.693
It's activity-based
work as opposed to just

00:03:07.693 --> 00:03:09.702
listening to a lecture.

00:03:09.702 --> 00:03:11.162
Creative writing, we don't have any,

00:03:11.162 --> 00:03:15.072
I can imagine there will probably
be some videos eventually

00:03:15.072 --> 00:03:17.593
for maybe writing generally;
grammar, vocabulary,

00:03:17.593 --> 00:03:21.328
some forms of critical analysis.

00:03:21.328 --> 00:03:24.454
What I think we could do
eventually for critical writing,

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.186
and once again, this is
completely on the drawing board

00:03:26.186 --> 00:03:28.683
and something we won't be able
to get to for the near term,

00:03:28.683 --> 00:03:32.257
but I think you can do a
model where Khan Academy

00:03:32.257 --> 00:03:39.056
has creative writing projects
and students write creative,

00:03:39.056 --> 00:03:41.259
they write essays and
they write short stories

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:44.487
and they write poetry and members

00:03:44.487 --> 00:03:47.409
of the Khan Academy community
can give them feedback

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.797
on how they did and they can assess

00:03:48.797 --> 00:03:53.409
how good the writing was,
and the students themselves

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.447
will assess other people's writing.

00:03:55.447 --> 00:03:57.134
I think if we can do something like that,

00:03:57.134 --> 00:03:59.537
once again, it will become
a tool where we can automate

00:03:59.537 --> 00:04:03.356
a lot of the overhead
of trying to coordinate

00:04:03.356 --> 00:04:08.531
who's going to assess whom's
work and all of the rest,

00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:10.271
and then you can, once
again, use class time

00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:13.352
with as much human
interaction as possible.

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:15.272
I don't want to claim that
we've solved that problem,

00:04:15.272 --> 00:04:17.275
but I suspect that there are ways.

00:04:17.275 --> 00:04:20.130
One thing I want to make
clear in this interview

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:29.089
is that we aren't married to a
particular type of technology.

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:31.537
We aren't saying it has
to be a black background

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:35.052
with Sal scrawling in pastel colors

00:04:35.052 --> 00:04:36.984
and just talking about a subject.

00:04:36.984 --> 00:04:39.251
We aren't married to the
idea that you have to have

00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:40.987
a knowledge map that's
structured that way.

00:04:40.987 --> 00:04:45.871
Our number one goal is how
can we make a student's

00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:48.210
learning experience as
productive as possible?

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.030
And how can we make that
scarce time with the teacher,

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.114
with the professor, and
with the student's peers

00:04:54.114 --> 00:04:56.535
in that classroom, how
can we make that as rich

00:04:56.535 --> 00:04:58.049
and productive as possible?

00:04:58.049 --> 00:04:59.614
That's what drives all of our thinking.

00:04:59.614 --> 00:05:04.864
Over time, I suspect in 10
years I might not recognize

00:05:04.864 --> 00:05:06.653
a lot of what Khan Academy
is, but I'll be very

00:05:06.653 --> 00:05:08.196
excited because it's
going to be empowering

00:05:08.196 --> 00:05:10.368
a lot of those basic core principles.

00:05:10.368 --> 00:05:13.201
We're always on the lookout
for things that can do that.

00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:15.537
In something like creative
writing, it's true,

00:05:15.537 --> 00:05:17.283
we don't offer something right now.

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.321
History we do offer a few videos

00:05:19.321 --> 00:05:21.657
and we'll probably have a question bank

00:05:21.657 --> 00:05:22.982
in the not too far off future.

00:05:22.982 --> 00:05:25.280
But for creative writing, we
want to explore that space.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.458
We do eventually want to empower

00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:29.790
even the creative writing classrooms.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.495
Next question.

00:05:31.495 --> 00:05:33.595
You said that most educational software

00:05:33.595 --> 00:05:35.088
loses sight of the end user.

00:05:35.088 --> 00:05:36.789
What should the people
in charge of purchasing

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.753
these materials understand about them?

00:05:38.753 --> 00:05:40.857
It's a very simple idea.

00:05:40.857 --> 00:05:45.789
I would say if you are in
the decision-making role

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.922
of purchasing materials, and this is true

00:05:47.922 --> 00:05:49.503
whether you're in education or anything,

00:05:49.503 --> 00:05:53.666
don't just be impressed by the polish

00:05:53.666 --> 00:05:55.924
of what the sales person tells you,

00:05:55.924 --> 00:05:58.527
or the fact that other
districts are doing it,

00:05:58.527 --> 00:06:00.124
or when you flip through the book

00:06:00.124 --> 00:06:02.527
it seems to have fancy graphics
and it seems to be expensive

00:06:02.527 --> 00:06:05.258
and it seems to meet all
of the State standards.

00:06:05.258 --> 00:06:07.794
I think the best thing
that anyone can do is say,

00:06:07.794 --> 00:06:08.517
"You know what?

00:06:08.517 --> 00:06:09.784
"Let me take out this book,

00:06:09.784 --> 00:06:11.868
"or let me take out this piece of software

00:06:11.868 --> 00:06:13.265
"and let me try to learn from it."

00:06:13.265 --> 00:06:17.883
Pick a subject that,
if you're the school's

00:06:17.883 --> 00:06:19.738
principal or the district superintendant

00:06:19.738 --> 00:06:20.964
or whoever you are, say,

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:23.638
"You know what, I'm a little
rusty on systems of equations.

00:06:23.638 --> 00:06:25.308
"Let me see if I can
learn systems of equations

00:06:25.308 --> 00:06:26.866
"from this book, and let
me see if it's really

00:06:26.866 --> 00:06:28.634
"that dramatically different
than the older textbook,

00:06:28.634 --> 00:06:31.276
"or if the software's
dramatically different

00:06:31.276 --> 00:06:32.923
"than the textbook."

00:06:32.923 --> 00:06:36.532
That's really the best way
to see if it's effective.

00:06:36.532 --> 00:06:39.004
In fact, I think that's true
about assessing anything.

00:06:39.004 --> 00:06:42.414
I think all of us have
experienced that sometimes,

00:06:42.414 --> 00:06:46.059
even amongst teachers, there could be

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:49.004
a very flashy presentation.

00:06:49.004 --> 00:06:50.201
And not just teachers, videos even.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:51.657
There could be a very flashy presentation.

00:06:51.657 --> 00:06:53.922
If you look at it superficially, you say,

00:06:53.922 --> 00:06:56.195
"Oh my god, this is going
to be good instruction,"

00:06:56.195 --> 00:06:58.861
but you're not actually
trying to learn from,

00:06:58.861 --> 00:07:00.672
or that thing might
not actually teach you.

00:07:00.672 --> 00:07:04.864
The more basic lecture,
or the more basic video,

00:07:04.864 --> 00:07:08.339
oftentimes might do a
better job at teaching you.

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:12.467
So the real way to assess something

00:07:12.467 --> 00:07:14.169
is to actually try to learn from it.

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:15.929
I'm not saying that
flashy is necessarily bad,

00:07:15.929 --> 00:07:18.331
I'm just saying that flashy
is not necessarily good.

00:07:18.331 --> 00:07:21.597
A lot of us, it's just
easier to assess something

00:07:21.597 --> 00:07:23.592
very quickly saying, "Oh,
look, that looks polished;

00:07:23.592 --> 00:07:25.458
"that looks like there's a
lot of money spent into it,

00:07:25.458 --> 00:07:27.333
it must be good," but the reality is

00:07:27.333 --> 00:07:28.929
try to actually learn from it

00:07:28.929 --> 00:07:30.660
and you'll find that some
of the more basic things

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.071
can often do better.

00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:37.066
I encourage anyone who's
looking at anything like that

00:07:37.066 --> 00:07:40.402
is to question their assumptions.

00:07:40.402 --> 00:07:46.335
Does a calculus textbook have
to have 1,000 pages in it?

00:07:46.335 --> 00:07:49.117
Does it have to even be a hardcover book?

00:07:49.117 --> 00:07:51.619
Why don't you separate it
into multiple chapters?

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:55.696
All of these questions I think people ...

00:07:55.696 --> 00:07:58.202
They all boil down to the
basic principle that you

00:07:58.202 --> 00:08:00.525
should just try to learn
from that content yourselves

00:08:00.525 --> 00:08:02.390
and if you learn better from that content

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.727
and you find that content engaging

00:08:04.727 --> 00:08:07.255
and you find it's something
that you can engage with,

00:08:07.255 --> 00:08:09.818
it's likely that the
students will be able to.

00:08:09.818 --> 00:08:11.196
If you can't and if it's just flashy

00:08:11.196 --> 00:08:13.129
and looks polished, it's
likely that the students

00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:15.799
won't be able to either.

00:08:15.799 --> 00:08:18.266
Next question.

00:08:18.266 --> 00:08:20.145
At the heart of the Khan
Academy's philosophy

00:08:20.145 --> 00:08:21.677
is the importance of enabling students

00:08:21.677 --> 00:08:22.979
to learn at their own pace.

00:08:22.979 --> 00:08:24.891
What happens when these
students enter the work force?

00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:27.737
Do they work, perform surgery, try a case,

00:08:27.737 --> 00:08:30.583
analyze data, or even
teach at their own pace?

00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:32.662
Yes.

00:08:32.662 --> 00:08:34.677
I think the learning at your own pace

00:08:34.677 --> 00:08:37.263
is exactly what happens in the real world.

00:08:37.263 --> 00:08:41.466
Every job I've been at,
there was no 30-person

00:08:41.466 --> 00:08:45.600
classroom where everyone was
moved ahead at the same time.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.598
First of all, it was a lot
of learning on your own.

00:08:48.598 --> 00:08:51.595
You had to figure out
what needs to be learned.

00:08:51.595 --> 00:08:54.101
There wasn't anyone holding your hand.

00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:56.012
You had to learn at your own pace.

00:08:56.012 --> 00:08:58.933
You work at a firm, you have
to figure out what's important,

00:08:58.933 --> 00:09:01.527
then you have to go,
usually at most firms,

00:09:01.527 --> 00:09:03.769
ask the right questions
from the right people

00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:05.529
and then proceed at your own pace.

00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:08.860
You actually see that; that
is actually the reality

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.195
in most fields.

00:09:12.195 --> 00:09:17.262
You learn from experience
and from your own inquiry,

00:09:17.262 --> 00:09:20.685
and that tends to happen at your own pace.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:24.859
No one forces you along until you have ...

00:09:24.859 --> 00:09:26.512
And you don't force yourself along

00:09:26.512 --> 00:09:28.096
until you've mastered something.

00:09:28.096 --> 00:09:31.462
So, yes, I actually
think that's why so many

00:09:31.462 --> 00:09:33.343
students, right now,
suffer when they go into

00:09:33.343 --> 00:09:36.767
the work force is that
they're so used to being

00:09:36.767 --> 00:09:39.608
kind of shepherded along,
kind of as a cohort,

00:09:39.608 --> 00:09:41.486
that all of a sudden,
when they're thrown into

00:09:41.486 --> 00:09:43.068
the work environment and all of a sudden

00:09:43.068 --> 00:09:44.662
you have to decide when it's time

00:09:44.662 --> 00:09:46.478
to ask the boss for a promotion,

00:09:46.478 --> 00:09:48.148
you have to decide when you think

00:09:48.148 --> 00:09:50.004
you're ready to go back to grad school,

00:09:50.004 --> 00:09:51.402
you have to decide when you think

00:09:51.402 --> 00:09:53.737
you're ready to start your own business.

00:09:53.737 --> 00:09:57.581
Some people struggle when
they're not being told

00:09:57.581 --> 00:09:59.149
now you're going to go to 12th grade,

00:09:59.149 --> 00:10:00.403
now you're going to go to college,

00:10:00.403 --> 00:10:02.605
so I think that's an added benefit.

00:10:02.605 --> 00:10:04.468
When you give people at a young age,

00:10:04.468 --> 00:10:06.065
if you give them control
of their learning,

00:10:06.065 --> 00:10:07.867
if you make them self directed,

00:10:07.867 --> 00:10:10.275
that's a skill that's going to translate

00:10:10.275 --> 00:10:12.801
really well and really empower them

00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:15.867
once they enter the workforce.
