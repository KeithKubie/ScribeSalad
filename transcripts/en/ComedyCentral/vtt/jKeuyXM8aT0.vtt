00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.383
- All right, man, what's up,

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.051
everybody in the Internets
world and whatnot?

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.286
This is Vandaveon and Mike.

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:20.420
It's the third season
of our show.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.855
It used to be called
"Critiquer's Corner."

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:22.990
We got a brand-new name.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.291
We're gonna call it
"The Van and Mike Show"

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:25.526
now from now on.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.127
You know, usually what we
used to do on the show

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.328
was that we would
critique scenes

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:29.530
from the "Key &amp; Peele" show.
- Stupid.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.131
- But you know what?
That's cool.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.966
We don't need to worry
about that anymore, man.

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.935
Over 2 million hits
for our show.

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:35.936
- 2 million hit!

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:37.070
- What's "Key &amp; Peele" got?

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.071
Who cares, man?

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.706
'Cause we are
Internet phenomenons.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.708
I bet, as soon as I finish
talking today,

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:42.709
y'all gonna have like--

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:43.710
- Blip!

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.745
- Like, skid-d-d-d-d-rah!

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:46.246
2 million hits, just like that.
- Bitch.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.447
- We're here
for the people, man.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.116
It's Internet free
for everybody.

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:50.684
- It's like Banksy.
- Like who?

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:51.685
- You know.

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:52.753
- No, I didn't hear
what you said.

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:54.922
- The dude from
the documentary, Banksy.

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:56.023
- Oh, Banksy, right.

00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:57.424
This that nigga
that can't nobody see.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:58.458
He out there somewhere.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.060
He be just drawing,
like, rats on a wall.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.261
- Try not to let it
go to our head.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.296
- Yeah, that's
the other thing.

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:03.363
Say it again, Mike?

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.431
- Try not to let success
go to our head.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:05.599
- Exactly, we don't want
no success

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:06.700
going up to our heads, man.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.168
We get a whole new look
up in here.

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.236
We got the double camera.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.071
- Why you got two cameras?

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.239
- So we can cut
back and forth

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:13.373
if we want to do something,

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.608
like, to get
a different dimension,

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:15.609
like Scorsese.

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:16.610
- It's pointed at me, though.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.945
- It's not--
hey, look, man.

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:19.780
Just look where I'm sitting,
and look where the lens at.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.948
It look like it's pointed--
- I'm not talking about

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:21.982
that one.
I'm talking about that one.

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:23.083
- Camera's definitely
not on you.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.252
It's just got
a wide-angle lens on it.

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:26.687
- You know what else
needs a wide-angle lens?

00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:27.888
- What's that?
- My dick.

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:30.190
[laughter]

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.959
I thought about that
way, way beforehand.

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:33.694
- I didn't know
what he was gonna say.

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:36.163
Sometimes we gonna be talking
about movies that we be enjoying

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:38.098
and how they could have
utilized dicks.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.099
- Whatever's
in the ether.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.200
- Other agendas on the show

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.935
that we gonna try
to get to: politics...

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.136
- World news.

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:44.338
- I know I wasn't gonna talk
about "Key &amp; Peele,"

00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:45.339
but just got to talk
about "Key &amp; Peele"

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:46.340
for just one second, though.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.341
- "The Substitute 2."

00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:48.609
- We watched
"The Substitute Teacher 2,"

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.978
which is one of the scenes
that's in the first show

00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:52.412
of the third season
of "Key &amp; Peele."

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:53.614
- Shit's funny,
that shit's funny, though.

00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:55.616
- It was stupid...
- [snickering]

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:57.117
- But it was funny, though.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.952
But it was straight-up funny.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:03.690
- Ain't none of you old enough
to go to the damn club!

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.059
Ridiculous.

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:07.060
- Mr. Garvey--

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.162
- Ah, son of a bitch!

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:10.631
[indistinct shouting]

00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:12.132
- "Oh, son of a bitch!"

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.867
- Kept waiting
for the dick to come out.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:15.235
- We have found it funny,

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:16.904
but there wasn't
a dick to be found,

00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:18.305
nary a dick to be found.

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:21.308
I thought, when he busted
the clipboard over his knee,

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:22.776
like he had done
in the first one,

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:24.878
what if he had just been
like, zip, whoop...

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:26.413
K'shh!
And broke it over his dick.

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:29.082
- [snickering]
- And broke it over his dick!

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:30.117
Ha-ha!

00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:31.952
You missed it, "Key &amp; Peele!"

00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:33.086
- Yo.
- That might be

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:34.588
the only critique
we do this year.

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:35.589
Enough about them.

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:36.657
Man, they starting
their third season.

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:37.658
Good for them.

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:38.659
We don't need no TV show.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.093
- That's just a rule.

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:41.428
- So I ain't even concerned
about their show no more, man.

00:02:41.428 --> 00:02:42.896
They don't want to hire you
as writers.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.731
They don't want to understand
the recipe for funny,

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.732
which is dicks.

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:46.733
- Bitch!

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:47.768
- So you didn't hire us,

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:48.869
and we wanted
to give you the dick secret.

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:50.337
- Dick secret.
- But you don't want it.

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:51.338
That's on you, then.

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:52.539
Fuck you!

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:53.874
- Dick secret's when you
think about dicks,

00:02:53.874 --> 00:02:55.909
and then only pleasant dicks
come back to you.

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.110
You put positive dicks
out there.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.779
- Only positive dicks
be coming back to you.

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:00.480
[laughter]

00:03:10.624 --> 00:03:12.693
See, Mike, man,
he prolific--what's the word?

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:13.961
- Prophylactic.
- Prophylactic.

00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:15.662
- He prophylactic--
wait a second.

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:17.164
[laughing]

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:18.599
He got the play on words,

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.801
'cause prophylactic
what you put on your dick!

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:23.170
Fuck you, "Key &amp; Peele,"
you missing all the gold.
