be the caregiver what does that require
 

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.399
be the caregiver what does that require
well if you think about a problem which

00:21:51.399 --> 00:21:51.409
well if you think about a problem which
 

00:21:51.409 --> 00:21:54.610
well if you think about a problem which
has become very well appreciated in

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:54.620
has become very well appreciated in
 

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.759
has become very well appreciated in
medicine today which is the problem of

00:21:57.759 --> 00:21:57.769
medicine today which is the problem of
 

00:21:57.769 --> 00:22:02.049
medicine today which is the problem of
patient safety and the responsibility of

00:22:02.049 --> 00:22:02.059
patient safety and the responsibility of
 

00:22:02.059 --> 00:22:05.740
patient safety and the responsibility of
the system of care to ensure the safety

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:05.750
the system of care to ensure the safety
 

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:10.119
the system of care to ensure the safety
of the patient the Institute of Medicine

when it did a landmark study on errors
 

00:22:14.389 --> 00:22:17.499
when it did a landmark study on errors
in medicine estimated that tens of

in medicine estimated that tens of
 

00:22:17.509 --> 00:22:20.139
in medicine estimated that tens of
thousands of people every year lost

thousands of people every year lost
 

00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:23.470
thousands of people every year lost
their lives because of errors in the

delivery of care it was if you ranked it

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:28.360
delivery of care it was if you ranked it
 

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.930

according to causes of mortality in the
 

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:36.610
according to causes of mortality in the
top 10 in the United States how do we

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:36.620
top 10 in the United States how do we
 

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.070
top 10 in the United States how do we
understand that as a problem from an

understand that as a problem from an
 

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.940
understand that as a problem from an
educators point of view how do you deal

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:42.950
educators point of view how do you deal
 

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:46.840
educators point of view how do you deal
with preparing doctors to practice safe

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:46.850
with preparing doctors to practice safe
 

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:50.619
with preparing doctors to practice safe
medicine well there are many different

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:50.629
medicine well there are many different
 

00:22:50.629 --> 00:22:53.889
medicine well there are many different
possible points of view one point of

00:22:53.889 --> 00:22:53.899
possible points of view one point of
 

00:22:53.899 --> 00:22:57.070
possible points of view one point of
view says well the reason that we have

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.080
view says well the reason that we have
 

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.619
view says well the reason that we have
errors in medicine is that we have

00:22:59.619 --> 00:22:59.629
errors in medicine is that we have
 

00:22:59.629 --> 00:23:02.950
errors in medicine is that we have
sloppy care and the reason we have

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960
sloppy care and the reason we have
 

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.060
sloppy care and the reason we have
sloppy cares that we allow into practice

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:07.070
sloppy cares that we allow into practice
 

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.190
sloppy cares that we allow into practice
in nursing in medicine and direct

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200
in nursing in medicine and direct
 

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.710
in nursing in medicine and direct
contact with patients individuals who do

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:11.720
contact with patients individuals who do
 

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.860
contact with patients individuals who do
not care enough about taking good care

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:14.870
not care enough about taking good care
 

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:19.619
not care enough about taking good care
of the patient and so if you adopt this

00:23:19.619 --> 00:23:19.629
of the patient and so if you adopt this
 

00:23:19.629 --> 00:23:23.080
of the patient and so if you adopt this
reasoning of the problem your solution

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:23.090
reasoning of the problem your solution
 

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:27.249
reasoning of the problem your solution
is to do a better job in selecting the

00:23:27.249 --> 00:23:27.259
is to do a better job in selecting the
 

00:23:27.259 --> 00:23:28.990
is to do a better job in selecting the
right people to go into these

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000
right people to go into these
 

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.970
right people to go into these
professions the caring professions in

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:30.980
professions the caring professions in
 

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:34.649
professions the caring professions in
the first place so if you take the

00:23:34.649 --> 00:23:34.659
the first place so if you take the
 

00:23:34.659 --> 00:23:37.600
the first place so if you take the
ethicist point of view that the problem

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:37.610
ethicist point of view that the problem
 

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:41.049
ethicist point of view that the problem
is you just don't care enough you say

00:23:41.049 --> 00:23:41.059
is you just don't care enough you say
 

00:23:41.059 --> 00:23:42.820
is you just don't care enough you say
well the answer is find people who do

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:42.830
well the answer is find people who do
 

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:47.379
well the answer is find people who do
before you let them harm any patient now

00:23:47.379 --> 00:23:47.389
before you let them harm any patient now
 

00:23:47.389 --> 00:23:50.379
before you let them harm any patient now
another approach is to say well it's not

00:23:50.379 --> 00:23:50.389
another approach is to say well it's not
 

00:23:50.389 --> 00:23:54.249
another approach is to say well it's not
that there is people who don't care it's

00:23:54.249 --> 00:23:54.259
that there is people who don't care it's
 

00:23:54.259 --> 00:23:56.350
that there is people who don't care it's
that we haven't done a good enough job

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.360
that we haven't done a good enough job
 

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.619
that we haven't done a good enough job
in educating them about what they need

00:23:59.619 --> 00:23:59.629
in educating them about what they need
 

00:23:59.629 --> 00:24:04.180
in educating them about what they need
to do to practice safe medicine so if

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:04.190
to do to practice safe medicine so if
 

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.549
to do to practice safe medicine so if
you want people to be able to practice

00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559
you want people to be able to practice
 

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:08.139
you want people to be able to practice
safe medicine it's not because they

00:24:08.139 --> 00:24:08.149
safe medicine it's not because they
 

00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:09.549
safe medicine it's not because they
don't care it's because they haven't

00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559
don't care it's because they haven't
 

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:12.820
don't care it's because they haven't
been trained to know exactly what the

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:12.830
been trained to know exactly what the
 

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.009
been trained to know exactly what the
correct protocol is exactly what is the

00:24:15.009 --> 00:24:15.019
correct protocol is exactly what is the
 

00:24:15.019 --> 00:24:17.320
correct protocol is exactly what is the
right procedure exactly what should be

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:17.330
right procedure exactly what should be
 

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.230
right procedure exactly what should be
the sequence of testing and how do you

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240
the sequence of testing and how do you
 

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.149
the sequence of testing and how do you
ensure that the right medication is the

00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159
ensure that the right medication is the
 

00:24:22.159 --> 00:24:25.930
ensure that the right medication is the
one that you order so if you think that

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:25.940
one that you order so if you think that
 

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:30.940
one that you order so if you think that
the solution is education you want to

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:30.950
the solution is education you want to
 

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:33.700
the solution is education you want to
get to the doctors in school and in

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:33.710
get to the doctors in school and in
 

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.279
get to the doctors in school and in
residency and beyond and make sure that

00:24:36.279 --> 00:24:36.289
residency and beyond and make sure that
 

00:24:36.289 --> 00:24:39.159
residency and beyond and make sure that
they are trained properly as you won't

00:24:39.159 --> 00:24:39.169
they are trained properly as you won't
 

00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:42.820
they are trained properly as you won't
want nurses to be trained properly but

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:42.830
want nurses to be trained properly but
 

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:44.580
want nurses to be trained properly but
if you say well

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:44.590
if you say well
 

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:46.529
if you say well
eight it's not just I don't care it's

00:24:46.529 --> 00:24:46.539
eight it's not just I don't care it's
 

00:24:46.539 --> 00:24:48.390
eight it's not just I don't care it's
not just we're not training them but

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:48.400
not just we're not training them but
 

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.299
not just we're not training them but
look where we practice and look how we

00:24:51.299 --> 00:24:51.309
look where we practice and look how we
 

00:24:51.309 --> 00:24:55.470
look where we practice and look how we
practice we have kept residence on duty

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:55.480
practice we have kept residence on duty
 

00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:01.560
practice we have kept residence on duty
for scores of hours at a time 36 and we

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:01.570
for scores of hours at a time 36 and we
 

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:05.370
for scores of hours at a time 36 and we
have kept doctors under stress in the

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:05.380
have kept doctors under stress in the
 

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.980
have kept doctors under stress in the
emergency rooms and we have nurses that

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:07.990
emergency rooms and we have nurses that
 

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:11.100
emergency rooms and we have nurses that
are overly burdened with their work and

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:11.110
are overly burdened with their work and
 

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:15.090
are overly burdened with their work and
that psychologically under stress over

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:15.100
that psychologically under stress over
 

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.870
that psychologically under stress over
worked with extreme pressure people will

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880
worked with extreme pressure people will
 

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:22.110
worked with extreme pressure people will
make mistakes and so if you say that the

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:22.120
make mistakes and so if you say that the
 

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.110
make mistakes and so if you say that the
problem well it's not ethical problem

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120
problem well it's not ethical problem
 

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.070
problem well it's not ethical problem
it's not an educational problem it's a

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080
it's not an educational problem it's a
 

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.480
it's not an educational problem it's a
psychological problem of overwhelming

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:32.490
psychological problem of overwhelming
 

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:36.180
psychological problem of overwhelming
stress pressure and circumstances of

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:36.190
stress pressure and circumstances of
 

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.549
stress pressure and circumstances of
work then the solution is well you cut

00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559
work then the solution is well you cut
 

00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:41.430
work then the solution is well you cut
down on residency hours you staff

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440
down on residency hours you staff
 

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.409
down on residency hours you staff
adequately the nursing that's required

00:25:43.409 --> 00:25:43.419
adequately the nursing that's required
 

00:25:43.419 --> 00:25:45.600
adequately the nursing that's required
so that you have a reduction of the

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:45.610
so that you have a reduction of the
 

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.630
so that you have a reduction of the
stress on your nurses you provide the

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640
stress on your nurses you provide the
 

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.510
stress on your nurses you provide the
kind of backup and training that will

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520
kind of backup and training that will
 

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.279
kind of backup and training that will
allow people to practice more sanely and

00:25:55.279 --> 00:25:55.289
allow people to practice more sanely and
 

00:25:55.289 --> 00:25:58.649
allow people to practice more sanely and
therefore it will be safer so if you

00:25:58.649 --> 00:25:58.659
therefore it will be safer so if you
 

00:25:58.659 --> 00:26:01.470
therefore it will be safer so if you
believe the problem is the circumstance

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:01.480
believe the problem is the circumstance
 

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.260
believe the problem is the circumstance
of care and the psychological burden you

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:04.270
of care and the psychological burden you
 

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:09.180
of care and the psychological burden you
approach the problem that way well you

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:09.190
approach the problem that way well you
 

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:14.519
approach the problem that way well you
might say no it's not quite that really

00:26:14.519 --> 00:26:14.529
might say no it's not quite that really
 

00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:16.769
might say no it's not quite that really
the problem is that we incentivize

00:26:16.769 --> 00:26:16.779
the problem is that we incentivize
 

00:26:16.779 --> 00:26:21.960
the problem is that we incentivize
doctors and others to be sloppy because

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:21.970
doctors and others to be sloppy because
 

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:25.019
doctors and others to be sloppy because
we don't pay them only for doing the

00:26:25.019 --> 00:26:25.029
we don't pay them only for doing the
 

00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:26.760
we don't pay them only for doing the
right things we pay them for doing more

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:26.770
right things we pay them for doing more
 

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:30.210
right things we pay them for doing more
things so if you believe that the

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:30.220
things so if you believe that the
 

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.850
things so if you believe that the
problem is that the incentives are wrong

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:32.860
problem is that the incentives are wrong
 

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.600
problem is that the incentives are wrong
and the pay is misplaced and the rewards

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:36.610
and the pay is misplaced and the rewards
 

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:38.970
and the pay is misplaced and the rewards
don't go along with safe care just goes

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:38.980
don't go along with safe care just goes
 

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.639
don't go along with safe care just goes
along with more care then you'd say well

00:26:41.639 --> 00:26:41.649
along with more care then you'd say well
 

00:26:41.649 --> 00:26:44.130
along with more care then you'd say well
the answer is we have to change the way

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:44.140
the answer is we have to change the way
 

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:49.399
the answer is we have to change the way
that we reinforce payment to doctors

00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:49.409
that we reinforce payment to doctors
 

00:26:49.409 --> 00:26:53.299
that we reinforce payment to doctors
well all of these I think have a point

00:26:53.299 --> 00:26:53.309
well all of these I think have a point
 

00:26:53.309 --> 00:26:57.240
well all of these I think have a point
but i'm here at carnegie mellon to tell

fundamentally none of those and even all
 

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.100
fundamentally none of those and even all
of those get to the heart of what is the

the processes of care it's about having
 

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:23.790
the processes of care it's about having
a medical care delivery capacity which

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:23.800
a medical care delivery capacity which
 

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.760
a medical care delivery capacity which
not only is capable of delivering safe

not only is capable of delivering safe
 

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:30.450
not only is capable of delivering safe
care but is virtually incapable of

delivering unsafe care now if we are
 

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:38.820
delivering unsafe care now if we are
going to take doctors today and we're

going to take doctors today and we're
 

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.550

about the relationship to the patient

decisions and I believe that that is a
very very good model but i would add

very very good model but i would add
 

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:56.560
very very good model but i would add
it's not the ideal model for every

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:56.570
it's not the ideal model for every
 

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:59.040
it's not the ideal model for every
individual or in every circumstance

there are times when individuals need a

there are times when individuals need a
doctor who will just tell them what to

their own decision-making over time and
what I believe we really need in the

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:20.810
what I believe we really need in the
 

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:23.050
what I believe we really need in the
training of doctors in this new age of

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:23.060
training of doctors in this new age of
 

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.360
training of doctors in this new age of
information and the new relationship to

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:25.370
information and the new relationship to
 

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.540
information and the new relationship to
patients are clinicians who have the

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:28.550
patients are clinicians who have the
 

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:33.000
patients are clinicians who have the
capacity to not exert their style of

quality of care that that patient needs
at that time and that means placing a

at that time and that means placing a
 

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.470
at that time and that means placing a
very high premium on the human

very high premium on the human

meet the needs of the patient so if we
 

00:34:45.859 --> 00:34:48.849
meet the needs of the patient so if we
think about the caregiver who's meeting

00:34:48.849 --> 00:34:48.859
think about the caregiver who's meeting
 

00:34:48.859 --> 00:34:51.669

raised oh thank you mark I think this is
a really critical point because the

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:12.650
a really critical point because the
 

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:14.890
a really critical point because the
concept of medical education is not

in fact what we used to tell our medical

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:32.930
in fact what we used to tell our medical
 

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.870
in fact what we used to tell our medical
students is that we know half of what

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880
students is that we know half of what
 

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.630
students is that we know half of what
we're teaching them is wrong we just

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:37.640
we're teaching them is wrong we just
 

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.500
we're teaching them is wrong we just
don't know which half

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:39.510
don't know which half
 

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.500
don't know which half
and they will discover which half in the

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:42.510
and they will discover which half in the
 

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.350
and they will discover which half in the

a junior at alder days um I've really
 

00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:02.769
a junior at alder days um I've really
been interested in medical studies for a

00:40:02.769 --> 00:40:02.779
been interested in medical studies for a
 

00:40:02.779 --> 00:40:04.029
been interested in medical studies for a
long time and I've always thought about

00:40:04.029 --> 00:40:04.039
long time and I've always thought about
 

00:40:04.039 --> 00:40:06.209
long time and I've always thought about
being a doctor and its really been

your opinion on the prevalence of

your opinion on the prevalence of
 

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:15.699
your opinion on the prevalence of
robotic surgery and different types of

robotic surgery and different types of
 

00:40:15.709 --> 00:40:19.930
robotic surgery and different types of
laparoscopic surgery and medicine it's

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:19.940
laparoscopic surgery and medicine it's
 

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:24.449
laparoscopic surgery and medicine it's
there so that you know one of the

00:40:24.449 --> 00:40:24.459
there so that you know one of the
 

00:40:24.459 --> 00:40:28.299
there so that you know one of the
features of Technology if you look at

00:40:28.299 --> 00:40:28.309
features of Technology if you look at
 

00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:30.849
features of Technology if you look at
technology in general in medicine over

00:40:30.849 --> 00:40:30.859
technology in general in medicine over
 

00:40:30.859 --> 00:40:34.439
technology in general in medicine over
time is that it has sometimes

00:40:34.439 --> 00:40:34.449
time is that it has sometimes
 

00:40:34.449 --> 00:40:37.029
time is that it has sometimes
progressively distanced the doctor from

progressively distanced the doctor from
 

00:40:37.039 --> 00:40:40.689
progressively distanced the doctor from
the patient so for example a Stanley

already it was considered technology

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:48.890
already it was considered technology
 

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:52.870
already it was considered technology
back then and he cited for example the

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880
back then and he cited for example the
 

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.829
back then and he cited for example the
development of the stethoscope which

00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839
development of the stethoscope which
 

00:40:55.839 --> 00:40:59.439
development of the stethoscope which
enabled the doctor no longer to lay her

00:40:59.439 --> 00:40:59.449
enabled the doctor no longer to lay her
 

00:40:59.449 --> 00:41:01.689
enabled the doctor no longer to lay her
or his ear right on the chest of the

nowadays art can tell me but I think the

nowadays art can tell me but I think the

is you know yet another remove from the

is you know yet another remove from the
 

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:18.549
is you know yet another remove from the
patient and so fundamentally technology

00:41:18.549 --> 00:41:18.559
patient and so fundamentally technology
 

00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:22.449
patient and so fundamentally technology
of this kind has that risk of the

of this kind has that risk of the
 

00:41:22.459 --> 00:41:24.900

because you can do surgery with a much
 

00:41:40.099 --> 00:41:43.779
because you can do surgery with a much
smaller intrusion to access the actual

surgery the appeal of it is that it is
 

00:41:50.299 --> 00:41:53.729
surgery the appeal of it is that it is
much more precise in its movement and
