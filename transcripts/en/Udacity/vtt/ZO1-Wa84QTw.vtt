00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.936
These variables have a stronger relationship, but there's no right answer for

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:09.650
how we would prove this. You might have come up with your own creative way. For

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:20.210
example, what if we drew the smallest ellipse possible around all our data, and

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:30.130
then looked at the ratio of the major axis of this ellipse, to the minor axis

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:42.720
were bigger ratio mean a stronger relationship.
