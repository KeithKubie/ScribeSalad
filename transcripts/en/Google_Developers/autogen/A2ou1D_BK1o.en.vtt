Android developer tools they sometimes

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230
Android developer tools they sometimes
 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.810
Android developer tools they sometimes
have some challenges and understanding

have some challenges and understanding
 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.150
have some challenges and understanding
how to use them and how to run them so I

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160
how to use them and how to run them so I
 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.940
how to use them and how to run them so I
figured it would be a good topic to

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950
figured it would be a good topic to
 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.930
figured it would be a good topic to
share because I think it's really

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940
share because I think it's really
 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.480
share because I think it's really
important I think the tools are really

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490
important I think the tools are really
 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.000
important I think the tools are really
fantastic and the project and the team

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010
fantastic and the project and the team
 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.430
fantastic and the project and the team
are really great I think the discovery

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440
are really great I think the discovery
 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.950
are really great I think the discovery
and usability of the tools not usability

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960
and usability of the tools not usability
 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.360
and usability of the tools not usability
but the discovery is it can be

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370
but the discovery is it can be
 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.450
but the discovery is it can be
challenging so that's why I wrote the

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460
challenging so that's why I wrote the
 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.159
challenging so that's why I wrote the
book the other thing is I am active

generate a project android project that

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219
generate a project android project that
 

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:21.820
generate a project android project that
is designed to help run the demos and

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830
is designed to help run the demos and
 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.159
is designed to help run the demos and
generate examples so it's up here at

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169
generate examples so it's up here at
 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.709
generate examples so it's up here at
github so if you want to download that

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:27.719
github so if you want to download that
 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:29.390
github so if you want to download that
that should help you run all the demos

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400
that should help you run all the demos
 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.240
that should help you run all the demos

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.000
okay so that's enough about me let's

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010
okay so that's enough about me let's
 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.500
okay so that's enough about me let's
talk a little bit about the tools and

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:00.510
talk a little bit about the tools and
 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.730
talk a little bit about the tools and
then we'll get into the nitty-gritty of

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740
then we'll get into the nitty-gritty of
 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.330
then we'll get into the nitty-gritty of
actually using the tools so the first

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340
actually using the tools so the first
 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.290
actually using the tools so the first
thing I want to mention about the

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300
thing I want to mention about the
 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.320
thing I want to mention about the
Android developer tools is that they are

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330
Android developer tools is that they are
 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.310
Android developer tools is that they are
free and open source so you know I don't

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320
free and open source so you know I don't
 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.570
free and open source so you know I don't
wanna make a political statement about

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.580
wanna make a political statement about
 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.680
wanna make a political statement about
Android but the Android AOSP is

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.690
Android but the Android AOSP is
 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.000
Android but the Android AOSP is
realistically not open source they don't

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.010
realistically not open source they don't
 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.670
realistically not open source they don't
take they don't take submissions and

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680
take they don't take submissions and
 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.580
take they don't take submissions and
they it's not developed in the open

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.590
they it's not developed in the open
 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.380
they it's not developed in the open
source they give it to the open source

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:27.390
source they give it to the open source
 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.440
source they give it to the open source
community after it's been developed

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:29.450
community after it's been developed
 

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.690
community after it's been developed
difference is the Android developer

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:32.700
difference is the Android developer
 

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.210
difference is the Android developer
tools are developed completely in the

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220
tools are developed completely in the
 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.120
tools are developed completely in the
open there is a open branch that you can

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.130
open there is a open branch that you can
 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.560
open there is a open branch that you can
go check out the latest revisions of the

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:39.570
go check out the latest revisions of the
 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.050
go check out the latest revisions of the
code and they do take submissions if you

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.060
code and they do take submissions if you
 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.200
code and they do take submissions if you
have a fix or something they do accept

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:45.210
have a fix or something they do accept
 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.560
have a fix or something they do accept
submissions so it's a much different

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:47.570
submissions so it's a much different
 

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.660
submissions so it's a much different
sort of project than Android and the

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:50.670
sort of project than Android and the
 

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.430
sort of project than Android and the
other thing that's important to mention

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440
other thing that's important to mention
 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.970
other thing that's important to mention
is its run independent of Android you

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:55.980
is its run independent of Android you
 

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.920
is its run independent of Android you
they're not necessarily the same team

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:57.930
they're not necessarily the same team
 

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.690
they're not necessarily the same team
they're run differently they have

00:07:59.690 --> 00:07:59.700
they're run differently they have
 

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.040
they're run differently they have
different schedules and they have

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.050
different schedules and they have
 

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.580
different schedules and they have
different um they have different kind of

different um they have different kind of
 

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:08.750
different um they have different kind of
ways of operations so they're very very

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:08.760

I do think some of the command some of
 

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.360
I do think some of the command some of
the tools are common but uh I don't

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:41.370
the tools are common but uh I don't
 

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.300
the tools are common but uh I don't
think they share a lot together but I

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:44.310
think they share a lot together but I
 

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.560

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.060
Android studio for the four Gradle you
can also run your builds your Clips

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:35.070
can also run your builds your Clips
 

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.150
can also run your builds your Clips
builds using the Gradle build and if you

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160
builds using the Gradle build and if you
 

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.200
builds using the Gradle build and if you
look in the export file export you can

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:42.210
look in the export file export you can
 

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:43.910
look in the export file export you can
actually export out of Eclipse you can

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920
actually export out of Eclipse you can
 

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.420
actually export out of Eclipse you can
export your Gradle build file so if you

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:47.430
export your Gradle build file so if you
 

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.420
export your Gradle build file so if you
want to play with Gradle which is a

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:50.430
want to play with Gradle which is a
 

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.010
want to play with Gradle which is a
whole nother discussion that we're not

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:52.020
whole nother discussion that we're not
 

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.830
whole nother discussion that we're not
going to get into a cradle is I would

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:54.840
going to get into a cradle is I would
 

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.600
going to get into a cradle is I would
strongly suggest that you start thinking

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:56.610
strongly suggest that you start thinking
 

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.120
strongly suggest that you start thinking
about Gradle i mentioned that android

00:12:59.120 --> 00:12:59.130
about Gradle i mentioned that android
 

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.580
about Gradle i mentioned that android
studio is not replacing a

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:01.590
studio is not replacing a
 

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:06.890
studio is not replacing a
ET Gradle is replacing aunt so they have

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:06.900
ET Gradle is replacing aunt so they have
 

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.900
ET Gradle is replacing aunt so they have
said that Gradle is their future build

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:08.910
said that Gradle is their future build
 

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:12.590
said that Gradle is their future build
system and that and is deprecated so you

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600
system and that and is deprecated so you
 

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.740
system and that and is deprecated so you
want to start using Gradle and Gradle is

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:15.750
want to start using Gradle and Gradle is
 

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.570
want to start using Gradle and Gradle is
really well designed for and write it

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:17.580
really well designed for and write it
 

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.970
really well designed for and write it
allows you to generate all sorts of

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:19.980
allows you to generate all sorts of
 

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.860
allows you to generate all sorts of
different builds just right from the

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:21.870
different builds just right from the
 

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.850
different builds just right from the
build tool things like that so again i'm

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:25.860
build tool things like that so again i'm
 

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.110
build tool things like that so again i'm
not sure i'd suggest using android

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120
not sure i'd suggest using android
 

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.530
not sure i'd suggest using android
studio I would suggest checking out

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:29.540
studio I would suggest checking out
 

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.940
studio I would suggest checking out
Gradle and trying to come up to speed on

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:31.950
Gradle and trying to come up to speed on
 

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:36.470
Gradle and trying to come up to speed on
that I think that will benefit you one

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480
that I think that will benefit you one
 

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.790
that I think that will benefit you one
really great thing about android studio

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800
really great thing about android studio
 

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.890
really great thing about android studio
is they have a really rich visual editor

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:39.900
is they have a really rich visual editor
 

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.910
is they have a really rich visual editor
so they have a real-time visual editor

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920
so they have a real-time visual editor
 

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.830
so they have a real-time visual editor
that will allow you to make changes in

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:45.840
that will allow you to make changes in
 

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.980
that will allow you to make changes in
your code and look at the changes as

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:48.990
your code and look at the changes as
 

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.550
your code and look at the changes as
they be represented in your UI directly

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560
they be represented in your UI directly
 

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.530
they be represented in your UI directly
so they also have a really rich

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.540
so they also have a really rich
 

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:59.060
so they also have a really rich
drag-and-drop UI builder it's clear that

00:13:59.060 --> 00:13:59.070
drag-and-drop UI builder it's clear that
 

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.610
drag-and-drop UI builder it's clear that
that's like something that you get

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:01.620
that's like something that you get
 

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.910
that's like something that you get
really good out of um Android studio the

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920
really good out of um Android studio the
 

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.200
really good out of um Android studio the
other thing is they have really good

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:06.210
other thing is they have really good
 

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.780
other thing is they have really good
integration with google cloud services I

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:08.790
integration with google cloud services I
 

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.850
integration with google cloud services I
haven't done this myself but what they

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860
haven't done this myself but what they
 

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.330
haven't done this myself but what they
demoed at i/o was you could look at your

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:14.340
demoed at i/o was you could look at your
 

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.670
demoed at i/o was you could look at your
data model right mouse click on the data

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680
data model right mouse click on the data
 

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.550
data model right mouse click on the data
model and generate code that would allow

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560
model and generate code that would allow
 

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.400
model and generate code that would allow
you to create a sink to the Google cloud

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:22.410
you to create a sink to the Google cloud
 

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:26.780
you to create a sink to the Google cloud
services so pretty cool stuff and no

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:26.790
services so pretty cool stuff and no
 

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.390
services so pretty cool stuff and no
doubt Android studio is going to really

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:29.400
doubt Android studio is going to really
 

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.040
doubt Android studio is going to really
keep innovating and we're going to see a

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:31.050
keep innovating and we're going to see a
 

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.900
keep innovating and we're going to see a
lot of movement with Android studio and

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:32.910
lot of movement with Android studio and
 

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.710
lot of movement with Android studio and
not as much as ADT but for now and this

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720
not as much as ADT but for now and this
 

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.920
not as much as ADT but for now and this
is the last bullet it's still an early

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:39.930
is the last bullet it's still an early
 

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:43.070
is the last bullet it's still an early
access preview which means it's alpha

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:43.080
access preview which means it's alpha
 

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.350
access preview which means it's alpha
for the most part not even beta it is

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360
for the most part not even beta it is
 

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.460
for the most part not even beta it is
buggy it is certainly in flux and it is

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:49.470
buggy it is certainly in flux and it is
 

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:54.950
buggy it is certainly in flux and it is
not for the weak of heart so so I think

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:54.960
not for the weak of heart so so I think
 

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.079
not for the weak of heart so so I think

yeah i would suggest using Gradle now

00:15:03.309 --> 00:15:03.319
yeah i would suggest using Gradle now
 

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:08.410
yeah i would suggest using Gradle now
yes I it is stable yes I don't know it's

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:08.420
yes I it is stable yes I don't know it's
 

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.829
yes I it is stable yes I don't know it's
still also pretty dynamic but i would

00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839
still also pretty dynamic but i would
 

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:13.480
still also pretty dynamic but i would
suggest using Gradle now and I do think

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:13.490
suggest using Gradle now and I do think
 

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.960
suggest using Gradle now and I do think
it is stable enough to be production

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:16.970
it is stable enough to be production
 

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.350
it is stable enough to be production
quality there's probably going to be

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.360
quality there's probably going to be
 

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.989
quality there's probably going to be
some features that are implemented yet

00:15:21.989 --> 00:15:21.999
some features that are implemented yet
 

00:15:21.999 --> 00:15:24.910
some features that are implemented yet
but maybe if you're an early adopter you

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:24.920
but maybe if you're an early adopter you
 

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.790
but maybe if you're an early adopter you
can help drive some of those things by

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800
can help drive some of those things by
 

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.989
can help drive some of those things by
communicating those needs and things so

00:15:28.989 --> 00:15:28.999
communicating those needs and things so
 

00:15:28.999 --> 00:15:35.199
communicating those needs and things so
I sir done this is of earlier can I just

00:15:35.199 --> 00:15:35.209
I sir done this is of earlier can I just
 

00:15:35.209 --> 00:15:37.509
I sir done this is of earlier can I just
see a show of hands of how many people

00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519
see a show of hands of how many people
 

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:42.220
see a show of hands of how many people
are active Android developers now great

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:42.230
are active Android developers now great
 

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.530
are active Android developers now great
and how many of you people are really

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:44.540
and how many of you people are really
 

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.210
and how many of you people are really
comfortable with the tools and think you

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:46.220
comfortable with the tools and think you
 

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:57.100
comfortable with the tools and think you
really know how they work okay uh well I

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:57.110
really know how they work okay uh well I
 

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.829
really know how they work okay uh well I
do cover a lot of the basics and I added

00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839
do cover a lot of the basics and I added
 

00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:02.259
do cover a lot of the basics and I added
some some more advanced stuff to this

00:16:02.259 --> 00:16:02.269
some some more advanced stuff to this
 

00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:04.629
some some more advanced stuff to this
presentation so hopefully I will you

00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639
presentation so hopefully I will you
 

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:22.770
presentation so hopefully I will you
know ab stuff of interest to everybody

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:22.780
 

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.720
well yes intellij is an IDE just like

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:27.730
well yes intellij is an IDE just like
 

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.060
well yes intellij is an IDE just like
eclipse so you can do different projects

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:30.070
eclipse so you can do different projects
 

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.570
eclipse so you can do different projects
of all different flavors web projects

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:32.580
of all different flavors web projects

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:49.780
 

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.470
okay so historically if you wanted to

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:53.480
okay so historically if you wanted to
 

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.480
okay so historically if you wanted to
install the Android developer tools you

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:55.490
install the Android developer tools you
 

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.190
install the Android developer tools you
had to download a bunch of different

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:57.200
had to download a bunch of different
 

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.990
had to download a bunch of different
components the plug in the IDE the Java

etc and then wire them all together

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:04.450
etc and then wire them all together
 

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.990
etc and then wire them all together
fortunately this has all gone away and

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:07.000
fortunately this has all gone away and
 

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.350
fortunately this has all gone away and
now they for both Android studio and

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360
now they for both Android studio and
 

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.290
now they for both Android studio and
eclipse there is a downloadable bundle

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:14.300
eclipse there is a downloadable bundle
 

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.090
eclipse there is a downloadable bundle
and this allows you to just download one

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:16.100
and this allows you to just download one
 

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:20.260
and this allows you to just download one
platform specific zip file install it on

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:20.270
platform specific zip file install it on

platform specific zip file install it on
your system and everything works so the

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:23.750
your system and everything works so the

I included this in these slides is

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:26.900
I included this in these slides is
 

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.600
I included this in these slides is
because it's really important if you're

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:28.610
because it's really important if you're
 

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.610
because it's really important if you're
working with an old eclipse if you're

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:30.620
working with an old eclipse if you're
 

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.620
working with an old eclipse if you're
working with an old Android installation

so this is basically a command line tool
and also a communication tool that

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:47.270
and also a communication tool that
 

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.990
and also a communication tool that
allows us to interact with our Android

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000

devices the important thing to note here

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:51.950
devices the important thing to note here
 

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:54.220
devices the important thing to note here
is in android

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:54.230

a Android test device can be an emulator
 

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.180
a Android test device can be an emulator
or it can be an actual physical device

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:58.190
or it can be an actual physical device
 

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.270
or it can be an actual physical device
and for the most part there's not a

and for the most part there's not a
 

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.500
and for the most part there's not a
whole lot of difference between those

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:02.510
whole lot of difference between those
 

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:07.090
whole lot of difference between those
two things so this is one of those cases

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:07.100
two things so this is one of those cases
 

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.820

with a DB is logcat I'm sure you guys
 

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:27.100
with a DB is logcat I'm sure you guys
are all familiar with logcat but i would

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:27.110
are all familiar with logcat but i would
 

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.690

the things that it can do so i just want
to run through a really quick example of

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:32.510
to run through a really quick example of
 

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.810
to run through a really quick example of
some simple stuff in law cat explain how

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:34.820
some simple stuff in law cat explain how
 

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:38.140
some simple stuff in law cat explain how
it works and try some advanced stuff so

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:38.150
it works and try some advanced stuff so
 

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:39.550
it works and try some advanced stuff so
the first thing you can do with law

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:39.560
the first thing you can do with law
 

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.770
the first thing you can do with law
can't log cat has to sort of concepts

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:41.780
can't log cat has to sort of concepts
 

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.430
can't log cat has to sort of concepts
the first concept is a verbosity level

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440
the first concept is a verbosity level
 

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.560
the first concept is a verbosity level
just like you guys I assume you guys

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:47.570
just like you guys I assume you guys
 

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.390
just like you guys I assume you guys
have used log4j where you can set the

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:49.400
have used log4j where you can set the
 

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.280
have used log4j where you can set the
debug level too verbose debug etc warned

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:53.290
debug level too verbose debug etc warned
 

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:55.990
debug level too verbose debug etc warned
that same concept exists in and right so

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000
that same concept exists in and right so
 

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.210
that same concept exists in and right so
you can set when you create a log

00:21:58.210 --> 00:21:58.220
you can set when you create a log
 

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.760
you can set when you create a log
statement so like this one in my java

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:00.770
statement so like this one in my java
 

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:05.560
statement so like this one in my java
class you can set a robo city level in

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:05.570
class you can set a robo city level in
 

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:09.070
class you can set a robo city level in
this case i have d sets of debug but the

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080
this case i have d sets of debug but the
 

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.350
this case i have d sets of debug but the
cool thing about logcat is you can also

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360
cool thing about logcat is you can also
 

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.590
cool thing about logcat is you can also
associate a tag with your log message so

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:14.600
associate a tag with your log message so
 

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.250
associate a tag with your log message so
in this case I have this my tag tag and

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:18.260
in this case I have this my tag tag and
 

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.860
in this case I have this my tag tag and
then the log message what this allows

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:20.870
then the log message what this allows
 

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.950
then the log message what this allows
you to do is you can filter based on the

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960
you to do is you can filter based on the
 

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.110
you to do is you can filter based on the
tags that you create in your code so

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.120
tags that you create in your code so
 

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.600
tags that you create in your code so
generally what you do is when you're

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:28.610
generally what you do is when you're
 

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.450
generally what you do is when you're
writing your code you create tags that

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:31.460
writing your code you create tags that
 

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.460
writing your code you create tags that
are specific to functional areas that

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:33.470
are specific to functional areas that
 

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.130
are specific to functional areas that
you want to test then you can filter

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:36.140
you want to test then you can filter
 

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.200
you want to test then you can filter
based on those tags and see how your

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:38.210
based on those tags and see how your
 

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:39.610
based on those tags and see how your
code progresses through that particular

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:39.620
code progresses through that particular
 

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:45.520
code progresses through that particular
functional area so a quick example this

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:45.530
functional area so a quick example this
 

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:48.970
functional area so a quick example this
is a logcat where I have not performed

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:48.980
is a logcat where I have not performed
 

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.390
is a logcat where I have not performed
any sort of filtering based on it if

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:51.400
any sort of filtering based on it if
 

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.470
any sort of filtering based on it if
again i'm sure you guys had looked at

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.480
again i'm sure you guys had looked at
 

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.200
again i'm sure you guys had looked at
log log cat messages there's a ton of

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:56.210
log log cat messages there's a ton of
 

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.360
log log cat messages there's a ton of
stuff that goes through especially if

00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:58.370
stuff that goes through especially if
 

00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:59.890
stuff that goes through especially if
you're using a real physical device

00:22:59.890 --> 00:22:59.900
you're using a real physical device
 

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.890
you're using a real physical device
there's all sorts of system events

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:02.900
there's all sorts of system events
 

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.260
there's all sorts of system events
happening you want to see what you're

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:05.270
happening you want to see what you're
 

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.480
happening you want to see what you're
looking at you got to look real closely

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:07.490
looking at you got to look real closely
 

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:08.980
looking at you got to look real closely
and got to look real careful so you can

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:08.990
and got to look real careful so you can
 

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.740
and got to look real careful so you can
see I have those tags but you know if I

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:11.750
see I have those tags but you know if I
 

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.060
see I have those tags but you know if I
didn't have them highlighted here they'd

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:13.070
didn't have them highlighted here they'd
 

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.310
didn't have them highlighted here they'd
be pretty hard to figure out where they

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320
be pretty hard to figure out where they
 

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.050
be pretty hard to figure out where they
were

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:16.060
were
 

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.440
were
so all you'll do is if you do want to

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:20.450
so all you'll do is if you do want to
 

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.050
so all you'll do is if you do want to
see the something if you do want to see

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:23.060
see the something if you do want to see
 

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.870
see the something if you do want to see
law cat related to your particular tags

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:25.880
law cat related to your particular tags
 

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.650
law cat related to your particular tags
you just issue a command adb logcat my

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:29.660
you just issue a command adb logcat my
 

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.310
you just issue a command adb logcat my
tag colon 0 then the important second

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320
tag colon 0 then the important second
 

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.760
tag colon 0 then the important second
part of that command is the not call in

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:36.770
part of that command is the not call in
 

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:41.770
part of that command is the not call in
the star I'm sorry so tag colon star the

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:41.780
the star I'm sorry so tag colon star the
 

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.380
the star I'm sorry so tag colon star the
first before the colon that is the tag

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:44.390
first before the colon that is the tag
 

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:48.430
first before the colon that is the tag
that part after the tag is if what

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:48.440
that part after the tag is if what
 

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.530
that part after the tag is if what
verbosity level you want seen so in this

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:50.540
verbosity level you want seen so in this
 

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.690
verbosity level you want seen so in this
case i say i want all verbosity levels

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:52.700
case i say i want all verbosity levels
 

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.690
case i say i want all verbosity levels
for tag and the second important thing

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:55.700
for tag and the second important thing
 

00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:01.300
for tag and the second important thing
is for I want to silence everything else

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:01.310
is for I want to silence everything else
 

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.100
is for I want to silence everything else
so that's what the star call and ask

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:03.110
so that's what the star call and ask
 

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.170
so that's what the star call and ask
means and when I do that you can see

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:05.180
means and when I do that you can see
 

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.110
means and when I do that you can see
that now I can very clearly see exactly

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:08.120
that now I can very clearly see exactly
 

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.940
that now I can very clearly see exactly
what I'm looking for and all the fluff

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:09.950
what I'm looking for and all the fluff
 

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:15.010
what I'm looking for and all the fluff
is gone now that's pretty cool you can

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:15.020
is gone now that's pretty cool you can
 

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.410
is gone now that's pretty cool you can
filter based on a single tag but the

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:17.420
filter based on a single tag but the
 

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.120
filter based on a single tag but the
important thing is you can filter based

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:19.130
important thing is you can filter based
 

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:22.450
important thing is you can filter based
on multiple tags so in this case this

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:22.460
on multiple tags so in this case this
 

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:26.200
on multiple tags so in this case this
example shows I'm 10 I'm filtering based

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:26.210
example shows I'm 10 I'm filtering based
 

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.060
example shows I'm 10 I'm filtering based
on my own unique tag I want to see my

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:28.070
on my own unique tag I want to see my
 

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.250
on my own unique tag I want to see my
tag but I'm also interested in seeing

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:30.260
tag but I'm also interested in seeing
 

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.310
tag but I'm also interested in seeing
how my tag released relates to package

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320
how my tag released relates to package
 

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.790
how my tag released relates to package
manager so basically you create that

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:36.800
manager so basically you create that
 

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.580
manager so basically you create that
command might add colon asterisk package

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:39.590
command might add colon asterisk package
 

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.980
command might add colon asterisk package
manager colon asterix and then don't

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:41.990
manager colon asterix and then don't
 

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.290
manager colon asterix and then don't
forget the asterisk colon asked to

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:44.300
forget the asterisk colon asked to
 

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.970
forget the asterisk colon asked to
silence everything else and you'll see

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:45.980
silence everything else and you'll see
 

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.830
silence everything else and you'll see
now I have just the information about

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840
now I have just the information about
 

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.840
now I have just the information about
the two tags that I'm interested in and

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:49.850
the two tags that I'm interested in and
 

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:52.090
the two tags that I'm interested in and
you could create as many different

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:52.100
you could create as many different
 

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.280
you could create as many different
filter sets as you want you can string

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:54.290
filter sets as you want you can string
 

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.260
filter sets as you want you can string
multiple sets and of course you could

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:56.270
multiple sets and of course you could
 

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.170
multiple sets and of course you could
also filter based on a tag and a

00:24:59.170 --> 00:24:59.180
also filter based on a tag and a
 

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.420
also filter based on a tag and a
verbosity level combined so there's a

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:01.430
verbosity level combined so there's a
 

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.400
verbosity level combined so there's a
ton of flexibility and if you design

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:03.410
ton of flexibility and if you design
 

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.160
ton of flexibility and if you design
your tags if you design your log

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:06.170
your tags if you design your log
 

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.920
your tags if you design your log
messages with these tags in mind it is a

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:08.930
messages with these tags in mind it is a
 

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.630
messages with these tags in mind it is a
indispensable tool when you're trying to

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640
indispensable tool when you're trying to
 

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.550
indispensable tool when you're trying to
debug it allows you to really drill down

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:12.560
debug it allows you to really drill down
 

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.620
debug it allows you to really drill down
to see just the stuff you care about and

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:14.630
to see just the stuff you care about and
 

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:18.530
to see just the stuff you care about and
remove all the other fluff

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:18.540
 

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.690
so that's just basic logcat did some

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:21.700
so that's just basic logcat did some
 

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.810
so that's just basic logcat did some
have a question okay so that's just

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:24.820
have a question okay so that's just
 

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.760
have a question okay so that's just
basic logcat but you can do a whole

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:26.770
basic logcat but you can do a whole
 

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.370
basic logcat but you can do a whole
bunch of other stuff with law cat and I

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:29.380
bunch of other stuff with law cat and I
 

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.520
bunch of other stuff with law cat and I
leave this slide for you guys to drive

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:32.530
leave this slide for you guys to drive
 

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.380
leave this slide for you guys to drive
in your home you could also if you're

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:34.390
in your home you could also if you're
 

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:36.480
in your home you could also if you're
interested in only a particular buffer

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:36.490
interested in only a particular buffer
 

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.630
interested in only a particular buffer
like radio like the radio buffer or the

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:39.640
like radio like the radio buffer or the
 

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.540
like radio like the radio buffer or the
events buffer or the main buffer which

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:42.550
events buffer or the main buffer which
 

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.160
events buffer or the main buffer which
is the default in this case you can

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:44.170
is the default in this case you can
 

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:45.750
is the default in this case you can
specify a particular buffer that you

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760
specify a particular buffer that you
 

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.100
specify a particular buffer that you
want to see so you can filter so you're

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:47.110
want to see so you can filter so you're
 

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.200
want to see so you can filter so you're
only seeing the radio buffer you that's

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:49.210
only seeing the radio buffer you that's
 

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:50.550
only seeing the radio buffer you that's
the only messages you care about

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:50.560
the only messages you care about
 

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.680
the only messages you care about
obviously that depends on the type of

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:52.690
obviously that depends on the type of
 

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.200
obviously that depends on the type of
code you're writing there's also a

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:55.210
code you're writing there's also a
 

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.990
code you're writing there's also a
variety of predefined output formats so

00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000
variety of predefined output formats so
 

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.810
variety of predefined output formats so
brief is the default and that specifies

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:03.820
brief is the default and that specifies
 

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.540
brief is the default and that specifies
different parameters that will be output

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:06.550
different parameters that will be output
 

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:09.210
different parameters that will be output
but time is a really useful one that

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:09.220
but time is a really useful one that
 

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.700
but time is a really useful one that
appends a time which isn't in the basic

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:11.710
appends a time which isn't in the basic
 

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:16.170
appends a time which isn't in the basic
log functionality so and again you can

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:16.180
log functionality so and again you can
 

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.350
log functionality so and again you can
add these command lines these

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360
add these command lines these
 

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.000
add these command lines these
command-line arguments in addition to

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:21.010
command-line arguments in addition to
 

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:23.010
command-line arguments in addition to
the tags so as you can see there's a

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:23.020
the tags so as you can see there's a
 

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.420
the tags so as you can see there's a
really rich rich set of logcat

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:26.430
really rich rich set of logcat
 

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:30.060
really rich rich set of logcat
functionality the last thing I'm not

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:30.070
functionality the last thing I'm not
 

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.890
functionality the last thing I'm not
going to demo but is really worth

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:31.900
going to demo but is really worth
 

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:36.150
going to demo but is really worth
exploring is the logcat tab in Eclipse

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:36.160
exploring is the logcat tab in Eclipse
 

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.300
exploring is the logcat tab in Eclipse
this allows you to save a bunch of

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:39.310
this allows you to save a bunch of
 

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:41.970
this allows you to save a bunch of
filter sets and tag sets if so you don't

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:41.980
filter sets and tag sets if so you don't
 

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.650
filter sets and tag sets if so you don't
have to type them every time you can

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:43.660
have to type them every time you can
 

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.590
have to type them every time you can
actually save a tag set and click on it

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:46.600
actually save a tag set and click on it
 

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.290
actually save a tag set and click on it
and it will filter based on that it and

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:49.300
and it will filter based on that it and
 

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.410
and it will filter based on that it and
the other really cool thing that the law

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:52.420
the other really cool thing that the law
 

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.870
the other really cool thing that the law
cab viewer in Eclipse has is a reg ex

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880
cab viewer in Eclipse has is a reg ex
 

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.270
cab viewer in Eclipse has is a reg ex
editor so you can actually search your

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:57.280
editor so you can actually search your
 

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:02.030
editor so you can actually search your
logs using regular expressions which

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:02.040
logs using regular expressions which
 

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.570
logs using regular expressions which
again is really rich so as developers

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:05.580
again is really rich so as developers
 

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.720
again is really rich so as developers
i'm sure you guys i'll realize that logs

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:09.730
i'm sure you guys i'll realize that logs
 

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.700
i'm sure you guys i'll realize that logs
are really important especially when

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:11.710
are really important especially when
 

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:13.170
are really important especially when
you're in the midst of trying to figure

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:13.180
you're in the midst of trying to figure
 

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.080
you're in the midst of trying to figure
something out and lock at really allows

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:16.090
something out and lock at really allows
 

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:19.080
something out and lock at really allows
you to get at exactly what what you want

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:19.090
you to get at exactly what what you want
 

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:21.480
you to get at exactly what what you want
to see

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:21.490
 

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:27.010
good okay so that's logcat let's now

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:27.020
good okay so that's logcat let's now
 

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:31.600
good okay so that's logcat let's now
talk a little bit about emulators I want

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:31.610
talk a little bit about emulators I want
 

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:32.950
talk a little bit about emulators I want
to address first of all some of the

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960
to address first of all some of the
 

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.430
to address first of all some of the
capabilities of emulators and then we'll

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.440
capabilities of emulators and then we'll
 

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.980
capabilities of emulators and then we'll
talk about some of the limitations first

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:38.990
talk about some of the limitations first
 

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:40.840
talk about some of the limitations first
thing you can do with an emulator is you

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:40.850
thing you can do with an emulator is you
 

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:42.810
thing you can do with an emulator is you
can simulate telephony so you can

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:42.820
can simulate telephony so you can
 

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:46.320
can simulate telephony so you can
simulate latency or connectivity or

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:46.330
simulate latency or connectivity or
 

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.480
simulate latency or connectivity or
simulate events as in SMS or a phone

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:49.490
simulate events as in SMS or a phone
 

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.370
simulate events as in SMS or a phone
call you can't actually make a phone

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:51.380
call you can't actually make a phone
 

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.549
call you can't actually make a phone
call but you can simulate a phone call

00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:53.559
call but you can simulate a phone call
 

00:27:53.559 --> 00:27:56.580
call but you can simulate a phone call
you can simulate location including a

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:56.590
you can simulate location including a
 

00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:01.659
you can simulate location including a
KML or a path you can specify a single

00:28:01.659 --> 00:28:01.669
KML or a path you can specify a single
 

00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:05.080
KML or a path you can specify a single
location that your emulator is supposed

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:05.090
location that your emulator is supposed
 

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:08.350
location that your emulator is supposed
to emulate you can emulate a variety of

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:08.360
to emulate you can emulate a variety of
 

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.090
to emulate you can emulate a variety of
different hardware now that's the

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:10.100
different hardware now that's the
 

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.380
different hardware now that's the
important thing and the reason why we

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:11.390
important thing and the reason why we
 

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:15.370
important thing and the reason why we
want to use an emulator is there's a lot

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:15.380
want to use an emulator is there's a lot
 

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.649
want to use an emulator is there's a lot
of Android devices in this world I think

00:28:17.649 --> 00:28:17.659
of Android devices in this world I think
 

00:28:17.659 --> 00:28:19.750
of Android devices in this world I think
the last time i looked at my droid of

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760
the last time i looked at my droid of
 

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.700
the last time i looked at my droid of
the day console that my app currently

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:21.710
the day console that my app currently
 

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:26.639
the day console that my app currently
supports like 3,000 different devices

00:28:26.639 --> 00:28:26.649
 

00:28:26.649 --> 00:28:29.230
even if i was really really rich i

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:29.240
even if i was really really rich i
 

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.580
even if i was really really rich i
wouldn't be able to purchase all three

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:30.590
wouldn't be able to purchase all three
 

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.850
wouldn't be able to purchase all three
thousand of those devices to test with

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:32.860
thousand of those devices to test with
 

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.740
thousand of those devices to test with
so using an emulator allows me to

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:35.750
so using an emulator allows me to
 

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.710
so using an emulator allows me to
simulate a variety of different hardware

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:37.720
simulate a variety of different hardware
 

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.149
simulate a variety of different hardware
configurations so that i can at least

00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159
configurations so that i can at least
 

00:28:40.159 --> 00:28:42.519
configurations so that i can at least
get close and now for the most part now

00:28:42.519 --> 00:28:42.529
get close and now for the most part now
 

00:28:42.529 --> 00:28:45.039
get close and now for the most part now
there are some limitations i guess which

00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:45.049
there are some limitations i guess which
 

00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:47.730
there are some limitations i guess which
we'll get to in a second on emulators

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:47.740
we'll get to in a second on emulators
 

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:52.070
we'll get to in a second on emulators
good

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080
 

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.090
Isis

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:55.100
 

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.789
so the question was if you want to

00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:57.799
so the question was if you want to
 

00:28:57.799 --> 00:29:00.700
so the question was if you want to
emulate different resolutions of devices

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:00.710
emulate different resolutions of devices
 

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.360
emulate different resolutions of devices
can you do that and how accurate is it

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:03.370
can you do that and how accurate is it
 

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:06.190
can you do that and how accurate is it
that you absolutely can do you can

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:06.200
that you absolutely can do you can
 

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.110
that you absolutely can do you can
actually i'll show you in a second when

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120
actually i'll show you in a second when
 

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.490
actually i'll show you in a second when
we're setting when i show you how you

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:09.500
we're setting when i show you how you
 

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:14.279
we're setting when i show you how you
set up an ABD you can specify preset

00:29:14.279 --> 00:29:14.289
set up an ABD you can specify preset
 

00:29:14.289 --> 00:29:16.900
set up an ABD you can specify preset
resolutions or you can actually create

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:16.910
resolutions or you can actually create
 

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:20.200
resolutions or you can actually create
your own so for resolution you

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:20.210
your own so for resolution you
 

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:24.720
your own so for resolution you
absolutely can emulate it exactly right

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:24.730
absolutely can emulate it exactly right
 

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.279
absolutely can emulate it exactly right
what you can't do it we'll get to in a

00:29:27.279 --> 00:29:27.289
what you can't do it we'll get to in a
 

00:29:27.289 --> 00:29:29.140
what you can't do it we'll get to in a
second what you can't do is emulate the

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:29.150
second what you can't do is emulate the
 

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.419
second what you can't do is emulate the
skins that the manufacturers put on

00:29:31.419 --> 00:29:31.429
skins that the manufacturers put on
 

00:29:31.429 --> 00:29:34.750
skins that the manufacturers put on
their devices so TouchWiz motoblur I

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:34.760
their devices so TouchWiz motoblur I
 

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.860
their devices so TouchWiz motoblur I
guess I don't know if that exists

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:35.870
guess I don't know if that exists
 

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.789
guess I don't know if that exists
anymore but a TouchWiz or LG skin those

00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:39.799
anymore but a TouchWiz or LG skin those
 

00:29:39.799 --> 00:29:48.370
anymore but a TouchWiz or LG skin those
you cannot emulate in a emulator well

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:48.380
you cannot emulate in a emulator well
 

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.560
you cannot emulate in a emulator well
actually that's now a little different

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:50.570
actually that's now a little different
 

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.990
actually that's now a little different
thing so the question was there's a

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.000
thing so the question was there's a
 

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.539
thing so the question was there's a
process that you can use with the Nexus

00:29:55.539 --> 00:29:55.549
process that you can use with the Nexus
 

00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:59.560
process that you can use with the Nexus
10 using adb you can actually have the

00:29:59.560 --> 00:29:59.570
10 using adb you can actually have the
 

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:03.730
10 using adb you can actually have the
nexus 10 emulate different resolution

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:03.740
nexus 10 emulate different resolution
 

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:07.140
nexus 10 emulate different resolution
resolution sizes using us some commands

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:07.150
resolution sizes using us some commands
 

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:09.460
resolution sizes using us some commands
that so the question was is is that a

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:09.470
that so the question was is is that a
 

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:11.710
that so the question was is is that a
better approach or is using an emulator

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:11.720
better approach or is using an emulator
 

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.600
better approach or is using an emulator
better approach and the answer is it

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:13.610
better approach and the answer is it
 

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:24.540
better approach and the answer is it
depends good

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:24.550
 

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:29.820
it is lat long it takes lat long KML and

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:29.830
it is lat long it takes lat long KML and
 

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:36.090
it is lat long it takes lat long KML and
one other type of format of um I can't

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:36.100
one other type of format of um I can't
 

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:45.380
one other type of format of um I can't
think in the third deep GPX is that I

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:45.390
 

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:49.039
what is it

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:49.049
 

00:30:49.049 --> 00:30:51.989
okay there's three types i'm not sure if

00:30:51.989 --> 00:30:51.999
okay there's three types i'm not sure if
 

00:30:51.999 --> 00:31:03.170
okay there's three types i'm not sure if
the third uh yes

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:03.180
 

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:07.810
the question is does the arm ambulation

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:07.820
the question is does the arm ambulation
 

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.070
the question is does the arm ambulation
basically does it perform the same as a

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080
basically does it perform the same as a
 

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:22.460
basically does it perform the same as a
real arm phone is that your question

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:22.470
 

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:26.060
so the question is does the emulator

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:26.070
so the question is does the emulator
 

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:31.430
so the question is does the emulator
perform the same as a device I think I'm

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440
perform the same as a device I think I'm
 

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.730
perform the same as a device I think I'm
going to but the answer is no definitely

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:34.740
going to but the answer is no definitely
 

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.820
going to but the answer is no definitely
not if you're doing really performance

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:37.830
not if you're doing really performance
 

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:39.830
not if you're doing really performance
testing you probably want to use a real

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840
testing you probably want to use a real
 

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.020
testing you probably want to use a real
device there's so many variables in an

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:42.030
device there's so many variables in an
 

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.180
device there's so many variables in an
emulator both the device the physical

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:44.190
emulator both the device the physical
 

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:47.060
emulator both the device the physical
device it's on your computer how many

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:47.070
device it's on your computer how many
 

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:48.740
device it's on your computer how many
other things that's working on etc etc

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:48.750
other things that's working on etc etc
 

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:51.110
other things that's working on etc etc
the performance is not going to be

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120
the performance is not going to be
 

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.149
the performance is not going to be
accurate to what you would see on a real

00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159
accurate to what you would see on a real
 

00:31:53.159 --> 00:32:08.500
accurate to what you would see on a real
device so

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:08.510
 

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:12.920
so the comment is in addition to AMD you

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:12.930
so the comment is in addition to AMD you
 

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.950
so the comment is in addition to AMD you
also may want to test using the Intel

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960
also may want to test using the Intel
 

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.350
also may want to test using the Intel
chipset because there are Intel phones

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360
chipset because there are Intel phones
 

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.150
chipset because there are Intel phones
around and I'm actually going to discuss

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:20.160
around and I'm actually going to discuss
 

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.650
around and I'm actually going to discuss
that in a second because there's other

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:21.660
that in a second because there's other
 

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:25.240
that in a second because there's other
advantages in addition to just emulating

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:25.250
advantages in addition to just emulating
 

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:28.040
advantages in addition to just emulating
Intel chipsets so I am actually going to

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:28.050
Intel chipsets so I am actually going to
 

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:31.070
Intel chipsets so I am actually going to
touch that in a second last thing you

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080
touch that in a second last thing you
 

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:35.120
touch that in a second last thing you
can do with emulator is you can do media

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:35.130
can do with emulator is you can do media
 

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.970
can do with emulator is you can do media
actions but only audio not video you

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:37.980
actions but only audio not video you
 

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.580
actions but only audio not video you
cannot do video on a emulator some of

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:40.590
cannot do video on a emulator some of
 

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:42.740
cannot do video on a emulator some of
the limitations of things you cannot do

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:42.750
the limitations of things you cannot do
 

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:46.460
the limitations of things you cannot do
on a emulator include Google services

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:46.470
on a emulator include Google services
 

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:49.850
on a emulator include Google services
like Gmail or the Play Store things like

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:49.860
like Gmail or the Play Store things like
 

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.760
like Gmail or the Play Store things like
that you can now there are ways to hack

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:52.770
that you can now there are ways to hack
 

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:57.020
that you can now there are ways to hack
that onto the emulator so there are ways

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:57.030
that onto the emulator so there are ways
 

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:59.570
that onto the emulator so there are ways
to work around this issue but out of the

00:32:59.570 --> 00:32:59.580
to work around this issue but out of the
 

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.510
to work around this issue but out of the
box it is not designed to run Play

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:02.520
box it is not designed to run Play
 

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:06.260
box it is not designed to run Play
services and I think there's obstacles

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:06.270
services and I think there's obstacles
 

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.000
services and I think there's obstacles
and there will continue to be obstacles

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:08.010
and there will continue to be obstacles
 

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:09.200
and there will continue to be obstacles
they don't they don't want that on

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:09.210
they don't they don't want that on
 

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:12.620
they don't they don't want that on
ambulator you can't make real phone

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:12.630
ambulator you can't make real phone
 

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:13.820
ambulator you can't make real phone
calls I think we already kind of

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:13.830
calls I think we already kind of
 

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:17.240
calls I think we already kind of
discussed that certain graphics support

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:17.250
discussed that certain graphics support
 

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:18.620
discussed that certain graphics support
again this is getting back to kind of

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:18.630
again this is getting back to kind of
 

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.330
again this is getting back to kind of
what we were discussing before the

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:20.340
what we were discussing before the
 

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.190
what we were discussing before the
performance is not the same so if you're

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200
performance is not the same so if you're
 

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.970
performance is not the same so if you're
doing a game or something that requires

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:24.980
doing a game or something that requires
 

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:28.820
doing a game or something that requires
very precise graphics performance the

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:28.830
very precise graphics performance the
 

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.590
very precise graphics performance the
emulator is probably not the right place

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600
emulator is probably not the right place
 

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.440
emulator is probably not the right place
for you to be testing testing your your

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:33.450
for you to be testing testing your your
 

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:36.410
for you to be testing testing your your
functionality the other thing that's

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:36.420
functionality the other thing that's
 

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.070
functionality the other thing that's
limited on a emulator is touch events

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.080
limited on a emulator is touch events
 

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.600
limited on a emulator is touch events
you have a mouse to interact with your

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:41.610
you have a mouse to interact with your
 

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:45.470
you have a mouse to interact with your
device so multi-touch or certain other

device so multi-touch or certain other
 

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:49.580
device so multi-touch or certain other
operations are limited you just can't

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:49.590
operations are limited you just can't
 

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:52.480
operations are limited you just can't
can't I can't do that

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:52.490
can't I can't do that

multi

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:00.540
 

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:05.220
so yeah so the question is using either

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:05.230
so yeah so the question is using either
 

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:09.290
so yeah so the question is using either
Vidya a touchscreen monitor or a

will they support multitouch in the

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:14.020
will they support multitouch in the
 

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.800
will they support multitouch in the
future I don't know the answer to what

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:16.810
future I don't know the answer to what
 

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:17.790

they're going to support the future

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:17.800
they're going to support the future
 

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:21.840
they're going to support the future
there is a adb bridge that allows you to

integration you can use USB and

00:34:59.490 --> 00:34:59.500
integration you can use USB and

integration you can use USB and
headphones and the other big limitation

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:04.450
headphones and the other big limitation
 

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:08.070
headphones and the other big limitation
of emulators is they're really slow slow

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:08.080
of emulators is they're really slow slow
 

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.200
of emulators is they're really slow slow
to start they can be slow to deploy too

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:10.210
to start they can be slow to deploy too
 

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:14.099

going to show you some tips on how you

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:15.460
going to show you some tips on how you
 

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.080
going to show you some tips on how you
speed it up but again I'm sure everybody

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:19.090
speed it up but again I'm sure everybody
 

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:21.810
speed it up but again I'm sure everybody
in here knows when you start your

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:21.820
in here knows when you start your
 

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.430
in here knows when you start your
emulator it's time to go grab a cup of

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440
emulator it's time to go grab a cup of
 

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.370
emulator it's time to go grab a cup of
coffee or you know go check out Facebook

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:26.380
coffee or you know go check out Facebook
 

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.540
coffee or you know go check out Facebook
or whatever because you're going to be

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:27.550
or whatever because you're going to be
 

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.660
or whatever because you're going to be
waiting you know it can take three

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:30.670
waiting you know it can take three
 

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:35.550
waiting you know it can take three
minutes for an emulator to start up okay

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:35.560
minutes for an emulator to start up okay
 

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:40.180
minutes for an emulator to start up okay
yeah go ahead

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:40.190
 

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:43.220
so the question is is it possible to

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:43.230
so the question is is it possible to
 

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.290
so the question is is it possible to
emulate bluetooth I don't know the

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:45.300
emulate bluetooth I don't know the
 

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:50.390
emulate bluetooth I don't know the
answer to that I would suspect not

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400
answer to that I would suspect not
 

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.900
answer to that I would suspect not
because that mmm I don't know as we say

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:53.910
because that mmm I don't know as we say
 

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:55.640
because that mmm I don't know as we say
because you're the computer hardware

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:55.650
because you're the computer hardware
 

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.860
because you're the computer hardware
would require bluetooth of course most

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:57.870
would require bluetooth of course most
 

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:00.560
would require bluetooth of course most
computers now have bluetooth so I don't

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:00.570
computers now have bluetooth so I don't
 

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:01.820
computers now have bluetooth so I don't
know if you can emulate Bluetooth that's

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:01.830
know if you can emulate Bluetooth that's
 

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:11.380
know if you can emulate Bluetooth that's
good question that you get the first

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:11.390
 

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:15.039
alright so as I mentioned there's lots

00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:15.049
alright so as I mentioned there's lots
 

00:36:15.049 --> 00:36:16.509
alright so as I mentioned there's lots
and lots of Android devices in this

00:36:16.509 --> 00:36:16.519
and lots of Android devices in this
 

00:36:16.519 --> 00:36:19.359
and lots of Android devices in this
world you know every device on this

00:36:19.359 --> 00:36:19.369
world you know every device on this
 

00:36:19.369 --> 00:36:23.109
world you know every device on this
screen it runs Android and or at these

00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119
screen it runs Android and or at these
 

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:25.779
screen it runs Android and or at these
interfaces with Android so it's really

00:36:25.779 --> 00:36:25.789
interfaces with Android so it's really
 

00:36:25.789 --> 00:36:28.359
interfaces with Android so it's really
important that you understand emulators

00:36:28.359 --> 00:36:28.369
important that you understand emulators
 

00:36:28.369 --> 00:36:30.640
important that you understand emulators
and understand how you can use them so

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:30.650
and understand how you can use them so
 

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:34.420
and understand how you can use them so
that you can be able to test on the

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:34.430
that you can be able to test on the
 

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.839
that you can be able to test on the
biggest variety of devices possible I

00:36:36.839 --> 00:36:36.849
biggest variety of devices possible I
 

00:36:36.849 --> 00:36:38.829
biggest variety of devices possible I
think in a professional world this

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839
think in a professional world this
 

00:36:38.839 --> 00:36:41.589
think in a professional world this
doesn't excuse you not having a variety

00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599
doesn't excuse you not having a variety
 

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:44.700
doesn't excuse you not having a variety
of actual devices to test on but

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:44.710
of actual devices to test on but
 

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:47.589
of actual devices to test on but
emulators will get you a good distance

00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599
emulators will get you a good distance
 

00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:52.630
emulators will get you a good distance
of the way so let's talk for real quick

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640
of the way so let's talk for real quick
 

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.970
of the way so let's talk for real quick
we'll take a quick diversion let's say

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:54.980
we'll take a quick diversion let's say
 

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.519
we'll take a quick diversion let's say
that you don't want to use an emulator

00:36:56.519 --> 00:36:56.529
that you don't want to use an emulator
 

00:36:56.529 --> 00:37:01.480
that you don't want to use an emulator
you can use almost any Android device as

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:01.490
you can use almost any Android device as
 

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:04.150
you can use almost any Android device as
a test device there may be very few

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160
a test device there may be very few
 

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.490
a test device there may be very few
exceptions but for the most part any

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:06.500
exceptions but for the most part any
 

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.589
exceptions but for the most part any
Android device works as a test device

00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599
Android device works as a test device
 

00:37:08.599 --> 00:37:11.109
Android device works as a test device
the only thing you need to do is enable

00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119
the only thing you need to do is enable
 

00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:14.289
the only thing you need to do is enable
this check box in your device settings

00:37:14.289 --> 00:37:14.299
this check box in your device settings
 

00:37:14.299 --> 00:37:17.019
this check box in your device settings
app so basically you just need to allow

00:37:17.019 --> 00:37:17.029
app so basically you just need to allow
 

00:37:17.029 --> 00:37:21.759
app so basically you just need to allow
your device to run applications from

00:37:21.759 --> 00:37:21.769
your device to run applications from
 

00:37:21.769 --> 00:37:23.589
your device to run applications from
outside of the Play Store and you can

00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599
outside of the Play Store and you can
 

00:37:23.599 --> 00:37:25.900
outside of the Play Store and you can
run any app you want on your Android

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:25.910
run any app you want on your Android
 

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.980
run any app you want on your Android
device I'm sure there are some maybe I

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:28.990
device I'm sure there are some maybe I
 

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:32.200
device I'm sure there are some maybe I
assume probably Kindle Fire doesn't

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:32.210
assume probably Kindle Fire doesn't
 

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:33.940
assume probably Kindle Fire doesn't
allow you to do that some other things

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:33.950
allow you to do that some other things
 

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:36.849
allow you to do that some other things
but for the most part any device is

00:37:36.849 --> 00:37:36.859
but for the most part any device is
 

00:37:36.859 --> 00:37:41.920
but for the most part any device is
available now the challenge is after OS

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:41.930
available now the challenge is after OS
 

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:45.460

step one step two that you're probably
also going to want to do is good okay

00:37:58.660 --> 00:37:58.670
also going to want to do is good okay
 

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:01.779
also going to want to do is good okay
great so the allowing apps from non Play

00:38:01.779 --> 00:38:01.789
great so the allowing apps from non Play
 

00:38:01.789 --> 00:38:03.519
great so the allowing apps from non Play
Store is not hidden in the developer

00:38:03.519 --> 00:38:03.529
Store is not hidden in the developer
 

00:38:03.529 --> 00:38:06.190
Store is not hidden in the developer

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.330
click 7 click 7 times 6 times 5 times 4
times I'm not sure but I think that

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:55.340
times I'm not sure but I think that
 

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:58.120
times I'm not sure but I think that
might move actually what you have to

00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:58.130
might move actually what you have to
 

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.910
might move actually what you have to
click but basically I thought I might

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:00.920
click but basically I thought I might
 

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:09.330
click but basically I thought I might
have had to click the build for KitKat

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:09.340
 

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:15.130
okay okay good so anyway that's what you

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:15.140
okay okay good so anyway that's what you
 

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.160
okay okay good so anyway that's what you
want to do now the cool thing is

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:17.170
want to do now the cool thing is
 

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:18.910
want to do now the cool thing is
basically what I just told you is how

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:18.920
basically what I just told you is how
 

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.380
basically what I just told you is how
you can use your phone as a test device

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:20.390
you can use your phone as a test device
 

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:23.890
you can use your phone as a test device
but the developer options that I just

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:23.900
but the developer options that I just
 

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.710
but the developer options that I just
showed you how to enable have a ton of

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720
showed you how to enable have a ton of
 

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.950
showed you how to enable have a ton of
really great functionality in them in it

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960
really great functionality in them in it
 

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.050
really great functionality in them in it
and it's all based on testing on your

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:32.060
and it's all based on testing on your
 

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:35.890
and it's all based on testing on your
device itself so obviously USB debugging

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:35.900
device itself so obviously USB debugging
 

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:38.440
device itself so obviously USB debugging
allows you to hook a USB device into

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:38.450
allows you to hook a USB device into
 

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:41.110
allows you to hook a USB device into
your phone that's pretty normal but the

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:41.120
your phone that's pretty normal but the
 

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.060
your phone that's pretty normal but the
other things you can do in there and I

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:43.070
other things you can do in there and I
 

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:45.550
other things you can do in there and I
really encourage you guys to go look in

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:45.560
really encourage you guys to go look in
 

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.140
really encourage you guys to go look in
the developer options and just start

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:47.150
the developer options and just start
 

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:49.840
the developer options and just start
playing with these things are allowing

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:49.850
playing with these things are allowing
 

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:51.610
playing with these things are allowing
mock locations so that allows you to

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:51.620
mock locations so that allows you to
 

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.650
mock locations so that allows you to
specify you know some of the locations

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:53.660
specify you know some of the locations
 

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.810
specify you know some of the locations
we were just talking about strict mode

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:55.820
we were just talking about strict mode
 

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.450
we were just talking about strict mode
allows you to flash your phone it

00:39:58.450 --> 00:39:58.460
allows you to flash your phone it
 

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.850
allows you to flash your phone it
flashes your phone red when you're doing

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:00.860
flashes your phone red when you're doing
 

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.160
flashes your phone red when you're doing
operations on the main UI thread which

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:03.170
operations on the main UI thread which
 

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:05.530
operations on the main UI thread which
as good android developers you know you

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:05.540
as good android developers you know you
 

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:07.420
as good android developers you know you
never want to do long-running operations

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:07.430
never want to do long-running operations
 

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:10.060
never want to do long-running operations
on the UI thread so there's just a check

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:10.070
on the UI thread so there's just a check
 

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:12.400
on the UI thread so there's just a check
box there that allows you to quickly see

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:12.410
box there that allows you to quickly see
 

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.380
box there that allows you to quickly see
and it's really obvious in fact i run

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:14.390
and it's really obvious in fact i run
 

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:15.970
and it's really obvious in fact i run
this all the time on i have strict mode

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:15.980
this all the time on i have strict mode
 

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.620
this all the time on i have strict mode
enabled on my device all the time and

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:17.630
enabled on my device all the time and
 

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:19.720
enabled on my device all the time and
it's interesting to see how many you

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:19.730
it's interesting to see how many you
 

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:22.600
it's interesting to see how many you
know apps are being bad but as a

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:22.610
know apps are being bad but as a
 

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:24.670
know apps are being bad but as a
developer it's really great for you to

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680
developer it's really great for you to
 

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.380
developer it's really great for you to
be able to see when your app is being

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:26.390
be able to see when your app is being
 

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:29.020
be able to see when your app is being
bad and it's really in your face you can

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:29.030
bad and it's really in your face you can
 

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.760
bad and it's really in your face you can
show touches so if you're doing a

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:30.770
show touches so if you're doing a
 

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:32.860
show touches so if you're doing a
presentation or something that will

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:32.870
presentation or something that will
 

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:33.760
presentation or something that will
highlight the

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:33.770
highlight the
 

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:36.190
highlight the
touch points you're pressing on your

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.200
touch points you're pressing on your
 

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.930
touch points you're pressing on your
device you can't change the animation

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:37.940
device you can't change the animation
 

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.930
device you can't change the animation
and transition scale so that you can get

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:40.940
and transition scale so that you can get
 

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.660
and transition scale so that you can get
a closer look at the you know animations

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:43.670
a closer look at the you know animations
 

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:44.920
a closer look at the you know animations
that you're using and if you're

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:44.930
that you're using and if you're
 

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:48.910
that you're using and if you're
debugging those you can also select and

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:48.920
debugging those you can also select and
 

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:51.040
debugging those you can also select and
this is just a small list there's a lot

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:51.050
this is just a small list there's a lot
 

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.490
this is just a small list there's a lot
of stuff in there you can also one don't

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:54.500
of stuff in there you can also one don't
 

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:58.060
of stuff in there you can also one don't
keep activities so this will kill the

00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:58.070
keep activities so this will kill the
 

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:00.040
keep activities so this will kill the
activity as soon as it closes which

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:00.050
activity as soon as it closes which
 

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:02.290
activity as soon as it closes which
allows you to mess with state if you're

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:02.300
allows you to mess with state if you're
 

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.600
allows you to mess with state if you're
you know doing particular particular

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:04.610
you know doing particular particular
 

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:07.450
you know doing particular particular
operations so the developer tools are

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:07.460
operations so the developer tools are
 

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.190
operations so the developer tools are
really the developer options that are on

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200
really the developer options that are on
 

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.520
really the developer options that are on
the phone are really really rich and

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:11.530
the phone are really really rich and
 

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:14.470
the phone are really really rich and
something that most people don't use but

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480
something that most people don't use but
 

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.060
something that most people don't use but
something that you should and they're

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:16.070
something that you should and they're
 

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:17.830
something that you should and they're
really low risk to play let's just go

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:17.840
really low risk to play let's just go
 

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.200
really low risk to play let's just go
enable your phone go start playing with

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:20.210
enable your phone go start playing with
 

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:21.610
enable your phone go start playing with
those things for your I mean you're not

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:21.620
those things for your I mean you're not
 

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.170
those things for your I mean you're not
going to mess anything up basically

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:23.180
going to mess anything up basically
 

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:25.090
going to mess anything up basically
these are just visual cues and things

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:25.100
these are just visual cues and things
 

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.760
these are just visual cues and things
but I think you'll learn a lot running

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:27.770
but I think you'll learn a lot running
 

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:29.650
but I think you'll learn a lot running
your app and enabling some of these

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:29.660
your app and enabling some of these
 

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:33.700
your app and enabling some of these
different developer options okay so

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:33.710
different developer options okay so
 

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:36.340
different developer options okay so
remember all these devices and remember

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:36.350
remember all these devices and remember
 

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:38.320
remember all these devices and remember
that we can particularly that we can't

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:38.330
that we can particularly that we can't
 

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:42.370
that we can particularly that we can't
possibly afford to buy them all let's

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:42.380
possibly afford to buy them all let's
 

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:43.630
possibly afford to buy them all let's
say that we just want to concentrate on

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:43.640
say that we just want to concentrate on
 

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.000
say that we just want to concentrate on
that top little area at the phones and

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:46.010
that top little area at the phones and
 

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.550
that top little area at the phones and
tablets that's when we really want to

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560
tablets that's when we really want to
 

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.010
tablets that's when we really want to
start talking about using emulators to

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:51.020
start talking about using emulators to
 

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.930
start talking about using emulators to
emulate some of these different physical

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:52.940
emulate some of these different physical
 

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:56.230
emulate some of these different physical
devices and so I want to go ahead and

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240
devices and so I want to go ahead and
 

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.910
devices and so I want to go ahead and
talk a little bit about how you set up

00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920
talk a little bit about how you set up
 

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.440
talk a little bit about how you set up
an emulator some of the different

00:41:59.440 --> 00:41:59.450
an emulator some of the different
 

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.050
an emulator some of the different
options you have and also how we go

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:02.060
options you have and also how we go
 

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.390
options you have and also how we go
about speeding up emulator thing like

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400
about speeding up emulator thing like
 

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.110
about speeding up emulator thing like
things like that okay so the first step

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:08.120
things like that okay so the first step
 

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.880
things like that okay so the first step
you want to do when you're creating an

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:09.890
you want to do when you're creating an
 

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:12.850
you want to do when you're creating an
emulator is I you're going to create

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:12.860
emulator is I you're going to create
 

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.500
emulator is I you're going to create
something called an Android virtual

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:14.510
something called an Android virtual
 

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:18.060
something called an Android virtual
device so this is basically just a

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:18.070
device so this is basically just a
 

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:21.370
device so this is basically just a
representation of the physical device

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:21.380
representation of the physical device
 

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.200
representation of the physical device
that allows you to specify a variety of

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:23.210
that allows you to specify a variety of
 

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:25.330
that allows you to specify a variety of
different things that you want your

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:25.340
different things that you want your
 

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.080
different things that you want your
particular emulator to look like so

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:28.090
particular emulator to look like so
 

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:31.060
particular emulator to look like so
you'll notice I you know in this case I

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:31.070
you'll notice I you know in this case I
 

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:34.960
you'll notice I you know in this case I
have it emulating a Galaxy Nexus I can

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:34.970
have it emulating a Galaxy Nexus I can
 

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:37.960
have it emulating a Galaxy Nexus I can
specify which particular OS I want to

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:37.970
specify which particular OS I want to
 

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:41.590
specify which particular OS I want to
target I can specify which particular

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:41.600
target I can specify which particular
 

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.830
target I can specify which particular
CPU I want to target currently you can

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:44.840
CPU I want to target currently you can
 

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.260
CPU I want to target currently you can
select between

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:46.270
select between
 

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:57.660
select between
arm Intel and a third nips you can

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:57.670
arm Intel and a third nips you can
 

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.610
arm Intel and a third nips you can
specify hardware keyboard things like

00:42:59.610 --> 00:42:59.620
specify hardware keyboard things like
 

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.370
specify hardware keyboard things like
that if it has a camera if it doesn't

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:02.380
that if it has a camera if it doesn't
 

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:06.240
that if it has a camera if it doesn't
have a camera memory footprint and you

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:06.250
have a camera memory footprint and you
 

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:11.190
have a camera memory footprint and you
can also specify you know SD card things

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200
can also specify you know SD card things
 

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.490
can also specify you know SD card things
like that now there's a couple options

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:14.500
like that now there's a couple options
 

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.680
like that now there's a couple options
at the bottom that I want to

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:16.690
at the bottom that I want to
 

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:18.510
at the bottom that I want to
particularly call out because they are

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:18.520
particularly call out because they are
 

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.890
particularly call out because they are
particularly useful and particularly

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:19.900
particularly useful and particularly
 

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:22.410
particularly useful and particularly
functional the first one is used host

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:22.420
functional the first one is used host
 

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.620
functional the first one is used host
GPU so this allows you to if your

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:25.630
GPU so this allows you to if your
 

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:28.440
GPU so this allows you to if your
computer has a GPU it allows you to

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:28.450
computer has a GPU it allows you to
 

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:30.570
computer has a GPU it allows you to
leverage that to improve the performance

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:30.580
leverage that to improve the performance
 

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.350
leverage that to improve the performance
of your emulator so it will attach to

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:33.360
of your emulator so it will attach to
 

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.240
of your emulator so it will attach to
it'll attach that GPU I think that

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:36.250
it'll attach that GPU I think that
 

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:37.830
it'll attach that GPU I think that
that's only available if you're using

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:37.840
that's only available if you're using
 

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.250
that's only available if you're using
the hack some emulator the Intel is that

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:41.260
the hack some emulator the Intel is that
 

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:45.330
the hack some emulator the Intel is that
correct I think you can only use the

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:45.340
correct I think you can only use the
 

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:46.920
correct I think you can only use the
host GPU if you're using an Intel

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:46.930
host GPU if you're using an Intel
 

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:49.760
host GPU if you're using an Intel
emulator which we'll get to in a second

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:49.770
emulator which we'll get to in a second
 

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.320
emulator which we'll get to in a second
but the other really great thing is

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:52.330
but the other really great thing is
 

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:55.320
but the other really great thing is
snapshot so if you guys know what

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:55.330
snapshot so if you guys know what
 

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:57.120
snapshot so if you guys know what
virtual if you guys have ever used you

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:57.130
virtual if you guys have ever used you
 

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:59.760
virtual if you guys have ever used you
know any virtual machine VM ware etc

00:43:59.760 --> 00:43:59.770
know any virtual machine VM ware etc
 

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:03.000
know any virtual machine VM ware etc
when you close the virtual machine there

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:03.010
when you close the virtual machine there
 

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:04.890
when you close the virtual machine there
is functionality that allows you to save

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:04.900
is functionality that allows you to save
 

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.590
is functionality that allows you to save
a snapshot of that virtual machine so

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:07.600
a snapshot of that virtual machine so
 

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.110
a snapshot of that virtual machine so
the next time you bring it up it brings

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:10.120
the next time you bring it up it brings
 

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:13.560
the next time you bring it up it brings
it up to that same place that's all

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:13.570
it up to that same place that's all
 

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:15.870
it up to that same place that's all
that's exactly what this this snapshot

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:15.880
that's exactly what this this snapshot
 

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.730
that's exactly what this this snapshot
functionality does because these are

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:17.740
functionality does because these are
 

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.740
functionality does because these are
basically virtual machines anyway these

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:19.750
basically virtual machines anyway these
 

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:22.860
basically virtual machines anyway these
emulator images so when you're creating

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:22.870
emulator images so when you're creating
 

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:26.370
emulator images so when you're creating
your abd if you check that snapshot

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:26.380
your abd if you check that snapshot
 

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:28.830
your abd if you check that snapshot
button it allows you to enable these

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:28.840
button it allows you to enable these
 

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.740
button it allows you to enable these
snapshot functionality then when you're

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:31.750
snapshot functionality then when you're
 

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:36.510
snapshot functionality then when you're
launching your abd you can select these

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:36.520
launching your abd you can select these
 

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.280
launching your abd you can select these
three buttons here at these three

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:38.290
three buttons here at these three
 

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:39.960
three buttons here at these three
buttons here at the bottom which allow

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:39.970
buttons here at the bottom which allow
 

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:42.780
buttons here at the bottom which allow
you to use the snapshot so the first

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:42.790
you to use the snapshot so the first
 

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:45.240
you to use the snapshot so the first
time you bring up your emulator you will

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:45.250
time you bring up your emulator you will
 

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:47.670
time you bring up your emulator you will
wipe user data and then have this saved

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680
wipe user data and then have this saved
 

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:50.790
wipe user data and then have this saved
snapshot button enabled so generally

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800
snapshot button enabled so generally
 

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.950
snapshot button enabled so generally
what I do is I bring up an emulator from

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960
what I do is I bring up an emulator from
 

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:58.120
what I do is I bring up an emulator from
scratch I go through the various startup

00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:58.130
scratch I go through the various startup
 

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:01.120
scratch I go through the various startup
that it presents you like there's the

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:01.130
that it presents you like there's the
 

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:03.789
that it presents you like there's the

your put apps here or whatever I go

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680
your put apps here or whatever I go
 

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.620
your put apps here or whatever I go
through all those startup options so I

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:11.630
through all those startup options so I
 

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:13.210
through all those startup options so I
have a fresh emulator that has been

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:13.220
have a fresh emulator that has been
 

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.620
have a fresh emulator that has been
started up and I've gotten through all

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:14.630
started up and I've gotten through all
 

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:16.930
started up and I've gotten through all
these startup dialogues and then I kill

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:16.940
these startup dialogues and then I kill
 

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:20.079
these startup dialogues and then I kill
it right there so that I have a pristine

00:45:20.079 --> 00:45:20.089
it right there so that I have a pristine
 

00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:22.329
it right there so that I have a pristine
emulator and has been started up and is

00:45:22.329 --> 00:45:22.339
emulator and has been started up and is
 

00:45:22.339 --> 00:45:25.839
emulator and has been started up and is
in brand-spanking-new fresh state next

00:45:25.839 --> 00:45:25.849
in brand-spanking-new fresh state next
 

00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:28.539
in brand-spanking-new fresh state next
time when i start my avd my emulator

00:45:28.539 --> 00:45:28.549
time when i start my avd my emulator
 

00:45:28.549 --> 00:45:31.089
time when i start my avd my emulator
instead of having wipe user data

00:45:31.089 --> 00:45:31.099
instead of having wipe user data
 

00:45:31.099 --> 00:45:33.759
instead of having wipe user data
selected i have launched from snapshot

00:45:33.759 --> 00:45:33.769
selected i have launched from snapshot
 

00:45:33.769 --> 00:45:38.200
selected i have launched from snapshot
selected in and not saved a snapshot so

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:38.210
selected in and not saved a snapshot so
 

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:40.180
selected in and not saved a snapshot so
next time when i start up this emulator

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:40.190
next time when i start up this emulator
 

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:42.220
next time when i start up this emulator
it's going to start it up using the

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:42.230
it's going to start it up using the
 

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:44.950
it's going to start it up using the
snapshot that i just took and the great

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960
snapshot that i just took and the great
 

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.589
snapshot that i just took and the great
thing is it changes the startup time

00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599
thing is it changes the startup time
 

00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:51.450
thing is it changes the startup time
from you know like i said 34 minutes 2

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:51.460
from you know like i said 34 minutes 2
 

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:55.120
from you know like i said 34 minutes 2
seconds maybe 10 seconds 20 seconds if

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:55.130
seconds maybe 10 seconds 20 seconds if
 

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:58.150
seconds maybe 10 seconds 20 seconds if
you're not using snapshots this will in

00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160
you're not using snapshots this will in
 

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.789
you're not using snapshots this will in
fact if you leave here now you just

00:46:00.789 --> 00:46:00.799
fact if you leave here now you just
 

00:46:00.799 --> 00:46:02.680
fact if you leave here now you just
learn something really good snapshots

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:02.690
learn something really good snapshots
 

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:05.589
learn something really good snapshots
will save you a lot of time the other

00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599
will save you a lot of time the other
 

00:46:05.599 --> 00:46:07.390
will save you a lot of time the other
thing you can do using snapshots is if

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:07.400
thing you can do using snapshots is if
 

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.579
thing you can do using snapshots is if
you do have a particular state in your

00:46:09.579 --> 00:46:09.589
you do have a particular state in your
 

00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:12.220
you do have a particular state in your
app that you want to test repeatedly you

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:12.230
app that you want to test repeatedly you
 

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:14.079
app that you want to test repeatedly you
can bring your app up to that state and

00:46:14.079 --> 00:46:14.089
can bring your app up to that state and
 

00:46:14.089 --> 00:46:16.029
can bring your app up to that state and
then save that's Nate state as your

00:46:16.029 --> 00:46:16.039
then save that's Nate state as your
 

00:46:16.039 --> 00:46:18.490
then save that's Nate state as your
snapshot so you can always bring up your

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:18.500
snapshot so you can always bring up your
 

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:21.730
snapshot so you can always bring up your
fresh emulator to exactly the point in

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:21.740
fresh emulator to exactly the point in
 

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:27.220
fresh emulator to exactly the point in
the code that you need to test ok so we

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:27.230
the code that you need to test ok so we
 

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:28.390
the code that you need to test ok so we
kind of touched on some of these things

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400
kind of touched on some of these things
 

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.970
kind of touched on some of these things
before but there are alternatives to

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:30.980
before but there are alternatives to
 

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:34.380
before but there are alternatives to
using the Android emulators first one is

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:34.390
using the Android emulators first one is
 

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:38.410
using the Android emulators first one is
Intel's hexam so this allows you to

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:38.420
Intel's hexam so this allows you to
 

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:41.349
Intel's hexam so this allows you to
create emulators using the Intel chipset

00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:41.359
create emulators using the Intel chipset
 

00:46:41.359 --> 00:46:43.630
create emulators using the Intel chipset
so if your computer is running an intel

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:43.640
so if your computer is running an intel
 

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:47.829
so if your computer is running an intel
chip instead of an AMD chip this is a

00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839
chip instead of an AMD chip this is a
 

00:46:47.839 --> 00:46:50.440
chip instead of an AMD chip this is a
great way to this is a great thing to do

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:50.450
great way to this is a great thing to do
 

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:54.609
great way to this is a great thing to do
now performance wise you know it's fine

00:46:54.609 --> 00:46:54.619
now performance wise you know it's fine
 

00:46:54.619 --> 00:46:57.940
now performance wise you know it's fine
but the Intel hexham emulator is much

00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:57.950
but the Intel hexham emulator is much
 

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:00.069
but the Intel hexham emulator is much
faster to start up and much faster to

00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079
faster to start up and much faster to
 

00:47:00.079 --> 00:47:03.519
faster to start up and much faster to
deploy to so right there in and of

00:47:03.519 --> 00:47:03.529
deploy to so right there in and of
 

00:47:03.529 --> 00:47:06.430
deploy to so right there in and of
itself it is a much faster experience to

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:06.440
itself it is a much faster experience to
 

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.349
itself it is a much faster experience to
be using the Intel hack some emulator

00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359
be using the Intel hack some emulator
 

00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:13.470
be using the Intel hack some emulator
big giant limitation of Hexham is that

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:13.480
big giant limitation of Hexham is that
 

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:16.530
big giant limitation of Hexham is that
it doesn't support the play I'm sorry

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:16.540
it doesn't support the play I'm sorry
 

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:19.260
it doesn't support the play I'm sorry
the google google api is it only

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:19.270
the google google api is it only
 

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:22.319
the google google api is it only
supports the android api s so if you're

00:47:22.319 --> 00:47:22.329
supports the android api s so if you're
 

00:47:22.329 --> 00:47:24.000
supports the android api s so if you're
doing anything that requires the google

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:24.010
doing anything that requires the google
 

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:28.200
doing anything that requires the google
api is GCM or some of the other options

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:28.210
api is GCM or some of the other options
 

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:30.420
api is GCM or some of the other options
available to android until accident is

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:30.430
available to android until accident is
 

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.870
available to android until accident is
unfortunately not available to use so if

you're not using the google api's until
aksam is really great i would really

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:38.530
aksam is really great i would really
 

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.530
aksam is really great i would really
strongly suggest you use it it supports

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:40.540
strongly suggest you use it it supports
 

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.589
strongly suggest you use it it supports
snapshots just the same as the standard

the development process is the

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:05.950
the development process is the
 

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:09.180
the development process is the
deployment speed so it takes a little

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:09.190
deployment speed so it takes a little
 

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:10.710
deployment speed so it takes a little
bit of time to deploy to an android

00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720
bit of time to deploy to an android
 

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.540

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:15.420
emulator both hack some and genymotion
the deployment time is is much more

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:15.430
the deployment time is is much more
 

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:17.460
the deployment time is is much more
rapid so

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:17.470
rapid so
 

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:20.170
rapid so
those are some things that you might not

those are some things that you might not
 

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:23.410
those are some things that you might not
key in on early but it makes a big

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:23.420
key in on early but it makes a big
 

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:25.059
key in on early but it makes a big

much more effective the last thing I

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640
much more effective the last thing I
 

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.789
much more effective the last thing I
might mention about generating code this

00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799
might mention about generating code this
 

00:58:16.799 --> 00:58:19.489
might mention about generating code this
way is it's all generated to code

00:58:19.489 --> 00:58:19.499
way is it's all generated to code
 

00:58:19.499 --> 00:58:22.819

compliant Android design patterns right

00:58:22.819 --> 00:58:22.829
compliant Android design patterns right
 

00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:27.309
compliant Android design patterns right
so the naming standards are matched the

00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:27.319
so the naming standards are matched the
 

00:58:27.319 --> 00:58:31.549
so the naming standards are matched the
division of workload etc so it's a

00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559
division of workload etc so it's a
 

00:58:31.559 --> 00:58:35.299
division of workload etc so it's a
really great way to get started wanted

00:58:35.299 --> 00:58:35.309
really great way to get started wanted
 

00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:39.109

have set up here now and now you'll see

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:14.970
have set up here now and now you'll see
 

01:05:14.970 --> 01:05:19.710
have set up here now and now you'll see
actually you can look at how your app

01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:19.720
actually you can look at how your app
 

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.290
actually you can look at how your app
will look on multiple devices so if

01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:22.300
will look on multiple devices so if
 

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:25.760
will look on multiple devices so if
you'll see in this screen I have a 3.2

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:25.770
you'll see in this screen I have a 3.2
 

01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:33.720
you'll see in this screen I have a 3.2
hvga image a 5.1 wvga a 10.1 wxga image

and i can quickly look at exactly how my

01:05:37.859 --> 01:05:37.869
and i can quickly look at exactly how my
 

01:05:37.869 --> 01:05:40.050
and i can quickly look at exactly how my
app is going to render on all of those

01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:40.060
app is going to render on all of those
 

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:43.980
app is going to render on all of those
devices in one place so the way that you

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:43.990
devices in one place so the way that you
 

01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:46.589
devices in one place so the way that you
get there is where it's selected nexus

01:05:46.589 --> 01:05:46.599
get there is where it's selected nexus
 

01:05:46.599 --> 01:05:50.310
get there is where it's selected nexus
one you can go into that menu and it

01:05:50.310 --> 01:05:50.320
one you can go into that menu and it
 

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.290
one you can go into that menu and it
will allow you to select which of the

will allow you to select which of the
 

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.839
will allow you to select which of the
different images you want to preview

01:05:54.839 --> 01:05:54.849
different images you want to preview
 

01:05:54.849 --> 01:05:58.349
different images you want to preview
your app on in theory you can actually

01:05:58.349 --> 01:05:58.359
your app on in theory you can actually
 

01:05:58.359 --> 01:06:01.320
your app on in theory you can actually
make changes in real time and see how

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:01.330
make changes in real time and see how
 

01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:03.060
make changes in real time and see how
that's going to lay out and all of those

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:03.070
that's going to lay out and all of those
 

01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:06.829
that's going to lay out and all of those
different in all of those different

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839
different in all of those different
 

01:06:06.839 --> 01:06:21.640
different in all of those different
image sizes

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:21.650
 

01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:24.620
so the question is years ago people use

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:24.630
so the question is years ago people use
 

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:27.620
so the question is years ago people use
tools like Troy draw or some other

visual UI is this good enough now that

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:33.870
visual UI is this good enough now that
 

01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:35.390
visual UI is this good enough now that
you don't need to use that I think the

01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400
you don't need to use that I think the
 

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:40.910
you don't need to use that I think the
answer is yes there's a really robust

01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920
answer is yes there's a really robust
 

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:46.190
answer is yes there's a really robust
set of things you can do the other thing

01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200
set of things you can do the other thing
 

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.500
set of things you can do the other thing
i will mention on this is in addition to

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:48.510
i will mention on this is in addition to
 

01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:52.460
i will mention on this is in addition to
specifying different resolution screens

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:52.470
specifying different resolution screens
 

01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:54.230
specifying different resolution screens
that you want to look at you can also

01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240
that you want to look at you can also
 

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.590
that you want to look at you can also
specify api levels and you can also this

01:06:57.590 --> 01:06:57.600
specify api levels and you can also this
 

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.170
specify api levels and you can also this
so you can specify api levels using this

01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:00.180
so you can specify api levels using this
 

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:03.170
so you can specify api levels using this
a selection or you can use this one to

01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:03.180
a selection or you can use this one to
 

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:04.690
a selection or you can use this one to
actually look at your

01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:04.700
actually look at your
 

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:06.680
actually look at your
internationalization so if you have

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:06.690
internationalization so if you have
 

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:09.110
internationalization so if you have
enabled you know german language french

01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:09.120
enabled you know german language french
 

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.180
enabled you know german language french
language etc on your app you can

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:11.190
language etc on your app you can
 

01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:13.370
language etc on your app you can
actually select those from this

01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:13.380
actually select those from this
 

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:16.460
actually select those from this
drop-down and see how your app lines up

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:16.470
drop-down and see how your app lines up
 

01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:18.230
drop-down and see how your app lines up
when you're using german characters or

01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240
when you're using german characters or
 

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.940
when you're using german characters or
something and obviously that's really

01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:19.950
something and obviously that's really
 

01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:22.250
something and obviously that's really
important because certain language

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:22.260
important because certain language
 

01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:24.590
important because certain language
character sets are bigger than others

01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:24.600
character sets are bigger than others
 

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.200
character sets are bigger than others
this allows you very quickly to modify

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:27.210
this allows you very quickly to modify
 

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:29.180
this allows you very quickly to modify
your UI and understand exactly how it's

01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:29.190
your UI and understand exactly how it's
 

01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:33.860
your UI and understand exactly how it's
going to look you know right here really

01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:33.870
going to look you know right here really
 

01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:35.990
going to look you know right here really
quick there's no deploy cycle there's no

01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000
quick there's no deploy cycle there's no
 

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.880
quick there's no deploy cycle there's no
fiddling with your phone them to change

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:37.890
fiddling with your phone them to change
 

01:07:37.890 --> 01:07:40.430

the locale it's all just right here so

01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440
the locale it's all just right here so
 

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.780
the locale it's all just right here so
even if you're not going to use the

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:41.790
even if you're not going to use the
 

01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:43.400
even if you're not going to use the
visual editor to drag and drop

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:43.410
visual editor to drag and drop
 

01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:46.520

components and select properties or I
 

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:48.020
components and select properties or I
would really highly suggest that at

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:48.030
would really highly suggest that at
 

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:50.060
would really highly suggest that at
least when you're testing that you bring

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:50.070
least when you're testing that you bring
 

01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:52.000
least when you're testing that you bring
your app into this visual editor and

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:52.010
your app into this visual editor and
 

01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:54.470
your app into this visual editor and
play with the different resolutions and

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480
play with the different resolutions and
 

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:59.930
play with the different resolutions and
things ok so we're coming up to the last

01:07:59.930 --> 01:07:59.940
things ok so we're coming up to the last
 

01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:02.240
things ok so we're coming up to the last
section and that's performance testing

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:02.250
section and that's performance testing
 

01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:06.650
section and that's performance testing
and performance monitoring so the first

01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:06.660
and performance monitoring so the first
 

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:09.350
and performance monitoring so the first
thing that I wanted to make everyone

01:08:09.350 --> 01:08:09.360
thing that I wanted to make everyone
 

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:12.230
thing that I wanted to make everyone
aware of that you might not know is

01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240
aware of that you might not know is
 

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.810
aware of that you might not know is
there something called the tools monitor

01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:14.820
there something called the tools monitor
 

01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:18.470
there something called the tools monitor
so if you type tools monitor from your

01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480
so if you type tools monitor from your
 

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:20.510
so if you type tools monitor from your
you know if you have Android home set

01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520
you know if you have Android home set
 

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:23.630
you know if you have Android home set
you don't need to put the path it will

01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640
you don't need to put the path it will
 

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.970
you don't need to put the path it will
you guys know what DBMS is the different

01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:25.980
you guys know what DBMS is the different
 

01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:29.220
you guys know what DBMS is the different
tools that allow you to you know

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:29.230
tools that allow you to you know
 

01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:32.099
tools that allow you to you know
monitor actually allows you to run all

monitor actually allows you to run all
 

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:35.070
monitor actually allows you to run all
the DDMS tools external to eclipse so if

01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:35.080
the DDMS tools external to eclipse so if
 

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.960
the DDMS tools external to eclipse so if
i'm going to show you that and you'll

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:36.970
i'm going to show you that and you'll
 

01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:38.880
i'm going to show you that and you'll
see that it's exactly the same as DDMS

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:38.890
see that it's exactly the same as DDMS
 

01:08:38.890 --> 01:08:41.309
see that it's exactly the same as DDMS
the cool thing is this would allow you

01:08:41.309 --> 01:08:41.319
the cool thing is this would allow you
 

01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:44.070
the cool thing is this would allow you
to tell people that don't have the IDE

01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:44.080
to tell people that don't have the IDE
 

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.059
to tell people that don't have the IDE
installed that allows them to run some

01:08:48.059 --> 01:08:48.069
installed that allows them to run some
 

01:08:48.069 --> 01:08:49.590
installed that allows them to run some
of these performance tools and

01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600
of these performance tools and
 

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.079
of these performance tools and
introspect some of the functionality

01:08:52.079 --> 01:08:52.089
introspect some of the functionality
 

01:08:52.089 --> 01:08:54.900
introspect some of the functionality
without requiring the full IDE install

01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:54.910
without requiring the full IDE install
 

01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:57.479
without requiring the full IDE install
or you know in bringing importing a

01:08:57.479 --> 01:08:57.489
or you know in bringing importing a
 

01:08:57.489 --> 01:08:59.999
or you know in bringing importing a
project and doing all those tough things

project and doing all those tough things
 

01:09:00.009 --> 01:09:03.059
project and doing all those tough things
that maybe a tester might not want to do

01:09:03.059 --> 01:09:03.069
that maybe a tester might not want to do
 

01:09:03.069 --> 01:09:08.370
that maybe a tester might not want to do
or a project manager so so you can bring

01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:08.380
or a project manager so so you can bring
 

01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:10.170
or a project manager so so you can bring
up the performance tools using monitor

01:09:10.170 --> 01:09:10.180
up the performance tools using monitor
 

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:12.990
up the performance tools using monitor
like this android device monitor or if

01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:13.000
like this android device monitor or if
 

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.769
like this android device monitor or if
you're in eclipse you can show open

01:09:16.769 --> 01:09:16.779
you're in eclipse you can show open
 

01:09:16.779 --> 01:09:21.599
you're in eclipse you can show open
perspective dbms okay so this is what

01:09:21.599 --> 01:09:21.609
perspective dbms okay so this is what
 

01:09:21.609 --> 01:09:25.470
perspective dbms okay so this is what
the DDMS or monitor window looks like

01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:25.480
the DDMS or monitor window looks like
 

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:27.210

is hierarchy viewer so what this allows

01:12:13.890 --> 01:12:13.900
is hierarchy viewer so what this allows
 

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.110
is hierarchy viewer so what this allows
you to do is this allows you to inspect

01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:16.120
you to do is this allows you to inspect
 

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:21.270
you to do is this allows you to inspect
the visual hierarchy of your UI and see

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280
the visual hierarchy of your UI and see
 

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:25.970
the visual hierarchy of your UI and see
where you might have extra layouts in

01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:25.980
where you might have extra layouts in
 

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.980

android the fewer layouts the better if

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:28.990
android the fewer layouts the better if

android the fewer layouts the better if
you have a bunch of nested layouts due

01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:31.870
you have a bunch of nested layouts due
 

01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:34.710
you have a bunch of nested layouts due
to the way that the view is measured and

01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:34.720
to the way that the view is measured and
 

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.980
to the way that the view is measured and
drawn the more layouts you have the

01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:36.990
drawn the more layouts you have the
 

01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:41.790
drawn the more layouts you have the
longer it takes to render and that's

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:41.800
longer it takes to render and that's
 

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.740
longer it takes to render and that's
obviously bad that causes performance

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:43.750

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.990
problems so this very quickly allows you
to look at your UI

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:49.000
to look at your UI
 

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.450
to look at your UI
on a visual level and see what your

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:51.460
on a visual level and see what your
 

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:53.550
on a visual level and see what your
hierarchy looks like and try to

01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:53.560
hierarchy looks like and try to
 

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.200
hierarchy looks like and try to
determine any places where you can

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:55.210
determine any places where you can
 

01:12:55.210 --> 01:12:59.690
determine any places where you can

01:14:04.090 --> 01:14:06.690
same thing however one of them was
written with a relative layout so it's

01:14:06.690 --> 01:14:06.700
written with a relative layout so it's
 

01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:09.480
written with a relative layout so it's
all very flat and not a lot of nested

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:09.490
all very flat and not a lot of nested
 

01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:11.760
all very flat and not a lot of nested
layouts the other is written using a

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:11.770
layouts the other is written using a
 

01:14:11.770 --> 01:14:14.220
layouts the other is written using a
bunch of nested layouts bunch of linear

01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:14.230
bunch of nested layouts bunch of linear
 

01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:16.350
bunch of nested layouts bunch of linear
layouts of horizontal and vertical

01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:16.360
layouts of horizontal and vertical
 

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.460
layouts of horizontal and vertical
orientation all meshed together so I

01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:20.470
orientation all meshed together so I
 

01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:22.830
orientation all meshed together so I
encourage you guys to actually run those

01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:22.840
encourage you guys to actually run those
 

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:27.030
encourage you guys to actually run those
two side-by-side and inspect what a good

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040
two side-by-side and inspect what a good
 

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.560
two side-by-side and inspect what a good
layout looks like and what a bad layout

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:28.570
layout looks like and what a bad layout
 

01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:31.230
layout looks like and what a bad layout
looks like the same exact layout in that

01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:31.240
looks like the same exact layout in that
 

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:34.740
looks like the same exact layout in that
example runs twenty percent faster using

01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:34.750
example runs twenty percent faster using
 

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:37.320
example runs twenty percent faster using
the relative layout so again it looks

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:37.330
the relative layout so again it looks
 

01:14:37.330 --> 01:14:40.470
the relative layout so again it looks
exactly the same but as an optimized

01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480
exactly the same but as an optimized
 

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:51.939
exactly the same but as an optimized
version it runs almost a fifth faster

01:14:51.939 --> 01:14:51.949
 

01:14:51.949 --> 01:14:55.359
so the question is how many layers of

01:14:55.359 --> 01:14:55.369
so the question is how many layers of
 

01:14:55.369 --> 01:14:59.959
so the question is how many layers of
layout is considered optimal and the

01:14:59.959 --> 01:14:59.969
layout is considered optimal and the
 

01:14:59.969 --> 01:15:02.890
layout is considered optimal and the
answer is it depends you know there's no

01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:02.900
answer is it depends you know there's no
 

01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:05.450
answer is it depends you know there's no
hard and fast rules layouts can be

01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:05.460
hard and fast rules layouts can be
 

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:07.220
hard and fast rules layouts can be
complicated and sometimes they require a

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:07.230
complicated and sometimes they require a
 

01:15:07.230 --> 01:15:09.520
complicated and sometimes they require a
bunch of different nested layouts

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:09.530
bunch of different nested layouts
 

01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:11.450
bunch of different nested layouts
sometimes that's the only way to get it

01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:11.460
sometimes that's the only way to get it
 

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.609
sometimes that's the only way to get it
done to dealing with the weights or

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:13.619
done to dealing with the weights or
 

01:15:13.619 --> 01:15:16.279
done to dealing with the weights or
other things so the answer is it depends

01:15:16.279 --> 01:15:16.289
other things so the answer is it depends
 

01:15:16.289 --> 01:15:18.739
other things so the answer is it depends
but the real answer to that is as few as

01:15:18.739 --> 01:15:18.749
but the real answer to that is as few as
 

01:15:18.749 --> 01:15:24.979
but the real answer to that is as few as
you can get away with yes the but the

01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:24.989
you can get away with yes the but the
 

01:15:24.989 --> 01:15:28.669
you can get away with yes the but the
fewer layers levels of layouts that you

01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679
fewer layers levels of layouts that you
 

01:15:28.679 --> 01:15:30.770
fewer layers levels of layouts that you
have the better user experience the

01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:30.780
have the better user experience the
 

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:32.629
have the better user experience the
faster your UI is going to render and

01:15:32.629 --> 01:15:32.639
faster your UI is going to render and
 

01:15:32.639 --> 01:15:35.569
faster your UI is going to render and
the less resources probably takes the

01:15:35.569 --> 01:15:35.579
the less resources probably takes the
 

01:15:35.579 --> 01:15:39.200
the less resources probably takes the
same resources but fewer layouts more

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:39.210
same resources but fewer layouts more
 

01:15:39.210 --> 01:15:45.229
same resources but fewer layouts more
better okay I wanted to just touch on

01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:45.239
better okay I wanted to just touch on
 

01:15:45.239 --> 01:15:47.989
better okay I wanted to just touch on

know that some other tools that I'm not
 

01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:54.649
know that some other tools that I'm not
able to demo here but I want you guys to

01:15:54.649 --> 01:15:54.659
able to demo here but I want you guys to
 

01:15:54.659 --> 01:15:57.399
able to demo here but I want you guys to
be aware of so you know that they exist

01:15:57.399 --> 01:15:57.409
be aware of so you know that they exist
 

01:15:57.409 --> 01:16:00.169

you're using OpenGL within your app this
 

01:16:02.489 --> 01:16:06.049
you're using OpenGL within your app this
allows you to trace very specifically

01:16:06.049 --> 01:16:06.059
allows you to trace very specifically
 

01:16:06.059 --> 01:16:08.720
allows you to trace very specifically
through all of your GL calls so that you

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:08.730
through all of your GL calls so that you
 

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:11.569
through all of your GL calls so that you
can see exactly what's happening through

01:16:11.569 --> 01:16:11.579
can see exactly what's happening through
 

01:16:11.579 --> 01:16:14.419
can see exactly what's happening through
after your throughout your code

01:16:14.419 --> 01:16:14.429
after your throughout your code
 

01:16:14.429 --> 01:16:17.930
after your throughout your code
rendering I don't do a lot of OpenGL

01:16:17.930 --> 01:16:17.940
rendering I don't do a lot of OpenGL
 

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.450
rendering I don't do a lot of OpenGL

graphic stuff but really really useful

01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:23.340
graphic stuff but really really useful
 

01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:25.819
graphic stuff but really really useful
if you're doing OpenGL really really

01:16:25.819 --> 01:16:25.829
if you're doing OpenGL really really
 

01:16:25.829 --> 01:16:27.500
if you're doing OpenGL really really
useful to be able to see exactly what it

useful to be able to see exactly what it
 

01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:29.540
useful to be able to see exactly what it
is that you're doing so again all these

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:29.550
is that you're doing so again all these
 

01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:31.339
is that you're doing so again all these

closer look at how our code is operating
 

01:16:34.409 --> 01:16:36.560
closer look at how our code is operating
so that we really understand and that we

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:36.570
so that we really understand and that we
 

01:16:36.570 --> 01:16:39.220
so that we really understand and that we
can optimize where it's most effective

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:39.230
can optimize where it's most effective

pixel perfect viewer allows you to look

01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:41.820
pixel perfect viewer allows you to look
 

01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:47.000
pixel perfect viewer allows you to look
at very close renditions of your UI so

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:47.010
at very close renditions of your UI so
 

01:16:47.010 --> 01:16:51.529
at very close renditions of your UI so
that you can isolate shadow problems or

01:16:51.529 --> 01:16:51.539
that you can isolate shadow problems or
 

01:16:51.539 --> 01:16:54.620
that you can isolate shadow problems or
any sort of dithering or other issues

01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:54.630
any sort of dithering or other issues
 

01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:55.910
any sort of dithering or other issues
that you might have

01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920
that you might have
 

01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:59.300
that you might have
your UI network statistics we already

01:16:59.300 --> 01:16:59.310
your UI network statistics we already
 

01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:01.070
your UI network statistics we already
talked about that allows you very very

01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080
talked about that allows you very very
 

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.979
talked about that allows you very very
close understanding of exactly what's

01:17:03.979 --> 01:17:03.989
close understanding of exactly what's
 

01:17:03.989 --> 01:17:06.590
close understanding of exactly what's
happening with your network calls you

01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600
happening with your network calls you
 

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.870
happening with your network calls you
can trace the size of the calls the

01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880
can trace the size of the calls the
 

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:12.050
can trace the size of the calls the
duration etc etc a system information

01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:12.060
duration etc etc a system information
 

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:14.689
duration etc etc a system information
gives you a really good overview of your

01:17:14.689 --> 01:17:14.699
gives you a really good overview of your
 

01:17:14.699 --> 01:17:19.820
gives you a really good overview of your
device the memory it's use the memory it

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:19.830
device the memory it's use the memory it
 

01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:23.630
device the memory it's use the memory it
has available space on the device things

01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:23.640
has available space on the device things
 

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.990
has available space on the device things
like that it shows you that in some

01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000
like that it shows you that in some
 

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.910
like that it shows you that in some
really nice charts so it's a really

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:28.920
really nice charts so it's a really
 

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.910
really nice charts so it's a really
clear visual representation of exactly

01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920
clear visual representation of exactly
 

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:36.020
clear visual representation of exactly
what your device is what resources are

01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:36.030
what your device is what resources are
 

01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:53.009
what your device is what resources are
available to your device

01:17:53.009 --> 01:17:53.019
 

01:17:53.019 --> 01:17:56.109
so the question is if you're dealing

01:17:56.109 --> 01:17:56.119
so the question is if you're dealing
 

01:17:56.119 --> 01:17:59.830
so the question is if you're dealing
with a app that might have might suck

01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840
with a app that might have might suck
 

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:03.339
with a app that might have might suck
battery or might use a lot of power does

01:18:03.339 --> 01:18:03.349
battery or might use a lot of power does
 

01:18:03.349 --> 01:18:05.229
battery or might use a lot of power does
the system information provide that I

01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:05.239
the system information provide that I
 

01:18:05.239 --> 01:18:07.870
the system information provide that I
don't know I'll look at that in a second

01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:07.880
don't know I'll look at that in a second
 

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:13.209
don't know I'll look at that in a second
I don't know of a good tool to track

01:18:13.209 --> 01:18:13.219
I don't know of a good tool to track
 

01:18:13.219 --> 01:18:18.580
I don't know of a good tool to track
that there's a company in India that

01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:18.590
that there's a company in India that
 

01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:28.350
that there's a company in India that
does that

01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:28.360
 

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:32.050
yeah so real quick we'll go through

01:18:32.050 --> 01:18:32.060
yeah so real quick we'll go through
 

01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:33.670
yeah so real quick we'll go through
these last ones and then I think we're

01:18:33.670 --> 01:18:33.680
these last ones and then I think we're
 

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.600
these last ones and then I think we're
good to close us out so lint is a

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:36.610
good to close us out so lint is a
 

01:18:36.610 --> 01:18:40.300
good to close us out so lint is a
automated test testing tool basically

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:40.310
automated test testing tool basically
 

01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:43.540
automated test testing tool basically
it's going to in your code as it's live

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:43.550
it's going to in your code as it's live
 

01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:45.970
it's going to in your code as it's live
it will flag certain things in your code

01:18:45.970 --> 01:18:45.980
it will flag certain things in your code
 

01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:50.740
it will flag certain things in your code
that are either wrong or that are just

01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:50.750
that are either wrong or that are just
 

01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:53.110
that are either wrong or that are just
bad so for instance like we talked about

01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120
bad so for instance like we talked about
 

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.090
bad so for instance like we talked about
before if you're using a hard-coded

01:18:55.090 --> 01:18:55.100
before if you're using a hard-coded
 

01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:58.690
before if you're using a hard-coded
string with in your code lint will go

01:18:58.690 --> 01:18:58.700
string with in your code lint will go
 

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.880
string with in your code lint will go
through automatically and it'll put a

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:00.890
through automatically and it'll put a
 

01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:02.470
through automatically and it'll put a
little flag next to that that says hey

01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480
little flag next to that that says hey
 

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.630
little flag next to that that says hey
you probably don't want to be using a

01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640
you probably don't want to be using a
 

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:07.210
you probably don't want to be using a
hard-coded string here and then when you

01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:07.220
hard-coded string here and then when you
 

01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.040
hard-coded string here and then when you
mouse over that and it will give you

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:09.050
mouse over that and it will give you
 

01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:11.500
mouse over that and it will give you
remediation strategies and in some cases

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:11.510
remediation strategies and in some cases
 

01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:13.510
remediation strategies and in some cases
will actually go ahead and fix those for

01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520
will actually go ahead and fix those for
 

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:15.580
will actually go ahead and fix those for
you so in this case lint will highlight

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:15.590
you so in this case lint will highlight
 

01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:19.960
you so in this case lint will highlight
that highlight you will click on that

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:19.970
that highlight you will click on that
 

01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:22.060
that highlight you will click on that
particular string and then it will

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:22.070
particular string and then it will
 

01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:25.750
particular string and then it will
provide you the button that says export

01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760
provide you the button that says export
 

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.900
provide you the button that says export
this string to XML to strings.xml so

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:28.910
this string to XML to strings.xml so
 

01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:30.880
this string to XML to strings.xml so
lint is run automatically it can also be

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:30.890
lint is run automatically it can also be
 

01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:34.180
lint is run automatically it can also be
run as part of your build to flag things

01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:34.190
run as part of your build to flag things
 

01:19:34.190 --> 01:19:38.290
run as part of your build to flag things
it's much like PMD or fine bugs in the

01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:38.300
it's much like PMD or fine bugs in the
 

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:42.610
it's much like PMD or fine bugs in the
Java world basically automated testing

01:19:42.610 --> 01:19:42.620
Java world basically automated testing

tool to highlight patterns and not

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:47.450
tool to highlight patterns and not
 

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:58.140
tool to highlight patterns and not
functional problems but code problems

01:19:58.140 --> 01:19:58.150
 

01:19:58.150 --> 01:20:00.310
so the question is is there a tool that

01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320
so the question is is there a tool that
 

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:02.890
so the question is is there a tool that
will tell you what the minimum android

01:20:02.890 --> 01:20:02.900
will tell you what the minimum android
 

01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:05.860
will tell you what the minimum android
OS is to target and the answer is no

01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:05.870
OS is to target and the answer is no
 

01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:07.660
OS is to target and the answer is no
because that's fully dependent on you

01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:07.670
because that's fully dependent on you
 

01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:10.960
because that's fully dependent on you
you need to decide how you want to so

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:10.970
you need to decide how you want to so
 

01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:15.760
you need to decide how you want to so
who you want to support so there's no

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:15.770
who you want to support so there's no
 

01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:17.590
who you want to support so there's no
tool that can tell you that now it

01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600
tool that can tell you that now it
 

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:19.810
tool that can tell you that now it
obviously depends on the api's you need

01:20:19.810 --> 01:20:19.820
obviously depends on the api's you need
 

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:24.910
obviously depends on the api's you need
to support and your customer base so but

01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:24.920
to support and your customer base so but
 

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:27.370
to support and your customer base so but
there's no no rules for that that's

01:20:27.370 --> 01:20:27.380
there's no no rules for that that's
 

01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:37.900
there's no no rules for that that's
that's completely subjective it will

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:37.910
that's completely subjective it will
 

01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:39.850
that's completely subjective it will
tell you if you have API issues and it

01:20:39.850 --> 01:20:39.860
tell you if you have API issues and it
 

01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:42.790
tell you if you have API issues and it
will allow you to it will tell you if

01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800
will allow you to it will tell you if
 

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.800
will allow you to it will tell you if
you're using an API that's not supported

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:44.810
you're using an API that's not supported
 

01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:46.420
you're using an API that's not supported
in the version of the OS you're

01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:46.430
in the version of the OS you're
 

01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:48.940
in the version of the OS you're
targeting actually so that is one of the

01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:48.950
targeting actually so that is one of the
 

01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:53.890
targeting actually so that is one of the
things that it will tell you um monkey

01:20:53.890 --> 01:20:53.900
things that it will tell you um monkey
 

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:56.950

with emulators there are certain things
 

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.570
with emulators there are certain things
that you can't emulate sensors being for

fashion or if you just want to simulate
 

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:45.640
fashion or if you just want to simulate
sensor operations meaning you know again

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:45.650

motion sensors or whatever it'll allow
 

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:51.610
motion sensors or whatever it'll allow
you to simulate those on the emulator so

01:22:51.610 --> 01:22:51.620
you to simulate those on the emulator so
 

01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:56.340
