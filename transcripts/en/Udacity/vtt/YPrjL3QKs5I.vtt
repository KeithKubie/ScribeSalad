00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.100
The design support library
has a built in fab widget.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.760
It already has ripples and
elevation enabled.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.050
But it's a good exercise
to wire up one yourself

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.370
to see what's been done for you.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.870
We're going to create this app.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.580
It has two fab widgets.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.610
One we've created by hand, and one
that uses the design support library.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.890
So I've gone ahead and
created a new project and

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.500
selected the Blank Activity option.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.162
In my build.gradle file,

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:33.220
I've made sure to add the design
support library as a dependency.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.870
At the core of a fab
widget is an image view.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.980
We can make life a little bit
simpler by using an ImageButton.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.010
I've set the background to
use the accent color, and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.880
a plus button as the source image.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.000
Fabplus is a vector
drawable I've created.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.800
You could use an image with transparent
images, but it's more scalable to use

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.190
a vector drawable because they can
be resized without any quality loss.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.310
As you can see here,
our button isn't very circular.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.880
We can do that by setting
it's background to be a shape

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.030
shaded in our accent color.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.220
Now is also a good time
to set our elevation.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.680
Because we use the background drawable,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.100
Andriod can use that data
to calculate a shadow.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.430
We don't need it in this case, but

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.540
you could create a custom outline
provide to control how shadows are cast.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.430
You can see more information about
that in the instructors notes.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.670
So going back to our button,
we have a button that we can click and

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.270
that has elevation but
it doesn't have any ripples and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.400
it doesn't raised to our touch.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.440
Let's go ahead and add a ripple.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.910
To enable ripples, we need to change the
buttons background from a static shape

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.570
to one that's enclosed in a ripple tag.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.230
The color control highlight is the color
applied to things like ripples,

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.600
list selectors, etc.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.002
The main difference
between oval_shape and

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:04.460
oval_ripple is that the ripple
tag encloses our shape.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.820
The next thing we need to do,

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.660
is add a material reaction to the fab
widget to raise it up to meet our touch.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.640
To do this, we'll add a state list
animator to run an animation when

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.060
the user touches the button.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.360
In the layout,
we reference a file fab_raise,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.950
that lives in the resources
anim directory.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.958
We have two object animators, one for

00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:32.680
when the button is pressed and
one for when it's released.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.290
Notice how we animated the translation
Z property of the button,

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.070
rather than the elevation.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.420
The final elevation is calculated by
adding the current value of translation

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.960
Z to the base elevation we set in code.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.200
So this translation Z property
goes from a value of 0 to 8 dps.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.760
Now if we remember, our fab button
has a resting state of six dp.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.780
So it's going to actually go
from an elevation of 6dp to 14.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.300
You won't generally need to
implement fabs from scratch and

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.170
you definitely should
use the design library.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.460
But it's likely that you'll need to
create custom widgets that you'll

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.240
need ripples for or elevation changes.
