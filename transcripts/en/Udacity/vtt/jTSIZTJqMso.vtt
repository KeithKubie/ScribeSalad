00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.680
So today I'm talking with Andrei Pop,
the Founder and

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.650
Chief Executive of Human API.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.960
Andrei is my favorite kind of person.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.670
An entrepreneur trained
in Political Science at

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.720
the University of British Columbia.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.820
He is now starting his
second technology company.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.270
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much for having me.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.640
&gt;&gt; So, the Human API is the luster

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.620
of a lot of the things that we have
talked about so far in the course.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.350
I am very excited to have you here,
because it brings together many pieces

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.270
in a tangible way, that's easy to
understand and easy to demonstrate.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.770
So let's start by talking about
the fundamentals of what you do.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.042
And for that,
we've assembled a few toys here, right?

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:45.058
&gt;&gt; Let's do it.

00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:49.855
&gt;&gt; So I'm a patient and this device
is measuring my blood pressure, or

00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:52.125
my activity, or whatever.

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:55.515
Tell me what you can do for
me, starting at that device.

00:00:55.515 --> 00:00:59.695
&gt;&gt; And so the idea for us, really was,
we wanted to make it really simple for

00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:03.715
this data to flow from this device
into wherever it needed to go, whether

00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:08.810
that was for research, for a doctor,
for a nurse practitioner, you name it.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.250
And so what this device would have, and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.950
sort of the other really important part
of this system is somewhere over here in

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.320
a totally different part is you have a,
say personal health record system and

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.320
it's floating away from me, but
let's just use this for the time being.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.030
So you start with this, and what we
said is, okay, this device will now,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.370
already has a connection to
a phone of some kind, right?

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.200
&gt;&gt; A phone.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.190
&gt;&gt; Let's put that there.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.800
Great.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.670
&gt;&gt; And then somewhere along the way,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.470
it finds its way into a cloud
system of some kind, right?

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.200
So now you've got blood
pressure data that's flowing

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.040
from this device to the phone
into this cloud system.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.590
And then over here, you've got-
&gt;&gt; And typically, this cloud system

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.750
would be provided by the company that
provides the device, that's the norm.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.010
&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.130
But now, you're over here, and
you're talking to your doctor.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.150
And you're trying to say okay,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.000
I've collected all of this
blood pressure data, and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.220
I'd like to actually get it into
the system, how do I do that?

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.630
And so that's where we come in.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.310
So what we provide is,
you essentially, and

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.080
I'll show you how this
works a little later on.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.770
But you essentially would click a button
inside of this personal health record

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.850
system.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.290
You know, just like you were
logging into an app with Facebook.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.540
And what would then happen is we would
say look, we're going to grab your

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.610
data from this blood pressure device,
we being Human API.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.460
We're going to pull it into our back
end, we're going to structure and

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.490
normalize it, and
then we will send it onto there.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.440
And so I'll show you how that works.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.440
But essentially, we now sit right
in the middle here, and this is us.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.480
And so, now the data's flowing from this
device through the phone up to the cloud

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.220
service to us, and
to the person who holds the records.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.230
&gt;&gt; And of course, it wouldn't
just be data from this device,

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.310
it could be data from several devices?

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.940
&gt;&gt; Of course.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.800
&gt;&gt; It could be data the patient
has recorded in their PHR.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.080
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.829
&gt;&gt; Could be any health data really,

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.050
disassembled into this
patient controlled database.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.560
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.190
So now, for example, let's say you
have a different device over here and

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.270
then you're trying to
query data from that, and

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.250
same sort of tree-like structure
that would flow down from there.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.750
And now here's where it
gets really interesting, so

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.090
now that we have the central identity
that you can query through an API,

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.650
as long as the patient grants access.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.510
Let's say you're using a totally
different personal health record system,

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.100
right, so you've got some
other application over here.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.380
We've already got your data here,
so now, all you need to do

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.470
is go inside of the system, click our
button and the connection is made.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.570
And now any time you capture
blood pressure on this device,

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.750
it will automatically flow up the chain
and into all of these different systems.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.910
&gt;&gt; So that's what Human API does.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.560
&gt;From the point of view of the course,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.620
maybe the more interesting
story is how you do it.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.430
So for that, we're going to clear
the table and let's take a look.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:58.090
So I guess this is a PHR or some other
tool that the patient might be using.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.290
&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.830
So for example,
we mentioned that connect

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.360
button that allows you to pull data
from all of these different devices.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.780
So what we've actually done
here is this would be some sort

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.230
of personal health record system and

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.130
somewhere inside of here, you'd have
this connect your health data button.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.329
And now what you do when you click that
button, is we serve up this pop-up

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.290
that basically says look, this wellness
portal, or PHR system wants permission

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.260
to access your health data, and we're
going to pull it through Human API.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.250
Now this is really important because
central to our philosophy in

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.670
how we approach this business
is to put the patient

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.270
in the driver's seat in this case.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.860
So what ends up happening is the patient
grants access to the system.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.020
Now, what's happening on the back end
here is we've created an identity for

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.330
that patient in our system.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.100
And we're essentially saying look,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.630
now we have all of these different
sources so, for this example Fitbit,

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.610
Jawbone, Nike, and Moves, but
it could be any one of these, right?

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.490
And so might say, okay, let's go
ahead and authenticate a Fitbit, or

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.700
let's go ahead and authenticate
a Moves application against Human API.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.152
And so this allows us to connect each
of those different data sources, and

00:05:10.152 --> 00:05:13.434
it could be a blood pressure monitor,
it could be another PHR system,

00:05:13.434 --> 00:05:14.065
you name it.

00:05:14.065 --> 00:05:19.800
&gt;&gt; And so Moves is an app that
keeps track of people's activity.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.940
&gt;&gt; Right, that's right.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.782
&gt;&gt; And FitBit is another approach to
keeping track of people's activity

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:24.560
through a device.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.510
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.118
That's right.

00:05:26.118 --> 00:05:27.066
&gt;&gt; One using the phone,
one using the device.

00:05:27.066 --> 00:05:30.375
&gt;&gt; So that's actually a really,
really important point as well,

00:05:30.375 --> 00:05:35.330
because what we do on our end that also
sort of helps move this process along

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.280
from the perspective of the application
that's pulling in our data,

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.250
is we actually normalize this data.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.900
So if you think about having steps,
for example,

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.860
as a metric that's being recorded, maybe
by an app on your phone, maybe out by

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.840
a pedometer you wear, maybe by a smart
watch that has an accelerometer in it.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.340
All of the data from the perspective of
the application is actually just steps.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.490
And so, what we do on our end is we
structure and normalize that data before

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.850
we send it on to the application, which
makes it much easier for them to use it.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.590
&gt;&gt; This is a really key point.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.090
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.420
&gt;&gt; As everyone taking the course
knows interoperability is one of

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.950
the overriding challenges
in health informatics.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.990
And you sit in the middle and
don't just aggregate the data.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.450
But you put it in a standard syntax so

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.350
that it's much easier on the other
side to access the data as we'll see.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.895
&gt;&gt; Right.
So

00:06:28.895 --> 00:06:31.520
yeah, why don't I show you
kind of how that works.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.760
So I will go to here and
I will show you.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.860
You saw that authentication process
sort of happen on the back end, right?

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.910
So once that authentication
process has happened,

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.320
the data starts flowing from Human APIs
or from the device to Human API.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.780
And into these various systems, right?

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.570
Now, what does this actually look like?

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:54.230
Well, if you have, and, you know, for to
kind of geek out a little bit here but,

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.640
we basically give an access token for
a user to the application.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.620
So, in this case,
we're using the demo access token but

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.010
each user of the application would
have their own unique token, and

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.490
then it's a restful API
that we can query in.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.650
So we say look,
api.humanapi.co human blood pressure.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.362
And here you can see structured data,
systolic and

00:07:16.362 --> 00:07:22.330
diastolic blood pressure that's come off
of a Withings blood pressure monitor.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.700
And then one thing you can do here
is actually change the date range.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.790
For example, you can sort of
modify this query on the fly.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.730
So, if you're building an experience for
a physician that wants to look at this

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:38.180
data at some point,
you as an application developer can

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.590
choose how you interpret this data for
that physician once it's in your system.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.500
If, for example,

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.150
you wanted to actually visualize it,
we can do that on the fly as well.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.740
So rather than using
the api.humanapi.coendpoint,

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.230
you would just use chart and
then there it is.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.780
And if you wanted to change
the dimensions of this or

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.170
do any of that stuff,
you can do that on the fly as well.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:05.920
&gt;&gt; So, it's important to look at
the URI here, the restful API.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.360
And see how simple it is.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.152
And in fact,
it's actually human readable.

00:08:09.152 --> 00:08:09.700
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.830
&gt;&gt; So getting to this data becomes much,
much simpler.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.740
And there's only a reference
here to blood pressure.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:22.320
And the app developer or
the query, the source

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.660
that screened the data doesn't have
to know what device is being used.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.280
Doesn't have to know
anything about that device.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.990
Doesn't have to understand their data
streams, or formats, or syntaxes.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:35.100
They're going to get it in
the standard form through your system.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:35.630
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.700
So, what we do is we
abstract all of that away.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.299
So, if you actually look
at our back end here,

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.670
you'll see we have this tool
we call the API explorer.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:49.340
And what you can essentially do in here
is you can see all the different types

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:54.750
of data that you can query, so blood
glucose, blood pressure levels, BMI.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:59.483
So, really important to this idea of
normalization is we're not actually

00:08:59.483 --> 00:09:03.310
taking Whithing's data, for example, and
just passing it on to the developers.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.810
What we're actually doing is making
sure that the data is very clean and

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.548
very structured.

00:09:07.548 --> 00:09:10.210
And that enables the application
developer to really focus

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.170
on the experience that they want to
create without worrying about where

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.935
the data comes from and all that stuff.

00:09:15.935 --> 00:09:17.535
&gt;&gt; Well, this is great.

00:09:17.535 --> 00:09:20.645
This is an example,
I think of the future of
