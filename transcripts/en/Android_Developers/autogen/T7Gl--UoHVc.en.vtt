show you some signals that occur in the
 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.289
show you some signals that occur in the
very first day that can help you

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299
very first day that can help you

good and if it's not maybe some things

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500
good and if it's not maybe some things

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.720
kind of the top 200 iat games you end up
with the curve that looks like this

course this kind of makes sense there's

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000
course this kind of makes sense there's
 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.369
course this kind of makes sense there's
a reasonable assumption that the more

a reasonable assumption that the more
 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.349
a reasonable assumption that the more
people play on the first day the more

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359
people play on the first day the more
 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.030
people play on the first day the more
likely they are to return since the more

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.289
likely they are to return since the more
they play the more likely they are

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299

they'd be having fun where this data
gets a bit interesting is when we

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199
gets a bit interesting is when we
 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.080
gets a bit interesting is when we
actually take those top couple hundred

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090
actually take those top couple hundred
 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.729
actually take those top couple hundred
games and break them out into quartiles

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739
games and break them out into quartiles
 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.770
games and break them out into quartiles
and so what we're looking at here is the

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780
and so what we're looking at here is the
 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.569

based on their day two retention what we

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879
based on their day two retention what we
 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.729
based on their day two retention what we
can actually see is that by and large

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739
can actually see is that by and large
 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.399
can actually see is that by and large
each of these quartiles exhibits largely

each of these quartiles exhibits largely
the same pattern after the first ten

the same pattern after the first ten
 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.360

right with the steadily decreasing slope
 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.899
right with the steadily decreasing slope
but it's in the first ten minutes where

the most interesting stuff starts to

the most interesting stuff starts to
 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.310
the most interesting stuff starts to
emerge zooming into that we can kind of

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320
emerge zooming into that we can kind of
 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.140
emerge zooming into that we can kind of
see here that there's kind of very

do if you were in the bottom quartile to

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640
it begin to rise and the other one that
 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.100
it begin to rise and the other one that
we've identified kind of calling it the

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110
we've identified kind of calling it the
 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.900
we've identified kind of calling it the
gorge here is where we actually see

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910
gorge here is where we actually see
 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.490

so these are two kind of patterns that

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.070
so these are two kind of patterns that
 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.500
so these are two kind of patterns that
are worth checking for in your own game

we also want to maximize our downnow
 

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.800
we also want to maximize our downnow
ratio since the higher that is it means

would be equal to our Mau
 

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.900
would be equal to our Mau
meaning that nobody would ever turn out

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:09.910
meaning that nobody would ever turn out
 

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.010
meaning that nobody would ever turn out
of the game they'd come back every

of the game they'd come back every
 

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.689
of the game they'd come back every

out of the game new installs turn out
because of poor retention even our kind

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:19.510
because of poor retention even our kind

lot of developers look at these would

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:29.380
lot of developers look at these would
 

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.080
lot of developers look at these would
like the down wow ratio and the down mal

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:31.090
like the down wow ratio and the down mal
 

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.050
like the down wow ratio and the down mal
ratio and kind of to give you some ideas

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:34.060
ratio and kind of to give you some ideas
 

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.870
ratio and kind of to give you some ideas
about what you should shoot for 55% for

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880
about what you should shoot for 55% for
 

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.399
about what you should shoot for 55% for
a Dow Wow ratio puts you right at the

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:38.409
a Dow Wow ratio puts you right at the
 

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:39.870
a Dow Wow ratio puts you right at the
median so that's kind of a good starting

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880
median so that's kind of a good starting
 

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.839
median so that's kind of a good starting
place and 31% for that down now ratio is

00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:42.849
place and 31% for that down now ratio is
 

00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:44.850
place and 31% for that down now ratio is
kind of again a good starting place to

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:44.860
kind of again a good starting place to
 

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.829
kind of again a good starting place to
shoot for but ideally you want to be

00:08:46.829 --> 00:08:46.839
shoot for but ideally you want to be
 

00:08:46.839 --> 00:08:48.900
shoot for but ideally you want to be
much better than that and something to

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:48.910
much better than that and something to
 

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.130
much better than that and something to
consider when you're looking at it and

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:50.140
consider when you're looking at it and
 

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.350
consider when you're looking at it and
trying to improve these relationships or

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:52.360
trying to improve these relationships or
 

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.700
trying to improve these relationships or
these ratios

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:53.710
these ratios
 

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.740
these ratios
is actually the relationship between the

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:55.750
is actually the relationship between the
 

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.080
is actually the relationship between the
two of them this is the plot that I had

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.090
two of them this is the plot that I had
 

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.540
two of them this is the plot that I had
never done on the developer side they

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:00.550
never done on the developer side they
 

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:01.560
never done on the developer side they
didn't really have enough data points

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:01.570
didn't really have enough data points
 

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.200
didn't really have enough data points
but in leveraging the Google Play data I

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:04.210
but in leveraging the Google Play data I
 

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.000
but in leveraging the Google Play data I
was able to create this and what it had

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.010
was able to create this and what it had
 

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.550
was able to create this and what it had
does is it has the dow l ratio on the x

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560
does is it has the dow l ratio on the x
 

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.260
does is it has the dow l ratio on the x
axis and the down mound ratio on the y

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:10.270
axis and the down mound ratio on the y
 

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.120
axis and the down mound ratio on the y
axis and what we can actually see is

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.130
axis and what we can actually see is
 

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.160
axis and what we can actually see is
this very strong linear relationship

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.170
this very strong linear relationship
 

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.290
this very strong linear relationship
between the two and what this helps us

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:16.300
between the two and what this helps us
 

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.520
between the two and what this helps us
to understand is that we want to

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:17.530
to understand is that we want to
 

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.350
to understand is that we want to
increase our monthly active users and

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360
increase our monthly active users and
 

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.600
increase our monthly active users and
our monthly uniques we can actually

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:21.610
our monthly uniques we can actually
 

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.090
our monthly uniques we can actually
start not by testing changes that

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:24.100
start not by testing changes that
 

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.190
start not by testing changes that
function over an entire month but test

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:35.480
be much more compelling and much more
impactful now the last thing I want to

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:35.490
impactful now the last thing I want to
 

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.310

kind of focus on monetization and this

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320
kind of focus on monetization and this
 

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.300
kind of focus on monetization and this
is what I'm going to be talking about

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:38.310
is what I'm going to be talking about
 

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:39.500
is what I'm going to be talking about
it's a metric that I use really

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:39.510
it's a metric that I use really
 

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.120
it's a metric that I use really
successfully and really effectively when

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:41.130
successfully and really effectively when
 

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.520
successfully and really effectively when
it's working on the developer side and

it's working on the developer side and
 

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.230
it's working on the developer side and
what it does what it will do is it's

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.240
what it does what it will do is it's
 

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.700
what it does what it will do is it's
gonna help us understand and answer the

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:46.710
gonna help us understand and answer the
 

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.340
gonna help us understand and answer the
question of our payers healthy

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:48.350
question of our payers healthy
 

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.800
question of our payers healthy
generically speaking the industry has

kind of reference singular data points

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:53.100
kind of reference singular data points
 

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.190
kind of reference singular data points
made claims to the effect of only 2% of

made claims to the effect of only 2% of
 

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.260
made claims to the effect of only 2% of
payers actually pay however that's kind

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:57.270
payers actually pay however that's kind
 

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.610
payers actually pay however that's kind
of horribly misleading as a statement

00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:58.620
of horribly misleading as a statement
 

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.380
of horribly misleading as a statement
because that's generally speaking that's

because that's generally speaking that's
 

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:01.760
because that's generally speaking that's
gonna be focused more on that daily by

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:01.770
gonna be focused more on that daily by
 

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.830
gonna be focused more on that daily by
our conversion number it takes know it

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:13.650
and so what you can kind of do to take a
 

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.710
and so what you can kind of do to take a
look at to understand your payers health

I found that we're most impactful were

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:30.900
I found that we're most impactful were
 

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.800

because we're always trying to convert

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:56.250
because we're always trying to convert
 

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.980
because we're always trying to convert
first-time users but then once they've

first-time users but then once they've
 

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.300
first-time users but then once they've
converted we need to create incentives

00:13:59.300 --> 00:13:59.310
converted we need to create incentives
 

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.010

what I'm going to talk through here is

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000
what I'm going to talk through here is
 

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.820
what I'm going to talk through here is
an example game and kind of show you

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:07.830
an example game and kind of show you
 

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:09.200
an example game and kind of show you
some trends and some patterns in the

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:09.210
some trends and some patterns in the
 

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.060
some trends and some patterns in the
daily buyer conversion and how they've

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:11.070
daily buyer conversion and how they've
 

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.790
daily buyer conversion and how they've
impacted various Powder ratios there's

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800
impacted various Powder ratios there's
 

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.050
impacted various Powder ratios there's
three events that I want to call it on

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.060
three events that I want to call it on
 

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.360
three events that I want to call it on
this chart and the first is this medium

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:17.370
this chart and the first is this medium
 

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.580
this chart and the first is this medium
duration event that occurred basically

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:19.590
duration event that occurred basically
 

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.860
duration event that occurred basically
at the end of January to the beginning

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:21.870
at the end of January to the beginning
 

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.320
at the end of January to the beginning
of February maybe two two and a half

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:24.330
of February maybe two two and a half
 

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.570
of February maybe two two and a half
three week period and what we saw here

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:26.580
three week period and what we saw here
 

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.520
three week period and what we saw here
is that this event provided a

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:28.530
is that this event provided a
 

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.440
is that this event provided a
substantial increase to the daily buyer

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:30.450
substantial increase to the daily buyer
 

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.290
substantial increase to the daily buyer
conversion the other two events are

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:33.300
conversion the other two events are
 

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.540
conversion the other two events are
event B and C each of these occurred for

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:35.550
event B and C each of these occurred for
 

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.230
event B and C each of these occurred for
about a day

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240
about a day
 

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.850
about a day
they were sales and they created a

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:37.860
they were sales and they created a
 

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.880
they were sales and they created a
substantial 130 percent increase in that

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:40.890
substantial 130 percent increase in that
 

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.130
substantial 130 percent increase in that
daily buyer conversion

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:42.140
daily buyer conversion
 

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.450
daily buyer conversion
both all three of these are really

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:44.460
both all three of these are really
 

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.190
both all three of these are really
really effective but it's interesting to

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:46.200
really effective but it's interesting to
 

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.840
really effective but it's interesting to
see what they did with the Powder ratios

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:49.850
 
 

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:52.820
 
so looking at the seven-day ratio where

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:52.830
so looking at the seven-day ratio where
 

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.830
so looking at the seven-day ratio where
we can actually see is that event a was

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:54.840
we can actually see is that event a was
 

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.470
we can actually see is that event a was
extremely effective at monetizing a very

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480
extremely effective at monetizing a very
 

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.990
extremely effective at monetizing a very
wide number of users and effectively

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000
wide number of users and effectively
 

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.370
wide number of users and effectively
this event it actually caused a lot of

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:03.380
this event it actually caused a lot of
 

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.370
this event it actually caused a lot of
non buyers or occasional buyers to pay

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:07.380
non buyers or occasional buyers to pay
 

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.930
non buyers or occasional buyers to pay
and open their wallets during that time

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940
and open their wallets during that time
 

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.540
and open their wallets during that time
versus events B and C which got

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:11.550
versus events B and C which got
 

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.220
versus events B and C which got
significant increases to buyer

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:13.230
significant increases to buyer
 

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.920
significant increases to buyer
conversion on that date but it didn't do

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:15.930
conversion on that date but it didn't do
 

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.720
conversion on that date but it didn't do
much to incentivize the occasional

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:17.730
much to incentivize the occasional
 

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.060
much to incentivize the occasional
buyers to open their wallets in pay so

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:20.070
buyers to open their wallets in pay so
 

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.230
buyers to open their wallets in pay so
something that you can think about as

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240
something that you can think about as
 

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.670
something that you can think about as
you monitor the performance of the game

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680
you monitor the performance of the game
 

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.710
you monitor the performance of the game
of the supply-side sales and the demand

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720
of the supply-side sales and the demand
 

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.930
of the supply-side sales and the demand
side events in your game try to

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940
side events in your game try to
 

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.850
side events in your game try to
understand who is actually paying during

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:28.860
understand who is actually paying during
 

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.800
understand who is actually paying during
their periods those periods

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:30.810
their periods those periods
 

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:33.560
their periods those periods
what is what are the motivating factors

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:33.570
what is what are the motivating factors
 

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.570
what is what are the motivating factors
what are the incentives what is kind of

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:35.580
what are the incentives what is kind of
 

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.220
what are the incentives what is kind of
driving those players to open their

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:37.230
driving those players to open their
 

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.830
driving those players to open their
wallets and you can also not just the

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:39.840
wallets and you can also not just the
 

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.810
wallets and you can also not just the
seven-day but I was mentioning you have

monetization models it might be as much
 

00:16:18.839 --> 00:16:21.200
monetization models it might be as much
as 3% but what you can do is take your

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:21.210
as 3% but what you can do is take your
 

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.730
as 3% but what you can do is take your
daily buyer conversion and if you look

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:22.740
daily buyer conversion and if you look
 

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.320
daily buyer conversion and if you look
at your seven-day pound out value it

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:24.330
at your seven-day pound out value it
 

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.350
at your seven-day pound out value it
should be four times higher the 30-day

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360
should be four times higher the 30-day
 

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.240

that would be 11 percent of your DEA you
 

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.579
that would be 11 percent of your DEA you
so think about how can you actually

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:10.589
so think about how can you actually
 

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:11.750
so think about how can you actually
incentivize these players

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760

here's a few things to consider let's
say your game that does run supply set

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700

you segment by average transaction value

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:39.780
you segment by average transaction value
 

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.960
you segment by average transaction value
and in doing so limit the amount of
