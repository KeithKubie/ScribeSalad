00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:07.233
HOST: Of approximately 61,000
residents in Utica, New York,

00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:10.700
nearly 11,000 are
immigrants and refugees.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.834
And 450 or more
arrive here each year.

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:21.000
Utica was a manufacturing
town in the 1970s and 1980s.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.133
Some of our factories
began to leave,

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.633
and our population
began to decline.

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:30.100
But then later in the
1980s, in came the refugees.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.033
They began to buy houses.

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:33.467
You drive around
East Utica, you'll

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:37.000
see many businesses are
run by some of the refugees

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.300
from other countries.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.567
And would you say that they
have revived the economy?

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:42.667
I think it's been a godsend.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:49.133

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.233
CHRIS SUNDERLIN:
Hi, how are you?

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:51.200
HOST: What's your name?
-Chris.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.667
HOST: Do you run this place?

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:54.800
CHRIS SUNDERLIN:
Yeah, collectively.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.433
HOST: Chris Sunderlin helps to
run the Midtown Utica Community

00:00:58.433 --> 00:00:59.567
Center.

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:01.667
And this place is
a bit of a hangout.

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:03.867
It just seems like a bag of fun.

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:05.934
It is also a place
for anyone to come

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:08.367
and dance, and play, and learn.

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:12.033
They provide food assistance
programs and more.

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:13.066
Where are you from?

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.266
Kenya.

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:18.600
We're Somali Bantu, but we
left Somalia due to war.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.300
That must have been a very
hard decision for them,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.200
when they left Kenya
to come to America.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.600
WOMAN: Did what was--
what she thought was

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.667
right for her and her family.

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:26.934
HOST: Yeah.

00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:30.033
With the afternoon vibe of
this place in full swing,

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:32.166
Chris and I took
a moment to chat.

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.400
Are there people
in Utica who are

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.900
uncomfortable with the levels
of refugees that come here?

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.266
Yes, the wonderful older
woman who owned the house,

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:44.400
she asked me one day why
there were so many Asians

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.233
moving onto the street.

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:49.834
I said, I don't know, but
they're cleaning up the block.

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:51.066
HOST: And is that true?

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:53.767
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:57.433
If I took-- I should have
taken pictures six years ago.

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:59.700
HOST: And this street has
quite a high concentration

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.767
of refugees, right?

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:03.834
Yes, and it's all
come full circle.

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:05.400
There's a health clinic there.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.033
There's three different
grocery stores.

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:09.233
So this area is getting better?

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:10.033
Yeah.

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:13.900
[music playing]

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.967
There's a lot more that the
United States and the rest

00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:17.633
of the international
community can

00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:21.433
do to more effectively address
the global refugee crisis.

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:26.166
We have to protect the rights of
refugees to flee their country.

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:27.967
And when they get to
a neighboring country,

00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:30.433
refugees need to be able
to access education.

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:32.266
And they need to
be able to work.

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:33.867
If they can't do those
things, they're not

00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:35.233
going to be able to stay there.

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:37.667
They're not going to be able
to support their families.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:40.433
They're going to be a constant
risk of being returned

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:42.500
back to face danger and harm.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.834
Most of us come from
immigrant families.

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:52.300
My grandmother and grandfather
came from Italy in the 1890s.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.934
They were welcomed here.

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:58.033
Who am I not to
welcome refugees here?
