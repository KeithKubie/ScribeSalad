runtime permission model letting you
 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.839
runtime permission model letting you
control when your app ask for a

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849
control when your app ask for a
 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.539
control when your app ask for a
permission when and how you ask for a

permission when and how you ask for a
 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.609

permission model and show you how to
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.550
permission model and show you how to
design a UX for asking for permission

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560
design a UX for asking for permission
 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.729
design a UX for asking for permission
that's appropriate to your apps needs

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739
that's appropriate to your apps needs
 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.260

now the purpose of permissions is to

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270
now the purpose of permissions is to
 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.780
now the purpose of permissions is to
protect your users privacy when you ask

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790
protect your users privacy when you ask
 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.520
protect your users privacy when you ask
for permission you're asking them to

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530
for permission you're asking them to
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.290
for permission you're asking them to
give up a little bit of that privacy and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300
give up a little bit of that privacy and
 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.540
give up a little bit of that privacy and
as such you need to offer a clear and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550
as such you need to offer a clear and
 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.310
as such you need to offer a clear and
equal benefit in exchange for that

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320
equal benefit in exchange for that
 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.490
equal benefit in exchange for that
access runtime permissions allow you to

access runtime permissions allow you to
 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.439
access runtime permissions allow you to
choose the right time to ask for

choose the right time to ask for
 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.090
choose the right time to ask for
permission when the user has more

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100

prompting can be unnecessary and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
prompting can be unnecessary and
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.230
prompting can be unnecessary and
annoying and you can achieve the same

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
annoying and you can achieve the same
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.570
annoying and you can achieve the same
effect by asking at the right time and

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580
effect by asking at the right time and
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.229
effect by asking at the right time and
in the right way we break down the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239
in the right way we break down the
 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.640
in the right way we break down the
different approaches to asking for

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
different approaches to asking for
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.250
different approaches to asking for

missions across two dimensions firstly
how important is the permission to your

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299
how important is the permission to your
 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.259
how important is the permission to your
apps operation and secondly how clear is

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269
apps operation and secondly how clear is
 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.839
apps operation and secondly how clear is
it why you're asking for it depending on

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849
it why you're asking for it depending on
 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.000
it why you're asking for it depending on
these two factors we recommend different

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010
these two factors we recommend different
 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.800
these two factors we recommend different
approaches to how you ask for the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810
approaches to how you ask for the
 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.470
approaches to how you ask for the
permission if the need for a permission

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480
permission if the need for a permission
 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.929
permission if the need for a permission
is both critical to your app and obvious

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939
is both critical to your app and obvious
 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.030
is both critical to your app and obvious
why it's needed then we recommend asking

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040
why it's needed then we recommend asking
 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.059
why it's needed then we recommend asking
upfront for example if you're making an

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069
upfront for example if you're making an
 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.520
upfront for example if you're making an
SMS app then the SMS permission is

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530
SMS app then the SMS permission is
 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.830
SMS app then the SMS permission is
absolutely critical for you to function

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840
absolutely critical for you to function
 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.569
absolutely critical for you to function
and it's crystal clear why you're asking

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579
and it's crystal clear why you're asking
 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.819
and it's crystal clear why you're asking
for it don't bother your users with any

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829
for it don't bother your users with any
 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.220
for it don't bother your users with any
unnecessary explanations just request

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230
unnecessary explanations just request
 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.979
unnecessary explanations just request
the permissions straight away if a

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989
the permissions straight away if a
 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.390
the permissions straight away if a
permission is really important to your

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400
permission is really important to your
 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.420
permission is really important to your
app but not immediately obvious why then

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430
app but not immediately obvious why then
 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.020
app but not immediately obvious why then
we recommend educating before asking if

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030
we recommend educating before asking if
 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.369
we recommend educating before asking if
your app uses some kind of user

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379
your app uses some kind of user
 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.020
your app uses some kind of user
onboarding then this would be a great

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030
onboarding then this would be a great
 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.879
onboarding then this would be a great
opportunity to tell them about this

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889
opportunity to tell them about this
 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.429
opportunity to tell them about this
killer feature then go ahead and ask for

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439
killer feature then go ahead and ask for
 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.250
killer feature then go ahead and ask for
the permission so for example if a key

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260
the permission so for example if a key
 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.589
the permission so for example if a key
part of your note-taking app is that it

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599
part of your note-taking app is that it
 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.300
part of your note-taking app is that it
logs the location where you made a note

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310
logs the location where you made a note
 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.429
logs the location where you made a note
you'd want to educate your users about

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439
you'd want to educate your users about
 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.619
you'd want to educate your users about
that upfront and then ask for the

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629
that upfront and then ask for the
 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.640
that upfront and then ask for the
permission next up if a secondary

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650
permission next up if a secondary
 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.470
permission next up if a secondary
feature of your app needs a permission

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480
feature of your app needs a permission
 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.789
feature of your app needs a permission
but it's clear why then ask in context

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799
but it's clear why then ask in context
 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.220
but it's clear why then ask in context
for example if your note-taking app lets

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230
for example if your note-taking app lets
