00:00:10.736 --> 00:00:13.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At a small school
in rural south Georgia,

00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:18.196
teacher and IT director, Vicki,
uses every kind of technology

00:00:18.246 --> 00:00:20.016
to connect her students to the world.

00:00:20.016 --> 00:00:23.116
&gt;&gt;Vicki: And then you have to put a
hyperlink to your Google doc, okay?

00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:26.186
&gt;&gt;I blog at the Cool
Cat Teacher blog,

00:00:26.346 --> 00:00:28.536
which has about six thousand readers.

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:30.186
It just won the Edublog award

00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:32.236
for best teacher blog
in the world this year.

00:00:32.596 --> 00:00:33.986
And I've traveled a bit,

00:00:34.526 --> 00:00:37.596
talking about what we're
doing, but I teach full time.

00:00:37.596 --> 00:00:38.266
That's my focus.

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:42.176
&gt;&gt;What are some of the things
that you have learned how to do

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:43.896
that you think are very interesting?

00:00:43.996 --> 00:00:46.886
&gt;&gt;I believe every student can
learn, every child can learn,

00:00:47.326 --> 00:00:50.166
but where children have trouble
is when you have only paper,

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:53.516
and only pencil, then
only certain types

00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:55.746
of children are going to succeed.

00:00:56.046 --> 00:00:56.586
&gt;&gt;Who's the avatar team?

00:00:56.586 --> 00:00:57.236
Raise your hand.

00:00:58.396 --> 00:01:01.836
You? Okay, Tuesday, the
avatar team is teaching.

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.276
&gt;&gt;I don't have to be
in front all the time.

00:01:04.726 --> 00:01:06.706
I need to look for rich experiences.

00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:08.236
I like to call myself
a teacherpreneur.

00:01:08.676 --> 00:01:10.436
I'm looking at the students I have.

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:12.676
I'm looking at their
strengths, their interests,

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:16.666
and I'm accomplishing the curriculum,
but I'm customizing what happens

00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:19.476
in the classroom according
to that group of students.

00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:23.716
&gt;&gt;You have to click on object
and change your X, Y and Z.

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:26.376
&gt;&gt;I focus on teaching them
how to learn new software.

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:31.316
Learning how to learn, using the
Wiki, how to blog effectively,

00:01:31.546 --> 00:01:35.666
collaborating effectively,
being very comfortable

00:01:35.736 --> 00:01:37.406
with just about any technology.

00:01:37.636 --> 00:01:40.686
&gt;&gt;On our class Wiki-- everybody
remember where our Wiki is?

00:01:40.686 --> 00:01:43.966
You're going to go to the
class Wiki and make sure

00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.576
that I have a link
to your Google doc --

00:01:46.026 --> 00:01:49.236
&gt;&gt;A lotta times I use new
terms, and I expect them

00:01:49.236 --> 00:01:50.516
to Google it and look it up.

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:54.646
That's a literacy-- you know, how
do I find new terms and look it up?

00:01:54.646 --> 00:01:57.116
I don't have to define
everything and I shouldn't.

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:57.976
They should be thinkers.

00:01:58.146 --> 00:01:59.476
&gt;&gt;Have you all brainstormed
some ways?

00:01:59.476 --> 00:02:01.516
You have about another
minute and a half or two.

00:02:01.516 --> 00:02:05.486
You all brainstorm some
ways that you can use this

00:02:05.486 --> 00:02:07.746
to teach digital citizenship.

00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:11.236
&gt;&gt;In this class, students are
learning a virtual life program

00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:13.976
called Open Sim by
helping to teach it.

00:02:13.976 --> 00:02:16.316
&gt;&gt;Student: So you're all
allowed to come to me.

00:02:16.316 --> 00:02:17.766
&gt;&gt;Vicki: So many teachers think that,

00:02:18.086 --> 00:02:20.306
I need to know everything
before I teach it,

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:23.716
and that is absolutely
the wrong thing to think.

00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:26.106
Because you think about the
empowerment these students have

00:02:26.456 --> 00:02:28.516
when they find out and
they figure it out.

00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:29.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Pull up your mini--

00:02:29.976 --> 00:02:31.766
&gt;&gt;Vicki: Look at what
they did in three days.

00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:33.986
They changed their avatars.

00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:35.056
They learned to terraform.

00:02:35.146 --> 00:02:37.986
I did not teach the terraforming
group how to terraform.

00:02:38.436 --> 00:02:39.386
They were teaching me.

00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:42.176
I literally didn't know how
to terraform until today.

00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:43.646
It's just phenomenal.

00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:47.336
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Davis and Julie
Lindsey, a teacher in Qatar,

00:02:47.826 --> 00:02:50.576
founded the global
collaborative project, Digi Teen.

00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:54.636
Students from around the world
studied digital citizenship

00:02:54.726 --> 00:02:57.266
by researching, writing
and posting their work

00:02:57.406 --> 00:02:59.056
through two digital portals.

00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:02.956
On the Digi Teen Wiki,
students post their research

00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:04.696
and writings on assigned topics.

00:03:04.696 --> 00:03:05.586
&gt;&gt;Vicki: And you all, I don't mind

00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:07.836
if you grab the information
off of there to link--

00:03:07.836 --> 00:03:10.616
&gt;&gt;And on the Digi Teen
social network, teachers

00:03:10.616 --> 00:03:12.976
and students connect,
blog and share ideas.

00:03:13.596 --> 00:03:16.146
&gt;&gt;Virginia: The most recent blog
I'm very proud of is the rights

00:03:16.146 --> 00:03:19.826
and responsibilities blog that
I did with like so many people

00:03:19.826 --> 00:03:21.626
from around the world on Digi Teen.

00:03:22.316 --> 00:03:25.846
&gt;&gt;Davis and Lindsey also created
the Flat Classroom project.

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:29.026
&gt;&gt;Vicki: The Flat Classroom
project lets the students study

00:03:29.116 --> 00:03:32.386
and experience the trends
in information technology,

00:03:32.736 --> 00:03:36.136
by collaboratively writing
reports with other students

00:03:36.586 --> 00:03:39.686
and creating videos where they
have to outsource part of it

00:03:39.726 --> 00:03:43.106
to the other students, so they
experience the trends and learn

00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:45.096
about the trends with
students all over the world.

00:03:46.036 --> 00:03:50.216
&gt;&gt;In January, 2009, Davis and
several of her students traveled

00:03:50.216 --> 00:03:53.346
to the Middle East to attend
the Flat Classroom Conference.

00:03:54.076 --> 00:03:55.116
&gt;&gt;Betty: We're in a rural setting.

00:03:55.116 --> 00:03:58.946
I mean, we're in south Georgia, about
as rural as you can get, but yet,

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:02.406
she has got us connected to the
world, and she has got our children,

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:06.186
who are basically rural children,
with a whole new perspective

00:04:06.356 --> 00:04:09.306
of possibilities, of
what's out there.

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:14.076
&gt;&gt;Vicki: I believe this whole idea
of sorta turning school upside down

00:04:14.076 --> 00:04:16.846
and empowering students
to share with one another.

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:19.626
If you can empower them, you're just
going to have a better classroom.

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:19.736
&gt;&gt;Okay.

00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:27.976
