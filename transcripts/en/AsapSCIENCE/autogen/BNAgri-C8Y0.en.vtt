00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.820
 Since 2.5 million years ago, humanity has begun to eat meat. 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.780
 Before that, our ancestors followed a plant system made up of berries and flowers 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.680
 Later humankind began to eat more seeds and nuts, which gave them more fat 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.280
 And less fiber, then our bodies began to prepare to eat meat. 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.620
 But what happens if we eat meat only? 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.500
 Without eating high-fiber foods such as lentils, beans and broccoli 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.220
 You will get constipated and feel uncomfortable. 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.260
 Not to mention that the easiest way to make energy in the body 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.760
 Are converting carbohydrates into glucose. 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.660
 In the absence of carbohydrates, your body will burn fat and crush the necessary proteins. 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.580
 The process of making glucose from the protein is called the development of glucose, 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.160
 It occurs in the liver and leads to the formation of nitrogen residues which in turn turn into urea. 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.480
 But a lot of urea leads to protein poisoning, 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.460
 Causing nausea and diarrhea and increasing the risk of death. 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.640
 Even if you eat meat as dry as rabbit meat, which contains very little fat 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.580
 Where you can eat a lot and lots of it and eventually become lean. 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.860
 Another killer is vitamin C deficiency. 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.340
 Humans are organisms that can not form vitamin C themselves. 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.760
 Without vitamin C in fruits and vegetables, 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.720
 Your body will not be able to make effective collagen 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.160
 It is a structural protein that can be found in tendons, ligaments and skin. 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.440
 This will increase your risk of scurvy, which causes slow wound healing 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.140
 Gingival necrosis and personality changes. 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.120
 If you are not treated, you will die from infection or bleeding. 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.220
 But eating raw meat can prevent it from happening 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.360
 Cooked meat reduces vitamin C, 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.860
 But the whale and fat of the raw and thick whales is rich in rubber collagen, with one serving (100 grams) containing 36 milligrams of vitamin C. 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.920
 More than 10 milligrams of grams needed to prevent scurvy. 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.880
 This leads us to an interesting situation, 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.720
 Caused by low temperatures and difficult environment 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.460
 The traditional Esquimos diet depends on what fish and fish they eat 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.320
 And few plant foods, dairy products and carbohydrates if any. 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.860
 However, the heart rate is half that of Americans and Canadians. 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.400
 How can you be healthy by following a diet rich in fat and not containing fruit or vegetables? 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.100
 You can eat snacks of meat as liver in order to get your recommended share of vitamin A. 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.840
 Which is essential for eyes, bones and vitamin D (essential for your bones as well) 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.140
 Fish oil rich in omega-3 fatty acids that will benefit the heart and blood vessels. 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.360
 Eskimo bodies have adapted to glucose control, and have helped them have a heavier liver than usual 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.600
 And increased urine volumes to get rid of extra urea. 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.760
 A recent genetic study of Eskimo genes in Greenland, 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.300
 They found a variety of alternatives that cause protective effects on cholesterol and triglycerides. 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.780
 So they can rely on meat only, 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.500
 But it is important to know that communities in the North of the world have relied on animal food as a result of the conditions and urgency. 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.940
 The goal of a high-fat diet is to maintain their weight throughout the fishing period, or when food is not available 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.540
 Not for weight loss, such as low-carb modern diets. 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.200
 Unless you plan to eat whale fat and organic meat 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.540
 Your genes were in good shape. Maintain a balanced diet that includes all major food groups. 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.540
