00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:08.167
MercadoLibre is the largest Latin American e-commerce platform

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:12.625
providing solutions for payments, transfers, credits,

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:15.417
and classifieds for all the users operating through our platform.

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:18.333
We had a lot of downloads

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:20.750
but too many users were uninstalling the app overall

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:23.875
because of installation size and performance

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:26.708
since many of them

00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:29.250
have lower end mobile devices.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.875
We looked back at our code to better compile 
   the app for different architectures.

00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:36.250
We had, for example, 30 APKs.

00:00:36.292 --> 00:00:38.000
In our code, we did several things like reducing

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.375
the app’s external libraries,

00:00:40.417 --> 00:00:42.792
that we were using at the app.

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:46.542
The app’s installation size shrank from 40 MB to about 10 MB

00:00:46.542 --> 00:00:49.042
since we made those changes,

00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:50.792
that was immediately reflected

00:00:50.792 --> 00:00:53.500
in the installation and uninstallation rates.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.750
My advice for any developer

00:00:56.792 --> 00:00:59.542
looking to build an app

00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:02.250
for a market like Latin America

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.333
is to pay special attention 
   to both the app’s download size and also its install size.

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:11.708
We like to build games that appeal
   to a wide audience,

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:14.125
but also showcase something new

00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:15.958
and innovative.

00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.333
Fanatee’s most famous 
   game is “Stop.”

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:21.167
Stop has over 15 million Android downloads.

00:01:21.208 --> 00:01:24.917
And today, “CodyCross” has even
   more active users than “Stop.”

00:01:25.292 --> 00:01:27.667
Localization is important for any mobile game.

00:01:27.708 --> 00:01:30.625
We end up re-building a game 
   from the ground up

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:34.125
every time we launch it in a new country,
   so both the translation of text

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:37.042
and the building of puzzles are done
   very carefully,

00:01:37.083 --> 00:01:40.250
all of this has a big impact on our ratings.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.333
Developers’ main challenge in Latin America

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:45.500
is building and scaling a global business.

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:48.917
Latin American cultures are often too focused
   on local economies.

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:52.750
This is especially true in Brazil 
   due to its huge size and population,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.750
but the business of apps and games
   is more global in nature.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.458
You must shape your product

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.375
to be successful in all those countries.

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:06.333
In the Latin American market, 70% of persons were overweight.

00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:09.208
And only 3% of people had access to gyms.

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:13.958
With InstaFit users can without inconvenience,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.625
without spending too much, without having to go to a gym,

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:19.833
they can have routines in the comfort of their home,

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:22.750
all able to be completed in about 20 sq ft

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:23.958
and without equipment.

00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:28.833
Last year, we grew 450% with our Android subscriber base

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:32.917
due to the fact that we hired a better team of internal developers

00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:35.833
and we started doing much more optimization experiments

00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:38.542
in user acquisition and user retention

00:02:38.542 --> 00:02:40.125
exclusively on Android.

00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:43.250
One of our experiments included changing

00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:46.708
our trial period from 7 days to 30 days.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:50.792
And that had an immediate impact

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:53.958
of a 25% increase in the volume of our free trials.

00:02:54.583 --> 00:02:59.000
Understanding your users and supporting 
   them through their experience with the app

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.500
lets you build a business

00:03:00.542 --> 00:03:03.125
that is growing with a loyal user base

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:05.250
that stays with you for a long time.

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:08.417
Mobills is a free platform and app,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.333
which people can use to take control 
   of their finances.

00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:14.083
However if users want to access

00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:16.250
all the app’s features,

00:03:16.292 --> 00:03:18.042
they pay a monthly subscription.

00:03:18.458 --> 00:03:20.542
This year we saw a spike in growth

00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:23.417
for Android subscriptions.

00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:25.458
Until the middle of the year, we saw growth

00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:28.583
in more than 55% of active subscriptions.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:31.958
That happened because we implemented 
   new tools.

00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:35.250
After we implemented the grace period,

00:03:35.292 --> 00:03:38.375
which gives users seven days to resolve

00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:40.958
any payment issues,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.875
we saw the number of involuntary churn drop 40%

00:03:45.417 --> 00:03:48.083
We also recognized a problem

00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:50.958
in just how many of our users were using

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.917
our application for free 
   over extended periods of time.

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:57.125
By coordinating the introductory
   price with Firebase,

00:03:57.167 --> 00:04:00.125
we developed a strategy to grant discounts

00:04:00.167 --> 00:04:03.125
to these users in a progressive way.

00:04:03.625 --> 00:04:05.708
I would advise other developers

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.083
to utilize all the tools available through
    Google Play Console.

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:12.833
Implement the grace period
    to reduce involuntary churns,

00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:16.292
employ the introductory price
    in order to offer discounts

00:04:16.292 --> 00:04:18.500
for users who aren’t subscribed yet,

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:21.000
keep working on the app’s quality

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.792
and build an app with an excellent usability.

00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:26.917
Quality has been foundational 
   to the development of our business.
