00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:31.350
- [Narrator 2] We are the paradoxical ape,
bipedal, naked, large-brained, long the

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.200
master of fire, tools, and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:48.640
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.140
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.560
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:11.340
to exchange insights on who we are and how
we got there, an exploration made possible

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.141
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:20.890
- [William Ruddiman] This is kind
of the transition talk between the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:31.600
relatively deep past and the very recent
past and present and future, so there is a

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.470
debate going on about this. I'm talking
about the last 10,000 years, when

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.570
agriculture developed. There is a debate
going on or discussion going on in the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:50.130
community. If you asked the average
geoscientist "Are humans now in control of

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.020
the world, the atmosphere, the water,
the soil, everything else?" I think you'd

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.401
get pretty much a 100%
response "Yes."

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.970
The debate or discussion is about whether
to define a particular time when that

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.240
began and on that, there is less
unanimity, and I'm somewhat toward one

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:20.720
extreme of that argument. I was asked to
write a prospective piece, and I'm sorry

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.110
this is not the most exciting slide in the
world. You can at least read the title,

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.770
and it's about this discussion and about
this, about defining this epic we live in.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:40.480
Whether to do it in a very recent time,
and there's a proposal out from a group in

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:49.660
London, geologists, cartographers to make
it the 1945, 1950 era because all kinds of

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.230
things started to happen that humans
hadn't been doing before then.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.010
And because bomb testing began then and
these isotopes that people have been

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:06.630
talking about were spread widely in the
ocean and the ocean sediments and in ice

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:14.290
cores, and so there is a move afoot to say
the Anthropocene, the start of the human

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:22.110
domination of the planet, is in the 1950s,
and this slide shows a dark-colored bar

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:29.180
down the right center part which defines
that era. It actually shows the industrial

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.380
era, which is the last 200 years, and
there is substantial support for this

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.941
suggestion to do to this.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:45.320
However, some of us who work back on
somewhat longer time scales favor a longer

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:54.370
interval of human influence on the earth
extending back about 10,000 years to the

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:01.700
earliest major domestication and dispersal
of crops and livestock and a series of

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.071
things that happened and accelerated
since that time.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.240
So that's what I'm going to talk about.
I'm going to take you back 10,000 years

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:17.350
and tell you what we were up to as we
became agricultural people. There's been a

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.650
community sense - this is a kind of
cartoon version I drew about five or six

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.150
years ago of the little figure that is in
the right insert on your program, and this

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.801
is pretty close. It's a schematic.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.030
You notice that nice wrinkle in the
deglaciation point, so you're coming from

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.210
glacial cold temperatures up into
interglacial, the modern interglacial

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:51.220
warmth. It peaks out and then it starts to
decline slightly towards the present, and

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:58.800
now we are taking off into worlds unknown
with the Industrial Revolution. This is

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.370
the picture of climate for the last 20,000
years that prevailed through the 1900s

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.510
right to the turn of the century.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:13.590
Here's a picture I think is correct. You
notice it is the same from the glacial

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:20.850
cold era coming up into the warmth, but
around 8,000 years ago in this slide,

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.560
something else starts to happen, you see
agriculture originating at the bottom of

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.960
the slide. And agriculture produced
greenhouse gas effects. There is no

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.220
disagreement about that, but there is big
disagreement about how much is the

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.910
amplitude of these greenhouse gas effects.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:45.440
So the proposal is that these
anthropogenic greenhouse gases kept the

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:52.270
climate from getting as cold as it would
have without the gases, and that in fact,

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:58.670
early farming stopped nature from taking
us back into the beginnings of a new

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:04.880
glaciation sometime in the last maybe
2,000, 3,000 years. So early farming

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.480
stopped deglaciation. It sounds radical,
but I'll take you through the steps.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.980
There are two ways to think about this. So
these are greenhouses gases that are

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:22.870
recorded in ice cores as you have already
learned. Air in the ice cores preserves

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:28.420
the amount of green house gases. Here are
two examples of this.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:34.050
The red dots show for methane at the top
and carbon dioxide at the bottom. Those

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:40.770
are the values during the last 11,000
years, the time scale along the bottom.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:46.250
There you see them both peaking, methane
and carbon dioxide peaking about 10,000

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:52.180
years ago, starting to decrease, then
climbing. Carbon dioxide comes back up

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:59.200
after about 6,000 years ago. Methane comes
back up after about 5,000 years ago.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:07.850
Also plotted on this slide in blue, dark
blue circles, is an average of the seven

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:13.180
previous interglaciations, and you've seen
that they were about every 100,000 years.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:19.320
There was an interglacial climate due to
those variations in earth's orbits. You'll

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:25.750
see that starting with methane, there was
a peak in methane about the same time as

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.560
the red circles for this interglaciation,
and then there's a decrease, not

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:36.710
dissimilar to this interglaciation. But
then instead of turning around and going

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:42.420
up, this average of all seven previous
interglaciations keeps going down and the

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:48.930
same things happens with CO2 with an even
more striking match of the current

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:54.820
interglaction and the average of the
previous interglaciations, and they part

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.341
ways about 6,000 years ago.

00:08:57.341 --> 00:09:04.840
I call this top-down evidence for human
influence, and the way to think about it

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:12.320
is really simple. If the blue circles show
previous interglaciations when no one

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:18.790
thinks humans were having massive effects
on earth's environment or its atmosphere,

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:25.500
if blue is natural and if blue is going
down, then red is not natural and so

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:32.480
something new is working in this
interglaciation. So something I say that

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:38.800
humans are doing 6,000 years ago starts to
push the CO2 curve upwards and starts to

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.471
push the methane curve upward about 5,000
years ago -- so anomalous

00:09:43.471 --> 00:09:46.271
and I say anthropogenic factor.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.100
I call that a top down view because it's
from the point of view of the atmosphere,

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:58.000
and that is half a hypothesis. If you want
a full hypothesis you need bottom-up

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.940
evidence. What is happening on the ground
? What are people actually up to? This

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:11.010
slide is a very simplified version of the
spread of agriculture. You can see, and

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.741
here I'm mapping mainly the spread, and
not the initial domestication

00:10:15.741 --> 00:10:17.401
of crops and livestock.

00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:23.000
You can see in Southwest Asia, the Eastern
Mediterranean, after about 9,000 years ago

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.720
crops which originated in the Fertile
Crescent started to spread across Europe,

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:35.600
down into the Nile River Valley, went east
into Pakistan and India. About the same

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:43.210
time in Northern China, people
domesticated crops and animals and that

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:48.690
spread at the beginning of the Han
Dynasty, the Han people I should say,

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:55.330
spread up into Korea and then the rest of
China. And then around 5,000 years ago in

00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:00.510
Southern China, the development of
irrigated rice spreads across down into

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:05.341
India, down into Southeast Asia, the
Philippines, so those are

00:11:05.341 --> 00:11:07.141
major centers of domestication.

00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:15.170
Around 5,000 years ago, the Bantu people
in tropical North Africa and sub-Saharan

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:21.270
Africa developed sufficiently impressive
agriculture that they spread all across

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:25.941
southern Africa except for South Africa
itself, one of the major

00:11:25.941 --> 00:11:28.271
migrations of human history.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:35.070
Over in the Americas, in Mexico, even
though agricultural began earlier by 4,000

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:41.330
years ago the combination of corn, beans,
avocados and tomatoes. People were

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:46.300
spreading agriculture up into North
America and down through Central America.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:53.780
And finally in the Eastern Andes, part of
the Amazon, more agriculture beginning

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:59.270
there 4,000 years ago. All of those are
happening during the time when those

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:02.330
greenhouse gas trends were going
the wrong way.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:07.610
So to go back to the methane curve shown
at the top, remember there the departure

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.280
is 5,000 years ago.
Here's a map of the spread of rice

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:18.190
agriculture through Asia. It originates
and the Yangtze River Valley.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:24.420
By 5,000 years ago, rice is fully
domesticated, and it spreads down into

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:31.661
across the rest of Asia by 1,000 years
ago, and this is based on archaeobotanical

00:12:31.661 --> 00:12:37.142
work. Now rice patties are man-made
wetlands, and wetlands are basically

00:12:37.142 --> 00:12:41.672
swamps which have swamp gas which is
methane which bubbles out of the rice

00:12:41.672 --> 00:12:47.202
patties. So the spread of rice agriculture
coincides nicely

00:12:47.202 --> 00:12:51.602
with the reversal of the methane trend.

00:12:51.602 --> 00:12:57.272
The man who did this, who is Dorian Fuller
at University College London, converted

00:12:57.272 --> 00:13:04.392
the spread of rice, and then assumed
infilling of the density of rice into

00:13:04.392 --> 00:13:10.942
estimates of total rice area. Irrigated,
that's in green, and he converted that

00:13:10.942 --> 00:13:17.202
using modern relationships to estimates of
the effect on atmospheric methane, and he

00:13:17.202 --> 00:13:23.742
got a 70 parts per billion estimate
between 5,000 and 1,000 years ago. The ice

00:13:23.742 --> 00:13:28.672
core data which I showed you earlier shows
a 100 parts per billion rise, so if his

00:13:28.672 --> 00:13:33.802
estimate's right, and there are going to
be more versions of this I'm sure, rice

00:13:33.802 --> 00:13:39.802
irrigation would explain 70 percent of the
rise in the methane trend. Remember also

00:13:39.802 --> 00:13:44.602
the full anomaly also would include the
fact that the methane trend should have

00:13:44.602 --> 00:13:47.142
gone down but it didn't, so there is more
to explain.

00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:55.002
Dorian Fuller also mapped the spread of
livestock across Africa and Asia, and you

00:13:55.002 --> 00:14:02.010
see that between 7,000 and 5,000 years
ago, the livestock are in relatively arid

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:08.080
areas. The Sahara, which is greener than,
it has grasslands because it is getting

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:14.660
some moisture, the Iranian plateau, and
Western China, but between 5,000 and 1,000

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:21.950
years ago rice spreads all the way across
India, livestock spreads across India and

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:28.410
Eastern Asia and down into South Africa
with that Bantu migration, so there will

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:33.950
be estimates of the methane contributions
from livestock too, and they will explain

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.840
more of the anomaly.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.630
Carbon dioxide at the bottom until
recently has been very tricky for a number

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:44.900
of reasons which I can't go into in this
talk, but there's been an explosion of

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:49.550
data in the last three of four years that
bears on this. Now to get carbon dioxide

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:55.400
from farming, you need to clear trees and
burn them or just let them rot, which puts

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.130
the CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:02.550
Here's a map of the spread of agriculture
across Europe beginning in the lower right

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:09.310
in the Fertile Crescent and spreading all
the way to the far reaches of Europe by

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:16.360
5,500 years ago. Interesting point, 5,500
years ago is still the late neolithic, the

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:21.510
late stone age. We don't even have bronze
age tools, but people are coming in

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:28.880
clearing forests. They are using flint,
very sophisticated flint axes, and so

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:34.740
there is agriculture all across Europe by
5,500 years ago, which is that CO2 curve

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.871
starts to rise by 6,500.

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:44.110
That doesn't begin to prove that carbon
dioxide explains that deforestation

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:49.500
explains that carbon dioxide rise, but a
paper published earlier this year

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:56.730
suggests, certainly points, in that
direction. The top left panel shows a

00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:02.880
synthesis of hundreds of cores, linked
cores that have pollen remains which

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:11.630
include grass pollen, tree pollen, and
then intermediate pollen. That's shrubs

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.271
and things that are in between.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:22.600
If you look at the trend in Part B, the
dark green forest pollen starts to

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:28.420
decrease somewhere between 6,000 and 5,000
years ago, which is just after that carbon

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:35.480
dioxide curve starts to turn up and go the
wrong way. Before you get to the

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:42.700
industrial era, you've basically gotten
rid of the forests. So this is favorable

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:48.930
to an early anthropogenic effect, a large
early anthropogenic effect. As the top

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:52.601
right shows, its based on
hundreds of cores.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:17:01.370
Parts C and D show some data from China,
not pollen data but numbers of

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:06.840
archaeological sites. It turns out the
Chinese government for decades has been

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:15.660
funding people to gather information on
the impressive early history of China, and

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:21.130
there's just thousands of data points,
archaeological data points, either

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:25.941
radiocarbon dated or correlated by
cultural remains to other

00:17:25.941 --> 00:17:27.941
sequences that are dated.

00:17:27.941 --> 00:17:35.601
So the bottom left slide shows the number
of archaeological sites 8,000 to 7,000

00:17:35.601 --> 00:17:39.900
years ago, and they are mostly down in the
Yangtze, down in the Yellow River Valley,

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:45.420
and they are fairly sparse. By 4,000 to
5,000 yeas ago, the Yellow River Valley is

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.260
just completely filled in. There are
people burning coal in some of these areas

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:54.210
because the forest is gone, and it's
coming down to the Yangtze River Valley,

00:17:54.210 --> 00:18:01.000
and this is before that rice spread begins
in Southern China and the rest of Asia.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.210
So, I guess I could summarize by saying in
the last three or four years there's been

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:12.530
an explosion of evidence, ground-truth
evidence, that people are doing things

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:18.940
that are putting a lot of methane and
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:24.130
So, this is beginning to gather some
attention from those who report the

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:31.640
scientific news. This is from "Science,"
autumn 2013, this is a piece, a

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:37.660
commentary, that focused on methane, and
you can read the title and get the

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:45.110
punchline yourself. Here's a paper that
was published, a feature's piece, that was

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:49.290
published in the other most distinguished
journal, that's "Nature, " and that the

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:56.150
central panel shows the time of major
effects, cultural effects, upon land

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.710
clearance and vegetation, and you see that
there are blocks there that are dating

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:05.141
back to 5,000 years or more. You also see
that methane reversal plotted

00:19:05.141 --> 00:19:07.541
in the curve at the bottom right.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:14.700
So, as we go off on the next few talks
after the break into talking about the

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.920
major things that have happened during the
industrial revolution and during the last

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:27.130
50 years, keep in mind that we have a long
history of effecting climate, and the

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:33.010
scope of it is still coming into focus,
but it's coming into focus pretty fast. I

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:36.741
think humans have been a major factor on
the landscape for

00:19:36.741 --> 00:19:41.061
thousands of years, not just 200 years.
