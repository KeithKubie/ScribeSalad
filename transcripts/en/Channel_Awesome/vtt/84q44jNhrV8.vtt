00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.980
NC: Oh, what's this, kids?

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.860
Oh, this is another excuse to weird stuff again, isn't it?

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.080
Well, your last excuse did result in Beetlejuice

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.140
and that was a big critical and box-office hit.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.200
OK, you can take the rest of the day doing another one!

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.360
Those bunch of scamps.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.360
This is another excuse to do weird stuff again, isn't it?

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.060
OK, look, the last time you did this, you made "Little Monsters,"

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.680
and that wasn't nearly as good.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.280
So I want you to try a lot harder this time, OK?

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm sure they'll get it this time around.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.280
OK, look, your last film was "Cool World."

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.080
"Cool World!"

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.440
There's only so many times you can use this excuse

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.220
for doing weird stuff

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.780
just for the sake of doing weird stuff!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.400
I'm giving you one more chance.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.720
If this next one isn't as nearly as good as Beetlejuice,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.980
you're both in big trouble!

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.480
Alright?!

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.380
Get out of my sight.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.420
{Umm...Critic?  Are you okay?}

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.260
{I think he's possessed!}

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.900
Tamara: Did you enjoy "Monkeybone?"

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.840
{What the hell do you think?}

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.800
Malcolm and Tamara: I will not breathe.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.860
I will not breathe.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.560
NC: Well, how can you accomplish that if you're saying it?

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.760
*Both of them breath in*

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.300
NC: Hello I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.300
Sometimes we like to give into the dark and weird

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.300
simply because it's dark and weird.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.840
Some directors are so good at creating them

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.120
that it's how they make their living.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.980
Giving us visually goofy, oddly nonsensical,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.160
yet somehow massively entertaining madness.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.840
But there's a right way and a wrong way to do it.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.640
And after a while, the novelty of the strange wears off

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.120
and we see what still holds up and what doesn't.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.720
Films like "Gremlins," "Addams Family," and "Paranorman" still hold up.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.080
Films like "Monkeybone," "Monkeybone," and "Monkeybone" do not.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.180
It's hard to say why some of these other weird work,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.540
But it's very easy to see why this weird film doesn't.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.080
Despite it being visually stunning and surreal,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.600
it's annoying as balls!

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.580
It's loud.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.420
It's stupid.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.600
It's a good thing the director did these films because,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.940
much like a trippy coma,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.720
I don't know how far I can go before I couldn't come back!

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.140
So why's this the one that killed the weird and dark movies for a while?

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.260
Let's take a look with "Monkeybone."

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.600
Child: It was 3rd grade.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.180
You know how some teachers have those flaps on their arms?

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.580
I began to feel...

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.940
aroused.
{WTF?!}

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.840
NC: Instantly sold!

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.400
Child: There he was!

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.960
Monkeybone!
{Ew.}

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.120
NC: I'm so glad Cartoon Network finally greenlit 
"An R. Crumb Christmas."

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.120
Though I'm surprised the title wasn't "Merry Crumbmass" or "Beware the Crumbus."

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.400
Hoestly I'm not even really joking.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.280
This is a new kids' show that's going to hit television

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.380
called "Monkeybone."

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.320
And isn't this just the audience

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.940
you would expect applauding a show like this?

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.000
Move over Samantha, our new "Sex and the City" is "Monkeybone."

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.080
Look at this, there's even tons of kids' merchandise.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.480
They're that certain it's gonna be a hit.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.620
Merch Guy: Every kid's gonna want three

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.020
and they're gonna want their friends to have three

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.000
otherwise they're not gonna be friends anymore.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.500
NC: Ugh

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.140
Yeah.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.040
For this:

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.600
Kid: I began to feel aroused.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.620
You have no idea how excited

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.960
kids are to see what "Duckman giving up looks like!

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.240
You know, aside from

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.040
the first time.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.860
The human representation of the 90's

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.800
trying to die in the 2000's trying to begin-

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.980
or as you call him, David Foley-

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.580
addresses the crowd and introduces the creator

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.380
of the comic strip the show is based on,

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.440
Stu Miley.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.820
Played by Brendan Fraser-

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.080
He did not draw that!

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.000
You lying sack of suck!

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.980
He did not come up with ANY of what we just saw!

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.180
Malcolm: Oh come on. There's usually good looking characters

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.360
in these weird dark films.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.600
Tamara: Yeah. Why doesn't it work here?

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.740
NC: Sileeence!

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.240
Malcolm: Ow.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.500
NC: In all those other films,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.000
the main character was quirky, but still normal!

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.520
The grounding reality to offset the strangeness

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.880
that the rest of the film is about to throw at you.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.420
But Fraser is already supposed to be weird and awkward and tormented.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.840
The crazy geek behind the odd cartoons.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.180
Tell me if even for a nanosecond you believe he's that kind of guy!

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.420
Stu: The cool thing is that you open it,

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.100
you go out, it closes and you can't get back in.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.780
Malcolm: Okay.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.680
Tamara: Yeah he's pretty bad.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.440
NC: No no no.  He's so believable!

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.960
Just look at his chiseled, smiling, action hero demeanor

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.800
that SO represents the shy artist!

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.120
Malcolm: Alright!

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.660
Tamara: We get it!

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.360
I mean, not since Woody Allen or Paul Giamatti

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.940
have I so bought the introverted, uncomfortable, social outcast this much!

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.740
Stu: Look at this now!  He won't let us leave.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.240
Julie: Who?

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.420
Stu: The monkey!

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.820
Julie: The monkey is good luck.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.280
Stu: I never had any good luck.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.320
Malcolm: We get it!

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.320
Tamara: We won't choose someone like him ever again!

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.400
NC: And what did we say about BREATHING!

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.400
*Both take deep breath*

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.780
He's about to propose to his girlfriend, played by Bridget Fonda,

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.580
Again, representing the "weirdo loser who gets lost in his own awkwardness."

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.840
Tamara: We said we're sorry!

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.040
NC: BREATHING!

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.880
{um, Tamara?}

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.700
And he tries to get her to leave the place.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.240
Because, you know, "this social stuff is so hard on him."

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.480
He's totally gonna bench less if he talks anymore.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.280
Oh I mean, in between his weird cartooning.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.560
Julie: Stu, you want to leave? You're a big hit! Everbody loves you!

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.140
NC: Okay, advice by the way:

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.220
Don't have a background that's more interesting than your foreground.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.140
Like most of you, I'm not listening to a thing they're saying and instead trying to figure out

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.480
what episode of "The Simpsons" that Krusty frame is from.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.780
I know I've seen that one before.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.220
Is it after season 7. I stopped watching after season 7...

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.820
I-I mean I watched, but you know,

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.900
it wasn't as good it was when it started to go down hill.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.180
I mean okay, it never officially jumped the shark at any moment.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.980
I don't know. The one with the fake Skinner,

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.140
that kinda jumped the shark.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.340
That was pretty bad but- DAMMIT I'M STILL REVIEWING "MONKEYBONE!"

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.700
But one of the pieces of merchandise,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.700
a...

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.600
giant inflatable raft,

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.140
"Pfft!  That overused market?

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.980
I thought they yanked those after people were disturbed sitting on Dora's face."

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.400
-goes off, and sends their car crashing into a wall.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.000
Fraser is sent into a coma while Fonda is...

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.400
completely untouched!

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.080
Their car was a giant airbag, how was he knocked out?!

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.280
As Fraser enacts a vision he'll soon become familiar with:

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.600
watching himself die.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.760
(statue singing)

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.000
Oh boy, you're not gonna take that background

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.940
overshadowing the foreground advice are you?

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.580
(singing to "This is Halloween")
"Boys and girls of every age,"

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.480
(singing to "This is Halloween")
"Think our designers were overly paid."

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.100
Cyclops...thing: Hey bud!  Glad to see me?

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.100
NC: O-kay movie, I'll make a deal with you.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.560
Nix all the actors

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.500
and just leave a 360 camera in the middle of the set,

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.300
I'll call it even!

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.620
Yeah, for all it's faults, this world is pretty damn amazing.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.360
This place is called "Down Town."

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.460
Where people go when they're in comas

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.060
that's apparently run on people's nightmares.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.440
And apparently everyone watched the same episode of Japan's "Pee-wee's Playhouse"

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.800
to come up with these images.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.200
While it is a marvel for the eyes, it's a "DC" for the rest of the senses.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.660
As Fraser comes across his creation, Monkeybone.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.020
Voiced by a sped up John Turturro.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.060
Monkeybone: Now I know you're all in comas.  But my first guess is gonna

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:57.820
SPIKE

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.880
YOUR

00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.580
CHARTS!

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.360
NC: What's the difference in speeding up Turturro's voice, and

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.300
really anybody's voice to sound exactly the same?

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.640
Turturro costs more!

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.440
{Smart!}

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:14.120
And trust me, casting a big name actor to do the voice doesn't distract how balls gratingly annoying he is!

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.940
Monkeybone: Homebone!

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.600
The lady got a loose caboose!

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.600
Homebone!

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.240
Get on the Julie train.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.960
Homebone!

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.326
NC: Okay, I'm over the novelty of him being stop motion.

00:08:22.326 --> 00:08:22.960
Now I hate him.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.380
Monkeybone: I wanna be loved by you.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.040
{what}

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.060
{what the}

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.000
{what the fuck?}

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.900
NC: "Anyone else created to work out the sexual issues of the director and/or writer?

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:35.940
Oh thank God, it's not just me.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.780
So Fraser's sister, played by Megan Mullally, wants to pull the plug on him.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:41.440
Why?

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.640
No.  That's not figurative.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.980
I'm actually asking you why.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.560
You probably have as much understanding as I do.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.400
As far as I can tell, she just wants to kill him

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.280
and there's no motivation the film gives as to why.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.740
I mean, okay, she says they made a pact because their father died so slowly,

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.640
but she seems way too excited and eager!

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.140
I don't really get it!

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.720
Kimmy (played by Mullally): Doctor!  Hey, sweetheart.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.260
Which one's the plug?

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.340
Doctor: What plug?

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:04.960
Kimmy: The plug.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.100
Malcolm: But it's dark so it's funny.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:07.720
NC: Yeah it's dark,

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.040
but it's only funny if we understand why.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.000
This is the first time we've seen her.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.200
We don't know what they're relationship is like,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.640
or even what SHE'S like

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.960
because we don't know why she's acting this way

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.080
or if this is how she normally acts or what?

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.540
There's no context!

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.536
Tamara: Yeah, but we blackmailed Bridget Fonda into being in this,

00:09:24.536 --> 00:09:25.580
that's gotta count for-

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.080
okay.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.040
NC: The doctor says that after three months,

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.420
it's less likely someone will come back from a coma.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.680
So three months pass as shown by...

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.360
this dissolve.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.860
I thought of that like more of a two and a half month dissolve,

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.740
but I still got the general passage of time.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.420
As Fraser continues to train for how to not be funny in "Loony Tunes Back in Action."

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.720
Stu: You have humiliated me in public for the last time!

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.700
Monkeybone: I doubt that.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.060
Stu: Back in the pack!

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.960
NC: You know, I'm just gonna say it.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.660
What's the appeal of this guy?

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.020
I mean I know he's good looking and he played the likable doofus okay,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.800
but looking back on his work, I can't say he's awful, but,

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.000
I can't really say he's good either.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.260
Just look at this scene where he's supposed to act like Monkeybone is in front of him.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.760
Stu: That's it, back in the pack.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.520
{WTF I don't know what he's saying}

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.520
{Is he.. speaking in some kinda accent?}

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.560
NC: I think Brendan Fraser is the less convincing puppet.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.460
Does it ever seem like he's looking at this thing?

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.820
Even when he's acting with other actors, it just seems like "George of the Jungle" light.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.980
Stu: He got an exit pass! Where's mine? When do I get to go home?

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.340
NC: He gives the performance a million other actors could give.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.180
It never seems distinctly unique.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.020
Stu (blandly): Who am I kidding?

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.100
I'm never gonna get out of here.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.720
NC: To his credit though, I don't know if any actor can make scenes like this work.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.260
*A-OOGA! A-OOGA! DIVE DIVE DIVE
DIVE DIIIIIVE!*

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.900
Ah, the days when adult humor in animation was a novelty.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.620
"A monkey jumping in a woman's boobs?

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.100
But those are cartoons!

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.940
Those things are for children!"

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.780
"Aren't they?"

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.680
{Literally!}

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.780
Their antics are interrupted though, when one of the people in a coma is sent back to the living.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.320
"Obie Glenn. I have come."

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.800
NC: "I'm the ghost of Christmas missteps.  I'm her to convince Michael Caine he can act with muppets.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.860
The man is sent back to the real world through the mouth of Abraham Lincoln.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:19.840
Because...

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.240
Because...?

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.000
Malcolm: Well you didn't think of it!

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.860
Tamara: So it's clever!

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.500
Malcolm: Yeah.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.400
NC: Come here.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.320
Did you know that if your knuckles are pink, you're more likely to be a genius?

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:36.860
Tamara: Well played.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:37.880
NC: Get back there.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.220
Fraser wants to figure out how he can get an exit pass,

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.840
so he goes to a pajama party of Hypnos,

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.280
the lord of dreams who loves the nightmares Fraser comes up with.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:55.400
{Insert "Mein Herz Brennt" lyrics}

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.940
Again if the story could just politely leave and we can play a Rammstein song over this,

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.160
I think we could have something.
{Oh hell yeah we can!}

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:01.820
{SOMEONE DO THAT!}

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.680
But the film insists it has a narrative, as Hypnos tells Fraser where to get an exit pass.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.640
Monkeybone: No life support?  Ha ha ha ha.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.140
Hypnos: I'm just the god of sleep.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.000
This is death's bailiwick.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.960
Monkeybone: Anybody got thumb(?) DESERVES TO DIE.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.560
NC: Could you please shut up your Roger Rabbit?

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.420
I know he has a name, but it's just your Roger Rabbit.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.720
Hypno says if he travels to the land of the dead,

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.680
he can steal an exit pass for himself,

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.960
but Fonda's convinced he's still in there trying to get out.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.840
Julie: does anybody know what Oneirix is?

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.840
guy: It's nightmare juice.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.340
You thinking we can decrease the levels?

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.400
Julie: No I want to give him more, I want to give him a massive dose.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.720
I want to scare him awake!
{That would kill him}

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.200
You want to scare him awake, show him the reviews for "Single White Female."

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.509
But, in all seriousness, you are a treasure.

00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:46.240
What are you doing in this movie?

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.740
Fraser disguises himself as a wicker tampon and sneaks in to see the Grim Reaper,

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:52.860
played by Whoopi Goldberg,

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:53.860
and her assistant,

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.200
played by Thomas Haden Church.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.360
Reaper: I'm yours.  What do you want?

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.720
Reaper's assistant: Let's get to reapin'

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.860
NC: "We're the paycheck in between two big things."

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.880
They steal the exit pass, resulting in...

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.740
...Whoopi's head exploding...

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.660
{They got Whoopi. Fucking. Goldberg in this. WTF.}

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.440
Thank you.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.600
Stu: It's just that, now that I'm leaving,

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.840
there's so many things I want to say to you.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.060
NC: "We really should have been working on our chemistry

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.060
instead of having the backgrounds eat us alive."

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.460
But Monkeybone betrays him by stealing the exit pass

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.800
and going into Fraser's body in the real world,

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.100
resulting in the real Fraser being put away.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.220
So like most boners, you think it's your friend,

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.040
but it often gets you in trouble and sometimes even lands you in prison.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.700
{Um...}

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.680
{Critic?}

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.560
{You okay there, bud?}

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:09.140
So now Monkeybone is in Brendan Fraser's body.  Oh the possibilities this opens up.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.060
I mean there's just so many defining character traits of Monkeybone.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.800
Like: he's silly...

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:16.980
he's horny...

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.960
he likes to dress like Marilyn Monroe for some reason.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.040
Honestly I'll probably get more character out of the peach from Selick's last movie than this.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:32.240
So we have a not very defined character, now being portrayed by a not very defined actor.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.600
Don't get me wrong, he's clearly trying.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.500
He's jumping all over the place, and screaming and such.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.520
But, again, that's kind of expected.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.060
Nothing is really added to make it his own.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.600
Even this spit take just seems run of the mill.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.460
Come on, it's a spit take!

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.560
There has to be more life in it than that!

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.140
Part of what makes those work is the unexpectedness.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.940
I don't even know where that came from!

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.840
It gets even more uncomfortable when Fonda tries to seduce him.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.160
What a...peculiar way to seduce a man.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.260
{What. Is. This.}

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.580
"This is what I call the PG-13."

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:21.960
{Jimi Hendrix's Foxy Lady plays}

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:24.780
Laughing yet?

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.080
Yeah, I think Fonda's look of horror speaks for all of us.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.960
No, STOP SHOWING THAT.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.980
This is not worth whatever impact you think it's having on us!

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:36.980
Dah!

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
Okay, I will die a happy ma-

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.460
a less angry ma-

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.640
I will not die if you never show me that again!

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.480
Oh thank God, one of those "Hulk" transitions finally had a good use.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:55.060
Fraser is thrown in prison with a ton of crazy minds who create great nightmares.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:16:00.320
Including Stephen King, who says Cujo stole his body like Monkeybone did when he was in a coma.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.100
Stephen King: I went through hell to get that exit pass.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.980
And who got to use it?  Cujo.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.940
Yeah.  I always wondered why Stephen King's last five novels were just "Bark Bark Bark."

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.820
To make things weirder,

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.220
that's the actual Stephen King playing himself in the movie.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.440
Okay, it's not.  But admit it, you were starting to IMDb that!

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.120
{Yep....I was.}

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.600
But Hypnos infiltrates Monkeybone's dream

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.520
to remind him this is all so he could spread more nightmares around the world.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:31.360
Hypnos: We help him swipe your body, he helps us get a heap of brand new nightmares!

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.820
NC: That's right. This guy that had maybe three minutes of screen time, he's our villain now!

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:40.400
Oh there's so many complex motivations and personalities going on in this film!

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:40.900
Like:

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.620
why the hell Chuck E. Cheese

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.860
genetically melted into Barf the dog.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.560
This movie's asking questions that didn't need to be asked.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.780
So Monkeybone tries to find that nightmare juice

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.900
brought up before and force it on people

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:53.720
all over the world.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.600
Okay, if that poncho is indicating that this is all a secret sequel to "Unbreakable,"

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.660
I am totally opting out of the Shyamalan cinematic universe!

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.240
{You see where this is going}

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.900
Monkeybone/Stu: Why don't you give me a little preview.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.120
NC: The writer of "Batman," everybody!

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.400
No! Seriously.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.100
Sam Hamm, the guy who wrote "Batman" also wrote this.

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.800
Actually, I hate to say it, but it makes a little too much sense.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.100
The villain wants to release a gas on everybody

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.800
disguised in a giant cartoon

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.000
while a sexy cat-woman

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.160
comes in suddenly deciding she's in love with the main character,

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.740
and McDonald's wants to attach their Happy Meal rights

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.900
to a franchise sure to have children wet their beds.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.420
Maybe Keaton saved those movies more than I thought.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.700
Give those movies credit though,

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.840
they didn't spend an entire NINETY SECONDS

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.820
congratulating themselves for a farting monkey doll.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.240
Oh, and you guessed right!

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.420
I counted!

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.460
{...this can't be real.}

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.120
{There's no way they green-lit this scene right?}

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:51.780
{RIGHT?!}

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.620
{What. The. Fuck. MOVIE!}

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.900
Just for that, you get the button.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:01.900
*Explosion*

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.000
Monkeybone tests the nightmare juice on the pet dog,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.680
giving him - what else - a nightmare.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.420
Whoa, cat videos on the dark web

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.880
are creepier than I expected.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.180
He puts the doll with the gas

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.620
inside a giant statue of his character, and...

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.360
*falsetto*

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.000
"Homie the Clown!"

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.360
That was the "Simpsons" episode

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.480
that had that Krusty frame.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.680
God, it was driving me nuts.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.860
Oh, and that scene sucked.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.120
So, as mentioned, the cat-lady breaks Fraser out of prison

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.200
only to immediately be caught again.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.420
They don't even show him being caught,

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.440
it's off screen.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.560
So, why'd you have him escape at all?

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.140

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.160
Reaper: I'm a simple person.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.060
I do an honest day's work.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.080
Why does everybody make it so hard for me?

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.560
NC: That is literally what Whoopi said every day of shooting.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.980
Fraser's sob story wins her over though,

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.580
so she sends him back via SNL actor trying way to hard.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.700
Stu: Where am I?

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.480
NC: In a shot that can crop out their mics better.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.600
Chris Kattan is now playing our hero for a bit,

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.560
and to be fair his physical comedy is pretty good

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.660
playing a gymnast who's neck is broken,

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.760
so he has to keep finding ways to prop it up.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.920
This bit's been done literally to death,

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.440
but he does pull it off okay.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.669
I'm just waiting to see where the "Better Call Saul" storyline

00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:37.440
is gonna fit in.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.240
Saul: I...

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.660
NC: Meanwhile Foley gets a whiff of the nightmare juice

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.600
from the farting Monkeybone toy.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.700
Herb (played by Foley): Damn, what the hell is this stuff?

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.360
NC: Oh look it's what Henry Selick said after every re-write.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.000
He starts seeing his nightmares in real life,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.340
because - let's face it -

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.860
this is all just an unused Freddy Krueger script.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.400
Herb: Clothes have turned evil!

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.360
They're working together!

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.700
NC: You're really gonna regret that this was the film

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.740
you went naked for.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.900
{I have no idea what he's saying}

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.560
Oh excuse me, I almost interrupted the master.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.620
{is he saying " No no no!  Where's my dingdong?"}

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.960
Can I package your misdirection?

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.560
Monkeybone: Ladies and gentlemen...

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.000
forget about the naked man with the purple face.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.660
*joke drums and laughter*
{why?}

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.140
NC: Oh ho. That old joke.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.400
But wait!

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.560
It's an early 2000's bad film, dance number time!

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:32.400
*Brick House by The Commodores is sung*

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.060
Oh you forgot the shadow of the camera man if he wanted to dance.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.200
Before he continues to be DOA (dated on arrival),

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.640
Kattan literally swings his way in because...

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.140
even though it's supposed to be Fraser's mind in there,

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.080
he suddenly knows gymnastics.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.720
I honestly give Kattan more credit though,

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.400
he does pull off the only believable bit of emotion in the movie.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.860
Stu: I had to come back, Julie.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.480
*sigh* I WAS happy Julie.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.260
I really was.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.220
Try to remember me like that...okay?

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.860
NC: He's giving a better Bendan Fraser performance than Brenden Fraser.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.860
But Monkeybone tries to stop him through...

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.320
"Rat Races" greatest hits.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.920
Though their greenscreen was more convincing

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.640
than the SPECIAL EFFECTS FILM.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.580
And they both get sent back to Down Town.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:25.840
*Whoopi making noises*

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.640
"I was just practicing my fake excitement for when I have to to 'Theodore Rex.'

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.580
Did it seem real?"

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.520
Monkeybone is left back in Fraser's mind,

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.000
he goes back to the real world

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.320
to be reunited with Fonda

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.880
trying to pretend she gives a shit,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.320
and let's go out on what we know was the funniest part of the movie.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.720
Herb: People...for the love of God!

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.060
Take off your clothes!

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:47.560
{I don't want to}

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.220
TAKE! OFF! YOUR CLOTHES!

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.740
{I feel disturbed}

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:59.680
"Monkeybone" is arguably the last of the dark, weird, wild, and crazy movies

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.620
that exists just to exist.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.760
There's a good reason it's the last one though.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.560
Because it's done horribly.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.240
While the visuals and imagination are stunning,

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:13.880
the lack of focus on motivation, comedy, and even just fun are completely misdirected.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.900
Thankfully this director would do more projects that were just as dark and imaginative,

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.060
but this time carry charm and intelligence along with it.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.160
As would more weird and dark movies

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.280
that decide they wanted to be smarter too.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.640
This just leaves you mentally numb.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.220
Like a hot spatula pressing against your brain

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.720
for an hour and a half.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.340
I'm glad other imaginative and likable ventures rose in the future,

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.500
but this was certainly not one of them.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.560
Uncle Lies: Okay kids.  It's time to go home.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.460
NC: W-wait. You're related to those kids then.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.260
Uncle Lies: No.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.100
Aunt Despair: Never seen 'em.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.380
NC: I have to ask more questions around here.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.760
{Be sure to check out the charity shoutout after the credits.}

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:40.600
*The Review Must Go On plays*

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.980
Monkeybone: OW-OW-OW. Where'd you dingdong?
{I think}

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.820
Doug: Hey, this is Doug Walker doing the charity shoutout,

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.800
and this week we are doing Action against Hunger.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.600
This is an international relief and development organization

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.300
committed to saving the lives of malnourished children and families

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.340
while providing substantial access to safe water

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.480
and long term solutions to hunger.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.380
Recognized as a world leader in the fight against hunger,

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.260
they have pursued it's vision of a world without hunger

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.060
for nearly three decades.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:19.360
Combating hunger in emergency situations of conflict,

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.100
natural disaster, and chronic food insecurity.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:26.360
With headquarters in New York, London, Madrid, Montreal, and Paris,

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.240
their field staff work in over 40 countries

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.000
to carry out innovative and life saving programs

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.140
in nutrition, food security, water and sanitation,

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.760
health, and advocacy.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.240
If you check out their site or their YouTube page,

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.300
you can see how their programs reach over 4 million people a year.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.680
They do amazing work, and you can help them do even more.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:51.140
Take a look, give a click, and see if you can help those who help others.
