00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.740
Actress Angelina Jolie had a chaotic relationship with her father growing up.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.280
As a result, she became estranged from him and even changed

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.380
her last name to disconnect from all her painful memories.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.880
 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.600
She says, "I don't believe that somebody's family becomes their blood,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.280
families are earned."

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.780
 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.400
Titles mean nothing when you never felt close to someone

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.640
who was supposed to be there, but offered little to no support.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.680
 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.300
Does this sound familiar?

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.520
Here are 6 side effects of growing up in a toxic family.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.480
1. You have a fear of being manipulated.

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:41.945
Toxic families often involve some sort of

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:45.380
daily  manipulation between 2 or more family members.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.960
Manipulation is  a serious form of mental and emotional abuse.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.920
Whether you've been directly manipulated or

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.220
watched someone you love be a victim to it,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.500
this can cause you to grow fearful of this toxic behavior.

00:00:57.505 --> 00:01:00.525
As a result, you may become avoidant of others in order

00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:02.540
to protect yourself.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.220
2. You struggle with developing your self-identity.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.135
People who come from toxic families often struggle with

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.760
image and low self-esteem issues because they weren't

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.000
nurtured to have confidence in themselves.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.605
You might have grown up with parents who never respected your boundaries,

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:19.600
often verbally abused you,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.040
or didn't allow you room for you to develop your own beliefs, dreams

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.120
and interests.

00:01:24.445 --> 00:01:27.915
Consequently, you begin to see yourself in a negative light.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:31.365
Instead of having nurturing parents who helped you except your flaws,

00:01:31.365 --> 00:01:34.105
mistakes, and failures, you faced harsh criticism

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:35.380
on a daily basis.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.140
Without a healthy sense of steam, one can miss out on

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.260
fulfilling their talents and potential.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.280
3. You have difficulty trusting others.

00:01:45.745 --> 00:01:48.525
Children first learn how to form relationships with others

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.360
from their parents.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.340
Toxic parents often give children a reason to close up,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.660
and they become distrustful of the world.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.140
When you learn to put walls up out of fear of being vulnerable,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.080
it makes it hard for you to connect and relate with others.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.480
4. You have trouble interacting socially.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.420
Studies from Texas Woman's University shows that adults who were raised in

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.340
dysfunctional families reported struggles maintaining

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.600
romantic relationships and overcoming their insecurities

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.080
because they feared losing control.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.440
As a result, many of them would deny reality and their own feelings.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.920
When you grow up in a household that exposes you to

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.760
neglect,  abuse, and mistreatment,  the last thing you want to do is

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.780
get close to people who might let you down or betray you.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.020
5. You have anxiety overload.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.740
According to a study published in The Journal Of Behavior Therapy And

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.020
Experimental Psychiatry, people who were raised in a dysfunctional

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.020
household are more likely  to be diagnosed with

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.280
Generalized Anxiety Disorder. As a result,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.540
children who grew up in a toxic environment

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.300
are at risk of developing problems with their academics,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.280
social life and impulse control, because their brain

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.060
is continuously exposed to cortisol, the stress hormone.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.100
Systems of Generalized Anxiety Disorder include headaches,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.940
irritability, muscle tension, sweating constant worrying,

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.520
and feelings of restlessness.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.260
6. You deal with the trauma by going through emotional cutoff

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.980
or estrangement from your family.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.345
Once children from toxic families grow up into adults

00:03:20.345 --> 00:03:22.600
who can financially support themselves, they often

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.940
experience emotional cutoff or estrangement to

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.960
disconnect from their unresolved family conflict.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.920
Emotional cutoff, coined by American psychiatrist

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.100
Marie Bowen, is a process that involves either physically

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.980
distancing oneself from a family member or avoiding

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.200
sensitive topics in a conversation to reduce anxiety.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.380
Some people choose to disconnect from their family members

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.720
because it's better than drowning along who hasn't changed

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.900
or been treated for their unhealthy behavior.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.120
Have you experienced these side effects?

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.420
We know that sometimes it might seem impossible

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.360
to recover from them, but were here to offer a safe,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.740
judgment free space where you can talk  about what

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.180
you've faced.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.540
