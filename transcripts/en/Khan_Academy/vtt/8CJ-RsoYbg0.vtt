00:00:00.087 --> 00:00:02.307
- [Instructor] "Market
researchers conducted a study

00:00:02.307 --> 00:00:04.127
"comparing the salaries of managers

00:00:04.127 --> 00:00:06.857
"at a large nationwide retail store.

00:00:06.857 --> 00:00:08.667
"The researchers obtained salary

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:12.617
"and demographic data for a
random sample of managers.

00:00:12.617 --> 00:00:14.957
"The researchers calculated
the average salary

00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:18.317
"of the men in the sample
and the average salary

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:20.417
"of the women in the sample.

00:00:20.417 --> 00:00:23.307
"They want to test if managers who are men

00:00:23.307 --> 00:00:27.547
"have a higher average salary
than managers who are women.

00:00:27.547 --> 00:00:31.937
"Assume that all conditions
for inference have been met.

00:00:31.937 --> 00:00:34.427
"Which of these is the
most appropriate test

00:00:34.427 --> 00:00:36.720
"and alternative hypothesis?"

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.020
And, we can see, they're
talking about a paired T test

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.470
and a two-sample T test,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.720
and then they talk about
the alternative hypotheses.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.370
So, pause this video and try to figure

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.940
this out on your own.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.410
So first, let's think about the difference

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.980
between a paired T test
and a two-sample T test.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.230
In a paired T test, we're
gonna construct hypotheses

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.560
around

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.100
a parameter for our population

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.260
that will often be the mean difference.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.860
So, we have one population,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.550
so we're talking about the
paired situation right over here,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.657
and so, let's say we say,

00:01:08.657 --> 00:01:13.657
"Hey, do people run faster when
they wear shorts or pants?",

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.460
and so for each member of the population,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.710
you can see what you would,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.460
if you really had perfect information,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.470
you would know, how fast
did they run with pants

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.840
and how fast did they run with shorts?

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.600
And then, you would
calculate the difference,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.300
and then across the whole population,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.590
you could actually get
that mean difference.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.320
So, the mean difference of pants

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.190
minus shorts.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.820
And of course, in order to estimate that,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.210
or in order to do a
hypothesis test around that,

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.460
you would take a sample,
and then you would calculate

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.150
the sample mean of the difference

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.290
of pants

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.460
minus shorts,

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.570
and then, you would say, "Hey,"

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.810
assuming the null hypothesis is true,

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.750
you would construct some null hypothesis,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.500
likely that there is no,
that this mean is zero,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.127
and you would say, "Hey, if
the null hypothesis is true,

00:02:02.127 --> 00:02:04.487
"that this is actually equal to zero,

00:02:04.487 --> 00:02:06.710
"what's the probability
that I got this result?"

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.550
If that's below your significance level,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.820
then you would reject your null hypothesis

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.360
and it would suggest the alternative

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.337
that might be that, "Hey, maybe this mean

00:02:14.337 --> 00:02:16.150
"is greater than zero."

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.470
On the other hand, a two-sample T test

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.170
is where you're thinking about
two different populations.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.380
For example, you could be thinking

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.880
about a population of men, and
you could be thinking about

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.690
the population of women.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.780
And you wanna compare the
means between these two,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.030
say, the mean salary.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.910
So, you have the mean salary for men

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.943
and you have the mean salary for women,

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.770
and what you're trying to
do with the hypothesis test

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.400
is try to come up with
some conclusions about

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.870
the mean difference between
these two parameters.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.610
So, the mean salary for men

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.530
minus the mean salary for women.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.230
And our null hypothesis is usually

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.240
the no-news-here hypothesis,

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.010
and so in this situation,
our null hypothesis is that

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.350
there is no difference between these means

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.520
and that our alternative hypothesis

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.050
in the situation that we are looking at,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.280
because they wanna test
if managers who are men

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.350
have a higher average salary.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.620
If they just wanted to
test that whether managers

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.450
who are men have a different salary,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.960
then our alternative hypothesis

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.530
would look something like this,

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.000
where the mean of men
minus the mean of women

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.370
is not equal to zero, but
they aren't just testing

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.760
to see if the means are different,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.110
they wanna see if men have
a higher average salary.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.360
So, instead of not equal zero there,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.830
we would have greater than zero

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.920
for our alternative hypothesis.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.040
So, which choice is that?

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.360
Well, we're clearly in a
two-sample T test situation,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.930
and we wanna do the greater than,

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.020
not the not-equal-to, so
we are in that choice,

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.913
right over there.
