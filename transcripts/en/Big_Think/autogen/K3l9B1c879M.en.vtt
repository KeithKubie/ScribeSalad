in some way my book is an optimistic

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580
in some way my book is an optimistic
 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.620
in some way my book is an optimistic
book because I argue about all of our

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:08.630
book because I argue about all of our
 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.030
book because I argue about all of our
limitations and how empathy leads us

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040
limitations and how empathy leads us
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.919

astray but in order to make that

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929
astray but in order to make that
 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.919
astray but in order to make that
argument we also have to have an

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929
argument we also have to have an
 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.599
argument we also have to have an

appreciation that we're smart enough to
 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.849
appreciation that we're smart enough to
realize that empathy could lead us

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859
realize that empathy could lead us
 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.980
realize that empathy could lead us
astray and that we're smart enough to

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990
astray and that we're smart enough to
 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.990
astray and that we're smart enough to
act those to override its pernicious

act those to override its pernicious
 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.019
act those to override its pernicious
effects so it's empathy that causes need

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029
effects so it's empathy that causes need
 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.490

it's rationality that leads me to say

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
it's rationality that leads me to say

it's rationality that leads me to say
hey that's not reasonable there's no

is also entirely rational you could
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.100
is also entirely rational you could
imagine another computer is entirely

kill each other as Steve Pinker has
