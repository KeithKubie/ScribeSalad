Oh

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:05.150
 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.970
our lab studies the genome of organisms

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980
our lab studies the genome of organisms
 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.890
our lab studies the genome of organisms
and also the genome of cancer cells and

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900
and also the genome of cancer cells and
 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.359
and also the genome of cancer cells and
we work on two kinds of problems the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369
we work on two kinds of problems the
 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.130
we work on two kinds of problems the
evolution and outcome of cancers and

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140
evolution and outcome of cancers and
 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.040
evolution and outcome of cancers and
also on genetic disorders of a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050
also on genetic disorders of a
 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.460
also on genetic disorders of a
spontaneous sort that is non heritable

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470
spontaneous sort that is non heritable
 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.900
spontaneous sort that is non heritable
genetic disorders and those are two very

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910
genetic disorders and those are two very
 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.680
genetic disorders and those are two very
sounds like two very different things

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
sounds like two very different things
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.420
sounds like two very different things
but they're they're related by our

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430
but they're they're related by our
 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.020
but they're they're related by our
methodology which is genomic analysis

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030
methodology which is genomic analysis
 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.440
methodology which is genomic analysis
what we do is we would call difference

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450
what we do is we would call difference
 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.450
what we do is we would call difference
analysis for example if we're looking at

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
analysis for example if we're looking at
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.150
analysis for example if we're looking at
a cancer will want to see where that

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160
a cancer will want to see where that
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.740
a cancer will want to see where that
cancer has mutated relative to the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750
cancer has mutated relative to the
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.350
cancer has mutated relative to the
genome of the person who gave rise to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360
genome of the person who gave rise to
 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.510
genome of the person who gave rise to
that cancer that's differential genomic

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
that cancer that's differential genomic
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.850
that cancer that's differential genomic
analysis and it tells us where the

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860
analysis and it tells us where the
 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.179
analysis and it tells us where the
cancer is mutated and from the types of

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189
cancer is mutated and from the types of
 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.840
cancer is mutated and from the types of
mutations the number of mutations we can

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850
mutations the number of mutations we can
 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.630
mutations the number of mutations we can
infer a lot about cancer ideology

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640
 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.700
well biology has always been influenced

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710
well biology has always been influenced
 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.700
well biology has always been influenced
strongly by quantitative types many

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710
strongly by quantitative types many
 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.399

forties fifties came into biology

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
forties fifties came into biology
 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.020
forties fifties came into biology
strongly influenced it there was a

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030
strongly influenced it there was a
 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.419
strongly influenced it there was a
period I would say from the time I was a

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429
period I would say from the time I was a
 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:46.710
period I would say from the time I was a
graduate student in the mid-70s till the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720
graduate student in the mid-70s till the
 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.449
graduate student in the mid-70s till the
mid to late 90s where it was not

mid to late 90s where it was not
 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.639
mid to late 90s where it was not
particularly quantitative and that was

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649
particularly quantitative and that was
 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.459
particularly quantitative and that was
largely because of the revolution in

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469
largely because of the revolution in
 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.699
largely because of the revolution in
recombinant DNA so really all you needed

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709
recombinant DNA so really all you needed
 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:04.800
recombinant DNA so really all you needed
to be to be a good biologist was a good

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810
to be to be a good biologist was a good
 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.190
to be to be a good biologist was a good
sense of logic and a good imagination

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200
sense of logic and a good imagination
 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.289
sense of logic and a good imagination
and mathematical and statistical skills

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299
and mathematical and statistical skills
 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.949
and mathematical and statistical skills
are weren't really that necessary for

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959
are weren't really that necessary for
 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.199
are weren't really that necessary for
much of biology and I was in that group

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209
much of biology and I was in that group
 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.349
much of biology and I was in that group
actually I'd studied earlier on as a

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359
actually I'd studied earlier on as a
 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.930
actually I'd studied earlier on as a
mathematician but I did used almost none

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940
mathematician but I did used almost none
 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.930
mathematician but I did used almost none
of those of the mathematical tools when

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940
of those of the mathematical tools when
 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.759
of those of the mathematical tools when
doing biological research of course the

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769
doing biological research of course the
 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.330
doing biological research of course the
logic comes in handy but the tools were

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340
logic comes in handy but the tools were
 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.940
logic comes in handy but the tools were
not very valuable there's no place for

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950
not very valuable there's no place for
 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.770
not very valuable there's no place for
them because the kind of data that we

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780
them because the kind of data that we
 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.660
them because the kind of data that we
were getting was very individual data

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670
were getting was very individual data
 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.569
were getting was very individual data
and I actually had a rule of thumb rule

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579
and I actually had a rule of thumb rule
 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.319
and I actually had a rule of thumb rule
of thumb i actually disliked statistics

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329
of thumb i actually disliked statistics
 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.509
of thumb i actually disliked statistics
early on in my in my life and i felt

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519
early on in my in my life and i felt
 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.849
early on in my in my life and i felt
that if if i needed to do statistics to

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859
that if if i needed to do statistics to
 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.920
that if if i needed to do statistics to
see what I was observing that I wasn't

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930
see what I was observing that I wasn't
 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.349
see what I was observing that I wasn't
really observing anything but that

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359
really observing anything but that
 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.520
really observing anything but that
changed with the advent of the

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530
changed with the advent of the
 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.940
changed with the advent of the
sequencing of the human genome that

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950
sequencing of the human genome that
 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.220
sequencing of the human genome that
changed everything and the development

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230
changed everything and the development
 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.069
changed everything and the development
of new high-throughput methods of

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079
of new high-throughput methods of
 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:10.110
of new high-throughput methods of
extracting data if forced biologists

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120
extracting data if forced biologists
 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.000
extracting data if forced biologists
reconsider the value of statistics and

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010
reconsider the value of statistics and
 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.240
reconsider the value of statistics and
mathematics in the analysis of their

subject so a number of biologists moved

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230
subject so a number of biologists moved
 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.979
subject so a number of biologists moved
in that direction not a lot but quite a

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989
in that direction not a lot but quite a
 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.500
in that direction not a lot but quite a
number did and I was one of those that

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510
number did and I was one of those that
 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.970
number did and I was one of those that
moved in that direction

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980
 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.020
you know we are so close historically to

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030
you know we are so close historically to
 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.369
you know we are so close historically to
that period and the data that's coming

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379
that period and the data that's coming
 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.649
that period and the data that's coming
out of that effort is still being

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659
out of that effort is still being
 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.750
out of that effort is still being
generated I think it's very hard for any

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760
generated I think it's very hard for any
 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.100
generated I think it's very hard for any
of us to really judge the impact that it

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110
of us to really judge the impact that it
 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.420
of us to really judge the impact that it
has had it was a huge revolution in

has had it was a huge revolution in
 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.080
has had it was a huge revolution in

who conceived of doing the only thing
comparable in my lifetime was the

comparable in my lifetime was the
 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.979
comparable in my lifetime was the
recombinant DNA revolution which changed

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989
recombinant DNA revolution which changed
 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.839
recombinant DNA revolution which changed
entirely the kinds of experiments that

people did since sequencing methods are
 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.060
people did since sequencing methods are
changing so fast i mean the the cost of

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070
changing so fast i mean the the cost of
 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.050
changing so fast i mean the the cost of
sequencing is is has dropped enormously

sequencing is is has dropped enormously
 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.719
sequencing is is has dropped enormously
and with each drop in the cost it

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729
and with each drop in the cost it
 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.610

changes entirely how you how do you

think of attacking a problem so in a few

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100
think of attacking a problem so in a few
 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.159
think of attacking a problem so in a few
years from now we'll be in a position to

years from now we'll be in a position to
 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.320
years from now we'll be in a position to
have DNA sequence of very high quality

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330
have DNA sequence of very high quality
 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.409
have DNA sequence of very high quality
for a million people and know the

think our computers are yet to a stage
where they'll be able to handle data

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780
where they'll be able to handle data
 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.040
where they'll be able to handle data
that type and the kind of analysis tools

haven't been developed yet so we're in a

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330
haven't been developed yet so we're in a
 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.510
haven't been developed yet so we're in a
really estranged point in the history of

really estranged point in the history of
 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.879
really estranged point in the history of
biology where things are changing so

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889
biology where things are changing so
 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.860
biology where things are changing so
rapidly we don't really we really can't

rapidly we don't really we really can't
 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.340
rapidly we don't really we really can't
quite see the shape of the future yet
