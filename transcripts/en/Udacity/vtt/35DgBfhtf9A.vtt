Lets get started by asking Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google,

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:06.298
what the most important thing is in building a search engine.

00:00:06.298 --> 00:00:08.680
So what's your take on how to build a search engine?

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.184
You have built one before, right?

00:00:10.184 --> 00:00:12.857
Yes, I think the most important thing

00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:14.664
if you want to build a search engine, I think is to

00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:18.715
have a really good, fun corpus to start with.

00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:25.286
In our case we used the world wide web which at the time was significantly smaller than it is today.

00:00:25.286 --> 00:00:27.519
It was also very new and exciting

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.000
there were all kinds of unexpected things there.
