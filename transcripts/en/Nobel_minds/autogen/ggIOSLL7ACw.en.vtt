idea is that the asymmetry of piece and

a loading is preserved in the PCM you

a loading is preserved in the PCM you

del alpha complex and this serves to

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:32.380
del alpha complex and this serves to
 

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.890
del alpha complex and this serves to
orient the and a nucleus active site

orient the and a nucleus active site

so when I began this discussion of

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:45.750
so when I began this discussion of
eukaryotic mismatch repair I mentioned

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760
eukaryotic mismatch repair I mentioned
 

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.970
eukaryotic mismatch repair I mentioned
that we had no idea about the nature of

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:47.980
that we had no idea about the nature of
 

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.750
that we had no idea about the nature of
the strand signal but the those two

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.340

strand directed reactions that I've

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:53.350
strand directed reactions that I've
 

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.620
strand directed reactions that I've
described suggest several possibilities

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:55.630
described suggest several possibilities
 

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.330

mentioned that strand direction of you

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:15.790
