We are told that the amount Grant wants in account eventually is $1250. So,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.903
let's substitute this in, in the place of A. That makes our equation 1250 equals

00:00:10.903 --> 00:00:19.520
1000 times 1 plus 0.03 to the t. So now we have an equation with just one

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.590
variable, t. And conveniently, that's what we wanted to solve for anyway. So

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.210
please solve for t using this equation. Once you have a number that t is equal

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.530
to, please round up to the nearest integer or to the nearest year, since

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.250
interest is paid into the account yearly. One more little hint for you. The

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.850
base of a log doesn't have to be an integer. Think about that as you go through

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.921
the problem.
