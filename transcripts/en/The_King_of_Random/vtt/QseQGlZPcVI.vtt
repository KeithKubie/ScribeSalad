00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.180
[Music]

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.880
Doing a video for War Dragons,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.749
we wanted to come up with
something that was extra fun,

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.160
and a while back, Grant had an
idea that we build a flamethrower

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.680
that can be entirely
mounted onto one arm.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.900
So, the arm-mounted flamethrower's
what we have built for War Dragons.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.780
We figured it was appropriately on theme,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.460
what with the breathing fire and all,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.140
and today, we're going
to be showing this off.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.620
First, let's take a quick look
at how we built everything.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.580
So, the quick and dirty
version of how this works,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.780
these two propane cylinders
fit right into these holsters,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.400
and they screw into these valves.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.480
These two valves lead down
in sort of a weird Y shape

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.940
to this barb right here connected to a hose.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.060
The hose runs down
into our solenoid,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.510
and the solenoid keeps
all of the pressure in,

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.100
until we activate the switch.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.900
We've got a battery pack
that's wired into the solenoid

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.140
by way of a switch over on the handle.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.880
When the electricity is turned on,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.720
pressing that button opens the solenoid,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.580
and the fuel dumps out
of our nozzle here.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.640
To ignite the fuel
coming out of our nozzle,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.160
we have a taser.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.580
The electricity for the taser
runs through this coiled wire,

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.520
and up to these two leads.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.340
When we press this button,
the whole thing shoots out,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.360
putting those leads right
where we want in the path of the fuel

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.960
but also well away from our hand.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.060
The decorative outer
portion of the flamethrower

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.420
is mostly comprised of foam with a little
bit of electronics running down through it.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.532
It fits over the body,
and we can turn the lights on,

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.000
and control the color
just by twisting this dial.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.520
We've now got the internals
and externals built ready,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.260
it's time to assemble it
and start using this sucker.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.360
This is a flamethrower and
of course, it looks best in the dark.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.780
So, we've come to the dome
right as the sun is going down,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.920
We're going to try and get great
footage of this both in low light,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.100
and well, very low light.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.740
Darkness, some would call it.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:02:34.580
[Music]

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.600
Well, we've got a flamethrower,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.920
and it would be a shame if we didn't
actually use it to cook anything,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.569
so, I've got a hot dog,
couple of marshmallows,

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.240
we're going to see
how it does against those.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.400
And just for good measure,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.580
we've got a couple of
these small barrels of straw,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.220
which I think are going to go up
in flames really really quickly.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.460
[Music]

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.460
I think it's cooked.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.080
[Music]

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.740
I always like my marshmallows well done.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.660
[Music]

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.320
Completely.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.220
Raw and uncooked,
and cool on the inside.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:16.440
[Music]

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.780
A little bit of an experiment here.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.440
Thought maybe not all dragons
breathe the same color fire.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:31.060
[Music]

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.340
Yeah. That was amazing.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:48.280
[Music]

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.200
Well, we got a shot.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.560
All right, flame thrower arm.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.080
I'm going to call that a success.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.060
This thing is wildly fun,
and uh... not wildly safe.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.439
Don't build flamethrowers guys.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.390
Thank you, shout out to War Dragons
for sponsoring this video.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.380
This was a super fun,
if rather intense build.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.480
Overall, I'm very happy
with how it turned out.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.940
It really looks like something
straight out of a mad scientist cartoon,

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.900
which is exactly what I was going for.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.910
War Dragons is a game where
you have dragons and big surprise.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.060
They go to war.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.600
War Dragons is this mobile
real time strategy game

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.800
where you collect and use
a bunch of different dragons.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.860
There's like 150 different types.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.240
You get a bunch of dragons,
and then you can actually combine them

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.280
by breeding them together
to get new dragons,

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.000
and all of them have
different styles of attack,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.480
different weapons,
different shields,

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.720
different magical powers.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.260
So, you just build them up
and create this crazy big army.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.220
You can join with your friends,
make a guild, all sorts of cool stuff.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.080
In fact, when you hit Level 6,
you can join my guild TKORNation.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.600
Graphics in this game are pretty good.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.120
I actually really like a lot of
the dragon designs they have.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.720
I think there's like dozens of different
designs of types of dragons in here.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.690
They all have different abilities,
different types of fire and shields,

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.200
and magic abilities and all these
different Attack Modes, lots of fun.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.500
In my experience, there is
a little bit of a learning curve,

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.360
and I did run into
a couple of little hiccups,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.380
but there's a nice tutorial at the beginning

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.820
that shows you how to get
through pretty much everything.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.620
The game is available
on Android and iOS.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.510
It is free.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.820
You can throw a little bit of money at it
if you want to skip ahead in some ways,

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.180
but nothing in the gameplay
requires you to do that.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.280
The game is available on
Android and iOS mobile devices.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.280
It is free.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.520
Start playing with the
link in the description below.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.640
If you want to know how
we built this flamethrower,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.400
we have three more videos coming up
showing you how it was made.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.900
So, check back over the next few days to
get a detailed look on how we built it all.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.680
Hey guys. Thanks for watching.

Have fun.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.530
Be safe and see you tomorrow.
