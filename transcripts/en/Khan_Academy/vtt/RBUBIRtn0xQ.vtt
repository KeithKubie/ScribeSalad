00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.400
Let's say you run
an orange stand.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.320
And this right here,
you could view this

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.320
as either the demand curve
for your orange stand

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.780
or your marginal benefit
curve, or really you

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.510
could call it the
willingness to pay,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.790
the first 100 pounds of oranges.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.360
Or that very 100th
pound, someone

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.420
would be willing to
pay $3 per pound.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.230
But then the 101st pound would
be a little bit less than that.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.605
So that's the
willingness to pay,

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:25.290
or the marginal benefit
of that incremental pound.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.900
But let's say you decide
to set the price at $2,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.312
and you are able to sell
300 oranges in that week.

00:00:36.312 --> 00:00:37.770
What I want to
think about is, what

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.589
is the total consumer surplus
that your consumers got?

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.380
And the way to think
about consumer surplus

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.720
is, how much benefit did they
get above and beyond what

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.790
they paid?

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.840
So for example, the
person who bought--

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.460
let's just think about
the exact 100th pound.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.660
The 100th pound, they paid $2.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.930
They paid $2, but their
benefit looks like it was,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.800
I don't know, $3.30.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.290
But they only paid $2.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.930
So their benefit on that
one pound, their benefit,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.370
or I should say their
consumer surplus,

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.890
is going to be
$3.30 minus a $2.30.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.920
So that person who bought that
100th-- not all the 100 pounds,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.900
just that 100th pound-- got a
consumer surplus of $3.30 minus

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.070
$2, which is a $1.30
consumer surplus.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.360
So if you wanted to figure out
the entire consumer surplus,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.970
well, you just have to do
it for all of the pounds.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.170
So that was 100th pound.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.120
So essentially,
you could view this

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.492
as the area of this little
thing right over here.

00:01:44.492 --> 00:01:46.200
And let me zoom in,
just to make sure you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.150
understand what's going on.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.160
That thing that I just
drew, if we zoom in,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.240
will look something like this.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.495
It was one pound wide.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.320
And this right over here was $2.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.750
And then we had our marginal
benefit curve, or our demand

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.440
curve, sloping down like that.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.710
And this point right
over here was $3.30.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.090
And so to figure out the
consumer surplus for that pound

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.620
we said, OK, for that pound
they were willing to pay $3.30.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.450
The benefit to them was $3.30.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.220
But they only had to pay $2.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.950
So the height of this
right over here was $1.30.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.950
And so the consumer surplus
is $1.30 per pound times one

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.230
pound.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.780
And so that's where we got
the $1.30 consumer surplus.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.640
Now, we could do that for
every one of the pounds.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.010
So we could do that
for the 101st pound.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.310
Let me get a different color.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.260
The 101st pound, we
would do it like that.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.780
Then the 102nd pound, we
would do it like that.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.550
103rd pound like that.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.119
We'd do it for the
99th pound like that.

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:00.660
And so you could
imagine if we wanted

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.161
to find the total consumer
surplus, what are we doing?

00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:04.660
Well, we're essentially
just finding

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.830
the area between
our demand curve

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.410
and this line where the
price is equal to 2.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.590
So we're just going
to sum up this area.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.170
And if you're familiar
with calculus,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.290
you might know that
you can actually

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.550
make these things
arbitrarily small.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.370
You don't have to take a
one pound wide rectangle.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.960
You get a half a
pound wide rectangle,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.310
or a quarter pound
wide rectangle.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.960
Then you'll just
have more rectangles.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.040
It doesn't matter so much if
you have a linear demand curve,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.255
but if you had a
non-linear demand curve

00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:37.130
then it would matter.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.172
You'd want to get smaller and
smaller and smaller, or thinner

00:03:40.172 --> 00:03:41.630
and thinner and
thinner rectangles,

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.910
so you could get better
and better approximations

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.310
for the consumer surplus.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.850
But needless to say, what
you're really doing-- especially

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.160
if you get unbelievably
thin rectangles,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.550
and you have an unbelievably
high number of them-- you're

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.550
really just estimating the
area under the demand curve

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.430
and above the price equals $2.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.760
And so if you want to know
this consumer surplus--

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.250
and I really want you to
understand why this was.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.041
I mean, just think
about it for each pound.

00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:10.940
It was just how much
more value that pound,

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.190
whoever bought that pound,
how much more value do they

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.970
get relative to what they paid.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.019
And we're just summing that
up across all of the pounds.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.310
So to really figure out
the total consumer surplus,

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.220
we just have to find this
area of this blue area.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.990
And that's just finding
the area of a triangle.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.960
So this right over here,
you have a base of 300.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.410
This length right over
here is 300 pounds.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.330
And then our height over here.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.970
And we can just use this
as the area of a triangle,

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.981
because this is a simple
linear demand curve.

00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:47.230
We would actually have to
use a little bit of calculus

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.100
if this was a non-linear curve.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.860
But the height here is 2.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.440
So our area, the area between
the demand curve and our price

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.120
equals 2, is equal to 1/2
times base times height.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:12.700
1/2 times the base, which is 300
pounds, times the height, which

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.005
is $2 per pound.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.670
The pounds cancel out.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.620
1/2 times 2 is 1,
times 300 is 300.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.140
So we get 300.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.420
And all we're left
with is dollars.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.000
So the total consumer
surplus in this case is $300.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.960
And it really is just the
area between the demand curve

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.440
and this price equals 2
line right over there.
