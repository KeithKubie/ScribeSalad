00:00:00.107 --> 00:00:00.940
(whooshing)

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.107
(beeping)

00:00:05.168 --> 00:00:07.999
(gentle music)

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:09.210
(bouncy music)

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.120
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.453
Bipedal, naked, large brain,

00:00:17.348 --> 00:00:21.353
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:24.770
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.672 --> 00:00:28.853
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:28.853 --> 00:00:30.936
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.573
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.573 --> 00:00:37.145
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:39.228
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.784
We shape the future

00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:46.075
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.075 --> 00:00:49.703
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:49.703 --> 00:00:52.902
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:52.902 --> 00:00:54.569
and how we got here.

00:00:55.993 --> 00:00:57.623
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.623 --> 00:01:01.081
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.664
(bouncy music)

00:01:15.144 --> 00:01:17.727
(bright music)

00:01:20.826 --> 00:01:23.326
(perky music)

00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:40.619
- I'm gonna give you a perspective,

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.566
a very brief perspective,

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:45.089
on what I think is the topic today

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:47.848
from the vantage point of somebody

00:01:47.848 --> 00:01:52.424
who is a clinical neurologist
and a research geneticist.

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:54.927
That's really where I'm coming from.

00:01:54.927 --> 00:01:57.413
Hopefully this idea of a continuum

00:01:57.413 --> 00:02:00.080
will make sense as I go through.

00:02:00.918 --> 00:02:05.095
Two themes that I'd like
to present and discuss,

00:02:05.095 --> 00:02:06.974
human disorders of cognition and behavior

00:02:06.974 --> 00:02:09.393
are part of normal human variation,

00:02:09.393 --> 00:02:11.887
in other words the human condition.

00:02:11.887 --> 00:02:13.566
And to understand human brain function

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:16.531
we must understand individual variability.

00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:18.350
That's the key.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.933
From a geneticists' standpoint,

00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:23.009
this says, for those
of you who can't read,

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.078
because my genetic programming prevents me

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:29.047
from stopping to ask
directions, that's why.

00:02:29.047 --> 00:02:31.257
Those of you who have been
in that situation before,

00:02:31.257 --> 00:02:32.552
you can't blame your spouse.

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:34.885
This is genetic programming.

00:02:36.153 --> 00:02:37.734
Of course we know that that's not true,

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:41.788
that behavior is a combination
of genes and the environment.

00:02:41.788 --> 00:02:43.565
But genes play a kind of considerable role

00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:45.861
in all the behavior, as
I'll discuss really briefly,

00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:49.075
as well as brain structure and function,

00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:50.905
which is what underlies our behavior.

00:02:50.905 --> 00:02:54.738
It's the organ that is
essential for behavior.

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.848
Neuropsychiatric disorders
are also highly heritable.

00:02:59.848 --> 00:03:02.141
I'm just showing here in a

00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:03.950
how prevalent many of these disorders are.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.074
Even the rarest, like Tourette's syndrome,

00:03:06.074 --> 00:03:08.256
is close to a percent in the population,

00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:10.005
Schizophrenia about a percent,

00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:11.563
autism a little more then a percent

00:03:11.563 --> 00:03:15.730
all the way up to anxiety,
which is about 30% general.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.497
But if you look at the
calculated heritability,

00:03:19.497 --> 00:03:22.181
which is just an estimate
from twin and family studies,

00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:25.908
all of these disorders have
very substantial heritability.

00:03:25.908 --> 00:03:28.043
On some of them the error
bars are quite large,

00:03:28.043 --> 00:03:29.083
but they range.

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:30.527
None of them are less than 40%

00:03:30.527 --> 00:03:33.076
and many of them are over 80%.

00:03:33.076 --> 00:03:36.030
We really have a group of
highly heritable disorders

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.332
and the question is where
does that come from?

00:03:39.332 --> 00:03:42.013
Again, as a neuroscientist and neurologist

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:44.162
as well as a geneticist,

00:03:44.162 --> 00:03:47.035
genes interact with the
environment during development

00:03:47.035 --> 00:03:49.258
to lead to cerebral structure.

00:03:49.258 --> 00:03:51.417
Structure is not a static structure.

00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:54.009
This is a very highly dynamic structure.

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:55.414
We have what we can see,

00:03:55.414 --> 00:03:57.652
what you can see with
imaging or other tools.

00:03:57.652 --> 00:03:59.310
You have microscopic anatomy.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.912
But you also have chemical
and molecular plasticity

00:04:01.912 --> 00:04:04.936
that's ongoing virtually constantly.

00:04:04.936 --> 00:04:08.592
As you're listening to this it's ongoing.

00:04:08.592 --> 00:04:12.635
Of course, that is what
underlies cognitive function.

00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:15.241
Of course it's not a unidirectional.

00:04:15.241 --> 00:04:16.911
Development occurs over time

00:04:16.911 --> 00:04:19.035
and cognitive function and behavior

00:04:19.035 --> 00:04:20.686
feeds back on brain structure

00:04:20.686 --> 00:04:23.710
so there's a constant
iteration of the brain

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.255
as we develop and as we're
exposed to the environment.

00:04:27.255 --> 00:04:31.267
Of course, as we all look
around we can see each other

00:04:31.267 --> 00:04:34.186
and we're all highly variable,
we're all individuals.

00:04:34.186 --> 00:04:35.616
We look at each other,

00:04:35.616 --> 00:04:36.811
we should be able to tell each other

00:04:36.811 --> 00:04:39.900
all apart from each
other most of the time.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.887
The same thing with the brain.

00:04:41.887 --> 00:04:45.557
There's an enormous amount
of variability in the brain.

00:04:45.557 --> 00:04:47.651
Here is just one example of that

00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:51.151
that I found quite interesting
from Laurence Binder.

00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:52.818
This is the IQ test,

00:04:54.176 --> 00:04:56.585
or it's one of the IQ tests.

00:04:56.585 --> 00:04:58.075
Forgive me, I'm not a psychologist

00:04:58.075 --> 00:04:59.866
so I'm just presenting this.

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:01.921
This is from a paper that he did

00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:05.836
and basically if you go
up to 11 or 14 subtests

00:05:05.836 --> 00:05:09.107
on these different domains that make up IQ

00:05:09.107 --> 00:05:12.788
and look at the percentage
of people who score,

00:05:12.788 --> 00:05:16.554
these are normal people who
score in the abnormal range

00:05:16.554 --> 00:05:19.054
on at least one test, it's 71,

00:05:20.136 --> 00:05:23.186
and if you go to 14 the more tests 82%

00:05:23.186 --> 00:05:24.634
score in the abnormal range.

00:05:24.634 --> 00:05:28.051
If you look at three standard deviations,

00:05:29.609 --> 00:05:33.029
would be called abnormal in
psychoeducational testing,

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:36.770
it's almost a quarter when
you're doing 14 subtests.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.954
What does that mean?

00:05:37.954 --> 00:05:39.092
We all have strengths and weaknesses.

00:05:39.092 --> 00:05:41.558
We kind of know that, but
we don't act that way.

00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:43.366
Our educational system
doesn't work that way

00:05:43.366 --> 00:05:47.448
and a lot of times that we
even discuss our own colleagues

00:05:47.448 --> 00:05:49.711
we don't act that way.

00:05:49.711 --> 00:05:52.711
(audience laughing)

00:05:54.365 --> 00:05:55.438
Here's another point

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.654
is that if you look at
functional brain networks,

00:05:57.654 --> 00:05:59.557
which are just kind of color coded here,

00:05:59.557 --> 00:06:01.352
things that are interconnected
with each other,

00:06:01.352 --> 00:06:03.616
no brain area really acts alone,

00:06:03.616 --> 00:06:05.392
they're connected in networks.

00:06:05.392 --> 00:06:08.453
But if we look at a map of
inter-subject variability,

00:06:08.453 --> 00:06:10.120
red being very high,

00:06:11.056 --> 00:06:12.458
we can see that the areas

00:06:12.458 --> 00:06:14.902
of highest inter-subject variability

00:06:14.902 --> 00:06:19.069
are those areas that are
kind of the most multi-modal,

00:06:21.198 --> 00:06:24.617
called heteromodal, association cortices.

00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:25.700
These are not the regions

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.123
that are involved in primary sensation

00:06:28.123 --> 00:06:30.465
like vision or touch or motor function,

00:06:30.465 --> 00:06:34.017
these are the places where thoughts come

00:06:34.017 --> 00:06:36.085
and the environment is integrated.

00:06:36.085 --> 00:06:37.594
That's really a critical issue

00:06:37.594 --> 00:06:41.963
is that the things, like the
frontal lobe and other circuits

00:06:41.963 --> 00:06:45.514
that really make us who
we are, allow us to plan

00:06:45.514 --> 00:06:47.250
and really account for a lot

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.313
of our uniquely human characteristics,

00:06:49.313 --> 00:06:52.063
are the most variable between us.

00:06:54.133 --> 00:06:56.369
Of course I mentioned there's
a high degree of variability,

00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:58.254
there's also a high
degree of heritability.

00:06:58.254 --> 00:07:01.496
This is, again, my genetics viewpoint.

00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:03.676
I'm not deterministic,
please don't get that idea,

00:07:03.676 --> 00:07:04.525
but there are two twins.

00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:07.151
I just find this picture
so unbelievably cute.

00:07:07.151 --> 00:07:08.572
(audience laughing)

00:07:08.572 --> 00:07:10.478
Much cuter than the identical twin brains.

00:07:10.478 --> 00:07:14.322
The point here is that
identical twin brains

00:07:14.322 --> 00:07:16.440
are also highly similar,

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.507
just like twins look
similar on the outside,

00:07:18.507 --> 00:07:20.976
the brain, the structure, the function,

00:07:20.976 --> 00:07:22.210
highly, highly similar.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.167
In fact, most structures in the brain,

00:07:26.167 --> 00:07:28.744
let's start with the cerebral cortex,

00:07:28.744 --> 00:07:32.494
are around 70% to 80% heritability.

00:07:34.618 --> 00:07:36.685
This maintains over
the lifespan, actually,

00:07:36.685 --> 00:07:39.179
so it's quite interesting.

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:40.871
Then the question is,

00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:43.019
I showed you that IQ kind of test

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:47.019
that shows that you might
have a really high IQ,

00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:50.320
but the likelihood is
you're gonna be really poor

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.570
in a few areas.

00:07:52.716 --> 00:07:54.768
Let's explore that a little bit.

00:07:54.768 --> 00:07:57.412
Is ability really uni-dimensional?

00:07:57.412 --> 00:08:00.723
The concept of g, or general intelligence.

00:08:00.723 --> 00:08:01.630
This is highly heritable.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.804
I think its heritability is around .6

00:08:04.804 --> 00:08:07.776
and it's related to many
psychoeducational tests.

00:08:07.776 --> 00:08:10.186
Again, as a neurologist,
not as a psychologist,

00:08:10.186 --> 00:08:12.449
I look at it as things
that task working memory

00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:14.706
and frontal lobe function very strongly,

00:08:14.706 --> 00:08:16.510
but it doesn't predict many functions.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:20.677
You can have a very high IQ
and be bad in certain things.

00:08:22.213 --> 00:08:23.166
Therefore, again,

00:08:23.166 --> 00:08:27.272
just like that Binder
table that I showed you,

00:08:27.272 --> 00:08:31.874
we have to be really careful
when we're looking at people

00:08:31.874 --> 00:08:34.301
to really understand
strengths and weaknesses,

00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:36.585
which I think is one of the themes

00:08:36.585 --> 00:08:38.840
of the discussion that
we're gonna have today

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.923
talking about very unusual strengths.

00:08:44.552 --> 00:08:45.551
Ability is specific.

00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:47.152
I'm just gonna hammer
this in a little bit.

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:51.030
This is what I think is a
spectacular chalk drawing

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.303
from somebody that I don't know well,

00:08:53.303 --> 00:08:56.616
but I've talked to his mother
quite a bit at some times,

00:08:56.616 --> 00:09:00.393
who is an autistic artist
named Jonathan Lerman

00:09:00.393 --> 00:09:03.550
who is a really remarkable artist.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.864
The foreword to this book

00:09:04.864 --> 00:09:06.439
is written by the New
York Times art critic.

00:09:06.439 --> 00:09:09.366
This is a serious artist
and I have some of his art

00:09:09.366 --> 00:09:10.800
and it's very Picasso-esque.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.329
It's absolutely brilliant.

00:09:12.329 --> 00:09:14.876
But there are times when he's
been absolutely non-verbal

00:09:14.876 --> 00:09:17.214
and really highly dysfunctional

00:09:17.214 --> 00:09:19.256
and having a lot of problems.

00:09:19.256 --> 00:09:21.423
This is not that uncommon.

00:09:22.378 --> 00:09:23.718
How about me?

00:09:23.718 --> 00:09:25.380
I'm a relatively smart guy.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.922
I have a few degrees.

00:09:27.922 --> 00:09:28.797
I'm not up there

00:09:28.797 --> 00:09:30.600
with the people we're gonna
be talking about today.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.655
I don't have any of those qualities.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:34.522
I'm kind of not exceptional.

00:09:34.522 --> 00:09:36.272
I'm just a professor.

00:09:37.142 --> 00:09:38.182
(audience chuckling)

00:09:38.182 --> 00:09:39.596
No, seriously.

00:09:39.596 --> 00:09:42.180
There's nothing exceptional about that.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.263
And yet at the same time,

00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:47.964
I've had to do well in school

00:09:47.964 --> 00:09:50.284
and that's because school
involves writing and reading

00:09:50.284 --> 00:09:52.807
and mathematics and I can do that.

00:09:52.807 --> 00:09:54.555
But this is one thing I can't do,

00:09:54.555 --> 00:09:56.176
and this is not a joke.

00:09:56.176 --> 00:09:59.643
(audience laughing)

00:09:59.643 --> 00:10:01.187
I've been drawing like that

00:10:01.187 --> 00:10:02.883
since I was in third or fourth grade.

00:10:02.883 --> 00:10:05.249
This is the best I can do.

00:10:05.249 --> 00:10:06.499
I'm not joking.

00:10:08.077 --> 00:10:11.235
Ability is a combination of
genes and the environment

00:10:11.235 --> 00:10:13.328
so there's no question that
I could probably do better

00:10:13.328 --> 00:10:14.435
if I put my mind to it.

00:10:14.435 --> 00:10:16.771
Bruce Miller believes that I can.

00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:19.514
I've tried at times 'cause
my mom was an artist

00:10:19.514 --> 00:10:21.160
and she tried to get me to draw and stuff

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.842
and I was really, really bad.

00:10:22.842 --> 00:10:23.965
Just the point I want to make

00:10:23.965 --> 00:10:26.534
is that strengths and weaknesses,

00:10:26.534 --> 00:10:29.415
some strengths come together,
they come in groups,

00:10:29.415 --> 00:10:31.843
and we're gonna talk
about that a lot today,

00:10:31.843 --> 00:10:34.072
but the point is just because
one's strong in one area

00:10:34.072 --> 00:10:36.329
doesn't mean that you're
strong in all areas.

00:10:36.329 --> 00:10:37.704
If we had an educational system

00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:39.624
where I had to represent the world

00:10:39.624 --> 00:10:41.423
in two or three dimensions,

00:10:41.423 --> 00:10:45.184
I wouldn't have gotten
very far, I'm sure of that.

00:10:45.184 --> 00:10:48.276
How does this fit into genetics?

00:10:48.276 --> 00:10:53.276
This is from Wikimedia images,
one of my main sources.

00:10:53.276 --> 00:10:55.001
We use this a lot.

00:10:55.001 --> 00:10:57.198
It's actually probably
from Daniel MacArthur,

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:59.972
it's a cartoon from the Broad group.

00:10:59.972 --> 00:11:02.995
What you can see here
is this is 10,000 B.C.

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:04.812
This is around where we are right now.

00:11:04.812 --> 00:11:07.577
This is the estimated
population in billions.

00:11:07.577 --> 00:11:11.024
You can see that there's an enormous rise

00:11:11.024 --> 00:11:14.441
that humans were a very small population.

00:11:15.526 --> 00:11:20.062
We essentially have arisen
from an ancestral population

00:11:20.062 --> 00:11:22.312
more than 10,000 years ago.

00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:24.834
What's interesting

00:11:24.834 --> 00:11:27.375
is that we come from a
small set of ancestors

00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:32.117
and that means that we share
a common genetic variation

00:11:32.117 --> 00:11:35.776
that's been acted on by evolution.

00:11:35.776 --> 00:11:38.320
If those had been very deleterious,

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.137
anything that's highly
deleterious would get removed

00:11:41.137 --> 00:11:43.720
after thousands of generations.

00:11:45.046 --> 00:11:46.829
The variation that we all share

00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:48.307
that is common genetic variation,

00:11:48.307 --> 00:11:51.541
things greater than 1% in the population,

00:11:51.541 --> 00:11:54.624
our genomes are 99.9% identical.

00:11:55.707 --> 00:11:56.959
Those things that we share

00:11:56.959 --> 00:11:58.336
have been acted on by natural selection

00:11:58.336 --> 00:12:00.142
to remove strong bad actors.

00:12:00.142 --> 00:12:02.082
Therefore the things that contribute

00:12:02.082 --> 00:12:05.424
to most of our human phenotypes,

00:12:05.424 --> 00:12:08.196
from diabetes to human cognition,

00:12:08.196 --> 00:12:12.733
each individually have
very small effect sizes.

00:12:12.733 --> 00:12:15.233
So they haven't been purified.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:19.507
When we're looking for
genes that cause diseases,

00:12:19.507 --> 00:12:22.528
a lot of what's going on in
genetic association studies

00:12:22.528 --> 00:12:25.507
is we're looking for relatively
high frequency variance

00:12:25.507 --> 00:12:27.392
that are more than 1% in the population,

00:12:27.392 --> 00:12:29.302
but they have very small effect sizes

00:12:29.302 --> 00:12:31.338
as opposed to mutation screens

00:12:31.338 --> 00:12:33.479
that identify genes of large effect

00:12:33.479 --> 00:12:35.294
but they're generally much rarer.

00:12:35.294 --> 00:12:37.120
I'm not saying that all human variation

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.287
is due to common variation,
but a good deal of it is.

00:12:42.208 --> 00:12:45.181
We can begin to think, and
this is a classic behavior

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:46.860
from a behavior genetics textbook

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.104
from DeFries and Robert Plomin,

00:12:49.104 --> 00:12:51.882
actually the w doesn't belong there.

00:12:51.882 --> 00:12:56.451
There's part of my residual
dyslexia from childhood.

00:12:56.451 --> 00:12:58.116
Complex diseases and disorders

00:12:58.116 --> 00:13:00.656
and all complex human cognition

00:13:00.656 --> 00:13:03.505
lies on a continuum of normal variability,

00:13:03.505 --> 00:13:05.289
a disease threshold model

00:13:05.289 --> 00:13:07.932
where we get one copy
of each gene from mom

00:13:07.932 --> 00:13:11.661
and one from dad and
this particular variant,

00:13:11.661 --> 00:13:13.828
if you have the BB variant

00:13:15.048 --> 00:13:16.876
you're likely to be passed the threshold

00:13:16.876 --> 00:13:19.019
but it's not deterministic.

00:13:19.019 --> 00:13:22.289
Think about this as an additive
said of normal distributions

00:13:22.289 --> 00:13:24.849
where these variance of
very small effect sizes

00:13:24.849 --> 00:13:27.846
are adding, adding, adding up.

00:13:27.846 --> 00:13:31.064
Another point is that the
threshold is somewhat arbitrary

00:13:31.064 --> 00:13:32.513
in many cases.

00:13:32.513 --> 00:13:33.720
What's high blood pressure?

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.434
What's high glucose?

00:13:35.434 --> 00:13:37.234
What's bad reading?

00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:39.709
What's attention deficit
disorder, et cetera.

00:13:39.709 --> 00:13:42.350
This is all somewhat
an arbitrary threshold

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.045
that's based upon society

00:13:44.045 --> 00:13:46.886
and what usually,
hopefully, what's practical

00:13:46.886 --> 00:13:49.386
for the biomedical enterprise.

00:13:51.485 --> 00:13:53.599
This is the kind of foundation

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:56.474
that took me, when I
started to work on autism

00:13:56.474 --> 00:13:58.583
now about 17 years ago,

00:13:58.583 --> 00:14:01.415
to think about autism
as part of the continuum

00:14:01.415 --> 00:14:03.508
of normal variation.

00:14:03.508 --> 00:14:04.594
This is the idea.

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:09.359
Autism diagnosis depends
upon quantitative impairment

00:14:09.359 --> 00:14:10.477
in multiple domains.

00:14:10.477 --> 00:14:12.188
It's not qualitative.

00:14:12.188 --> 00:14:16.309
Some people here are really
good socially, some aren't.

00:14:16.309 --> 00:14:20.059
To become autistic you
have to fall out here.

00:14:21.474 --> 00:14:24.013
If you think of each of these

00:14:24.013 --> 00:14:25.734
as a contour of normal distribution

00:14:25.734 --> 00:14:28.214
where the green is highly advantageous,

00:14:28.214 --> 00:14:29.831
really superior functioning,

00:14:29.831 --> 00:14:32.581
and the red is less than optimal.

00:14:34.968 --> 00:14:35.956
Children with autism

00:14:35.956 --> 00:14:38.362
have to have repetitive
restrictive behavior

00:14:38.362 --> 00:14:40.388
and deficits in social behavior.

00:14:40.388 --> 00:14:43.247
The diagnosis has changed
over the last five years

00:14:43.247 --> 00:14:45.833
so that language is now not
fundamentally part of it

00:14:45.833 --> 00:14:47.495
but it often is.

00:14:47.495 --> 00:14:51.561
Just the point here is
that, again, a line is drawn

00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:54.003
and you have to have
impairment in multiple domains

00:14:54.003 --> 00:14:56.063
that's quantitative and measured

00:14:56.063 --> 00:14:57.647
so that those people that are here

00:14:57.647 --> 00:15:00.334
who might be a sibling on one area

00:15:00.334 --> 00:15:02.896
aren't autistic, of if they're here.

00:15:02.896 --> 00:15:04.259
That's arbitrary, again.

00:15:04.259 --> 00:15:06.548
It's our diagnosis.

00:15:06.548 --> 00:15:07.663
Do we have proof of that?

00:15:07.663 --> 00:15:08.809
Yes, there's quite a bit of proof.

00:15:08.809 --> 00:15:10.745
I'm gonna show you one
really nice piece of data

00:15:10.745 --> 00:15:14.912
that was published recently by
Elise Robinson and Mark Daly.

00:15:17.701 --> 00:15:19.277
Social function in those without autism

00:15:19.277 --> 00:15:21.914
is strongly related to
the same genetic factors

00:15:21.914 --> 00:15:24.443
that increase autism genetic risk.

00:15:24.443 --> 00:15:25.622
What you can do is you can come up

00:15:25.622 --> 00:15:28.220
with a compositive genetic score,

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.835
all these little small
common risk variance,

00:15:30.835 --> 00:15:34.258
add them up in what's called
a polygenic risk score.

00:15:34.258 --> 00:15:36.677
You can ask if I have that for autism

00:15:36.677 --> 00:15:39.477
and it has about a 70% prediction

00:15:39.477 --> 00:15:41.307
for who's gonna be autistic,

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:43.708
how well is that correlated

00:15:43.708 --> 00:15:47.208
with just autism in the normal population?

00:15:48.046 --> 00:15:50.224
And the normal population being used here

00:15:50.224 --> 00:15:54.236
is a longitudinal study of
parents and children in Avon,

00:15:54.236 --> 00:15:57.905
it's in England, it's called ALSPAC.

00:15:57.905 --> 00:16:00.444
If you look, you can see
that the genetic correlation

00:16:00.444 --> 00:16:03.980
between the Psychiatric
Genomics Consortium Autism

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:08.637
and a Danish autism consortium
are both close to .3.

00:16:08.637 --> 00:16:10.811
That's an enormous correlation.

00:16:10.811 --> 00:16:11.644
That's telling us

00:16:11.644 --> 00:16:14.738
that the things in the
common variation that we have

00:16:14.738 --> 00:16:19.387
that predisposes to autism
is part of normal variation.

00:16:19.387 --> 00:16:21.048
How about other things?

00:16:21.048 --> 00:16:22.422
You're gonna hear a lot more

00:16:22.422 --> 00:16:23.660
about some of these topics today

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.930
but I just wanted to touch on them

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.945
and give you a point of
view, maybe a framework.

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:29.443
There's something called synaesthesia.

00:16:29.443 --> 00:16:32.347
And this is a slide from my
colleague Simon Baron Cohen

00:16:32.347 --> 00:16:35.362
who would have given a much
better talk than I am giving

00:16:35.362 --> 00:16:38.045
and unfortunately can't be here.

00:16:38.045 --> 00:16:40.238
Stimulation of one sensory modality

00:16:40.238 --> 00:16:43.993
automatically triggers a
perception in a second.

00:16:43.993 --> 00:16:47.076
It might be that when you see a word,

00:16:47.922 --> 00:16:49.573
you hear music with it.

00:16:49.573 --> 00:16:50.406
Or vice versa.

00:16:50.406 --> 00:16:53.233
When you hear music, there's
a color associated with it.

00:16:53.233 --> 00:16:54.999
It's actually present in
some degree or another

00:16:54.999 --> 00:16:57.416
in 4% of the population.

00:17:01.352 --> 00:17:05.102
There's evidence that
it has genetic factors.

00:17:06.236 --> 00:17:09.669
About almost 40% have at
least one other family member

00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:12.164
with synesthesia and
there's been some evidence

00:17:12.164 --> 00:17:14.850
of genetic linkage even, but
no genes have been identified

00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:16.107
as far as I'm aware,

00:17:16.107 --> 00:17:19.274
but maybe Simon knows or Simon Fisher.

00:17:20.255 --> 00:17:22.461
Now I'm gonna tell you just a brief bit

00:17:22.461 --> 00:17:25.613
about somebody that Simon
Baron Cohen knows quite well,

00:17:25.613 --> 00:17:26.974
which is Daniel Tammet.

00:17:26.974 --> 00:17:29.553
Many of you may have read
his book Born on a Blue Day.

00:17:29.553 --> 00:17:31.272
If you haven't read it, you must read it.

00:17:31.272 --> 00:17:33.605
It is an extraordinary book.

00:17:35.604 --> 00:17:36.752
If you haven't read it,

00:17:36.752 --> 00:17:40.883
you wouldn't believe that
there's somebody who can do this.

00:17:40.883 --> 00:17:42.776
He sees numbers as shapes and colors.

00:17:42.776 --> 00:17:44.953
This Test of Genuineness is a test

00:17:44.953 --> 00:17:47.180
that is related to synesthesia.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.288
He's invented his own language.

00:17:48.288 --> 00:17:49.445
He learns languages in two weeks.

00:17:49.445 --> 00:17:52.960
I think he learned Finnish
in two weeks perfectly.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.822
He performs mathematical calculations

00:17:54.822 --> 00:17:56.488
that you can't imagine.

00:17:56.488 --> 00:18:00.155
He is the European
champion in Pi to 22,515.

00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:04.790
And he has Asperger's syndrome.

00:18:06.399 --> 00:18:08.197
Okay, that's an interesting observation.

00:18:08.197 --> 00:18:11.785
That's a very, rare, unique
individual with these features.

00:18:11.785 --> 00:18:13.785
You can ask the question

00:18:14.695 --> 00:18:17.535
is synesthesia increased
in people with autism?

00:18:17.535 --> 00:18:20.096
If independent, synesthesia
and autism should co-occur

00:18:20.096 --> 00:18:22.513
in four out of 10,000 people.

00:18:24.121 --> 00:18:25.021
But they're not.

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:26.195
Simon Baron Cohen's study

00:18:26.195 --> 00:18:28.173
shows that it's present in almost 19%.

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:30.462
Of course, this is done via questionnaire

00:18:30.462 --> 00:18:32.697
so it would have to be
redone measuring it.

00:18:32.697 --> 00:18:37.557
I think one would argue
that it's quite enriched.

00:18:37.557 --> 00:18:39.172
There's also an enrichment

00:18:39.172 --> 00:18:43.830
among those who have perfect
pitch with synesthesia,

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:46.455
in this study about 20%.

00:18:46.455 --> 00:18:48.397
There's a relationship
of some of the things

00:18:48.397 --> 00:18:50.781
that we're gonna be talking about today

00:18:50.781 --> 00:18:54.202
that are really extraordinary
variations on the human mind

00:18:54.202 --> 00:18:56.535
and common genetic variation

00:18:57.802 --> 00:19:01.057
and what we think of as intellectual

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:04.654
or behavior disabilities or disorders.

00:19:04.654 --> 00:19:05.947
I'll leave you with one thought.

00:19:05.947 --> 00:19:07.943
What does it mean that a
feature that is present rarely

00:19:07.943 --> 00:19:09.572
in the general population

00:19:09.572 --> 00:19:11.981
is more frequent in those with a disorder?

00:19:11.981 --> 00:19:13.607
Of course it means that
the human condition

00:19:13.607 --> 00:19:15.638
is one of strengths and weaknesses

00:19:15.638 --> 00:19:18.660
and that great strength can
be the flip side of disability

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.323
and in part, this is because
of the genetic contributions

00:19:21.323 --> 00:19:23.529
to evolution, to human brain evolution,

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:27.047
that we've inherited strengths
along with weaknesses

00:19:27.047 --> 00:19:30.465
and sometimes they lead to
what we call a disorder.

00:19:30.465 --> 00:19:33.220
I'm gonna leave you with
another interesting thought

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.053
that if you look

00:19:34.053 --> 00:19:35.921
at the most variable
brain regions in humans

00:19:35.921 --> 00:19:38.314
there are also those
that have expanded most

00:19:38.314 --> 00:19:39.483
on the human lineage,

00:19:39.483 --> 00:19:41.415
getting back to one of my earliest slides.

00:19:41.415 --> 00:19:45.251
Again, this is from a paper
Mueller et al A Neuron in 2013.

00:19:45.251 --> 00:19:48.113
Basically if you look at the
cortical surface expansion

00:19:48.113 --> 00:19:50.991
in this frontal, parietal,
temporal lobe area

00:19:50.991 --> 00:19:52.278
and then you look at the areas

00:19:52.278 --> 00:19:55.128
with the most inter-subject
variability, there it is.

00:19:55.128 --> 00:19:57.981
We know that cortical surface volume,

00:19:57.981 --> 00:20:00.512
especially volume as highly heritabile,

00:20:00.512 --> 00:20:04.679
so that this variability is
highly heritabile as well.

00:20:06.031 --> 00:20:07.729
You can look at this correlation.

00:20:07.729 --> 00:20:09.940
There's a strong correlation throughout,

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.652
not just in my picture.

00:20:12.652 --> 00:20:15.072
We've had 150 years in
behavioral neurology

00:20:15.072 --> 00:20:16.241
of learning from the individual

00:20:16.241 --> 00:20:19.090
from Tan, who was Broca's first patient,

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.376
and from seeing two patients

00:20:21.376 --> 00:20:24.360
he reasoned that language
was in the frontal lobes.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.856
Maybe that was a little too specific.

00:20:25.856 --> 00:20:27.813
Wernicke helped him out a little bit.

00:20:27.813 --> 00:20:30.311
But he reasoned that the cerebral cortex

00:20:30.311 --> 00:20:33.649
was therefore asymmetric and
that language was on one side.

00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:36.046
Here's another patient, Patient HM,

00:20:36.046 --> 00:20:38.199
who was one of a series of patients

00:20:38.199 --> 00:20:40.569
who had bilateral hippocampal damage

00:20:40.569 --> 00:20:45.082
and played important roles in
our understanding of memory.

00:20:45.082 --> 00:20:48.165
Again, I wanna say that we must learn

00:20:49.497 --> 00:20:51.137
to continue to understand the nature

00:20:51.137 --> 00:20:52.882
of individual differences

00:20:52.882 --> 00:20:56.537
and how disease, what we
call disease and disorders,

00:20:56.537 --> 00:20:58.890
is really just part of
the human condition.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.781
These exceptional variations

00:21:00.781 --> 00:21:04.060
are often strongly associated
with vulnerabilities.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.414
Thank you.

00:21:05.414 --> 00:21:07.255
(audience applauding)

00:21:07.255 --> 00:21:09.908
- It is a pleasure and an honor to be here

00:21:09.908 --> 00:21:12.465
and to have the opportunity
to talk with you

00:21:12.465 --> 00:21:16.632
about our work integrating
genes, brain, and behavior

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:22.794
in a truly extraordinary human condition

00:21:22.794 --> 00:21:25.579
called Williams syndrome.

00:21:25.579 --> 00:21:28.875
An important point of
departure for this talk

00:21:28.875 --> 00:21:32.708
is the fact that brain
function or disfunction

00:21:33.544 --> 00:21:38.203
can be observed at multiple
levels of neuronal organization.

00:21:38.203 --> 00:21:41.577
The most basic, of
course, is gene expression

00:21:41.577 --> 00:21:46.236
which works through cellular
and brain circuitry mechanisms

00:21:46.236 --> 00:21:49.387
to produce the complex emergent phenomena

00:21:49.387 --> 00:21:52.447
that make us who and what we are,

00:21:52.447 --> 00:21:54.660
conferring complex behaviors,

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:59.173
and, in some cases,
susceptibility to disorders.

00:21:59.173 --> 00:22:01.923
There's been a tremendous impetus

00:22:03.501 --> 00:22:05.457
in our research portfolios

00:22:05.457 --> 00:22:09.325
to understand the genetic determinance

00:22:09.325 --> 00:22:11.197
of this cascade of events.

00:22:11.197 --> 00:22:14.519
It's really easy to understand
why this is the case

00:22:14.519 --> 00:22:17.886
because genes are entry
points to molecular pathways

00:22:17.886 --> 00:22:20.328
that can lead us to new treatments,

00:22:20.328 --> 00:22:23.118
to early detection and
possibly to prevention

00:22:23.118 --> 00:22:27.574
of diseases and teach
us about our variability

00:22:27.574 --> 00:22:30.273
and what makes us who and what we are.

00:22:30.273 --> 00:22:32.602
I'm going to be telling
you about Williams syndrome

00:22:32.602 --> 00:22:35.860
which is a truly extraordinary model

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.298
of phenotype, genotype relationships

00:22:39.298 --> 00:22:41.851
and that allows us to make inferences

00:22:41.851 --> 00:22:46.098
across these multiple levels
of neuronal organization

00:22:46.098 --> 00:22:48.579
and sometimes disorganization.

00:22:48.579 --> 00:22:49.681
Let me tell you first

00:22:49.681 --> 00:22:53.490
about the genetics of Williams syndrome.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:56.314
This is a rare disorder.

00:22:56.314 --> 00:22:59.897
It exists in somewhere
between one in 7,500

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.125
and one in 20,000 live births,

00:23:05.125 --> 00:23:08.592
depending on whose
statistics one believes.

00:23:08.592 --> 00:23:11.955
It is caused by the
removal, the hemi deletion,

00:23:11.955 --> 00:23:15.689
of one copy of a number of
genes, about 25 of them,

00:23:15.689 --> 00:23:19.301
on chromosome seven in this locale.

00:23:19.301 --> 00:23:23.301
This is about 1.6 megabases
of genetic material.

00:23:25.036 --> 00:23:27.773
This is a very active part of our genome

00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:31.625
and the reason is that this segment of DNA

00:23:31.625 --> 00:23:35.330
is flanked on both sides
for everyone in this room

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.558
by low copy repeat sequences.

00:23:38.558 --> 00:23:42.111
This means that there
are similar DNA sequences

00:23:42.111 --> 00:23:43.793
here and here.

00:23:43.793 --> 00:23:46.458
It's thought that these
are of recent origin

00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:50.625
and rapid evolution that play
a role in hominid speciation.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:56.261
This causes mistakes during recombination.

00:23:56.261 --> 00:23:58.774
These two ends can get mixed up.

00:23:58.774 --> 00:24:03.017
This leads to either
the removal of one copy,

00:24:03.017 --> 00:24:06.201
which is what causes Williams syndrome,

00:24:06.201 --> 00:24:09.618
or duplication, which causes three copies

00:24:10.756 --> 00:24:13.676
of genes to be present in this region.

00:24:13.676 --> 00:24:15.708
At the end of my talk I'll tell you

00:24:15.708 --> 00:24:19.703
about this fascinating
duplication syndrome.

00:24:19.703 --> 00:24:22.377
But first about Williams syndrome.

00:24:22.377 --> 00:24:26.154
I, and my colleagues, we were
drawn to Williams syndrome

00:24:26.154 --> 00:24:28.769
because this is a very well-defined,

00:24:28.769 --> 00:24:32.936
circumscribed cognitive behavioral
profile in human beings,

00:24:34.392 --> 00:24:36.796
which I'll tell you about in a moment.

00:24:36.796 --> 00:24:39.561
Moreover the affected genes are known,

00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:42.764
unlike many of the complex
disorders that we study.

00:24:42.764 --> 00:24:45.930
Schizophrenia, autism, et cetera,

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:50.676
many of the ones that Doctor
Geschwind showed before.

00:24:50.676 --> 00:24:53.778
We hoped that by studying
Williams syndrome,

00:24:53.778 --> 00:24:57.136
this gold standard
phenotype, genotype link,

00:24:57.136 --> 00:25:01.513
that we would be able to
uncover neurogenetic mechanisms

00:25:01.513 --> 00:25:05.680
that underlie complex human
behaviors and disorders.

00:25:08.305 --> 00:25:11.538
Our strategy has been to very carefully

00:25:11.538 --> 00:25:14.663
define the brain phenotype,
the brain features,

00:25:14.663 --> 00:25:16.775
that characterize Williams syndrome

00:25:16.775 --> 00:25:20.246
and to use this information
to bridge the knowledge gap

00:25:20.246 --> 00:25:22.970
between genes and behavior.

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:26.758
Let me tell you a little
bit about the syndrome.

00:25:26.758 --> 00:25:28.226
People with Williams syndrome

00:25:28.226 --> 00:25:30.825
have facial features
that are very similar.

00:25:30.825 --> 00:25:33.154
This is an old picture, very famous,

00:25:33.154 --> 00:25:37.347
from one of Doctor
Bellugi's seminal papers,

00:25:37.347 --> 00:25:39.924
and you can see how much
these unrelated children

00:25:39.924 --> 00:25:42.224
with Williams syndrome look.

00:25:42.224 --> 00:25:45.844
It was really two hallmark
neurobehavioral features

00:25:45.844 --> 00:25:47.474
that caught our interest.

00:25:47.474 --> 00:25:49.299
One in the domain of personality,

00:25:49.299 --> 00:25:51.593
and one in the domain of cognition.

00:25:51.593 --> 00:25:54.054
I'll be speaking about each of these.

00:25:54.054 --> 00:25:56.699
Let's talk about the
cognitive profile first.

00:25:56.699 --> 00:25:59.116
This is a distinctive pattern

00:26:00.061 --> 00:26:03.325
of peaks and valleys in abilities.

00:26:03.325 --> 00:26:05.822
Language is very good.

00:26:05.822 --> 00:26:08.025
Face recognition is preserved.

00:26:08.025 --> 00:26:12.547
But visuospatial construction
is markedly impaired.

00:26:12.547 --> 00:26:14.569
Visuospatial construction is the ability

00:26:14.569 --> 00:26:17.802
to visualize an object or
picture as a set of parts

00:26:17.802 --> 00:26:21.634
and construct a replica of
the object from those parts.

00:26:21.634 --> 00:26:25.694
This is the classic neuropsychometric test

00:26:25.694 --> 00:26:30.534
that's used to access visuospatial
constructive abilities.

00:26:30.534 --> 00:26:32.491
This is the block design test.

00:26:32.491 --> 00:26:34.349
People are shown a model like this

00:26:34.349 --> 00:26:35.931
and they're given some blocks

00:26:35.931 --> 00:26:37.416
and asked to reconstruct it.

00:26:37.416 --> 00:26:40.642
You can see how poorly folks
with Williams syndrome do

00:26:40.642 --> 00:26:43.394
even compared to folks with Downs syndrome

00:26:43.394 --> 00:26:44.894
with the same IQs.

00:26:46.042 --> 00:26:48.807
Another way that this can
be accessed is by drawing,

00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:50.774
which Doctor Geschwind was talking about.

00:26:50.774 --> 00:26:55.384
This is a 9 1/2 year old
child drawing a bicycle.

00:26:55.384 --> 00:26:58.139
We would not know at all
that this was a bicycle

00:26:58.139 --> 00:27:00.227
if the parts weren't labeled for us.

00:27:00.227 --> 00:27:04.168
So a dissolution of this
information in space.

00:27:04.168 --> 00:27:08.338
I love this example, again,
from a work of Doctor Bellugi's.

00:27:08.338 --> 00:27:11.074
This is an elephant and
we would not know that

00:27:11.074 --> 00:27:12.811
if this weren't labeled.

00:27:12.811 --> 00:27:15.304
This is a pretty impoverished picture

00:27:15.304 --> 00:27:18.971
and compare it to this
rather rich depiction

00:27:20.035 --> 00:27:23.010
in the verbal domain from the same teen

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.015
with Williams syndrome.

00:27:24.015 --> 00:27:25.630
I'll read some of it to you.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:26.928
It lives in the jungle.

00:27:26.928 --> 00:27:28.267
It can also live in the zoo.

00:27:28.267 --> 00:27:30.943
It has long, great ears, fan ears,

00:27:30.943 --> 00:27:32.765
ears that can blow in the wind.

00:27:32.765 --> 00:27:35.026
If they're in a bad
mood it can be terrible.

00:27:35.026 --> 00:27:36.833
It could stomp, it could charge.

00:27:36.833 --> 00:27:38.561
They have big long tusks.

00:27:38.561 --> 00:27:40.052
They can damage a car.

00:27:40.052 --> 00:27:41.640
You don't want an elephant as a pet.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.018
You want a cat, a dog, or a bird.

00:27:44.018 --> 00:27:46.394
(audience laughing)

00:27:46.394 --> 00:27:48.978
Pretty rich and very lyrical, almost,

00:27:48.978 --> 00:27:51.711
compared to this impoverished drawing.

00:27:51.711 --> 00:27:54.972
Domain specificity of
the peaks and valleys

00:27:54.972 --> 00:27:56.694
in Williams syndrome.

00:27:56.694 --> 00:27:58.427
My colleagues and I over the years

00:27:58.427 --> 00:27:59.687
have done a number of studies

00:27:59.687 --> 00:28:02.671
trying to understand the brain features

00:28:02.671 --> 00:28:04.946
that go along with that inability.

00:28:04.946 --> 00:28:08.529
This is a posterior
back view of the brain.

00:28:09.723 --> 00:28:13.364
We, and others now, have
found a structural anomaly.

00:28:13.364 --> 00:28:14.704
This is not a lesion.

00:28:14.704 --> 00:28:17.625
It would not be read as
such by any radiologist.

00:28:17.625 --> 00:28:19.442
But this is a statistical finding,

00:28:19.442 --> 00:28:21.697
a reduction in gray matter volume,

00:28:21.697 --> 00:28:23.452
the gray matter of our brains,

00:28:23.452 --> 00:28:26.349
right here early in the dorsal stream

00:28:26.349 --> 00:28:30.458
that crosses where objects are in space.

00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:33.002
We also found functional deficits

00:28:33.002 --> 00:28:37.155
that emerged from this structural anomaly.

00:28:37.155 --> 00:28:40.192
This has been a very well replicated

00:28:40.192 --> 00:28:43.708
and reliable brain phenotype
for mapping gene effects.

00:28:43.708 --> 00:28:48.284
That, of course, was our goal
in starting out these studies.

00:28:48.284 --> 00:28:50.647
We have found, I don't have
time to talk about this today,

00:28:50.647 --> 00:28:53.973
although perhaps we will in
the question and answer part,

00:28:53.973 --> 00:28:55.474
but we found this to be linked

00:28:55.474 --> 00:28:58.835
to one particular gene in
the Williams syndrome region,

00:28:58.835 --> 00:29:00.657
the LIMK1 gene.

00:29:00.657 --> 00:29:04.284
I'd like to turn to the
Williams syndrome profile now

00:29:04.284 --> 00:29:06.820
because this is, in many ways,

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:10.963
the most immediately apparent
and captivating aspect

00:29:10.963 --> 00:29:13.400
of folks with this syndrome.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.552
They are highly and overly social,

00:29:15.552 --> 00:29:18.228
they are empathic, outgoing, loquacious,

00:29:18.228 --> 00:29:22.271
charming, unusually friendly,
even with strangers,

00:29:22.271 --> 00:29:26.535
however, they're anxious in
some non-social situations.

00:29:26.535 --> 00:29:28.618
Never social, non-social.

00:29:30.623 --> 00:29:34.908
Increased sociability, increased
number of social contacts,

00:29:34.908 --> 00:29:38.992
increased empathy that can
be measured experimentally.

00:29:38.992 --> 00:29:42.667
They don't observe social
distance unless they're taught to.

00:29:42.667 --> 00:29:44.914
They're socially fearless even in infancy,

00:29:44.914 --> 00:29:48.529
but there is this strong
increase in non-social anxiety.

00:29:48.529 --> 00:29:51.461
My colleagues and I have also
searched for brain features

00:29:51.461 --> 00:29:54.646
underlying this aspect
of Williams syndrome

00:29:54.646 --> 00:29:56.728
and we've become very interested

00:29:56.728 --> 00:29:58.567
in an area called the insula

00:29:58.567 --> 00:30:01.657
and convinced that it's important.

00:30:01.657 --> 00:30:03.217
This is an area of the brain

00:30:03.217 --> 00:30:05.363
that integrates cognitive,

00:30:05.363 --> 00:30:07.768
affective, and social information.

00:30:07.768 --> 00:30:10.134
It plays a crucial role in empathy,

00:30:10.134 --> 00:30:12.952
in interoception,
thinking about ourselves,

00:30:12.952 --> 00:30:14.428
and in social functions.

00:30:14.428 --> 00:30:15.936
It's a great candidate.

00:30:15.936 --> 00:30:19.519
We have found that both
the structural size

00:30:21.365 --> 00:30:24.183
and the function of
this region of the brain

00:30:24.183 --> 00:30:28.386
predicts the degree to
which this Williams syndrome

00:30:28.386 --> 00:30:32.304
personality profile is expressed
in individual patients.

00:30:32.304 --> 00:30:36.656
We've replicated this in a
large number of children now.

00:30:36.656 --> 00:30:40.396
We have linked this to a general
transcription factor gene

00:30:40.396 --> 00:30:43.643
that is in the Williams syndrome region.

00:30:43.643 --> 00:30:45.246
I'd like to turn now to talk to you

00:30:45.246 --> 00:30:47.759
about children with duplications.

00:30:47.759 --> 00:30:52.668
These folks have three copies
of these relevant genes.

00:30:52.668 --> 00:30:55.351
They provide a remarkable opportunity

00:30:55.351 --> 00:30:59.270
and are extraordinarily interesting also.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:03.167
People with the deletion
were described first

00:31:03.167 --> 00:31:07.497
about a decade ago by my colleague
Carolyn Mervis and others

00:31:07.497 --> 00:31:09.137
and you can see right away

00:31:09.137 --> 00:31:10.701
that people with the duplication

00:31:10.701 --> 00:31:12.236
have similar facial features,

00:31:12.236 --> 00:31:14.073
as do those with with Williams syndrome,

00:31:14.073 --> 00:31:15.903
but they're quite different.

00:31:15.903 --> 00:31:20.070
They differ in other very
important and interesting ways.

00:31:21.144 --> 00:31:22.582
Williams syndrome, as I've told you,

00:31:22.582 --> 00:31:24.770
has a weakness in spatial skills,

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.541
whereas there's a relative
strength in spatial skills

00:31:27.541 --> 00:31:29.079
in the duplication.

00:31:29.079 --> 00:31:30.762
You can see this in examples

00:31:30.762 --> 00:31:35.341
from two of our children
patients, child patients.

00:31:35.341 --> 00:31:38.170
This is a 12 1/2 year old
with Williams syndrome

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.792
drawing a bike, a little impoverished.

00:31:40.792 --> 00:31:44.721
This is a 10-year-old with
a duplication drawing a bike

00:31:44.721 --> 00:31:47.797
and you can clearly see the
contrast in the level of detail

00:31:47.797 --> 00:31:50.964
and spatial integration in this image.

00:31:54.989 --> 00:31:56.274
Folks with Williams syndrome

00:31:56.274 --> 00:31:58.515
have a strength in expressive language.

00:31:58.515 --> 00:32:02.682
They're very personable and
good language relative to IQ.

00:32:04.162 --> 00:32:07.063
People with the duplication

00:32:07.063 --> 00:32:11.069
have a marked speech and language delay,

00:32:11.069 --> 00:32:13.802
and this is often why
they come to the attention

00:32:13.802 --> 00:32:14.757
of clinicians.

00:32:14.757 --> 00:32:16.291
So a contrast there.

00:32:16.291 --> 00:32:19.367
People with Williams syndrome
are excessively social.

00:32:19.367 --> 00:32:22.019
However, people with the duplication

00:32:22.019 --> 00:32:25.561
have problematic and
reduced social function

00:32:25.561 --> 00:32:28.988
and, in fact, there was
a very influential paper

00:32:28.988 --> 00:32:32.155
from UCSF showing that the duplication

00:32:33.268 --> 00:32:36.435
of Williams syndrome genes is formally

00:32:37.477 --> 00:32:42.356
and statistically associated
with a diagnosis of autism.

00:32:42.356 --> 00:32:45.542
We've actually shown this experimentally

00:32:45.542 --> 00:32:48.284
using a personality questionnaire

00:32:48.284 --> 00:32:52.367
in which we found a factor,
a sociability factor,

00:32:53.566 --> 00:32:56.018
comprised of cheerfulness, gregariousness,

00:32:56.018 --> 00:33:00.180
people-orientedness,
visibility, affectionateness,

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:04.825
and responsivity that
had a step-wise function

00:33:04.825 --> 00:33:06.924
according to the number of genes.

00:33:06.924 --> 00:33:09.108
One copy in Williams syndrome,

00:33:09.108 --> 00:33:11.371
here's their sociability score.

00:33:11.371 --> 00:33:15.930
Two copies in typically
developing children, around zero.

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:18.729
And three, in the duplication syndrome.

00:33:18.729 --> 00:33:23.000
We're using these values to
search for brain features

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.697
that may correlate with this gene dosage.

00:33:26.697 --> 00:33:29.366
We believe that these brain features exist

00:33:29.366 --> 00:33:30.488
and we will find them

00:33:30.488 --> 00:33:33.228
and we actually have
some preliminary evidence

00:33:33.228 --> 00:33:35.940
that I wanna share with you.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.045
With regard to total brain volume

00:33:38.045 --> 00:33:40.085
and relative cerebellar volume

00:33:40.085 --> 00:33:42.908
we see opposite but step-wise functions.

00:33:42.908 --> 00:33:47.098
One copy, two copies, three
copies of these genes.

00:33:47.098 --> 00:33:49.908
One copy, two copies, three
copies of these genes.

00:33:49.908 --> 00:33:52.061
What's interesting about this

00:33:52.061 --> 00:33:55.051
is that the findings in
the duplication syndrome

00:33:55.051 --> 00:33:57.860
are also evident in autism,

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:02.289
although there is some
controversy about this.

00:34:02.289 --> 00:34:05.566
It will be such a privilege
to continue this work

00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:08.093
and to continue to see these children

00:34:08.093 --> 00:34:09.831
longitudinally over time,

00:34:09.831 --> 00:34:13.882
which we're doing at the NIH right now.

00:34:13.882 --> 00:34:16.398
Contrasting behaviors and brain features

00:34:16.398 --> 00:34:19.391
associated with step-wise alterations

00:34:19.391 --> 00:34:22.558
in these particular genes, in 7q11.23,

00:34:24.653 --> 00:34:27.612
one copy of affected gene
in Williams syndrome,

00:34:27.612 --> 00:34:29.899
two copies in the general population,

00:34:29.899 --> 00:34:32.355
three in the duplication syndrome.

00:34:32.355 --> 00:34:34.660
This is a very clear road

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:37.438
to uncovering neurogenetic mechanisms

00:34:37.438 --> 00:34:39.419
and an extraordinary opportunity

00:34:39.419 --> 00:34:42.644
to understand what makes
us who and what we are

00:34:42.644 --> 00:34:44.558
and what biological mechanisms

00:34:44.558 --> 00:34:48.530
confer our wonderful human variability.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.403
It's an extraordinary syndrome

00:34:50.403 --> 00:34:52.296
and a privilege to study it.

00:34:52.296 --> 00:34:55.571
I'd like to take a moment
to thank our families

00:34:55.571 --> 00:34:57.327
and our participants,

00:34:57.327 --> 00:34:59.179
and I'd like to thank Doctor Bellugi

00:34:59.179 --> 00:35:02.701
for her continuing inspiration
throughout my career,

00:35:02.701 --> 00:35:04.923
and you for your attention.

00:35:04.923 --> 00:35:08.087
(audience applauding)

00:35:08.087 --> 00:35:12.599
- Why is a geneticist interested
in something like language,

00:35:12.599 --> 00:35:14.666
something that we learn?

00:35:14.666 --> 00:35:15.778
To answer this question,

00:35:15.778 --> 00:35:17.830
I'm gonna hand over to somebody

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:20.190
who's much more eloquent than I am

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:23.234
and it's this fellow here, Charles Darwin.

00:35:23.234 --> 00:35:25.937
About almost 150 years ago

00:35:25.937 --> 00:35:28.556
he really summed up what's amazing

00:35:28.556 --> 00:35:29.815
and remarkable about language.

00:35:29.815 --> 00:35:33.675
He said, "Language is an
art like brewing or baking.

00:35:33.675 --> 00:35:35.627
"It certainly is not a true instinct,

00:35:35.627 --> 00:35:37.629
"for every language has to be learned.

00:35:37.629 --> 00:35:40.041
"It differs widely from all ordinary arts,

00:35:40.041 --> 00:35:43.109
"for man has an instinctive
tendency to speak,

00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:45.678
"as we see in the babble
of our young children,

00:35:45.678 --> 00:35:49.176
"while no child has an
instinctive tendency

00:35:49.176 --> 00:35:51.474
"to brew, bake, or write."

00:35:51.474 --> 00:35:53.972
This really beautifully captures

00:35:53.972 --> 00:35:56.269
something strange about language.

00:35:56.269 --> 00:35:59.106
Let's dig into this a little bit more.

00:35:59.106 --> 00:36:02.280
By the time a child is
only a few years of age,

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.561
they've already assembled a vocabulary

00:36:05.561 --> 00:36:07.394
of thousands of words.

00:36:09.219 --> 00:36:11.570
They can assemble these words

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:14.750
into a potentially limitless
number of meaningful sentences

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.587
using grammatical rules.

00:36:16.587 --> 00:36:18.051
These meaningful sentences

00:36:18.051 --> 00:36:20.395
can relate not only to the present,

00:36:20.395 --> 00:36:24.888
but also the past, the future,
even abstract concepts.

00:36:24.888 --> 00:36:28.458
Then something that we
take completely for granted

00:36:28.458 --> 00:36:30.308
but is really extraordinary

00:36:30.308 --> 00:36:33.911
is the ability that a child learns

00:36:33.911 --> 00:36:36.662
to take the thoughts that are
sitting inside their heads

00:36:36.662 --> 00:36:39.435
and convert them into streams of sound

00:36:39.435 --> 00:36:42.831
via the most incredible
feat of motor control

00:36:42.831 --> 00:36:47.647
of the articulatory
functions moving the muscles

00:36:47.647 --> 00:36:51.433
that control the face,
the jaw, the larynx,

00:36:51.433 --> 00:36:55.384
in this rapid kind of
dance of motor function

00:36:55.384 --> 00:36:58.690
that converts thoughts
into streams of sound.

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:02.563
And then another child's
ears can do an amazing thing

00:37:02.563 --> 00:37:04.328
which is to kind of reverse engineer,

00:37:04.328 --> 00:37:07.304
decode the stream of
sound, reverse engineer it,

00:37:07.304 --> 00:37:09.300
figure out what the original thought was,

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.451
and come to their own conclusions.

00:37:12.451 --> 00:37:14.073
All these different things

00:37:14.073 --> 00:37:17.255
that happen in the
first few years of life.

00:37:17.255 --> 00:37:20.062
A child can develop a suite of skills

00:37:20.062 --> 00:37:23.058
without needing any kind of formal tuition

00:37:23.058 --> 00:37:26.194
in a way that seems very almost magical.

00:37:26.194 --> 00:37:28.371
It's a complicated set of different things

00:37:28.371 --> 00:37:30.238
that go towards being able to become

00:37:30.238 --> 00:37:33.408
a proficient speech and language user.

00:37:33.408 --> 00:37:35.777
How do we explain this?

00:37:35.777 --> 00:37:36.959
People have speculated

00:37:36.959 --> 00:37:40.622
that there might be something
important in our genes.

00:37:40.622 --> 00:37:44.423
Importantly here, this is
actually a great example,

00:37:44.423 --> 00:37:47.418
a perfect example of interaction

00:37:47.418 --> 00:37:49.918
between genes and environment.

00:37:51.134 --> 00:37:53.165
Obviously as soon as
you think about the fact

00:37:53.165 --> 00:37:57.212
that a child who grows
up in the Netherlands

00:37:57.212 --> 00:37:59.948
surrounded by Dutch speakers
will learn to speak Dutch.

00:37:59.948 --> 00:38:02.074
That same child growing up in Japan

00:38:02.074 --> 00:38:03.624
surrounded by Japanese speakers

00:38:03.624 --> 00:38:05.575
will learn to speak Japanese.

00:38:05.575 --> 00:38:08.344
A child who is not exposed to language

00:38:08.344 --> 00:38:11.177
will never become a language user.

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.649
There's this incredible interaction

00:38:15.649 --> 00:38:18.003
between genetics and environment.

00:38:18.003 --> 00:38:19.857
But there's something in the genes

00:38:19.857 --> 00:38:22.949
that seems to predispose
us to soak up language

00:38:22.949 --> 00:38:27.504
from the environment
around us in early life.

00:38:27.504 --> 00:38:29.998
Not every child, unfortunately,

00:38:29.998 --> 00:38:32.368
when exposed to language
becomes as proficient

00:38:32.368 --> 00:38:35.052
as this young lady here, for example.

00:38:35.052 --> 00:38:37.791
There are some kids who
are exposed to language

00:38:37.791 --> 00:38:39.526
and have language-rich environments,

00:38:39.526 --> 00:38:43.621
but they fail to become
proficient language users.

00:38:43.621 --> 00:38:45.765
In some cases there might
be a reason for this,

00:38:45.765 --> 00:38:48.695
like they have a physical
problem, they're deaf

00:38:48.695 --> 00:38:51.875
or they have some kind of
general cognitive problem,

00:38:51.875 --> 00:38:55.223
but in some cases there are
kids that fail to learn language

00:38:55.223 --> 00:38:58.054
and it's a mystery and we don't know why.

00:38:58.054 --> 00:38:59.916
It was noticed very early on

00:38:59.916 --> 00:39:04.215
when people started studying
these kind of disorders

00:39:04.215 --> 00:39:07.438
that these cases clustered in families.

00:39:07.438 --> 00:39:09.683
If you have a relative with a problem

00:39:09.683 --> 00:39:11.542
with development of speech and language,

00:39:11.542 --> 00:39:14.293
that dramatically increases your risk.

00:39:14.293 --> 00:39:16.609
This kind of familial clustering

00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:19.948
could in fact relate to something
like shared environment,

00:39:19.948 --> 00:39:22.597
for example, in the family.

00:39:22.597 --> 00:39:24.755
We know from studies of twins

00:39:24.755 --> 00:39:27.532
that actually there's a
very, very high heritability

00:39:27.532 --> 00:39:29.530
for these kind of speech
and language disorders,

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.497
unexplained speech and language disorders.

00:39:31.497 --> 00:39:33.855
We know this by looking at the concordance

00:39:33.855 --> 00:39:37.372
and the rates of language
disorders in identical twins

00:39:37.372 --> 00:39:39.493
as compared to non-identical twins.

00:39:39.493 --> 00:39:42.658
There's been many, many studies
that robustly show this.

00:39:42.658 --> 00:39:45.009
What I want to talk to you about

00:39:45.009 --> 00:39:47.594
in the remainder of the talk

00:39:47.594 --> 00:39:50.053
is the idea that we should
be able to go further

00:39:50.053 --> 00:39:53.080
than just saying, "Well,
there's genes involved."

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.262
To actually being able to say,

00:39:54.262 --> 00:39:55.850
"Can we take some people

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:58.005
"who have speech and language problems

00:39:58.005 --> 00:40:01.111
"and figure out what the actual genes are,

00:40:01.111 --> 00:40:03.595
"the particular genes that are important?"

00:40:03.595 --> 00:40:04.523
One of the wonderful things

00:40:04.523 --> 00:40:08.659
about being able to find
the genes that are involved

00:40:08.659 --> 00:40:12.009
is that we can use these
as kind of windows,

00:40:12.009 --> 00:40:15.662
molecular windows, into
the intermediate biology.

00:40:15.662 --> 00:40:17.989
This is my favorite
slide that I always show

00:40:17.989 --> 00:40:19.696
and everybody, I think,
has a version of this slide

00:40:19.696 --> 00:40:21.897
if they work on genes
and brain and behavior.

00:40:21.897 --> 00:40:24.988
There's this huge gap
between DNA and the outputs,

00:40:24.988 --> 00:40:27.410
the behavioral outputs,
that we're interested in.

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:29.809
We're not so naive to ignore that gap,

00:40:29.809 --> 00:40:33.740
but we think that we can use
the knowledge of the genetics

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.711
to actually fill in and
understand each different level

00:40:36.711 --> 00:40:39.984
so we can understand that
many genes that we study

00:40:39.984 --> 00:40:42.850
are important because
they code for proteins

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:45.197
and the proteins kind of all work together

00:40:45.197 --> 00:40:47.432
as molecular and machinery in your cells

00:40:47.432 --> 00:40:50.004
to do all the functions of your cells.

00:40:50.004 --> 00:40:53.001
We know that genes and
proteins are important

00:40:53.001 --> 00:40:57.040
for different properties of
the way that neurons develop.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.730
For example, they might influence

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:02.005
the proliferation of neurons
in early development.

00:41:02.005 --> 00:41:04.786
They might influence how neurons move,

00:41:04.786 --> 00:41:07.943
migrate to the final
positions in the brain,

00:41:07.943 --> 00:41:11.623
how those neurons
differentiate and extend out

00:41:11.623 --> 00:41:14.482
kind of their axons to
connect up and wire up

00:41:14.482 --> 00:41:17.173
with other neurons in the brain.

00:41:17.173 --> 00:41:18.440
Then we might want to understand

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.044
how neuro circuits actually work.

00:41:20.044 --> 00:41:21.412
One of the most fascinating things

00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:24.631
about the interaction between
genes and neuro circuitry

00:41:24.631 --> 00:41:26.875
is that your genes are
important for their functions

00:41:26.875 --> 00:41:29.604
of your neuro circuits
even in your adult brain

00:41:29.604 --> 00:41:31.337
because they help you to learn,

00:41:31.337 --> 00:41:35.504
they help genes actively
working to strengthen and weaken

00:41:36.459 --> 00:41:37.979
the links, the synapses,

00:41:37.979 --> 00:41:41.192
the links between your
different brain cells

00:41:41.192 --> 00:41:42.525
throughout life.

00:41:43.613 --> 00:41:46.010
Of course, we have these
complex assemblages

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.853
of neuro circuits built by combination

00:41:48.853 --> 00:41:52.112
of genes and experience
and it's those in the brain

00:41:52.112 --> 00:41:54.957
that are doing these kind
of complex behaviors.

00:41:54.957 --> 00:41:57.233
The idea here is that
if we can find something

00:41:57.233 --> 00:42:01.679
at this end of the
spectrum, at the DNA level,

00:42:01.679 --> 00:42:04.637
and we know that it's
linked this other end

00:42:04.637 --> 00:42:05.518
to speech and language,

00:42:05.518 --> 00:42:07.084
we can use that as a tool

00:42:07.084 --> 00:42:09.011
for understanding all
these different levels.

00:42:09.011 --> 00:42:12.525
There's interactions and
relationships between the levels.

00:42:12.525 --> 00:42:14.736
This is a gross over simplification,

00:42:14.736 --> 00:42:17.310
but it's a starting
point for thinking about

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:19.474
what I'm gonna talk about.

00:42:19.474 --> 00:42:20.949
I'm gonna give you an example

00:42:20.949 --> 00:42:24.392
where we've been able to identify a gene

00:42:24.392 --> 00:42:27.470
that's important in speech
and language development.

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:30.253
The starting point for this study

00:42:30.253 --> 00:42:32.949
was this family here, the KE family.

00:42:32.949 --> 00:42:34.361
It's a three generation family,

00:42:34.361 --> 00:42:36.389
now a four generation family.

00:42:36.389 --> 00:42:37.459
In each of these generations

00:42:37.459 --> 00:42:39.504
you can see these shaded individuals

00:42:39.504 --> 00:42:42.182
are affected with a severe
speech and language disorder.

00:42:42.182 --> 00:42:43.209
They're growing up together

00:42:43.209 --> 00:42:46.203
with these unaffected
individuals who are non-shaded,

00:42:46.203 --> 00:42:47.311
who are growing up together

00:42:47.311 --> 00:42:49.763
with the kids who
develop a severe problem.

00:42:49.763 --> 00:42:52.478
The severe problem is that
they have difficulties

00:42:52.478 --> 00:42:56.645
learning to make those
coordinated sequences of speech.

00:42:57.728 --> 00:43:00.811
They do actually become speech users,

00:43:01.908 --> 00:43:03.068
but there's always a problem

00:43:03.068 --> 00:43:05.031
and I'm gonna now play you an example,

00:43:05.031 --> 00:43:06.328
hopefully, if this works,

00:43:06.328 --> 00:43:08.980
from one of the adult
members of the KE family

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:10.721
from the second generation.

00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:13.554
She's being asked by Kate Watkins,

00:43:15.495 --> 00:43:17.510
a PhD student at the time,

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:19.647
she now leads a group in Oxford,

00:43:19.647 --> 00:43:23.217
but at the time she was
a PhD student in London

00:43:23.217 --> 00:43:25.673
with Faraneh Vargha-Khadem
studying this family,

00:43:25.673 --> 00:43:29.280
and she asks the lady to repeat
different words five times.

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:33.589
She's going to ask them to
repeat the word catastrophe.

00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:35.577
So listen to this.

00:43:35.577 --> 00:43:37.306
- [Kate] Catastrophe.

00:43:37.306 --> 00:43:40.900
- [Woman] Castas, cat-as-ophe, catas.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.450
(grumbling)

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:44.080
- [Kate] Catastrophe.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.830
(faint speaking)

00:43:48.896 --> 00:43:49.762
(whimpering)

00:43:49.762 --> 00:43:50.595
It's hard, isn't it?

00:43:50.595 --> 00:43:54.319
- [Woman] It's a real tongue twister.

00:43:54.319 --> 00:43:56.255
- She's having a great trouble

00:43:56.255 --> 00:43:59.052
repeating the word catastrophe.

00:43:59.052 --> 00:43:59.885
That's not a comment

00:43:59.885 --> 00:44:02.150
on the political situation at the moment.

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:04.082
(audience laughing)

00:44:04.082 --> 00:44:05.968
I promised I wouldn't be political.

00:44:05.968 --> 00:44:07.445
Anyway.

00:44:07.445 --> 00:44:09.445
This trait that she has,

00:44:09.445 --> 00:44:11.984
it's called childhood apraxia of speech.

00:44:11.984 --> 00:44:14.696
But actually, as you can hear,
it persists into adulthood.

00:44:14.696 --> 00:44:17.844
And even despite some
intensive speech therapy,

00:44:17.844 --> 00:44:21.090
people still suffer from these problems.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:23.691
The problem is that they have problems

00:44:23.691 --> 00:44:27.524
stringing together certain
sequences of sound.

00:44:28.559 --> 00:44:32.807
The problems gets worse as
the utterances get longer

00:44:32.807 --> 00:44:34.786
and as they become more complex.

00:44:34.786 --> 00:44:38.830
This is shown, this is a study
that Kate Watkins carried out

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:42.698
on the KE family where
they're being asked to repeat

00:44:42.698 --> 00:44:46.667
either simple or complex nonsense words.

00:44:46.667 --> 00:44:50.756
These are nonsense words like
contrapanist and puplisterog,

00:44:50.756 --> 00:44:53.395
words that now I practice every
day in front of the mirror

00:44:53.395 --> 00:44:54.684
so I'm very good at them.

00:44:54.684 --> 00:44:56.299
These people have never
encountered the words

00:44:56.299 --> 00:44:57.838
and they try to repeat them back

00:44:57.838 --> 00:44:59.721
and they have difficulty doing so.

00:44:59.721 --> 00:45:01.522
What you can see on these graphs

00:45:01.522 --> 00:45:04.704
is these are unaffected
members of the KE family,

00:45:04.704 --> 00:45:06.877
these are affected
members of the KE family,

00:45:06.877 --> 00:45:09.873
and this third line is
actually adults with brokers

00:45:09.873 --> 00:45:12.017
and other kinds of aphasias,

00:45:12.017 --> 00:45:16.184
brain damage that yields
problems with speech access.

00:45:18.401 --> 00:45:19.823
Here, as you can see,

00:45:19.823 --> 00:45:22.967
the material that gives
them the most difficulty

00:45:22.967 --> 00:45:25.049
is when they have to
repeat these nonsense words

00:45:25.049 --> 00:45:27.783
that are really long and complex.

00:45:27.783 --> 00:45:30.038
It's not that they can't
say certain sounds,

00:45:30.038 --> 00:45:31.962
it's that they have particular problems

00:45:31.962 --> 00:45:35.456
with stringing them
together in the right way.

00:45:35.456 --> 00:45:36.600
Something to do with the way

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.871
that the brain is programming sequences

00:45:39.871 --> 00:45:43.130
of mouth and face movements during speech.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:44.918
They also have lots of other problems

00:45:44.918 --> 00:45:47.103
with all sorts of aspects of language.

00:45:47.103 --> 00:45:49.841
They have deficits not
just in spoken language,

00:45:49.841 --> 00:45:54.066
but also if you ask them to
write linguistic items, as well.

00:45:54.066 --> 00:45:56.408
Their impairment's not just in expression,

00:45:56.408 --> 00:45:58.605
but also in reception of language.

00:45:58.605 --> 00:46:02.131
There are tests of grammar
comprehension and production

00:46:02.131 --> 00:46:06.585
that they do worse on than
unaffected individuals.

00:46:06.585 --> 00:46:08.905
This is not a kind of general
intellectual disability.

00:46:08.905 --> 00:46:12.117
They don't all have a kind of IQ

00:46:12.117 --> 00:46:15.552
that's in the intellectual
disability range.

00:46:15.552 --> 00:46:18.215
But this family is not the
brightest family in the world.

00:46:18.215 --> 00:46:20.277
There are some unaffected
individuals in the family

00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:22.555
who have low non-verbal IQ,

00:46:22.555 --> 00:46:25.058
and there are affected individuals

00:46:25.058 --> 00:46:27.110
who have normal non-verbal IQ

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:29.326
and severe speech and language problems.

00:46:29.326 --> 00:46:33.465
It doesn't seem like that
the non-verbal problems

00:46:33.465 --> 00:46:36.048
that some of the family
members suffer from,

00:46:36.048 --> 00:46:40.089
it doesn't seem like they're a
core feature of the disorder.

00:46:40.089 --> 00:46:43.769
If you look at patterns of
non-verbal and verbal cognition,

00:46:43.769 --> 00:46:45.405
different kinds of subtests,

00:46:45.405 --> 00:46:47.027
you find that they have deficits

00:46:47.027 --> 00:46:49.308
that are much more severe
in the verbal range,

00:46:49.308 --> 00:46:50.523
which is what you would expect

00:46:50.523 --> 00:46:53.228
for a speech and language disorder.

00:46:53.228 --> 00:46:57.259
Working in the lab with Tony
Monaco in the late 1990s,

00:46:57.259 --> 00:47:01.632
we started screening
the DNA from this family

00:47:01.632 --> 00:47:05.799
and we pinpointed a linked
region on chromosome seven.

00:47:06.801 --> 00:47:09.648
This was actually a different region

00:47:09.648 --> 00:47:11.136
from the region that
you've just heard about

00:47:11.136 --> 00:47:13.636
in the Williams syndrome talk.

00:47:14.478 --> 00:47:18.645
Eventually we zoomed in and
spotted a single tiny change,

00:47:20.892 --> 00:47:23.809
one letter of DNA, one base of DNA,

00:47:24.963 --> 00:47:28.284
which normally in every
unaffected person in this family

00:47:28.284 --> 00:47:32.367
and in every one of you
I can guarantee, was a g.

00:47:33.335 --> 00:47:35.519
In the affected members of the family,

00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:37.141
they have two copies of every gene.

00:47:37.141 --> 00:47:39.476
Once copy had the g, one copy was normal,

00:47:39.476 --> 00:47:42.755
but one copy has an a instead of a g.

00:47:42.755 --> 00:47:45.221
This was private mutation
that had occurred

00:47:45.221 --> 00:47:46.750
in the grandma of that family

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:49.983
and then been passed on to
half of the affected members

00:47:49.983 --> 00:47:54.150
and the unaffected members
did not receive this variant.

00:47:55.628 --> 00:47:57.832
This was in a gene called FOXP2.

00:47:57.832 --> 00:48:00.594
We could already say something
about what the gene was.

00:48:00.594 --> 00:48:03.368
It's a gene that regulates other genes,

00:48:03.368 --> 00:48:06.087
I'll tell you about that in a minute.

00:48:06.087 --> 00:48:07.420
All these genes,

00:48:10.044 --> 00:48:11.062
genes like FOXP2,

00:48:11.062 --> 00:48:12.828
they have something called
a forkhead box domain.

00:48:12.828 --> 00:48:16.785
They make a protein that
has this special domain here

00:48:16.785 --> 00:48:18.143
that I'm showing you

00:48:18.143 --> 00:48:21.026
and it consists of these
three helices here,

00:48:21.026 --> 00:48:24.520
one, two, and three, and
these big loops here.

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.945
The KE family have this mutation

00:48:26.945 --> 00:48:29.190
that changes one of the amino acids

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:31.409
in the protein that they built for FOXP2

00:48:31.409 --> 00:48:33.383
and it's this amino acid here.

00:48:33.383 --> 00:48:36.447
It stops the protein from
doing its job properly.

00:48:36.447 --> 00:48:39.537
It stops the protein from binding to DNA.

00:48:39.537 --> 00:48:43.354
Since finding this
mutation in the KE family,

00:48:43.354 --> 00:48:45.402
we and others have found

00:48:45.402 --> 00:48:49.158
a bunch of other different
mutations in FOXP2

00:48:49.158 --> 00:48:50.787
in different cases around the world.

00:48:50.787 --> 00:48:53.271
This just shows you a
picture from a later study

00:48:53.271 --> 00:48:55.748
showing about eight or
nine different mutations

00:48:55.748 --> 00:48:57.031
that are being found,

00:48:57.031 --> 00:49:00.948
disturbing different
letters of the FOXP2 gene.

00:49:02.145 --> 00:49:05.564
In each case, they damage
one copy of the FOXP2 gene,

00:49:05.564 --> 00:49:09.159
but leave another copy of
the FOXP2 gene in tact.

00:49:09.159 --> 00:49:12.702
These people have kind
of a insufficient amount

00:49:12.702 --> 00:49:14.846
of FOXP2 protein that they're making

00:49:14.846 --> 00:49:18.678
and they have speech and
language problems sometimes,

00:49:18.678 --> 00:49:19.997
other problems in addition,

00:49:19.997 --> 00:49:21.704
but the kind of most common feature

00:49:21.704 --> 00:49:25.448
across all these patients is
speech and language disorder.

00:49:25.448 --> 00:49:27.563
We've been able to take
the different mutations

00:49:27.563 --> 00:49:31.362
that disrupt FOXP2 and
look at them in the lab.

00:49:31.362 --> 00:49:33.695
We can grow cells in the lab

00:49:35.242 --> 00:49:37.325
and label FOXP2 in green.

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.614
Here is the nucleus of cells.

00:49:40.614 --> 00:49:42.676
Here is normal FOXP2 being expressed

00:49:42.676 --> 00:49:43.713
in the nucleus of these cells,

00:49:43.713 --> 00:49:45.554
which is where it likes to be.

00:49:45.554 --> 00:49:47.253
Here are some examples of mutations

00:49:47.253 --> 00:49:50.123
where the protein can no
longer get into the nucleus.

00:49:50.123 --> 00:49:52.410
And we do other isos that show

00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:55.757
that FOXP2 is not working
properly in these cells.

00:49:55.757 --> 00:49:57.806
The idea then is that you can use FOXP2

00:49:57.806 --> 00:50:01.513
to study all these intermediate levels

00:50:01.513 --> 00:50:04.180
from DNA to speech and language.

00:50:05.501 --> 00:50:09.639
I refer you to these papers
to find out more about it.

00:50:09.639 --> 00:50:11.295
I'm just gonna give you
a couple of examples

00:50:11.295 --> 00:50:13.554
because I'm running out of time

00:50:13.554 --> 00:50:16.876
of the kinds of things that
we've been studying with FOXP2.

00:50:16.876 --> 00:50:18.982
FOXP2 is a regulatory gene

00:50:18.982 --> 00:50:20.664
that switches on and off other genes

00:50:20.664 --> 00:50:22.547
and this is how it works.

00:50:22.547 --> 00:50:26.314
It gets transcribed into messenger RNA.

00:50:26.314 --> 00:50:28.508
This messenger RNA is used as a template

00:50:28.508 --> 00:50:31.890
to build a protein also called FOXP2.

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:35.684
This FOXP2 protein finds target genes

00:50:35.684 --> 00:50:37.255
and it binds to the promoters,

00:50:37.255 --> 00:50:39.646
the regulatory regions of
the front of each gene,

00:50:39.646 --> 00:50:42.245
and it could either activate them

00:50:42.245 --> 00:50:44.915
or it could repress them,
it could silence them.

00:50:44.915 --> 00:50:46.300
We think that a lot of the time

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:49.984
what FOXP2 is doing is
to silence these genes.

00:50:49.984 --> 00:50:52.534
But it can also act as an activator.

00:50:52.534 --> 00:50:53.367
It seems to do this

00:50:53.367 --> 00:50:55.583
like a kind of genetic
demonstrate if you like.

00:50:55.583 --> 00:50:57.105
It's not all or nothing.

00:50:57.105 --> 00:50:59.924
We can then have a look,

00:50:59.924 --> 00:51:01.798
we know that we have this gene,

00:51:01.798 --> 00:51:06.791
can we ask what are the other
elements of this FOXP2 network

00:51:06.791 --> 00:51:07.896
that it belongs to.

00:51:07.896 --> 00:51:12.553
We might ask what are the things
that bind to the FOXP2 gene

00:51:12.553 --> 00:51:13.651
to switch it on.

00:51:13.651 --> 00:51:15.733
What are the things signaling processes

00:51:15.733 --> 00:51:18.410
that interact with FOXP2
to modulate its function?

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:21.361
What are the other
factors that bind FOXP2?

00:51:21.361 --> 00:51:22.828
What are the downstream targets

00:51:22.828 --> 00:51:25.093
that it's switching on and off?

00:51:25.093 --> 00:51:28.218
We've identified quite
a few downstream targets

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:30.586
and many people have been
working on this over the years.

00:51:30.586 --> 00:51:32.478
What's interesting is that many of targets

00:51:32.478 --> 00:51:35.470
that FOXP2 regulates are
known to be important

00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:37.376
for neuro development
because when they go wrong,

00:51:37.376 --> 00:51:39.312
they cause neuro developmental disorders

00:51:39.312 --> 00:51:43.312
like autism, schizophrenia,
epilepsy, and so on.

00:51:45.341 --> 00:51:47.360
We've identified pathways like SUMOylation

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.967
that modulate the way that
FOXP2 works in the cell.

00:51:50.967 --> 00:51:55.211
And also other proteins like
TBR1 that interact with FOXP2

00:51:55.211 --> 00:52:00.169
and are also implicated in
neuro developmental syndromes.

00:52:00.169 --> 00:52:05.084
We can go further to ask what
is the influence to FOXP2

00:52:05.084 --> 00:52:06.721
on the neuronal properties.

00:52:06.721 --> 00:52:09.759
One of the neuronal properties
that FOXP2 pairs to influence

00:52:09.759 --> 00:52:13.229
is the outgrowth of neurites from cells.

00:52:13.229 --> 00:52:15.429
These are the things from neurons.

00:52:15.429 --> 00:52:17.895
These are the things that
will eventually connect

00:52:17.895 --> 00:52:20.346
and become axons and dendrites

00:52:20.346 --> 00:52:22.700
and connect up with other neurons.

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:26.266
When FOXP2 is lost, it can
lead to shorter neurites

00:52:26.266 --> 00:52:28.839
with reduced branching.

00:52:28.839 --> 00:52:31.018
You might ask then, if
FOXP2's so important

00:52:31.018 --> 00:52:34.518
for things like the outgrowth of neurites,

00:52:35.459 --> 00:52:37.060
when we have a loss of FOXP2,

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:38.656
why don't we have a global problem

00:52:38.656 --> 00:52:40.384
with the whole of our brains?

00:52:40.384 --> 00:52:41.775
The reason for this is that FOXP2

00:52:41.775 --> 00:52:45.415
is not actually switched on
itself all over the brain.

00:52:45.415 --> 00:52:49.165
It's switched on in
certain subsets of cells.

00:52:50.491 --> 00:52:51.600
This is if I took your brain,

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:55.469
which I promise I won't
do, and I slice it in half,

00:52:55.469 --> 00:52:57.691
you can see this is a
kind of cross section.

00:52:57.691 --> 00:53:01.554
FOXP2 is expressed in the
deepest layers of the cortex,

00:53:01.554 --> 00:53:03.021
especially in motor regions,

00:53:03.021 --> 00:53:06.003
it's expressed in layer
six and layer five.

00:53:06.003 --> 00:53:09.259
It's also expressed in the basal ganglia

00:53:09.259 --> 00:53:11.809
in the striatum and the caudate, putamen,

00:53:11.809 --> 00:53:13.610
the thalamus, and in the cerebellum

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:15.709
it's expressed in a
very specific cell type

00:53:15.709 --> 00:53:17.622
called the Purkinje cells.

00:53:17.622 --> 00:53:19.533
What a lot of these circuits do,

00:53:19.533 --> 00:53:23.061
the cortico, basal ganglia,
and cortico cerebellar circuits

00:53:23.061 --> 00:53:25.879
is they're important for you
to do motor skill learning,

00:53:25.879 --> 00:53:28.629
to learn to make motor sequences.

00:53:29.832 --> 00:53:33.533
Since FOXP2 is not a new human gene,

00:53:33.533 --> 00:53:37.154
it's actually present in
all sorts of other organisms

00:53:37.154 --> 00:53:39.061
in evolutionary history,

00:53:39.061 --> 00:53:41.956
we can study what FOXP2 does

00:53:41.956 --> 00:53:44.432
say by looking at it in a mouse.

00:53:44.432 --> 00:53:48.186
When we take a mouse, we can
study the way that neurons,

00:53:48.186 --> 00:53:50.062
these neurons that express FOXP2,

00:53:50.062 --> 00:53:53.895
the way they fire during
motor skill learning.

00:53:54.731 --> 00:53:58.565
We can thus kind of get
insights into what's happening.

00:53:58.565 --> 00:54:02.006
We found that in these different
places in the striatum,

00:54:02.006 --> 00:54:04.670
also in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum,

00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:08.607
that the firing of the neurons
during motor skill learning

00:54:08.607 --> 00:54:11.023
and motor skill tasks is different

00:54:11.023 --> 00:54:15.190
from when FOXP2 is mutated
from unaffected animals.

00:54:18.793 --> 00:54:21.026
I'm gonna finish there by just summing up.

00:54:21.026 --> 00:54:21.908
FOXP2 at the extremes.

00:54:21.908 --> 00:54:22.984
What does this tell us

00:54:22.984 --> 00:54:25.721
about speech and language development?

00:54:25.721 --> 00:54:27.420
Heterozygous mutations in FOXP2

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:31.101
cause a rare severe speech and
language disorder in humans.

00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:34.282
It's a regulatory gene, so its
targets and its interactors

00:54:34.282 --> 00:54:37.800
give us entry points into neural pathways.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:38.993
It's not a gene for speech,

00:54:38.993 --> 00:54:40.251
because as I've told you

00:54:40.251 --> 00:54:42.145
versions of FOXP2 are active in the brains

00:54:42.145 --> 00:54:44.248
of many different vertebrate species.

00:54:44.248 --> 00:54:45.226
The nice thing there

00:54:45.226 --> 00:54:47.303
is that we can actually
study what FOXP2 does

00:54:47.303 --> 00:54:51.136
in these other places,
in these other species.

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:54.883
By studying humans, mice,
and even song birds,

00:54:54.883 --> 00:54:56.962
which I didn't have time to talk about,

00:54:56.962 --> 00:54:58.967
we can uncover the roles of the gene

00:54:58.967 --> 00:55:01.609
in these kind of circuits
like cortico-basal ganglia

00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:04.450
and cerebellar circuitry that
are known to be important

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:06.416
for complex motor functions.

00:55:06.416 --> 00:55:07.564
The curious question would be

00:55:07.564 --> 00:55:09.446
we know that when FOXP2's damaged

00:55:09.446 --> 00:55:11.658
it impairs your speech motor skills.

00:55:11.658 --> 00:55:13.005
It'd be interesting to see

00:55:13.005 --> 00:55:14.646
whether at the other end of the spectrum,

00:55:14.646 --> 00:55:19.292
for example in people who are
really good at beat boxing,

00:55:19.292 --> 00:55:21.587
or rapping, maybe they have

00:55:21.587 --> 00:55:24.323
an interesting variance of FOXP2.

00:55:24.323 --> 00:55:25.274
The last thing I'd like to say

00:55:25.274 --> 00:55:28.846
is that the fact that FOXP2's
been around for a long time

00:55:28.846 --> 00:55:30.320
in evolutionary history

00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:33.328
and has been doing important
things in the brain

00:55:33.328 --> 00:55:34.504
means that whatever it's doing

00:55:34.504 --> 00:55:36.259
in speech and language in humans

00:55:36.259 --> 00:55:37.713
is not novel and de novo,

00:55:37.713 --> 00:55:40.116
but it's built on ancient stuff.

00:55:40.116 --> 00:55:41.718
I think this suggests to us

00:55:41.718 --> 00:55:44.131
that our unique capacity for
acquiring spoken language

00:55:44.131 --> 00:55:48.229
is built on systems that
are evolutionarily ancient.

00:55:48.229 --> 00:55:49.229
There I will stop.

00:55:49.229 --> 00:55:50.513
Thank you very much.

00:55:50.513 --> 00:55:53.826
(audience applauding)

00:55:53.826 --> 00:55:56.409
(bright music)
