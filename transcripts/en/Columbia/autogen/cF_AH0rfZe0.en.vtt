Quixote values really don't align with

01:05:43.079 --> 01:05:43.089
Quixote values really don't align with
 

01:05:43.089 --> 01:05:45.390

his society but I think we kind of see

01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:45.400
his society but I think we kind of see
 

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.370
his society but I think we kind of see
um especially in the priest in the

01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:47.380

particular but rather someone who

01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:27.660
particular but rather someone who
 

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:31.440
particular but rather someone who
pursues this ideal Singh

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:31.450
pursues this ideal Singh
 

01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:35.960
pursues this ideal Singh
mindedly so it's the single-mindedness

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:35.970
mindedly so it's the single-mindedness
 

01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:40.980

that were meant to look at and it's in
looking at the single-mindedness that we

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:44.110
looking at the single-mindedness that we
 

01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:48.900
looking at the single-mindedness that we
see the gap and the gap is there a

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:48.910
see the gap and the gap is there a
 

01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:53.040
see the gap and the gap is there a
couple gaps I think one is that one of

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:53.050
couple gaps I think one is that one of
 

01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:54.630
couple gaps I think one is that one of
the problems with chivalry is that it's

01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640
the problems with chivalry is that it's
 

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:58.650

01:07:58.650 --> 01:07:58.660
not real honor chivalry is a kind of bad
 

01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:02.480
not real honor chivalry is a kind of bad
mix of Greek military virtue and

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:02.490
mix of Greek military virtue and
 

01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:06.110
mix of Greek military virtue and
Christian charity and Christian love

01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:06.120
Christian charity and Christian love
 

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.350
Christian charity and Christian love
yeah

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:07.360
yeah
 

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.310
yeah
so it's an incoherent ideal that Quixote

01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:11.320
so it's an incoherent ideal that Quixote
 

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:15.380
so it's an incoherent ideal that Quixote
can attain but that shows up in his

01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:15.390
can attain but that shows up in his
 

01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:20.310
can attain but that shows up in his
behavior but the ideal he still he

01:08:20.310 --> 01:08:20.320
behavior but the ideal he still he
 

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:23.970
behavior but the ideal he still he
understands he he embodies another ideal

01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:23.980
understands he he embodies another ideal
 

01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:26.880
understands he he embodies another ideal
actually which is that he's generally on

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:26.890
actually which is that he's generally on
 

01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:29.790
actually which is that he's generally on
a genuinely honorable courageous and

01:08:29.790 --> 01:08:29.800
a genuinely honorable courageous and
 

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:33.570
a genuinely honorable courageous and
dutiful so we get a critique of a bad

01:08:33.570 --> 01:08:33.580
dutiful so we get a critique of a bad
 

01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:37.860
dutiful so we get a critique of a bad
idea and get an example of what a real

01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:37.870
idea and get an example of what a real
 

01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:42.060
idea and get an example of what a real
ideal might be by the way he is but he's

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:42.070
ideal might be by the way he is but he's
 

01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:45.480
ideal might be by the way he is but he's
unable to do that because he's been

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:45.490
unable to do that because he's been
 

01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:48.110
unable to do that because he's been
struck by this bacillus of chivalry

01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120
struck by this bacillus of chivalry
 

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:51.780
struck by this bacillus of chivalry
which is a bad one and so it makes a

01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:51.790
which is a bad one and so it makes a
 

01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:55.890
which is a bad one and so it makes a
fool of himself but in the end I think

01:08:55.890 --> 01:08:55.900
fool of himself but in the end I think
 

01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:59.460
fool of himself but in the end I think
the gap is shown in Cervantes but I

01:08:59.460 --> 01:08:59.470

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.530
don't think that the lesson and I hope I
didn't give that impression is give it

01:09:04.530 --> 01:09:04.540
didn't give that impression is give it
 

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:09.080
didn't give that impression is give it

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.280
guess I mean with the first three types
well with all four types there's a

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:43.290
well with all four types there's a
 

01:19:43.290 --> 01:19:46.670
well with all four types there's a
problem of perception and that's how I

01:19:46.670 --> 01:19:46.680
problem of perception and that's how I
 

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.830
problem of perception and that's how I

in that with the first three types it

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:51.690
in that with the first three types it
 

01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:53.540
in that with the first three types it

and with the reaction of the citizen

01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280
and with the reaction of the citizen
 

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:59.140
and with the reaction of the citizen
their aspirations are too small that

01:19:59.140 --> 01:19:59.150
their aspirations are too small that
 

01:19:59.150 --> 01:20:02.800
their aspirations are too small that
they can't think beyond the present and

ignorance right and I guess well the

01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:15.300
ignorance right and I guess well the
 

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:16.460
ignorance right and I guess well the
first thing is is that there must be

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:16.470
first thing is is that there must be
 

01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:21.140
first thing is is that there must be
some kind of dynamism to this patent the

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:21.150
some kind of dynamism to this patent the
 

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:23.750
some kind of dynamism to this patent the

came later so how do we interact with
that ignorance when we become acutely

01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:36.750
that ignorance when we become acutely
 

01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:39.410
