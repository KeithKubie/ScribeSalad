00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.690
In the last video we talked
about ionization energy, or

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.925
the energy required to
remove an electron.

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:10.190
And we saw the general trend
in the periodic table, that

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.310
when you're in the bottom
left-hand side close to

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.590
cesium, cesium really wants
to give up electrons.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.820
It's a big atom.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.360
It only has one extra electron
in its sixth shell.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.870
It can just give it up,
and then it'll have

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.190
five complete shells.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.250
So it really wants to give it
away, so it requires very

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.040
little energy to ionize.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.840
On the complete other side of
the spectrum, helium requires

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.220
a lot of energy to ionize.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.170
It's very happy.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.850
I has a full shell at
the first shell.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.990
It's a very small atom.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.860
The electrons are very
close to the protons.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.920
So the coulomb force is
super-duper-duper strong.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.260
So it takes a lot of energy
to remove that incremental

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.270
electron, and we learned that.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.240
And the one thing I want to
cover before moving on to

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.260
other types of trends or
properties amongst the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.395
different atoms is the idea of
a second ionization energy.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.080
And I want to do this because
sometimes it's covered on some

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.280
chemistry exams or some
chemistry standardized tests.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.810
And it's just the idea that
ionization energy is the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.700
energy required to remove the
first electron, to go from a

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.450
neutral state to popping
one electron off of it.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.350
The second ionization energy is,
then, the energy required

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.720
to remove the very
next electron.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.010
And the reason why this is
interesting, is sometimes

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.510
they'll say, OK, what elements
have a very high second

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.100
ionization energy?

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.930
And your temptation would be,
OK, high ionization energy,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.740
that also probably means high
second ionization energy.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.860
And that might be true.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.520
For example, neon has a very
high ionization energy, It

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.310
really wants to keep that 10th
electron, because it fills out

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.090
the second shell.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.900
And then, of course, even if you
were able to remove that

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.300
electron, to remove the ninth
electron, when now its

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.950
configuration looks a
lot like fluorine,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.950
that's still very difficult.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.620
So you'd say its second
ionization energy

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.370
is still very high.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.419
But if you think about it, the
elements with the highest

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.710
second ionization energies are
going to be some of the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.340
elements with the lowest
ionization energy.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.630
So, think about it.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.880
And that might be kind
of confusing.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.820
Lithium, for example.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.380
Very low ionization energy.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.150
It's got that extra electron.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.660
It just wants to give it away.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.080
But once it gives it away,
it's in a very stable

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.490
situation, Then its electron

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.580
configuration looks like helium.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.730
So to remove that second
electron is

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.760
super-duper-duper difficult.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.950
So lithium has a very high
second ionization energy.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.660
And so you might run into a
question where they're like,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.240
which of these elements has the
biggest difference between

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.610
their ionization energy and
their second ionization

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.940
energy, where their second
ionization energy is higher

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.490
than their ionization energy.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.840
And lithium, or anything in
group one, that would be true,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.040
because as soon as you remove
one electron, its electron

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.540
configuration becomes super
stable, so removing that

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.320
second one is super-duper
difficult.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.120
And you also see this
in this chart.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.820
This is, of course, the first
ionization energies.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.050
But let's say, the case
with lithium, you

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.020
removed that electron.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.790
It was very easy.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.640
You only needed five electron
volts to do it.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.170
But then your configuration
looks a lot like helium.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.210
So that second ionization energy
is going to look a lot

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.330
like helium's first
ionization energy.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.860
Anyway, I don't want to
confuse you too much.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.960
But that's an interesting point
that might pop up every

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.050
now and then.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.510
Now another property, which is
in a lot of ways, in my mind,

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.570
related is the idea of
electronegativity.

00:03:41.745 --> 00:03:44.000
The concept came up
by Linus Pauling.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.710
I always remember him.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.970
He was a famous chemist. What
I always remember is that he

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.180
was famous for being convinced
that Vitamin C was kind of the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.540
key to living forever.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.780
And he would take huge
doses of Vitamin C.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.630
I should probably read
up on that again.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.310
I don't want to spread lies
about Linus Pauling.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.920
But I remember reading that
when I was in high school.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.620
But anyway, he came up with the
idea of electronegativity.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.360
And the idea is that when two
atoms form covalent bonds--

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.860
and I haven't taught you what a
covalent bond is, and I was

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.769
planning on doing that in a
couple of videos from now--

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.910
but the idea of a covalent
bond is really just atoms

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:21.790
sharing electrons.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:22.780
Let me draw that out.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.000
So if I have oxygen, oxygen
looks something like this.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.010
I could draw it like that.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.310
I could also draw oxygen like
this, just because I'm going

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.350
to use these extra electrons
to bond.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.540
And if you take oxygen like
that and you add it to two

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.300
hydrogens-- hydrogen
has one electron--

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.560
what's going to happen?

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.440
You might not know yet, if you
haven't seen a covalent bond.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.040
But the atoms will actually
share electrons.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.960
So this oxygen, you put
it in the center.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.706
You have these, over here.

00:04:54.706 --> 00:04:58.180
Let me draw it like that.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.660
The electrons from oxygen
I'll do in green.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.740
And then hydrogen, I'll just
do it in this orange color.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.640
So we have two of
these hydrogens.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.940
So one hydrogen will be there.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.180
And then the other hydrogen
will be there.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.620
Now what just happened?

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.310
Well if this hydrogen can
pretend that both of these

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.290
electrons, it has to kind
of share this green

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.310
one with the oxygen.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.850
And the deal is, hey, I share
the green one and you let me

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.710
borrow the green one, and I'll
let you borrow the orange one,

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.410
we both can kind of feel like
we have a stable electron

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.420
configuration.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.460
Hydrogen feels good because
the one s-shell

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.790
is completely filled.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.420
Oxygen fills great because
it's valence shell is

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.840
completely filled with
eight electrons, two

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.570
of which are borrowed.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.340
So it feels great.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.200
This is a covalent
bond, where the

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.580
atoms are sharing electrons.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.910
And so this sometimes will
be drawn like this.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.320
Oxygen.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.415
Those are the extra electron
pairs of oxygen.

00:05:55.415 --> 00:05:57.220
And they'll just draw
a line like that.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.650
And that line implicitly is
saying, look, there's two

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.310
atoms on either end.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.240
There's the oxygen
electron there.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.660
And then you have the hydrogen
electron there.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.790
And they're kind of shared.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.320
These two things mean
the same thing.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.100
But that line just means
a covalent bond.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.700
Now my whole point behind
talking about covalent bonds a

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.890
little prematurely is so
that I can touch on

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.140
electronegativity.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.230
And the idea that Linus Pauling
came up with is that

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.160
in these covalent bonds, the
sharing is not equal.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.400
That some of the atoms
will hog the

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.970
electrons a little more.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.330
So in this case, oxygen.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.720
We learned about oxygen.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.470
Oxygen is way over here.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.080
It loves to grab electrons.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.840
It has a very high ionization
energy.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.780
It's only two away from having
an electron configuration

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.560
similar to neon and being
super-duper happy.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.420
So oxygen loves electrons.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.350
Hydrogen is a little
bit here or there.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.420
It could gain an electron
and then it'll

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.320
have a stable 1s orbital.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.470
Or it could lose an electron and
it will essentially just

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.780
turn into a positive ion.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:08.700
It can go either way.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.810
So it's a little bit more
ambivalent about what happens

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.760
relative to the electrons.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.030
But oxygen really wants
the electrons so

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.300
that it can get completed.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.880
So in this relationship between
oxygen and hydrogen,

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.950
oxygen is more electronegative.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.090
It's more electronegative, which
means it kind of hogs

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:29.700
the electrons a little
bit more.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.740
So if you were to draw this
relationship here, it might

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.660
look something-- If you were
to draw this bond.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.480
This is all abstract.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.590
Maybe you would draw
it a little bit

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:42.770
heavier on that side.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.380
And this is not really at
all a convention, but I

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.250
just made that up.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.630
Or if you just drew the hydrogen
and the oxygen part

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.680
of it, maybe the electrons
spend most of their time

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.120
around-- this is a probability
distribution-- and less of

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.790
their time around hydrogen.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.720
And that would be true for
the other hydrogen.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.600
They spend less of their time
around the hydrogen and a lot

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.570
more of their time around
the oxygen.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.590
The idea of electronegativity is
just that one atom is going

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:12.670
to hog the electrons more when
you form a covalent bond.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.740
Now if we wanted to figure out
the trend of electronegativity

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.870
on the periodic table, what do
you think's going to happen?

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.390
Which elements are likely
to hog electrons?

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.050
Well, the ones that
love electrons.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.330
The ones that it's
very hard to take

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.450
electrons away from them.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:35.039
The ones that are super-close
to completing a full eight

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.480
valence electrons in their
outermost shell.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.280
So the most electronegative
atoms are

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.760
going to be right here.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.549
They're going to be the
halogens, especially the

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:47.240
fluorine, because the small ones
want the electrons even

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.400
more because they're
a small atom.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.670
The electrons are going to get
closer to the nucleus.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.320
And the reason why I'm not
talking about the noble gases

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.300
here is because these don't
form covalent bonds.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.150
They're always happy.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.850
They're all these inert gases.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.995
Inert just means that they
don't do anything.

00:09:02.995 --> 00:09:04.920
A similar word is inertia.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.570
Inertia means the tendency to
want to stay at rest, not do

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.600
anything, or stay in motion,
but I won't go

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.450
into that too much.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.240
But these are inert.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.020
They don't do anything.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.510
So these guys react.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.180
They form covalent
bonds up here.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:21.170
And when they form covalent
bonds, they hog the atoms.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.240
Likewise, when these guys down
here form covalent bonds,

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.000
they're like, you know what,
you can have the atoms. I

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.640
don't need them.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.500
I'm actually happier without
them altogether.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.330
In fact, sometimes these
guys actually just

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.620
give away the atom.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.340
They don't even form
a covalent bond.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.490
It's called an ionic bond.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.320
We'll talk about that
in the next video.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.620
But as you can see, the trend
is the same as it is for

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.180
ionization energy.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.010
These guys, a lot of
energy required

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:48.970
to remove an electron.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.730
That's because they
love electrons.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.890
So these guys are also
very electronegative.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.930
They're going to hog the
electrons in a covalent bond.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.620
These guys, very low
ionization energy.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.060
Very easy to take an electron
away from them.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.650
And that's why they have very
low electronegativity.

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:09.480
They're very unlikely to hog
an electron in a bond.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.050
Now the other trend that some
people sometimes talk about is

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.095
the metallic nature
of an element.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:26.680
And so, there's a lot of things
that, in my mind, I

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.700
imagine when someone talks
about metallic nature, I

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.230
imagine it should conduct
electricity, it should be

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.980
shiny, it should be malleable.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.240
I can bend it without
it cracking.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.840
That's how I imagine
metallic nature.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.560
But when people talk about it
in chemistry, they're really

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.470
just talking about
a willingness

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.270
to give away electrons.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.140
That's metallic nature.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.600
And that is important.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.430
If you talk about something
that's going to conduct

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:52.320
electricity or be malleable or
have this sea of electrons

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.280
available that the
atoms can sit in.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.890
But the same trend.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.810
Which atoms are very likely
to give away electrons?

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.290
Well, the bottom left, right?

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:06.300
As you go down, the atom gets
bigger, so the electrons are

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.850
further away from the nucleus.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:14.400
So the coulomb force is weaker,
so those electrons are

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.810
more weakly bound.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:19.080
And also, if you just have one
extra electron here or two

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.162
extra electrons there in your
outermost shell, you're just

00:11:21.162 --> 00:11:24.420
like, hey, let me get rid of
them and then I'll have a

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.030
complete outer shell.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.880
So these guys want to
give away electrons.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.290
So they have a very high
metallic nature.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.450
These guys want to
keep electrons.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:35.560
And they want to take more.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.460
So they have a very low
metallic nature.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.150
In fact these are completely
non-metallic in any way.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.680
And if you were to say, within a
group, the trend-- I mean, I

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.290
did the diagonal, but that's in
general true-- is that the

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:52.960
further you go down a group,
the size of the atom is

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.340
increasing and the outer
electrons are

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.630
further from the nucleus.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.850
So the electron force is going
to be weaker-- or the coulomb

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:01.690
force is going to be weaker.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.060
So you're more likely to
give away electrons.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.990
So your metallic nature will
increase as you go down.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.230
And your metallic nature will
increase as you go to the

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.365
left, because when you only have
a couple of electrons in

00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:13.800
your outermost shell, you
want to give them away.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.780
So metallic nature, it goes
in the opposite direction.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:17.660
It goes like that.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.890
But for the same reason.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.440
These guys love to
hog electrons.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.680
These guys love to
give them away.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:23.910
Right?

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.070
So ionization energy increased
to the top right.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.010
Electronegativity increased
to the top right.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.920
Metallic nature increased
to the bottom left.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.625
The last trend we could talk
about is just atomic radius.

00:12:38.252 --> 00:12:43.070
And there's a lot of different
ways to actually measure this.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.890
And there's no one best way,
because obviously, we already

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.140
talked about it, an atom doesn't
have a fixed radius.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.830
The electron could show up
pretty much anywhere.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.360
So you could just kind of
do a hard boundary.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.695
OK, 90% chance of finding
the electron.

00:12:55.695 --> 00:12:58.120
That's your sphere
of the atom.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.890
Or you could say, OK, if this
atom bonds with another atom,

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.240
what is half the distance
between the two nucleuses.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:04.470
Right?

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.060
If you make a bond like that.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.325
This is the distance between the
two nucleuses and then you

00:13:10.325 --> 00:13:12.690
can say the atomic
radius is that.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:13.580
So there's a lot of ways.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:14.770
But I think you get
the general idea.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.210
It's just the size
of the atom.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.950
And you could already imagine
that as you go down any one

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.370
group, the size of the
atom increases.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.850
You're adding on more and
more energy levels,

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.300
more and more shells.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.290
The atom is just getting
larger and larger.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.350
In fact, we've used that as an
argument as to why, as you go

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:35.190
down, ionization energy
goes down, or

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.340
electronegativity goes down.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:43.550
So the atoms become larger
as you go down.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.290
Now, the one thing that might
be a little un-intuitive is

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.770
what happens as you
go to the right?

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.070
You're adding electrons as you
go to the right, but you're

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.010
adding them all in the
same shell, right?

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.610
So if this is the nucleus, right
there, and you're in

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.200
some shell, some
orbital shell.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.560
And obviously, they're
not all spheres.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.470
But let's say you're in
some orbital shell.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.900
As you go to the right in a
period, you just keep adding

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.430
electrons to that shell.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.640
Right?

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.710
This is a super-gross
oversimplification.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.180
And as you go to the right,
you have more

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.040
protons in the nucleus.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.680
So this is only getting more and
more positively charged.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:23.800
So what happens is that these
electrons get pulled inwards.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.170
They get pulled inwards.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.150
So as you move to
the right on the

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.670
periodic table, size decreases.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:40.870
And then you say, OK, but
what about when you

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.900
go to the next period?

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.210
You're getting more
protons there.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:45.280
Won't that decrease?

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.120
You are.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.330
But at the same time, you're now
adding the electrons in a

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.740
new shell that's further
from them.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.390
So it gets larger when you
go to the new period.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:59.310
So electron size, as
you go down, large.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.405
And as you go to the left,
you get larger.

00:15:03.405 --> 00:15:10.000
So electron size goes from the
bottom right to the top left.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.940
Although in general, the things
that are in a lower

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.420
period will have a larger size
than most things in a higher

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.120
period, regardless of
what group it's in.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:24.950
But the general trend within a
group, the higher the number,

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.340
the larger the atom.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.780
Within a period, the more
protons you have,

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.690
the smaller the atom.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.080
Anyway, I hope you found
those interesting.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.390
In the next few videos we'll
start with bonding.
