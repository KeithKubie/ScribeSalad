00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.410
I'm a strong advocate for
the study of the humanities

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.140
and the social sciences because
I believe that it's a way

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.290
for students to come to
get outside their own skin

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.780
and to really understand a
world beyond themselves often

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.490
by being able to
look at the world

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.580
through other people's eyes
and that to me seems essential.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.300
First of all, to work with other
people, but also to be able

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.200
to get perspective on
themselves and what might be a

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.520
of idea they'd rethink

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.340
or something they would
no longer take for granted

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.250
or something they'd need to more
fully explain and understand.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.960
So that kind of study that
introduces students to habits

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.760
of mind, to judgment, to
perspectives beyond themselves,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.060
I think are at the heart of what
it means to become educated.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.100
To become a person who's more
than just your single self,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.450
but is a person related to the
rest of the world and the rest

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.910
of the people in that world.
