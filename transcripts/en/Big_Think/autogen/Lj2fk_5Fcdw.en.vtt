00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.140
so when we think about democracy I think

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150
so when we think about democracy I think
 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.820
so when we think about democracy I think
there's kind of a real interesting

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830
there's kind of a real interesting
 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.410
there's kind of a real interesting
opportunity to think about what is

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420
opportunity to think about what is
 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.450
opportunity to think about what is
participatory democracy in the modern

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460
participatory democracy in the modern
 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.609
participatory democracy in the modern
connected connected world and I think

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619
connected connected world and I think
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.769
connected connected world and I think
there's all kinds of versions that are

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779
there's all kinds of versions that are
 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.230
there's all kinds of versions that are
much better than the vote every two year

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240
much better than the vote every two year
 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.509
much better than the vote every two year
kind of version that we have right now

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519
kind of version that we have right now
 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.570
kind of version that we have right now
for example there's a lovely experiment

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580
for example there's a lovely experiment
 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.080
for example there's a lovely experiment
that said what if people got to vote on

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
that said what if people got to vote on
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.540
that said what if people got to vote on
were five percent of their income tax

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550
were five percent of their income tax
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.830
were five percent of their income tax
goes to so you would get a list of all

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
goes to so you would get a list of all
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.780
goes to so you would get a list of all
the things the government does right

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790
the things the government does right
 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.310
the things the government does right
which is actually it's already a good

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
which is actually it's already a good
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.260
which is actually it's already a good
thing because people don't know what the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270
thing because people don't know what the
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.160
thing because people don't know what the
government does we went at some point we

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170
government does we went at some point we
 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.200
government does we went at some point we
went to the Chapel Hill Public Library

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210
went to the Chapel Hill Public Library
 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.330
went to the Chapel Hill Public Library
and we asked people when was the last

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340
and we asked people when was the last
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.189
and we asked people when was the last
time you got benefit from taxpayers

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
time you got benefit from taxpayers
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.889
time you got benefit from taxpayers
money people couldn't remember when was

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
money people couldn't remember when was
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.660
money people couldn't remember when was
the last time and they were in a public

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670
the last time and they were in a public
 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.990
the last time and they were in a public
library funded by taxpayers money so you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
library funded by taxpayers money so you
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.399
library funded by taxpayers money so you
know we don't really understand what the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409
know we don't really understand what the
 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.130
know we don't really understand what the
government does what what taxes go for

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
government does what what taxes go for
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.810
government does what what taxes go for
but if you got a list of all the things

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820
but if you got a list of all the things
 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.700
but if you got a list of all the things
the government does and you could decide

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
the government does and you could decide
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.679
the government does and you could decide
five percent you know you probably don't

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689
five percent you know you probably don't
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.210
five percent you know you probably don't
want people to allocate all of their

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220
want people to allocate all of their
 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.800
want people to allocate all of their
income tax because there's some things

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
income tax because there's some things
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.300
income tax because there's some things
that the government needs to worry about

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310
that the government needs to worry about
 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.460
that the government needs to worry about
but doing some kind of marginal

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470
but doing some kind of marginal
 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.140
but doing some kind of marginal
contribution and thinking where we want

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
contribution and thinking where we want
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.450
contribution and thinking where we want
to be I think would get people to be

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
to be I think would get people to be
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.179
to be I think would get people to be
more involved care more look at waste I

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189
more involved care more look at waste I
 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.520
more involved care more look at waste I
think will make government officers a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
think will make government officers a
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590
think will make government officers a
bit more accountable so that's one

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600
bit more accountable so that's one
 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.039
bit more accountable so that's one
version where I think we could get

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049
version where I think we could get
 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.539
version where I think we could get
participatory democracy to be closer to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
participatory democracy to be closer to
 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.539
participatory democracy to be closer to
what we want it want it to be and

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
what we want it want it to be and
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.270
what we want it want it to be and
another another kind of direction is to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
another another kind of direction is to
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.730
another another kind of direction is to
say why do we need to vote for one

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
say why do we need to vote for one
 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.620
say why do we need to vote for one
person so so imagine that we would have

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
person so so imagine that we would have
 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.289
person so so imagine that we would have
a voting procedure which would say you

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299
a voting procedure which would say you
 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.590
a voting procedure which would say you
could say I won't Dan then really to

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
could say I won't Dan then really to
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.310
could say I won't Dan then really to
vote for me on any issues that has to do

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
vote for me on any issues that has to do
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.950
vote for me on any issues that has to do
with education and health but not about

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960
with education and health but not about
 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.410
with education and health but not about
I don't know space exploration and not

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420
I don't know space exploration and not
 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.309
I don't know space exploration and not
about nuclear activities imagine all of

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319
about nuclear activities imagine all of
 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.070
about nuclear activities imagine all of
society is a network of people and you

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
society is a network of people and you
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.300
society is a network of people and you
can assign your vote not

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310
can assign your vote not
 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.460
can assign your vote not
just to the representatives but you

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470
just to the representatives but you
 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.020
just to the representatives but you
could assign your votes to other people

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030
could assign your votes to other people
 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.900
could assign your votes to other people
in society well you could say you know

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910
in society well you could say you know
 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.120
in society well you could say you know
what then I trust you on those topics

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130
what then I trust you on those topics
 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.130
what then I trust you on those topics
you could vote for me and I could trust

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140
you could vote for me and I could trust
 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.470
you could vote for me and I could trust
somebody else and so on so we could we

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480
somebody else and so on so we could we
 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.030
somebody else and so on so we could we
could create a network in which we trust

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040
could create a network in which we trust
 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.520
could create a network in which we trust
different people for different subtopics

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530
different people for different subtopics
 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.280
different people for different subtopics
and not have this idea that is one

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290
and not have this idea that is one
 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.670
and not have this idea that is one
person who is representing us is is the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680
person who is representing us is is the
 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.479
person who is representing us is is the
right person for all all topics around

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489
right person for all all topics around
 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:51.680
right person for all all topics around
so so that's one the other the other of

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690
so so that's one the other the other of
 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.620
so so that's one the other the other of
course a big issue and I don't know if

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630
course a big issue and I don't know if
 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.940
course a big issue and I don't know if
you saw this but we we did a lot of

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950
you saw this but we we did a lot of
 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.960
you saw this but we we did a lot of
studies about how people want society to

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970
studies about how people want society to
 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.370
studies about how people want society to
be designed so originally we did it from

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380
be designed so originally we did it from
 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.289
be designed so originally we did it from
inequality financial inequality but then

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299
inequality financial inequality but then
 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.600
inequality financial inequality but then
we moved to other areas as well but in

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610
we moved to other areas as well but in
 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.000
we moved to other areas as well but in
the area of financial inequality and we

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010
the area of financial inequality and we
 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.259
the area of financial inequality and we
asked people first of all what they

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269
asked people first of all what they
 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.150
asked people first of all what they
understand about the distribution of

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160
understand about the distribution of
 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.340
understand about the distribution of
wealth in the US so we said imagine if

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350
wealth in the US so we said imagine if
 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.990
wealth in the US so we said imagine if
we took all the people in the u.s. from

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000
we took all the people in the u.s. from
 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.330
we took all the people in the u.s. from
the poorest to the richest we broke them

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340
the poorest to the richest we broke them
 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.880
the poorest to the richest we broke them
into five buckets the 20% richest 20%

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890
into five buckets the 20% richest 20%
 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.640
into five buckets the 20% richest 20%
less less less in the poorest and we

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650
less less less in the poorest and we
 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.750
less less less in the poorest and we
asked you from the hundred percent

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760
asked you from the hundred percent
 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.930
asked you from the hundred percent
wealth tone pie how much is allocated

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940
wealth tone pie how much is allocated
 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.690
wealth tone pie how much is allocated
right now to each of those five buckets

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700
right now to each of those five buckets
 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.840
right now to each of those five buckets
and people think that the bottom two

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850
and people think that the bottom two
 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.250
and people think that the bottom two
buckets the bottom forty percent of

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260
buckets the bottom forty percent of
 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.440
buckets the bottom forty percent of
Americans own about nine percent of the

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450
Americans own about nine percent of the
 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.400
Americans own about nine percent of the
wealth where in fact they own about 0.3

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410
wealth where in fact they own about 0.3
 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.830
wealth where in fact they own about 0.3
right so the this slope is what's called

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840
right so the this slope is what's called
 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.120
right so the this slope is what's called
the Gini coefficient the rate of

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130
the Gini coefficient the rate of
 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.250
the Gini coefficient the rate of
inequality people know the rich have a

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260
inequality people know the rich have a
 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.870
inequality people know the rich have a
lot of people don't understand Americans

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880
lot of people don't understand Americans
 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.569
lot of people don't understand Americans
understand how little the poor the poor

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579
understand how little the poor the poor
 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.020
understand how little the poor the poor
have and then we also asked them what

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030
have and then we also asked them what
 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.910
have and then we also asked them what
would you like society to be and we use

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920
would you like society to be and we use
 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.229
would you like society to be and we use
John Rawls if you remember John Rawls

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239
