Our sleep patterns are a result of Circadian rhythms which are biological

00:00:04.146 --> 00:00:09.630
processes that occur over approximately a 24-hour cycle. For example throughout

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.078
a 24-hour period, our bodies will change in temperature. It'll peak a few hours

00:00:14.078 --> 00:00:18.355
before we go to bed. And soon after we wake up, but it will decrease when we're

00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:22.922
asleep. Production of certain chemicals, such as Melatonin. They will change

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:26.712
our alertness throughout the day. I mentioned Melatonin, this is produced in

00:00:26.712 --> 00:00:30.829
the Pineal Gland, and it's important for sleep. It causes drowsiness and

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.020
lowering of the body temperature.
