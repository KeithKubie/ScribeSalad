00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.220
When NASA started recruiting for its first
astronaut class in 1959, it had no idea what

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.640
it was looking for because it didn’t know
what was going to happen to the human body

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.870
in space.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.780
Basically the agency needed people used to
flying dangerous missions in untested vehicles

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.050
while giving real-time feedback to engineers…
which pretty much narrowed the pool to test

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.050
pilots.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.170
President Eisenhower stipulated that due to
the potential top-secret nature of this endeavour,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.760
they should be in the military.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.740
And this led to the basic qualifications for
the first batch of astronauts.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.489
Military pilots who’d graduated from a test
pilot school holding a bachelor’s of engineering

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.670
with at least 1,500 hours flying jets under
their belts.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.800
And we ended up with these guys: three Navy
pilots, three air force pilots, and one marine

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.730
pilot all with the flight time and bachelor’s
degrees.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.559
This was basically the way things went until
1964 when NASA shifted to reward academic

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.530
merits, looking at PhDs instead of flight
time.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.870
The fourth group was the first of scientist-astronauts.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.690
Two were qualified civilians and the others
had military backgrounds.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.510
NASA’s needs were changing.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.229
With long-duration lunar missions and even
longer space station flights in the works,

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.760
the agency was starting to need real scientists
in space.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.440
During the Apollo-era, untested and new was
the name game and the crews were just three

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.680
men so each astronaut had to do everything
-- be a test pilot, an engineer, a scientist...

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.280
But with the pending beginning of the shuttle
program, crews were larger, missions were

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.440
longer, and the technology was designed to
be reused so it would become familiar over

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.440
time.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.280
This meant NASA could look at astronauts not
as jacks of all trades but specialists.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.630
Some would fly the shuttle and others would
have specific roles on missions.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.470
To this end, incoming classes of astronauts
didn’t divide people by type.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.030
They took all types under one umbrella: pilots
and what NASA called mission specialists.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.160
And that’s still what NASA does when recruiting,
though occasionally there are payload specialist

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.800
who are trained for a specific flights.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.290
But this doesn’t mean there aren’t strict
criteria for astronaut hopefuls of either

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.290
type.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.650
The current base requirements from NASA say
candidates need to hold a bachelor’s degree

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.850
in science or math and have at least some
jet experience under their belt.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.120
They have to be able to pass a physical exam,
have at least 20/20 vision, blood pressure

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.149
below 140/90 at rest, and stand between 5
foot 2 and 6 foot 3.

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.069
From there, the special skills are taught,
things like military water survival, SCUBA

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.500
in anticipation of spacewalks, and specific
training for their individual mission.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.620
Since 1959, NASA has had some 350 American
men and women join its astronaut corps.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.010
They’ve done a combined 306 spacewalks over
150 missions.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.030
And new groups aren’t recruited regularly.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.889
NASA brings in astronauts on an as-needed
basis.

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:35.989
So with all that you might think that astronauts
are a highly skilled trade and paid as such,

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:36.989
right?

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:37.989
Not exactly.

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.410
Job openings for astronauts are announced
online at USAJOBS, the site for US civil service

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.319
positions alongside listings for aviation
safety inspector, internal revenue agent,

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.549
dental officer for the prison system, and
food inspector.

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:51.549
And the pay is equivalent.

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:52.549
That means the annual salary can be anywhere
between 50 and 114 thousand dollars.

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.659
The qualifications for astronauts have loosened
but haven’t changed all that much since

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:56.659
1959.

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.419
The latest class of 12 astronauts has three
recruits from the Navy, one Marine, one from

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.900
the Air Force, and one from the Army.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.189
The other six are civilians.

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.489
All have bachelor’s degrees and five have
doctorates.

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.700
And only six among them already have flight
experience.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.300
So flying in space is awesome and badass,
but it’s not glamorous and you kinda gotta

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.269
be a badass nerd to do it.
