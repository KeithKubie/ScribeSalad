a little bit that will release carbon

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300
a little bit that will release carbon
 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.230
a little bit that will release carbon
dioxide and initiate a greenhouse effect

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.900
dioxide and initiate a greenhouse effect
which will then melt more ice and let

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910
which will then melt more ice and let
 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.510
which will then melt more ice and let
more carbon dioxide come up so in other

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
more carbon dioxide come up so in other
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370
more carbon dioxide come up so in other
words you have an autocatalytic effect

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380
words you have an autocatalytic effect
 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.650
words you have an autocatalytic effect
you just have to jumpstart it once you

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
you just have to jumpstart it once you
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.020
you just have to jumpstart it once you
jumpstart it more carbon dioxide creates

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030
jumpstart it more carbon dioxide creates
 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.090

more temperature heats up the planet

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100
more temperature heats up the planet
 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.760
more temperature heats up the planet
which releases more carbon dioxide so

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770
which releases more carbon dioxide so
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.900
which releases more carbon dioxide so
then the question is how do you

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910
then the question is how do you
 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.510
then the question is how do you
jumpstart it a number of mechanisms have

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520
jumpstart it a number of mechanisms have
 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.220

been proposed greenhouse effects

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230

hydrogen bombs nuclear power plants to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
hydrogen bombs nuclear power plants to
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.810
hydrogen bombs nuclear power plants to
raise the temperature of Mars a little

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
raise the temperature of Mars a little
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.330
raise the temperature of Mars a little
bit and that will then set off a chain

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340
bit and that will then set off a chain
 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.910
bit and that will then set off a chain
reaction release even more carbon

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920
reaction release even more carbon
 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.490
reaction release even more carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere that's the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
dioxide into the atmosphere that's the
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.250
dioxide into the atmosphere that's the
cheapest way to take advantage of the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
cheapest way to take advantage of the
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.530
cheapest way to take advantage of the
carbon dioxide that already exists

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540
carbon dioxide that already exists
 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.380
carbon dioxide that already exists
rather than hauling pumps and generators

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390
rather than hauling pumps and generators
 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.430
rather than hauling pumps and generators
from the earth to Mars
