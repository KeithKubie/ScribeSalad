Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 63 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. I am an American fighting man. I serve in the forces which guard my country and our way of life. I am prepared to give my life in their defense. I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command I will never surrender my men. While they still have the means to resist, they find him captured. I will continue to resist. By all means available. I will make every effort to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy. If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will give no information or take part in any actions which might be harmful to my comrades. If I am senior, I will take command. If not, I will obey the lawful orders of those appointed over me and we'll back them up in every way. When questioned, should I become a prisoner of war, I am bound to give only name, rank, service number, and date of birth. I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability. I will make no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and its allies or harmful to their cause.

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       I will never forget that I am an American fighting man responsible for my actions and dedicated to the principles which made my country free. I will trust in God and in the United States of America.

Speaker 2:          00:02:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:09       And that is the 1955 version of the code of conduct for the armed forces of the United States.

Speaker 2:          00:02:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       And it was written in response to the brutal treatment. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:02:27       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       Of the 7,190 Americans captured by the enemy during the Korean War, prisoners who were subjected to torture, indoctrination, brainwashing, and forced confessions. And that version of the code that I just read is almost exactly the same as the one that I learned in the military. When I joined in 1990

Speaker 2:          00:02:55       they did

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       make some changes to it. They changed it to include men and women and they changed two words to give some flexibility to increase survivability and psychological recovery from torture. And so the little changes that were made at it changed from the prisoner being bound to give only name, rank and service number and date of birth to the prisoner being required to give name, rank, service number and date of birth, small changes. But the spirit of the code didn't change at all. And that code is what we as military fighting men and women were and are expected to uphold should we ever be captured and held as prisoners by the enemy. Code of conduct is simple and clear and straightforward, but the code of conduct gets tested on like any other document in the world when our American servicemen and women are somehow captured and as prisoners of war face absolutely ruthless levels of torture, pain, suffering, disease, starvation, humiliation, and perhaps the most devastating hopelessness. And tonight it is my absolute honor to have one of these men here, one who during almost a full year of horror upon horror at the hands of his captors and Vietnam man, who persevered and fought with every ounce of his soul to survive against the worst possible conditions imaginable.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       Oh man, that not only learned the code of conduct,

Speaker 2:          00:05:27       but lived it

Speaker 1:          00:05:30       a retired army colonel William bill reader. Sir, thank you so much for being here tonight. Thank you, Jackie. Oh, it's my honor indeed to be here and participate in this podcast as well. Thank you. I want to just before we jump into the book, if you could just talk a little bit about you growing up, what you did, what

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       you were like, where you were. Oh boy. Okay. I didn't know this was coming. Um, yeah, it was essentially a kid off the streets of Los Angeles. I was born in Glendale, grew up for a time in the San Fernando Valley, which is in the opening prologue to the, to the book. Um, yeah, I had a tough childhood, I guess I would say. Um, got into some trouble as a, as a young guy, uh, sports helped me at least survive to graduate from high school, uh, left college. Uh, and I, and I went off to college at University of Idaho to study forestry. Uh, I left college and less than the than esteemed academic terms. After only one year, uh, worked for a time as a, uh, I worked all the time as a kid with various small jobs, newspaper routes and selling magazines to door to tour. Um, then did some construction work in, in my early teens roofing work.

Speaker 3:          00:06:51       Uh, but yeah, after I left college, I worked cattle ranches for awhile. Uh, worked for the US Forest Service for a time, a ultimately as a firefighter. I got laid off in the end of fire season, went back home to Los Angeles and found a job with southern California Edison in Santa Monica, climbing power lines as a apprentice Lineman, and did that until the outbreak of the Vietnam War. And then found my real niche in life when I walked into the army recruiter in Santa Monica, California. And the sign on the dotted line, what you was at 1965. So you know, the Tonkin Gulf incident occurred, that's where the, uh, the US destroyers were attacked in 1964. We put Marines ashore in Denang and March of 1965, that's when I started talking to recruiters. First I was going in the Marine Corps, uh, but somehow ended up enlisting in the army, uh, in a, in August of 1965.

Speaker 3:          00:07:41       And then what was the transition to becoming a pilot? Yeah, so I started out enlisted, uh, went to basic training and advanced individual training ait. I was 80, can't Ken, Ken Kennedy Ear, a member of a cannon crew and an artillery unit, and then applied for officer candidate school. And they took those with the highest test scores. You had to pass this through of interviews. Uh, but they were looking for officers and especially artillery lieutenants. And so I went to artillery officer candidate school, six months of a, of training with some degree of harassment and then got commissioned in August of 1966 as a second lieutenant and artillery. And then how long did you artillery for before he became a pilot? Yeah, that was about a year. I didn't think I was going to be able to fly. And that's really why I didn't go in the Marine Corps. I wanted to be a pilot throwing two services.

Speaker 3:          00:08:26       You could fly without a college degree. So this college dropout had hopes in either the Marine Corps or the army. Uh, when I went and saw the marine recruiter, he gave me a battery of tests and he said, and he said, yeah, you qualify for a flight and we can guarantee you a flight training. I said, okay. So what do I have to do? Is, is you just go in, as long as you pass a flight physical, you're good to go. So I could sense there was something, uh, of put here. So before I went in and I went to a FAA flight surgeon in Santa Monica said, give me the same flight the military does and tell me if I could pass it. So he gave me the physical and said, no, you wouldn't pass it. He said, you're right. Eyes about 20, 25 to 2030. You have an astigmatism.

Speaker 3:          00:09:06       They require a perfect 20, 20 vision. You couldn't pass the flight physical. So I wrote off the Marine Corps. I wasn't going to do that. And I, I went into the, uh, into the army instead thinking I would never fly after I went to officer candidate school, I get commissioned, I was working in an artillery assignment at Fort Carson, Colorado and went in for an annual physical. And when I got the physical, it came back 20, 20, both eyes. So I was, I was in like Flynn took that down to the flight surgeon and put my application in and a, and one off to flight school.

Speaker 1:          00:09:35       Awesome. Awesome. And so I'm going to, I'm going to jump into the book here. You, um, you spent your first tour in Vietnam, I think as your first tour in Vietnam. You were flying the Mohawk, right. Okay. So first tour in Vietnam. And by the way, you know, we were talking before the podcast about how much risk you guys took in Vietnam as pilots. It's, it's actually crazy and we'll get into more than that. But one of the things that struck me as I'm in the beginning of your book and you're talking about how you got shot down on your first deployment to Vietnam as a pilot. So, so here, here's you telling that story to your, your crew when you're going on your second deployment that you said. Yeah, the first couple of operations we've done here, they've been pretty exciting. But you know, I had some good ones on my last deployment too by the way.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       It got shot down and uh, so here I'm going to go to the book here. This is what happened when you got shot down for the first time. It took a 37 millimeter milometer antiaircraft hitting the right wing, attacking a fuel depot, hit hidden under the trees, classified mission in Laos over the Ho Chi Minh trail. I pulled up from a rocket run, wham. The whole right side of the aircraft seemed to explode. We tumbled out of control. The right wing shattered and was on fire, worked hard, got back some ability to fly, got the fire out, but we were descending fast, could not hold out the Tude. Gave the command to eject. The Observer went out, I pulled my seat handle right after I had a very short parachute ride, only got partial shoot deployment before hitting the ground with a thud. We are crashing through the tree tops by the time I punched out. So, so for those people that don't know what all that means is right there, that means you know, when you pull an ejection handle on, uh, on, uh, when you're in a plane, it ejects you out. But you're supposed to do it with some level of altitude, right? Not when you're hitting the tree tops. So you're hitting the tree tops in that, in the canopy, not opening all the way. That means that the full usage of the parachute isn't there. It's just sort of getting opened and then boom, it hits the ground.

Speaker 3:          00:11:36       My way, man, took a picture of my shoot down site and you can see the, uh, the parachute is just all strung out and I'm laying there at the end of the parachute. I mean, I never got a single isolation. I got a partial shoot deployment and hit the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:11:50       I'm glad we can sit here and laugh at say, am I offending by laughing at this?

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       I hope not. No, you're not. Because I mean you made a comment about, you know, taking the hits and I the attention to come. And it was, it really was. But there's something crazy about young men. Uh, and uh, and uh, at that point in my life I was a kid living a dream and I got blown out of the sky and my first tour. Yes, I survived it. And somehow in my crazy twisted mind, I couldn't wait to get back over on his second tour, Flying Cobra attack helicopters. Hey, by the way, so this is what happens once you get on the ground. Here we go back to the book. Then I was newly captured. I ran through the jungle 45 minutes while my wing man put down suppressive fire that earned me the nickname. Lightfoot got plucked out of the jungle by an Air Force helicopter from the 20th Special Operations Squadron Out of Thailand called the call side Pony Express. Spent some time in the hospital there. Eventually I returned to the unit back to flight

Speaker 1:          00:12:44       duties. This is incredible. We lost 15 airplanes at that point. Out of 1830 crew members shot down. Not many of them ever recovered. I was one of the few lousy odds. I was scared. Then I'll tell you, if you don't get scared in combat, you're a liar or nuts. Only after tents mission is over. Does the real fright come when there's time to sit and think? You watch it all play out in your mind and wonder how the hell you live through something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:13:16       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:13:17       so again, we were talking before, before we pressed record about the, you know, about how protective America is of its aircraft right now. I can't even imagine. You guys had 15 out of 18 airplanes that were shot down. That's, that's insane.

Speaker 3:          00:13:35       Yeah, and that was a sophisticated, expensive aircraft for the army at the time, though. The Mohawk was pretty much top of the line technology, arm, army aircraft then. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:13:49       very. Yeah. That's, that's a totally different mentality that than we have now.

Speaker 3:          00:13:55       Totally different mentality. Yeah. And that was a special unit. We had five Mohawk companies in Vietnam at that time. Uh, four of them were for each of the four core tactical zones inside of south Vietnam. They flew missions and supportive of those areas. Uh, we were the fifth company, the Bastard Company. We flew out of way Phu Bai. The only time we saw South Vietnam was for take offs and landings, all of our missions when it allows her up off the coast of North Vietnam. And then I had one highly classified one. I had to deploy down to Todd snoot at Saigon to go into Cambodia. Uh, that I didn't know what that was all about. It was really hush hush at the time. And that was in the advance of the big Ang, Cambodia and curves. And that took place in 70. They developed the Mohawks for Vietnam because it's interesting aircraft.

Speaker 3:          00:14:38       It's a side by side right in, it's a prop plane to that twin turbo prop. Others built purely for reconnaissance and surveillance, Grumman, Grumman aircraft. Um, but then you guys went ahead and put missiles on them or rockets. We put, we put rocks in. There were Zuni missiles forever. Yeah, we had rockets and pod mounted machine guns. Uh, that, yeah, that led to my cobra experience because I really, that was my favorite mission where the gun missions in the Mohawk, not all of them were armed, but I, I liked the gun missions. Uh, when I came back, my first tour, there was a spat between the army and the air force. And the result of the spot was we had to take all the armament off the Mohawks. So when I went back on second tour, I wanted to go on a gunship, not something without guns. So that got me into cobras.

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       Yeah, that's weird. Those bureaucratic spats happening, decisions like that get made. That's really disturbing. So let's get into your second tour, right? And I'm going to jump into this piece here. Back to the book. On April 14th, we received a radio call that Firebase Charlie was under attack by two regiments, 3000 soldiers of the 320th Nva Infantry Division and 130 million meter artillery shells were pounding the position. So you guys get this call, this, this friendly basis being overrun basically. And here you show up on the scene. Now you're fine. A Cobra, which for those of you that don't know a Cobra gunship as you just said, it's still in service today. The Marine Corps stuff flies growers like overs and very narrow skinny. It's based on a Huey, right?

Speaker 3:          00:16:09       Yeah, it was, you know, the Helio was designed and went to Vietnam and that most of our smaller with the Huey, the Huey took on a gun mission though that, that uh, in Vietnam we saw the utility had guns on our aircraft. Uh, so the Cobra then was designed specifically and only as a gunship and they took the Huey design, narrowed it down to 36 inches pilot in the backseat, copilot gunner in the front seat, 2.75 rockets on the wing stores, a mini gun and 40 million or million or grenade launcher in a movable knows to it. And it was one killing machine.

Speaker 1:          00:16:38       Okay. And it's still apparently brings a giant smile to your face when you talk about that, which is lovely. And I don't want to seem twisted. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16:46       And I, I sat at the time I was a, I was a kid living a dream and I was, but I don't want to take away from the horror of combat. And it was scary as crap. Yeah. On, on every single mission. But there's still something about a young guy, uh, going to war, at least a certain type of young guy. Uh, and those that were in the two units I served in, uh, that, uh, yeah, we, we were dedicated what we did and I think we did it well and I'm still smiling about it. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:17:12       So far, every guy had brought in to this podcast has the exact same attitude. So you're among friends here. So I'm going now you guys are, you guys are there, you show up with your, when you're Cobra's back to the book, we made several passes on enemy guns, bullets stream past our cockpits as the NVA gunners tried to bring us down. Rolling in on a 51 physician is always dicey. So this is a 51 caliber. It's a dish, it's a, it's an anti aircraft, aircraft machine gun. And they actually had those when we were in Ramadi. They had still had dish gets and they use them against us. Tracers come at you and miss by a few feet. You try to get rockets onto him before he gets lucky and blast you out of the sky. We took small arms, hits my knees vibrated like a sewing machine, but I focused on controlling the helicopter, lining up the gun sights and shooting.

Speaker 1:          00:18:02       I was scared, but had no time for it. Dan radioed dusty cyanide panther one three panther one three be advised, running low on fuel out of Ammo. We're breaking station for re arm refuel. Roger, one, three, four gun crews taken out. Good work. Hurry back. So you're your to ring to the guy on the ground. Who's there? So there's an American advisor on the ground with a bunch of south Vietnamese soldiers. They're being overrun. You come in, you're taking heavy fire, but you're giving backfire. You tell them, hey, we got to go and get some more ammunition. He's saying, good job, hurry back.

Speaker 1:          00:18:44       And when you do show up back, the NVA attack is now more intense. And here's the call that you get when you show back up panther. That's you. By the way, Panther Pink Panther's as your, as you guys want to call, as your call sign is panther. Here's the call you get panther, the battalion commander is dead acting commander, wounded enemy broken through on the southwest, put it there first, then all around us, but real close. So for those people that don't understand what this means, when you're on the ground calling for fire, it's, it's, and I've talked about a lot of fracture side and blue on blue situations. I've, I had him on my deployment and it's a, it's a very scary thing and it's even scarier from the air to the ground. It's, it's, it's hard for people to understand this. When you're in an aircraft, it's very hard to see what's happening on the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:19:42       It can be very easy to get confused and so it's hard to bring fire very close to your position unless you are just in a terrible situation. And so when you get a call that saying, put the fire all around us as close as you can. You know, this is a desperate scenario and so I'll go back to the book, Roger Dusty, we've got them after a number of Cobra attack runs, Duffy called Panther lead. This is dusty Sinai, so that's the guy on the ground. That's his call sign. Dusty cyanide, you've broken the enemy attack for now hundreds of bodies in the wire, maybe a thousand but we cannot hold after a short break. He continued. We are leaving Firebase, Charlie, now stop them from following us. Whatever it takes, put your stuff right on top of the fire base. Now and again, this is something that it, just to explain what that means. If you don't understand what that you'd never in the military to explain,

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       you're calling for people to drop fire onto your own position so that you can get away. It doesn't get any, there's nothing. It doesn't get any more intense. It doesn't get any more dramatic. It doesn't get any more sketchy than that right there. That was one hell of a fight. And John Joseph Duffy was the adviser, the American advisor on the ground. And he is a true American hero Army Special Forces officer had those adviser duties. Uh, that battle, the battle lasted for about two weeks. The climax of it was a couple days with that last night. That is described in the book, uh, out of a 470 man, south Vietnamese airborne Paratroop Battalion. At the end of that fight, the next morning, uh, the American advisor, John Joseph Duffy and 36 of the South Vietnamese were all that survived to be picked up. Uh, when they, when they got off of that Firebase and, and John was a wounded five times in the battle.

Speaker 3:          00:21:44       So yeah, 470 man battalion, 36 survivors and their, and their wounded American advisor. Absolutely unbelievable. And I know you wrote in here that major Duffy was recommended for the medal of honor and he got the distinguished service cross for his actions, which if you don't know what that is, it's, it's the second highest award underneath the metal of honor. Yeah. And you actually talk about possibly writing about that battle. That's my, that's my next project. And in doing this book, and there's a, uh, there's a statement at the beginning of the book that I wrote this some 40 years after I experienced these actions. Uh, and, and some things were still perfectly clear in my mind. Other things were a little bit hazier than I thought they would be when I put pen to paper. Uh, so in the process of writing, I not only just dug down in my mind and relived every experience as detailed as I could to get everything correct.

Speaker 3:          00:22:38       I contacted those who were also involved in and the actions to get their versions of their view, their recollections, to be sure I had this as right as I could. Uh, John Joseph Duffy was one that I got ahold of major Duffy. I had never met him. I'd never talked to him since that battle until I was able to track him down with the wonders of modern communication and Internet. Uh, and, and in sharing the details about that fight, uh, he dropped a couple of hints. He said, you know, somebody really ought to write the history of the battle of Firebase. Charlie, this is one of the most extraordinary fights in the entire Vietnam war. So I think it was after about half a dozen times he said, I said, okay, John, I'll do it. I'll write it. So yes, right now I'm, I'm working on doing my research and getting everything in order to, to write the story of, of, of that battle and more detail than I give on my, what couple of pages are in my book. Yeah, that's one of the, one of the most interesting things for me about doing this podcast. And we're, again, another thing we were talking about is there's so many, you know, I didn't know about that battle and I'm a pretty decent student of military history. I didn't know about that battle and didn't know about major John Duffy. I absolutely should. And we

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       all should. Any and what you realize is that battle that man, we will never be able to account for all of these heroes. No, you just can't do it. So again, this is fast forwarding a little bit through the book. And by the way, I didn't mention the name of the book yet. Oh yeah. Thank you. The name of the book is through the valley, my captivity in Vietnam by William Reader and get this book. So at this point I'm, I'm jumping ahead a little bit too,

Speaker 1:          00:24:31       a situation where you've got, and I'll go to the book tanks in the wire at Poli cling launched now and call me and wrote for their radio freak hawks claw will get up later. You'll be covering him too. You have tail number, zero five three and six eight to go. So that right there is something bad is happening and you got to go now. And what's, what's interesting, and I'll point this out for again, people that aren't in the military, by the way, a lot of guys that listen to this or in the military, a lot of law enforcement, but there's a lot of civilians that don't know everything that I'm talking about or that word that you're talking about. So what I like about this is that what they're telling, what they're telling the colonel to do is launch your aircraft. Just go get an aircraft and launch and start heading in that direction.

Speaker 1:          00:25:22       We'll give you a frequency when you get up there, we'll tell you what's going to happen once you get up there to go. So again, this is an inextremist situation. What we would do that would be similar to this in the seal teams is we would go on QRF missions, quick reaction forces where they would call it there. It happened to me where they call up and say, hey, something's going on here at this location. Go and I'd say, who's the unit? We don't know yet. Any frequency. What's what radio frequency on? We don't know yet. We'll get it to you. Launch. We'd get in our vehicles and launch. Yeah. You developed the situation and route and then when you lay eyes on when you get there and start talking to the folks. Yep, exactly. Back to the book, I stuffed a small emergency radio into one of the pockets of my survival vest.

Speaker 1:          00:26:04       No time to perform the normal check on the radio. I, I had to include that. There's a lesson learned there. I had to include that. It's, you know, the radio will always work. If you test it in the water tight, you don't test it is the one time that locker. Yeah, that's the lesson. Check all your survival, your shirts in order, regardless of how hot that mission is. Um, now you're heading to a place called the Ben hit and I'm going to the book. We headed to Ben hat as we crossed the last ridge line. The entire valley before us was filled with smoke. Tracers streamed outward from defensive positions inside the camp enemy tracers replied from outside to jet. Fighters bombed next to the camp. Nva rockets, artillery and mortars exploded in the camp. Enemy tanks breached the perimeter one inside and part way up the hill look like it had been killed already. I couldn't be sure an AC one 30 on air force AC when 30 spectre gunship was leaving. He had worked the area over with 20 millimeter Volk Vulcan Gatling guns and 40 millimeter cannon cannon's probably hitting the tank enemy infantry move through openings in the jungle canopy. I could see groups assembling to join the attack.

Speaker 3:          00:27:25       Yeah, it was, it was one heck of a heck of a battle. The, this whole situation we're getting to in the book occurred during the Easter offensive of 1972 when I arrived back in Vietnam at the end of [inaudible] 71, it seemed like the war was over. In fact, I was afraid that maybe I'd missed my chance for combat and a Cobra because things were so quiet. Uh, many American, in fact, most American forces had been withdrawn in the central part of Vietnam. The central highlands where I was operating, there were no American ground forces left at all. It's just some special forces guys, uh, army aviation units and some air force unit. That was it. Um, how that changed as we got into the spring of 1972 because the enemy had been building up their divisions across the border into Laos and Cambodia. And in the spring of 72, they launched an attack from the demilitarized zone and attack from Cambodia towards Saigon.

Speaker 3:          00:28:16       And then finally in April, attacks across the central highlands where we were, and there were a lot of enemy this day at Ben Het courses is going to turn into the the day, the day that we're getting to here. Uh, but yeah, elements of two north Vietnamese divisions with artillery, with anti aircraft weapons Galore. Uh, and with, uh, with armor, uh, going into the end of the camp. And there we showed up with our two cobras to do, do what we could do. Was that your first time seeing armor enemy armor? No. Uh, that, that, that period was on the 20 foot, cause this is the 9th of May. On the 24th of April, the enemy attacked the, uh, the 22nd Arvin that's Army Vietnam Division headquarters at 10 can, which is a little bit further to the east from Ben hit. So on the 24th of April, they attack Tan cannon and defeated and overran that Nva division, uh, with a, a number of tanks. So that was the first time I saw tanks and battle. Then we come out on the 9th of May and I'm seeing tanks again. Whole different ballgame for the guys on the ground. Yes. Yeah. This guerrilla war suddenly turned into a very conventional war fighting regular north Vietnamese divisions. Now

Speaker 1:          00:29:25       it's again you, you had some time on station, you did a bunch of shooting and running and gun and you had to go back to reload, refuel, and I'm going back to the book now. On our way back to Ben hat, we could see the battle continuing at ploy polyclinic, Holly clang, Vietnamese air force a one sky Raiders dove dropping bombs. We pass close enough to see one as it trailed smoke and flame and went into the ground and awful explosion. I saw parachute and a mayday call came over the radio emergency radio frequency. I called headquarters to tell them I was diverting for a few minutes to help cover the downed v. N a. F. So the Vietnamese air force pilot negative panther, three six permission denied. Proceed direct to Ben hat out. You try it again. Same results. So you saw the north or a South Vietnamese air force pilot gets shot down. Right. And you call back to base and say, I'm going to go cover for this guy. When they try and rescue them and they tell you no right now. So you do what you're told.

Speaker 3:          00:30:34       Yeah. Decisions have kind of bad. I mean, and there's pluses and minuses to that. There. There were guys on the ground at Ben Hat in serious trouble at Ben hit. There were two Vietnamese ranger battalions, so probably four or 500 people at the most, probably for 400 people on the ground at Ben hit with two American advisors. There's two Americans on the ground. They are under attack by elements of two north Vietnamese divisions, which means thousands of infantry with the tanks and artillery, everything attack. And so yeah, they were in dire straights though. I really had hoped we could briefly stop over and help get this uh, Vietnam, Vietnamese air force pilot.

Speaker 1:          00:31:09       It's picked up. Yeah, no, that's a tough decision for command to make. Right. But from my position, I look at it like, okay, the command has a better overall view of the battlefield right now. And if they're telling me to proceed on to Ben Hat. Got It. Even though you obviously, yes,

Speaker 3:          00:31:24       you have a little good. I'm glad you have that perspective because I didn't know that at the time at all. Yeah. Well it's easy for me right now sitting in an air conditioned space with my headset on. Yeah. Um, so much in Vietnam, you know, and warfare is different today and I think things are probably much more planned out and, and, and you go to a, according to a set of rules and procedures more than we did, so many of these combat missions with Cobras and Vietnam and that day and age, we would get launched out of our base and we'd go out and make contact with people. And it was pretty much up to the pilot and command or the air mission commander, uh, to decide where he would go and how he would support and what was the hottest fire on town that, that needed help.

Speaker 3:          00:32:04       Uh, so we always had, some of it was just I guess are pompous attitude too. We always felt we had a better handle on what was happening then the guys in the headquarters that made some of those decisions. Uh, in fact when we first saw tanks, uh, in the area before that battle at tank can on the 24th of April, we saw tanks and reported them back through headquarters and there was a great deal of reluctance on the part of anybody in the headquarter staff to do believe that there were tanks. Uh, there was a guy that, in fact, this is another interesting situation at Vietnam at that time, the senior commander in two core, that area that I was operating in was not a guy.

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       There was a civilian named John Paul van and Mr van made all the decisions now to keep things illegal. He had a two star army general officer working for him. So all military orders came through the army general. But Mr van was making the decisions and the, and when we reported we had seen tanks in mid to mid April. Van Said, Nah, there's not tanks that I fly out there all the time. If there are tanks, I'd have seen him. He said what you guys saw our probably elephants in the jungle. Uh, so that's, that's what we dealt with with uh, with our headquarters. Yeah, that's interesting. They're definitely was when I was in Iraq, there is very tight control over air to ground support, especially in the cities. In Ramadi. It was very difficult to get dropped, bombs dropped. But you know, who had really good decentralized command was the tanks and the tanks that we work with, they would, they would come and they had pretty good control over what I'm talking to tank commander, at least at the company command level.

Speaker 4:          00:33:37       We had some company commanders that would just get after it and they would, would make stuff happen. So we felt really comfortable working with the tankers and in, they supported us over and over and over again. Really, like I said, with a lot of decentralized command, you know, they couldn't, they had to use some, they obviously use discretion, but they had a lot of authority out there, which was, which was great for us, which we did as well, which was really good. So at already, yeah, you left me. I'm going back from, we'd rearm refueled or costume. We're heading back up, were denied permission to deviate over to Polly clang. And, uh, we're, we're getting back into it. Have been at one more time. And now what you're doing when I'm going to pick the story back up here, there's a Huey that's got resupply.

Speaker 4:          00:34:21       So he's got, you know, bullets, probably bullets, water and food maybe at this point, just bullets. And they need to get that gear down to the guys on the ground. Right. The guys on the ground, the base had been pretty much completely overrun. The friendliest had consolidated in a command bunker complex or defensive Duggin positions at the top of the hill, which was their Firebase. Uh, they were, when we got the call to cover that Huey, uh, we were told that the guys on the ground, we're completely out of anti tank ammo and we're almost out of small arms ammunition and could we cover this? You in for the resupply. So here we go. Back to the book. The Huey came into a low hover near the command bunker. The crew kicked out the ammo boxes. The helicopter did a hovering turn and took off.

Speaker 4:          00:35:03       I began a sharp left turn so I could continue shooting suppressive fire for him. The enemy opened up on our two Cobiz with everything they had my view left right and above and below was filled with tracers. Tim fired continuously and Tim was your was him was Tim was my front seat or my copilot gunner in the front seat working that knows to her while I was firing rockets. Tim fired continuously on those firing at us. We took large caliber hits all over the aircraft. 50 ones like I talked about and 14.5 millimeter rounds came through. The cockpit

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       hits from small arms, always felt something like Jiffy pop popcorn popping against it's tin foil cover. These seem like Jack Hammers slamming into the aircraft beginning in the rear, working up the side and then into the cockpit. The tail rotor were shot off and the engine was shot up. Every system on the helicopter was damaged in some way without the tail rotor. The aircraft began to spin. Fuel lines ruptured and we were burning. I keyed the microphone. This is three six taking fire from four o'clock taking fire everywhere, taking fire, taking hits, going down, panther going down the engine quit the rotor. RPM caution. Light flashed. The audio warning sounded announcing got my rotor blades were turning dangerously slow. I slammed the collective down hard to auto rotate under optimal conditions. This is a controlled emergency descent. Under these conditions, I could only hope to lessen the severity of the crash.

Speaker 1:          00:36:36       We corkscrewed down in flames. As I wrestled the aircraft, I radioed my wing man flame, you better get in here and get us out quick. There was no answer. They were fighting for their lives. I learned years later that when I called taking hits, flame had banked his cobra and fired rockets onto the position shooting at me as he did. So a big ugly 51 round came through the cockpit and tore into his chest high on the left side. Bob took the controls and headed for help. Flying from the front seat, microbrew came down, spinning and burning. It hit the ground hard, nose low on the left side. It bounced back into the air, spun another turn and a half and crashed. It's settled nearly upright, firing Gulf, the cockpit.

Speaker 2:          00:37:35       So

Speaker 1:          00:37:39       pilots are known for maintaining their composure. Right. And I, I've, I've heard pilots do it and clearly, you know, you're saying we're taking hits, we're taking fire from everywhere. We're going down path. They're going down.

Speaker 2:          00:37:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:53       Are you so tracking on controlling the aircraft that you're, you're just completely focused on that, that the rest of what's happening is a little bit blocked out or what?

Speaker 2:          00:38:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:07       Are you thinking yourself, I've got to survive this crash? Are you not worried about the fact that when you get on the ground, hey, now I'm going to, we're going to

Speaker 3:          00:38:13       be surrounded by enemy. Yeah, no, none of those thoughts are taking place. As I said in an earlier thing that you read, everyone who's not totally insane is scared and combat, uh, off times. That fear, uh, comes about after the missions are over at the end of the day, when you think back on what she'd been through that day, thank goodness we got to drink alcohol at Vietnam. I don't know how people survive in war today. I really don't. We've got drunk every single night and then went back out the next day and did it again. So there's fear at the end of the day, there's also fear and trepidation, uh, to a degree when you first go, like when I described coming across the hill and seeing what that battle of Ben had looked like, tracer stuff all over the place. I mean, you get butterflies in your stomach and you're anxious, but once you go in on that mission and start those gun runs, it's all, there's, there's, there's no time.

Speaker 3:          00:39:03       There's no mental space for any of that other thought. There was no mental space for that fear. Uh, you just focus on what you have to do and you do it. Uh, and the pull thing, we just ready to get in the shot down though still. I mean, all these years later, I'm sitting here with a red emotional flush and my face reliving this yet, one more time. But no, I don't, I don't recall thinking of anything in those moments. But, but doing that mission, controlling that aircraft, dealing with that emergency situation as best I could and, and going through the whole process, I don't even think there was a thought of life or death or who am I going to make it or not make it or none of that was even there. It was, it's, you do what you have to do and, and get it done. And then when it all settled in and, and, and uh, you know, hit spun, settled in, crashed smoke and flames everywhere the thing begins exploding a then even then there's not time for that fear factor then because then you start dealing with, okay, what do I have to do now to survive this and get out of here?

Speaker 4:          00:40:00       And so your aircraft's on fire and I guess you're not sitting around pondering much when your aircraft is on fire and you're stuck and they're trying to get out. You get hung up while you're getting now by the way. I did. So you, you do get out. You make it away from the bird a little bit and

Speaker 3:          00:40:22       ew. Ew.

Speaker 4:          00:40:24       Ended up getting some distance away. You lost, you lost your wing man. Right? Or he started, you lost your, your um, yeah my, my wing man took the 51 wing minutes, took the 51, but Tim, he got out of the aircraft too and took off in another direction. Now my front seat,

Speaker 3:          00:40:38       Tim Conroy in a Cobra, the, there's two canopies, one for the front seat, one for the back, the front seat canopy opens to the left. The backseat canopy opens to the right. Uh, so we, we hit, we had an inner calm conversation. I said, uh, I don't know. I said, let's get out of this thing. That's, that's good enough for that. And he, Roger that call and uh, and then he got out his way. I got out my way. I Dunno if you had that little vignette of what happened when I was hanging upside down out there. The

Speaker 4:          00:41:05       aircraft. Yeah. That guy was New England to mark mark true hand. The idea of advisor on the ground there. I'll, I'll, I'll go ahead and if you want. Yeah. Inside Ben hat, one of the American advisors, Mark True Hand Watch this get shot down and crash. He saw Tim exit the aircraft. He saw me hanging out of the side of the Cobra head down with my feet, stuck in the cockpit, the helicopter burning. He'd seen a truck driver die in agony in a blazing semi rack years before and it's, he would not

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       let that happen again. He raised the sight of his m 16 rifle to my body as he began to squeeze the trigger to put me out of my misery, a cloud of smoke billowed from the exploding aircraft. It obscured me from his view. When the smoke cleared, I was gone.

Speaker 3:          00:41:54       And that's something that you found out years later? Yeah, he got in touch with me. I got it. He contacted me and said, I think it was a letter and said I was one of the advisors on the ground had been hit when he got shot down. I can give you some information about what happened if you'd like to hear it, if you don't, I understand if you just don't want to even go there. I said, no. Tell me what you know. So he shared that story with me on believable. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:42:16       Okay. So I'm going back to the book. You're, you're, this is the state you're in. The pain in my back was intense. It was broken. The fire had burned the back of my neck. I had lesser burns on my face. My hair was singed. I had pulled a shell fragment out of my ankle. Superficial lacerations covered my face and forehead bleeding badly. I was a mess, but I was motivated. I wanted to get away. I staggered from the crash site and headed southeast towards contem con tomb costume as it was getting dark. I had not gone far. When I heard helicopters approaching cobras came in low shooting and you had your little a strobe and so here we go. I held the light over my head, pointed it toward the aircraft. It flashed a few times. The gunner in the lead Cobra opened up on me with this mini gun. A streamer. Tracers came right at me, which is, this is something we we learned in Iraq as well. When you fire off a strobe, if someone isn't expecting or isn't looking for it, it just looks like muzzle flashing. Anybody that sees it will shoot at it.

Speaker 3:          00:43:24       We had blue covers that we put on them that supposedly change the color of it so it wouldn't look like enemy fire. But no. In fact, I ran into that a front seat or that opened up on my years later at Bentley Hill and a yeah, he shared, he said, yeah, we were out there flying that mission and it sure look like enemy fire. Sorry about that.

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       So here we go. Back to the booker. This is a little bit about your attitude. I was cocksure if anyone can survive this. It was me. I'd been a boy scout though I was one of the trouble makers in my troop. I've learned a lot. I backpacked 65 miles through the mountains in five days and practice survival skills. My troubled youth got me suspended from school a number of times, but it also taught me lessons. I learned a street fight, take care of myself. I had boxed, played football and run track. I majored in forestry, worked cattle ranches, rode broncs in small Rodeos, fought forest fires, worked construction, and was an electrical lineman for southern California Edison.

Speaker 1:          00:44:26       I remembered a little ditty my mother had taught me. The Lord helps those who help themselves. I knew I could depend on its absolute truth to get me through this. The lowered hell helps those who help themselves. God, I'll do that. Do all, I can muster every bit of what's inside me. I'll do my part, I'll do all I can to help myself. So please, please do yours. I need your help. I said it again to myself. Drawing comfort and strength. The Lord helps those who helps themselves. I would repeat it often as I set my mind to doing all I must to survive. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:45:17       This is a, this is interesting going through this at all, this detail again because when I, when I wrote the book, I had to revisit everything in detail. Like I had not done since it happened to me. I had never gone to this depth of reliving those experiences. Um, yeah. And it, uh, it's tough to think back on that. Um, indeed, when I was writing this, I'd share some of the writing with my wife when I come to bed late at night. And after I got a few chapters into this, I told her when I said, Melanie, what am, what am I doing? This whole thing is a series of unfortunate events, uh, who's gonna want to read something like this? And, uh, she told me, so bill, I know the whole story. She said, stick with it, finish this book. Because I think that in it, uh, there's, there's inspiration, there's motivation for, for people.

Speaker 3:          00:46:00       It's not just your story, it can help others. Uh, and so in that vein, I mean, I say that because it is getting a little emotional as we read through this and that's fine. But I do hope that some of this is useful and helpful for others. And, uh, I grew up going to church as a kid, but I wasn't overly overly religious guy. And, uh, somewhere around college I could go into church altogether and in the army, the only time I can remember that I've been going to church was from memorial services for guys. And that was about it. Uh, but if you end up in a situation like this or, or I would say any really, if you think the situation in your life is stressful and is about to overwhelm you, uh, you need some help beyond yourself. And, uh, you know, no matter what you, and I'm not selling any religion, but I would say whatever your religious beliefs are, uh, you can find a lot of strength and your God and, uh, get, get close to God and he'll help you through it. And he certainly, I couldn't have done this by myself. I, I grabbed a hold of that duty that my mom gave me. I also grabbed a hold of the 23rd psalm and when stuff got really close to being blown to smithereens a few times later on in my captivity, that 23rd psalm was going over and over again in my mind too. So yeah, again, not selling any religion, but whatever your spirituality is your best. Get comfortable with it if you're going to be in dire straits like this.

Speaker 1:          00:47:21       Yeah. And it's, it's, it's interesting that you're, you're saying, look, I'm going to do everything I can, but I'm need some. Yep. Yep. And you know, certainly, you know, when you, when you say that other people, you know, we'll be able to find, absolutely. I mean, just me reading this, I've found all kinds of, not just inspiration but practical guidance, which, you know, one of the things you just said is practical guidance on, you know, someone that's been through what you've been through. There's so much that everybody else can take away and learn from and yeah, that's, that's one of them right there. Do what you can do everything that you can and then have some faith on the things that you can't control are going to work out your way.

Speaker 3:          00:48:07       Yeah. And I think that's important too, because I'm thinking now as we're talking, and I don't know if we're going to get to that specific part in, in the book or not. Uh, but early on, I want to, I think it was the first night I got beef, 52 strikes almost landing on top of me. And I'm beginning to feel that, am I going to survive this or not? And I think the answer is I don't know. But in that answer is, I don't know. And so what I mean that, that, that doesn't matter. That's not important. I may survive. I may not survive. I'm going to do all I can to survive. So I got to the point where this fear of being blown to smithereens kind of went away. Uh, and I just settled into, I'll either survive or I won't survive. It's not, I can't worry about that. All I can worry about is what can I do to try and set the best conditions to make that survival possible. And, uh, I either will or I won't.

Speaker 1:          00:48:55       Yeah. One of the similar thing that I always felt was, you know, when I rack, one of the biggest threats to us was iads and you, they're random. They're going to hit you or they're not going to hit you. And when you, every time you go outside the wire, there's, there's a chance that it's your day. And you know, kind of what I told my guys and the way I felt myself was, okay, I know they're out there, we've done everything we can to mitigate the risk. We've done our planning, we'd done our drills, we've gathered our intelligence, there's nothing else we can do to control it. So I'm not going to worry about it. Right. And I've done everything I can. Like you said, I've, I've helped him at myself as much as I can. And then after that it's out of my hands. And in the more you worry about it, like you said, well it does. It does. It really matter. I can sit here and worry about it, but doesn't matter. Got It. Got To move forward. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:49:55       Here's you, you do a couple of days, three days worth of evasion of the enemy and now you're out hiding. You hear some voices, you crouch down your hide, you know their people. And here we go back to the book. A lot of crashing around came from the direction of the voices. I looked up and saw a uniformed NVA soldiers pointing AK 47 rifles at my head. They Shriek, something in motion for me to stand up. I did. I was captured. I felt indescribably sick in the pit of my stomach as the world fell away, I'd been struggling for three days to stay alive. I was in miserable shape, but I had been free and I had options. No more. My soul was a washed with anguish. I was no longer a free man. In that instant, I'd become a captive of the communist North Vietnamese army, a prisoner of war, another American POW in the long Vietnam conflict. I had no idea how long they might let me live or if I was about to die. A couple of them were shaking. We stood in utter silence for a moment. They glared at me. I glared at them for that tense instant. I didn't know if I'd be riddled with bullets or be allowed to live. One barked something at me. I could not understand another joint in than a third. I looked right into their eyes. I was an American. I would show them the best American fighting man that I could

Speaker 3:          00:51:39       in the pitiful state that I was in. Um, you know, that that's the best I could do on describing capture it. It's, it's impossible to really convey the full feeling of losing your freedom and being a captive. It's just indescribable. Uh, but I, I did the, uh, the best that a, that I could, I was in miserable shape. I mean, you read about the wounds that I had. Uh, in addition to those, I picked up some Leeches, uh, that I've been plucking off on my body. Uh, my, my face was covered with blood. My three day growth, the heavy beard was, was sticking through, uh, because of my back injuries that a, I didn't even know that I got released and I had badly broken my back. Uh, I had no control of my bowels or bladder for those three days, so I smelled. I was just an awful mess. When those guys captured me and took me up that hill,

Speaker 1:          00:52:31       they finally get you to sort of like a camp, sort of the first interrogation camper. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:52:37       Yeah. What were the, I mean the capture me, the jumbo so thick, they were only a few yards away when I stumbled upon them and then they, uh, and they had been down a stream filling canteens. These five young guys at captured me and they took me almost an equal distant up a hill opposite and I came into an open area, still had the canopy of the triple canopy jungle. Uh, but the bottom was all open. There are hundreds of north Vietnamese soldiers supplies defensive positions. This was a major staging area for this battle is taking place. And as I was trying to get away from, from the battle and get towards costume, I stumbled right into there

Speaker 1:          00:53:10       staging area and you start getting your, you know, start getting the soft interrogation is what I put down here. A guy says, you know, we found pictures of a pretty later lady with your or your wallet, obviously your family and you say, yeah, I know you miss them and are very worried and they are very worried about you. You follow the rules and you will be home soon, you'll receive humane and lenient treatment, you will be allowed to go home. And I put that in there cause that's a refrain that we hear quite a bit humane and leads.

Speaker 3:          00:53:48       That was, that was a refrain. They would say it all the time. And during my whole captivity. Yeah, you do, you do what you're supposed to do and cooperate. You get the humane and lenient treatment. Of course you

Speaker 1:          00:54:00       warrant fully cooperative at all with them and what they're asking you. So they're there. They went from that idea. So they start stepping it up on you and you know, here's an example of the things that they say do you are a war criminal and the Geneva Geneva agreements do not apply to you. You have no rights. But we will still give you the deserved humane and lenient treatment. All you have to do is cooperate with us and acknowledge your crimes. Yep, Yep.

Speaker 3:          00:54:27       Yeah. That goes back to your reading of the code of conduct that started this off to our code of conduct was different. Uh, said we are, we are bound to give only our name, rank, service number and date of birth and, and the, and the way that was taught and the way we understood it, that was all we could give was name, rank, service number, date of birth. And if we gave anything else, uh, we had uh, we had caved in and we're cooperating with the enemy. Uh, so that was my stance. That was all I was going to give them was my name, rank, service number, date of birth. Uh, you may get into some of the things that that took place. Uh, I would just like to comment that there was nothing heroic going on at all. I guess a couple things that were going on.

Speaker 3:          00:55:05       I was trying to abide by the code of conduct and I was in a state where I had been near death for days, was very near death at that moment. And was numb and just almost didn't care. It's hard to understand and believe, but almost didn't care at that point. And then I got so angry and aggravated with this son of a bitch that ended up being my interrogator from his initial soft sell, as you said, but, but his first words, he showed up, he was only guy had spoken English since I was captured, started asked me about myself by condition if I was hurt. And so I opened up with him about some of that. But then when he got into what was clearly a, an interrogation than I clammed up, uh, W I would close these comments now with, uh, the fact that he didn't break me in.

Speaker 3:          00:55:48       That interrogation, uh, speaks nothing to my heroism or ability to resist interrogation. Anyone can be broken. Uh, and if this would have continued over time, uh, you know, I'm, I'm sure that he could have gotten me to do something, uh, with his brutality. Probably nothing that would have given him any useful intelligence, but he might've got made to do, to do something. Yeah. So I was for that. For that, those moments on those days or that initial interrogation, I was able to stick with my name, rank, service number, date of birth. Awesome. Here, here's an example of that is

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       back to the book here. Please sign this. He handed me one of the sheets of paper and a pen. I looked at the paper. It was typed in English. As I began to read the words, my interrogator interrupted. This is simply a form that acknowledges your status we needed so we can begin to process you for release so we can send word to your family of your status. Please. Just signed. I read the words. I could not believe what I was reading. There was a blank fates place for me to fill in my name. The tech said that I was an American war criminal who had been conducting an illegal acts against the Vietnamese people, including biocide, genocide and eco side. I had dropped fire bombs and chemical bombs. I'd killed old men, pregnant women and babies. Biocide genocide, Eco side. What a bunch of crap.

Speaker 1:          00:57:12       I raised my head and looked into his eyes. No, I will not sign this there. I had spoken, you must. I will not. His agitation return now you must. I glared at him. He got up and came at me. He smacked me across the face. You must. He turned to his sidekick and spoke quietly and the man got up at his direction. Two Guards dragged me up against a tree abroad trunk of a tree. I've been bent over since the crash, unable to stand erect. They forced me up into a straight sitting position and tied me to the tree. It hurt like hell. I couldn't keep my face from contorting in anguish. Now you signed no more orders. They pulled on the ropes to bring my arms closer together behind me. The pain in my back. Increased new pain was introduced in my shoulder joints.

Speaker 1:          00:58:05       More demands to sign more refusals. The ropes tightened further. They move my elbows closer together. More demands more refusals, ropes ever tighter, more pain. I was uncontrollably grimacing and cursing. I would not sign. I could never consider signing anything like that. The brutality made me angrier and more firmly set against giving in. I could have been broken and made design eventually. There's no doubt. No Man can resist forever, but this interrogator would not bring me to breaking point. On that day, his demands continued and so did my refusals. The ropes tightened more and more pain scream through me. My anger swelled against this asshole. I began grunting in audible attack against the agony the guards gave the ropes. One huge last poll, which brought my elbows together behind me. I felt a pop as each shoulder. Dislocated pain shot through my torso, up my neck, into my head and down my back, through my groin and into my thighs. I've never felt such pain. My vision narrowed and I passed out. Sign. I could only grown and shake my head. The interrogators scowled angrily turned and left. We're to continue on.

Speaker 2:          00:59:41       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:59:44       this is a little bit further on and he's saying that he's given you one last chance to sign this paper and one last chance to cooperate. Will you? Going back to the book now my head hung down partly and exhaustion and partly in an intentional rudeness, not paying him any attention. I looked up when he finished, I saw his sadistic minion standing a few yards in front of me holding an AK 47 at the ready. Your last chance?

Speaker 2:          01:00:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:18       The assistant raised the rifle and pointed it at me. I stared ahead and said nothing. No heroism was involved. I was rung out at the end of everything I had to give. I had been so close to death for so long, was so angry and so absolutely drained. A faint spark was all I had left. I felt numb, detached from what was happening. I was not resisting. I was just giving into the flow of whatever was destined to be. That might be deaf. It might not. I had seen army training film at army training film years before showing the mock execution of a Korean War POW. I remembered that scene. The action of the trigger being pulled, went over and over in my mind. Click, click, Click Ben. I flinched as a soldier, jerk the trigger back, but nothing happened. No shot, no loud bang, no bullet ripping my scholar chest, nothing. The soldier laughed. My interrogator smiled. I am done with you. You will be taken away from here.

Speaker 3:          01:01:37       Yeah, that was three days of,

Speaker 2:          01:01:40       yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:01:41       there's three horrible days losing my freedom, going through that interrogation, um,

Speaker 3:          01:01:47       being thrown down into a pit at night is where I stayed. It was one of their old abandoned bunkers. We had about six inches of mud and Goo in the bottom and uh, Eh, and that caused me a big psychological issue that first night closed in that darkness that night. Uh, I really had to fight to just keep my cool down there with a bunch of, there were centipedes and spiders and rats and it was, it was a mess. I'd spend the nights down there and come up in the daytime for interrogation back down in that whole night's backup for interrogation. So what we read cover to pray to three days before he finally gave up on me and yeah, I had no idea what was going to happen. I just, and even thinking back on it, it's just going through all that pretty much and just a numb state, um, with, with, with that treatment. Yeah. My shoulders today still caused me problems. I had a son that ended up playing football for University of Washington many years ago. He's going to turn 50 years, uh, in April. So this was a number of years ago. But yeah, in high school, like I throw about two passes and that was it for my shoulders can't play. You can't play horseshoes or anything, but uh,

Speaker 1:          01:02:53       yeah. You know, so it's something that definitely I've experienced. So doing these readings, and I've talked about it before, that, you know, when I read something in my head and it kind of, I go all of that, that's powerful. But then when you read it aloud and you hear it, it's just, it's even more, and it's the same thing with, you know, I know I sent you Jody medics, the podcast with Jody medical was on. Yeah. And he said the same thing. He, you know, he said to me, he said, you know, when you're reading it, it's like, it's like I'm hearing my own thoughts or something. You know, it just, right. It just, it brought him back and yeah, there's something, there's something about that. It's okay. It's like when it's, when it's, when you're reading it, it's sort of detached from reality or it's one step further detached from reality.

Speaker 1:          01:03:45       And, and obviously sitting in with Jodie sitting here with you and knowing that this is you, you know, one point that I make all the time when I covered these historical books, I always remind people that, cause you know, people in this day and age, we're used to seeing movies. We're used to seeing, watching TV. And I always say that this guy that I'm talking about, this is a person, you know, this guy in World War II, this is a person, this guy in world war one, this is a man and sort of have you sitting here knowing that this is you. It's, it's, I don't even know what to say to describe it.

Speaker 3:          01:04:22       Well thanks Jack O and this, this has become an emotional experience for me, but it's important and I think this is going to be an important podcast. I wrote that book. I finished it. It was published last April.

Speaker 2:          01:04:35       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:04:36       I've not read that book since it was published. Uh, I mean it was something to go through and relive all that to get it written. And, uh, and so it's been almost a year. I haven't, I haven't read the book so we're going into, into, into detail. But, uh, this is, this is good.

Speaker 2:          01:04:55       So

Speaker 1:          01:04:59       do you get turned over to some other, some other guards? Bright and they start taking you on a walk. You're walking to somewhere else in urine. I, you know, you talked about the conditioner. You, by the way, you have a broken, crushed vertebrae at this point,

Speaker 3:          01:05:14       so badly, badly broken back. Uh, yeah. Vertebrae is about completely

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       crush damage to two other verbiage. Your leg swollen and you got all kinds of shoe and now you're, now you've got to walk. And so I'm going out with know that. Yeah, they gave me my boots back after those three days. Materialization, no socks, no laces. Boots. Bare feet. Okay, go ahead. We had a old Vietnam seal when I got to seal team one in 1990 and he would run barefoot all the time. And you know, one day was, hey, hey sir, why you, you know, why you run barefoot? And he says, the first thing that goofs do, you take your shoes, got to have a hard feat. I was like, okay, I guess I'm running barefoot now. I was thinking, because when I showed up at CLT one, I always joke about this, I thought I was going to the Vietnam War in 1991 when I got there, I thought, I'm going to Vietnam now. You know, I was that how you were? But I was a little off, you know, historically. So that's the situation you're in. Going back to the book, they'd been saying a phrase. So as you're marching with these guys, they've been saying a phrase for the past two days that I couldn't understand. I thought it was Vietnamese Gacaca die. As we pushed up the road, they walked behind me poking their rifle barrels into my kidneys, my ribs shouting with increasing urgency, go cook with [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:06:32       And then after a while, for the first time, I understood what they were saying, go quick or die. They had been taught one short phrase in English. It was all they knew and they had pronounced it so poorly that it took me two days to figure it out. I moved as fast as I could, but I was at the end of everything I had. I struggled on and you don't. I'm just noticing this. You're going to reach the end of everything you've had. I mean, you already were there many times. You're going to reach the again, you just reached it. It's, it's

Speaker 2:          01:07:06       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:07       Incredible. It's an amazing thing about human beings. What we have inside that we can dig down and grab a hold of one. We have two that we don't think we ever could have done it, but it's there and here is something that helps you. Back to the book. I found myself mentally reciting what I could recall of the 23rd psalm. I repeated one line over and over in my head. Yea though I walk through the Valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me. That wasn't the only time during my captivity that the 23rd psalm came to my lips. Nope.

Speaker 2:          01:07:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:53       After it in, please forgive me for like I already covered three days of misery. Now we're talking about, and I'm doing it in three minutes now you've walked for multiple days suffering the whole time and I'm going to fast forward through it and I'm sorry and no, it's fine. I mean, that's why people need to read by the book. That's all there. So you arrive at a camp. Now we arrived back to the book. We stopped in front of one cage and the door opened. A guard pushed me in and I stumbled over someone lying inside and fell tumbling into the ground. Pain shot through me. The cage was about 12 feet wide and 20 feet or so long. I could not have been more than four feet high. 26 prisoners were stuffed inside all south Vietnamese soldiers. Heat hung in the cage, heavy and stale. The air smelled of filth and putrid wounds. People moaned in a constant doe rumble. The occasional whale was met with sharp chachas and guard guarded whispers. The doorway was shut and secured. I lay there thankful I'd survive the journey of the past three days. What would become of me now.

Speaker 3:          01:09:14       Yeah. That was my first, that was my first prison camp. Uh, the jungle camp was in the jumble figure somewhere in northern Cambodia where the US was not operating anymore and it was a, a camp of, of many cages are about 300 prisoners in that camp. All South Vietnamese that have been captured in this offensive one other American who I would meet later. And uh, yeah, putting one of those cages

Speaker 1:          01:09:39       back to the book. My broken back screamed every time I tried to lay down, try to lie down with my feet in the stocks. So they'd put your feet into stocks, wooden bamboo stocks. There was no way I could lay on my side. I couldn't lay straight back. So I sat upright in the dark in agony. I thought of my family, fought of my day of where I'd been, where I was now, and what might lie ahead. I heard badly still, I had hope I can live this way. I can do this. I can survive, I will survive. I sat there, thoughts drifting across the landscape of my life, shaped by these extraordinary circumstances. Eventually I fell asleep sitting up right that night, dreaming of what might become of me. I jolted awake, something scampered across my legs. Something was on my feet, something small, cool and wet. Touched my arches and souls. Little rat noses poked and sniffed at my feet. Tiny teeth nod, my pulverized, raw flesh. My arms swung without command. As I batted a large rat off my lap. Others scurried away. I screamed inside. Lips pressed tightly shut, a muffled. The Shriek of terror. I thrashed my legs, flailed, but went nowhere. I wiggled my feet as well as I could in the socks and got the rats off. They fled into the night only to when I fell back asleep, they would return to torment me nearly every night in that jungle prison.

Speaker 3:          01:11:22       Yeah. I don't like rats this day. Uh, some of my kids just to mess with me. I'll just bring up rats. As I mentioned, a rat's I hate. I hate rats from, from that experience. And that's not the beginning or the end of the rat experiences and in prison. One thing that you did mention though that I'd like to highlight is, is hope. Uh, there was a phrase in there that I wasn't going to give up. Hope. Hope is such a powerful thing. Uh, it's there for all of us. Uh, we just need to grab a hold of it and hold it tightly. Uh, hope was all I had for much of my time in captivity, a hope of, of, uh, of surviving a and in that survival of getting back to my two young kids, those two kids really played such a role in having me survive. My son, when I went over there was a four and a half years old. The over for my daughter was newborn. Uh, but when things would get really, really tough, I think of those kids and however bad it was, I had to endure it, uh, to do my best to survive and, and get home to those kids.

Speaker 2:          01:12:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:12:33       Yeah. The, the I, I definitely, that's one of the things that I specifically highlighted, you know, was, I can live this way. I can do this. I can survive. I will survive. I still, I had hope. Yeah, and I read it just the way you just explained it. It hit me that hard. Back to the book. We sat for a few more hours. My cage mates, all Vietnamese soldiers appear to rag tag crew. Almost everyone had been wounded, some gravely filth covered there. Tattered uniforms. The whole place stunk of sweat, blood, infection, feces and urine. We were all hurting and some would dye. Some cautiously whisper to their neighbor. Most like me just sat and stared. That's what I did. I sat and stared at them sitting and staring at nothing. I wondered if I would go crazy here, would I die here? What would happen first? Insanity or death.

Speaker 2:          01:13:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:13:34       I snapped back to what little grasp by hat on reality. Hold it together. Focus. Spence and Vicky will hike. We'll play. Get back home for those kids. You can do it. You can endure.

Speaker 2:          01:13:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:13:50       I couldn't allow my thoughts to drift and dark directions. I forced myself into logical, structured thinking. I began planning a hiking trip with my family, uh, bactrim backing trip into the woods. I plan the route, the equipment loads for each. They'd be Featherlite for Vicky a little more for Spence. Amy. I'd carry most

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       of it. We'd eat dehydrated food, cooked around a small campfire. Delicious. I'll tell you. Dehydrated food then sounded awfully, awfully. Yeah, that was, that was a gourmet meal. And, and I did that. I got back from my captivity. I spent some men, maybe we'll go into this later and I won't get all the details of hospitalization and medical and all that. But when I got released from the hospital finally, uh, took my family on vacation and he guesses on what the first thing I did on that vacation, tell me, drove to the Olympic peninsula and took my family backpacking. Uh, your heart, man. I love and I'm glad that I did. I mean, I always enjoyed the wilderness in the woods and would've been a much worse shape in captivity if I, if I hadn't. Uh, but since then, I've, I've loved the wilderness in the woods even more.

Speaker 3:          01:15:06       I mean, I love every day, every beautiful day on God's green earth, but loved the wilderness in the woods. We were assigned a Panama for a time. I don't know if you've been down there and general school. And when, one thing, my, my older son, the little four and a half year old boy was a, was an adult by then, uh, we backpacked, well, we did a three day journey across the isthmus of Panama somewhere where nobody ever did. We just pick some place, went from the Atlantic or the Pacific side. Uh, we did mountain bikes first, then we backpacked staying in the jungle and until we got to the Rio Indio, uh, and it was dry season, winter planted very well cause we had to hike way down the Rio Indio before there was enough water to hire a guy in a car. You get canoe to take us out to the ocean.

Speaker 3:          01:15:44       So I, you know, even, and that was just before my retirement, but I, I've always loved the wilderness, love the jungle. And, uh, yeah, I don't know how we got on that thing, but okay. Back back to the book. Well that's awesome. And one of the things that I, again, I specifically highlighted was the fact that you know, you, you, you would be drifting in these dark directions and you would force yourself. And I talk about that too. You know, I, I say mind control, not mind control. Like, Hey, we're going to control your mind. Control your own mind. Yeah. And put your own thoughts in there. Yup. You can do that and people just need to learn how to do it instead of we, you start drifting off in the wrong direction, control your thoughts, get mind control. And I love the fact that you did that we such with such authority and power over what, over what your brain was thinking.

Speaker 3:          01:16:30       Yeah. I think that's an important message. And I was a much overused phrase. Are you a half glass, half empty or glass half full kind of guy? Uh, I, I really would advocate for you have to be a glass half full kind of guy to survive. And I think I might carry that argument further. If you want to have a happy, full, enjoyable life, you'd damn well better be a half glass full kind of person. Uh, if you're, if I mean there's enough problems and difficulties in life, if you want to go for the dark side, it's, it's there. You can go to it. Uh, but there's enough positive, wonderful things. Uh, the, yeah, grab that beat of hope and, and go for it. Absolutely. Back into the

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       camp and back to the book, the camp provided a miserable existence on the edge of madness. All was filth and disease and suffering. Moans and whales of pain and anguish cried from the enclosures as we walked by, I caught glimpses of sick and wounded men inside cage after cage, their eyes, white orbs of desperation, peering from grimy faces through the din of the gray world inside and now you're back in the stocks sitting there, wounded in stocks and a bamboo cage and an unknown jungle prison camp with death all around me. I began to wonder, how long can I endure this? Then my voice said out loud. As long as it takes.

Speaker 5:          01:17:58       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:18:01       Incredible. And here you meet that and in this prison Cape you meet Wayne. Wayne.

Speaker 3:          01:18:08       Wait, finished. Yeah. The other American who was held prisoner already been captured march, April, May, a couple months before me.

Speaker 1:          01:18:16       And you, Wayne, the crew now you're going to get put on a long march. The, they say we're going to move you out of this prison camp. Do you know you're going to Hanoi?

Speaker 3:          01:18:27       No, no. They, they, they put, they pulled me out of my cage and I found myself in the center of the camp with a group of 25 south Vietnamese prisoners. Uh, I think they were all, they were all officers, uh, myself and Wayne. Uh, and they told us they were going to move us to a new camp and the, and the communist camp commander, it was running at the mouth and one of the South Vietnamese officers was translating for us, but they're going to move us to a new camp. Uh, work conditions would, we'd be up, would be better. I mean, in this camp, people were dying almost every, every day. Uh, conditions be better. We get medical care, we'd get letters from home. Uh, but we have very difficult journey. It could last for as long as 11 days and we should try very hard to make it.

Speaker 3:          01:19:07       That's what we were told. Now the tribe very hard. The 11 days I guess was registering in my mind that try very hard to make, it really didn't fully register until we actually set out marching. By this time my ankle wound was very infected. My leg was very swollen. It was so painful just to take a step. And you know, I was having to take step after step after step. And as I got into that March, I was wondering how I was going to get through the first day. I didn't think I could do it. I didn't know how I could possibly walk for a day through the jungle. Uh, they, uh, they had as tied loosely together, uh, had our arms tied Lusa behind our backs, no shoes as time. This was barefoot and off we went. Uh, somehow I made it through that first day and the day after that.

Speaker 5:          01:19:49       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:19:50       And the day after that, the trip turned out to be not 11 days to a new camp somewhere in Cambodia or even Laos or back into Vietnam. That trip took over three months. Uh, and I did end up in Hanoi at the end of that trip. Uh, that journey cost the lives

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       of a, of six of the south Vietnamese prisoners in Wayne. The other American died, uh, before we got to Hanoi. And I damn near died a number of times and that's all in the book. But by the grace of God, I survived and made it and got all the way to Hawaii. He also got to know some of the Vietnamese south Vietnamese soldiers, one of them, Lieutenant Dwayne Dean Zan. Is that right? Yeah. That's very good son, son, son. And he was, you know, obviously you, you formed a really good relationship with him. Yes. Here we go. Back to the book we charge. Yes. Let me interject one. Let me interject one thing. Cause this is fascinating to me. It's always been why are, well I'll come back to it. Let me see where you're going to go with the conversation. You're going to get to my relationship with him and yeah. Okay, good. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 4:          01:21:08       We trudged out of the valley up on to a rising ridge line. There wasn't much talking. When we began to climb up with steep long trail, I was already exhausted. I had to push hard to make every step my swollen infected ankle throbbed with pain. I wondered, is anyone else having this much trouble? How long am I be able to keep going? Only then did the words of the lead guard really hit me as long as 11 days try very hard to make it my being revolted. My being revolted. 11 days of this, how the hell am I going to be able to do that in two seconds? I answered. Got To as long as it takes reach down deep gotta go. Keep going. God helped me. Wayne was stoic. He was in better shape than I was, but still it had to be tough for him.

Speaker 4:          01:22:00       He just bore down and put out what was needed to keep on going. Some of the other person's nurse did as well. Many like me had trouble, a number of complained and a few cried. Other prisoners paraded them. A couple of them fell down and whimpered and the guards yelled at them slapping, kicking and hitting them with rifle butts until they got up. I thought this is going to be a long 11 days and this is just continuing way past 11 days. You're now just beyond that. Continuing with the story. As the days continued, I became weaker and lost weight. Fevers followed waves of shivering. Chills might be malaria. I suffered from diarrhea, probably dysentery. My festering ankle wound hurt more. The swelling grew worse, aggravated by the journey. Leeches plagued me, sucking my blood and adding infections of their own. My right leg became a heavy, painful mass that I dragged along the trail. I must've been a site though. My Moo wounds placed me in a worst

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       situation. Wayne was sick and deteriorating too. He had some sort of jungle fever and lost his appetite. He quit eating regular rice preferred only the crispy layer that formed right next to the surface, the cooking pot. What the Vietnamese called Calm Che or Fireeye's. Zhan was having troubles to injuries from his shoot down, declined from months in captivity, poor diet disease than the daily toll of this horrendous marsh north. Every step of the way, our personal demons threatened our physical ability and mental willingness to press on. Everyone suffered. We look like the walking dead struggling to survive each agonizing mile of that march. Most of us stoically face the challenges that beset us. Sometimes selfishness and self pity erupted and tempers flared. Pain and suffering took its toll. The senior ranking prisoner and our group was Pham Van thousand a major in the South Vietnamese army. He tried his best to be a leader for the 25 south Vietnamese officers and two American helicopter pilots under the most trying conditions. The enemy gave him no authority to lead. I had a lot of respect for what Tom tried to do. I felt the frustration he had to endure. Morale sunk lower and lower. Bickering grew rampant. Prisoners died. Don was senior, but most dismissed his efforts as they struggled to survive.

Speaker 2:          01:24:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:24:38       And now there's a prisoner that goes down on the trail. The guards yelled back and forth at each other. They ranted at the prisoner lying on the ground. They barked orders to the rest of us. I didn't understand any of it. Zhan said softly, but earnestly to Wayne in me. Keep walking. No stop. We continued. One guard stayed with the prostate prisoner where he lay, we walked on after a short while,

Speaker 2:          01:25:05       Bang,

Speaker 1:          01:25:06       one shot. Sometime later, the guard guard caught up. Adult sense of disbelief and shock overcame me. I had no doubt what had just happened. I kept walking as I cried. It was clear. If you could not march,

Speaker 2:          01:25:29       you would die.

Speaker 3:          01:25:33       Yeah. And that message really settled into my mind at that point. And I knew if I ever got to the point where I couldn't march anymore, that would probably happen to me as well. The aside that I wanted to say about sung, uh, was, and it was mentioned song was a Vietnamese air force pilot. Uh, he was young and strong and in my mind he was a lot bigger than he was because he's still a short statured Vietnamese. He was the [inaudible] pilot that I saw shot down on my way to Ben hit that I asked for permission to go help rescue. Yeah. We put that together shortly after we started that March north of, you know what he was flying where he was when he was shot down. I said, my God, we were shot down the same day. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:26:20       Yeah. And that's why, that's one of the reasons I included that piece because that was such a, such a coincidence or fate that you guys were, that was in there. You were,

Speaker 3:          01:26:31       and he turned out to be such a good friend and I, oh my. Well, I owe my life to several people. Wayne Finch, uh, [inaudible] especially for what he did for me,

Speaker 1:          01:26:44       back to the book, the journey was a nightmare, a horrid soul wrenching nightmare. It grew worse. Others fell out and died each step everyday racked my body with pain. My infections became worse. Disease was taking me. I knew I was sliding closer to death, but I kept fighting as hard as I could to keep my spirits up. I continually thought, continuously thought of my family of things I would do with Spencer and Vicky when I got home. Thinking of those two kids gave me strength, always bolstered my hope. My leg was now swollen to twice its normal size. Dark colored filled with pos, long splits formed in the skin plus and bloody stinking fluid oozed from the cracks. I dragged it along like a sodden club. Every movement, every movement lashed me with searing pain that kept my face contorted. I shrieked a silent cry within pain burden to black and scarred.

Speaker 1:          01:27:43       Deep in the center of my soul. Gangrene set in my bloody dysentery worsened. I had chills and fevers. I would find out later that I had three different kinds of malaria each morning I fought a battle to stand and with all that going on, I tried to maintain a sense of humor. It was hard, but it was necessary. Spirit is the most important factor in survival. A sense of human humor, even under the worst conditions helps maintain spirit and in spirit lives. Hope I was determined to survive. Still, I owed so much to Wayne and Zam. They helped me during the through the worst and we're always concerned about me. They did all they could to help me. Zhan especially helped me remain positive to be hopeful, as bad as things ever got. I never gave up hope. I mustered all my will each day just to wake, stand and take a step.

Speaker 1:          01:28:51       Then I fought hard for the remainder of the day to keep going. Moving along the trail, I could barely walk, but somehow I did. I survived each day to open my eyes in the morning to the gift of one more dawn. The realities of my miserable world, we're clear DEF are constant. Companions stalked us, waiting for us to give into its relentless temptation. That would be the easy thing to do. In normal life, you have to take some overt action to die. You have to kill yourself as a prisoner of war. Under these circumstances that is reversed. You have to reach deep within yourself and struggle each day to stay alive.

Speaker 4:          01:29:39       Dying is easy. Just relax, do nothing, give up and peacefully surrender,

Speaker 1:          01:29:49       stop gagging down food, stop struggling to walk, stop fighting, then you will die.

Speaker 2:          01:29:58       Many did.

Speaker 4:          01:30:03       So that's an incredible paradox that you point out there. Yeah. But it's, it's something that I, that I saw because it is, I mean, if you give up then you just die. You stop eating and you die. It's hard to stay alive and you need something to motivate you to stay alive. And I had it. I mean, I can't talk enough about those two kids and when they, when they listen to this, uh, yeah, it's uh, it's often hard to keep from getting very emotional, but uh, those two little kids are probably the single most important reason that I, that I survived along with a lot of other, other things that helped you in that little four years. Four and a half year old boy will celebrate his 50th birthday in April and you'll be there with them. I, yeah, yeah, yeah. Beautiful.

Speaker 2:          01:31:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:31:02       I think we're getting to the low point here. The worst day of my life came a few weeks into this trip. I fought hard to continue the march, but I faltered. I dug deep inside myself for strength.

Speaker 4:          01:31:13       There was nothing there. I dug deep.

Speaker 1:          01:31:16       I staggered on and faltered again. I struggled more. I reach deeper, yet I prayed for more strength. There was none.

Speaker 2:          01:31:27       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:31:28       I collapsed. I got up and stumbled along. I collapsed again and again and I got up again and again. I fought, fought with all I had in my body, heart and soul. I collapsed and couldn't get up. I could not. We'll myself up. I was at the end of my life. The guard looked down on me. He ordered me up. He yelled at me. I could not. It was done. I knew my life was here on this miserable, muddy jungle trail. It was over.

Speaker 2:          01:32:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:32:07       Would my family ever know what had happened to me? Then? Zhan was there looking, worried, bending over me. The guard yelled at him to stop. Undeterred Zhan reached down to help me. The guard yelled louder, but zones face was set with the termination. In spite of whatever threats the guard was screaming. Zhan raised me up, turned and pulled me onto his frail weak back. He wrapped my arms around his neck and class my risk together in front of him the rest of the day. He pulled me along my feet dragging on the ground behind. Part of the time he was helped by Lieutenant Hoang, knowingly a big ambitious brute helped briefly, but it was on on who carried the burden that day. It was on who risked his own life to lift me from def. It was on who carried me and cared for me until we completed that long days struggle had another wayside camp.

Speaker 3:          01:33:13       Yeah, I definitely owe him my life. Absolutely. Absolutely. You end up falling into a river as well. Yeah. That's the next day when we tried to set out and I couldn't get back up. I remember my ankle wound was so infected I could barely move that leg and yeah, three kinds of malaria dysentery. Then three kinds of intestinal parasites, malabsorption syndrome. I was just a bad, bad way.

Speaker 2:          01:33:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:33:45       You fall into this river back to the book. Zohn and Wayne came off the log and down behind Steepbank to my rescue. They waded into the turret, pulled me back onto the bank with Wayne shouting in English and on and Vietnamese. They pleaded for the group to stay at the camp until I was able to travel again. They were ordered away. They wouldn't leave me. Guards dragged them away and force them across the log bridge at gunpoint. They marched off with the rest of our prisoner group. Everyone believed I was left at that camp, the die. So you get left by that group? I do. And you go to another camp where they kind of let you recover a little bit?

Speaker 3:          01:34:25       Yeah. Well I actually stayed in that camp and for some reason the decision was because I hadn't had any medical treatment to that point at all for, for for months. Uh, and at that camp with me laid up there, they've got the camp medic and came over and I got some shots of penicillin. Uh, I, I guess the only reason for this, the decision was we were along the trail and head north and they wanted to get me to annoy if at all possible. So they did give me penicillin shots for about five days running and as soon as I could stand up again and put any weight on my leg at all, then off, off we went back on the trail and now you're on the trail to be, you were the one guard at this point, 1,000,001 guard going north yet suit duties.

Speaker 1:          01:35:09       You too, and you're again, you're hiking again, challenging terrain and going back to the book, we continue day after day after miserable day, the journey was taking its toll, stretching my will to press on again. It's like you just keep getting to the bottom and finding more unbelievable. Each day's trek demanded more than I thought I had to give. I was able to go on only by scraping up the few remaining bits of grit that remained in the most obscure recesses of my heart and soul. I prayed, I commanded, I willed myself to take step after impossible step. That effort itself, fed in agony festering within me, which swelled and nod at my core as weak, followed wretched week. Malaria tax and bouts of bloody dysentery tortured me. The pain of my broken back pierced me every day. The soles of my feet were mosaics of raised welts and open bleeding, dashes and punctures. Previously broken toes throb as I broke them again. And as always there was the pesky leash leeches, but I was still alive and for that I thank God.

Speaker 2:          01:36:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:36:30       And not only did you think God,

Speaker 3:          01:36:35       you also still tried to escape in that state? That was one of the stupidest things I did in my entire captive. There'll be yes. I, you know, I had that in the code of conduct, escape, escape, escape. And we had planned even in that first jungle camp, uh, had planned on escape from there with Wayne. Uh, but it was because of my poor condition that Wayne said, let's, we're going gonna wait till you get some strength or this isn't going to work. And then of course I took us off on the, on the trip that Wayne didn't survive. Uh, but yeah, so the day that I'd finally did, I may have an opportunity, you mentioned I was with one guard. We'd often travel with groups of other groups in north Vietnamese is going up and down the trail and we were traveling with one such group this day.

Speaker 3:          01:37:14       And uh, I don't know where you're going to pick up the stories. You can tell. Just tell him. I'll tell part. So, uh, my guard zoo is talking to some other North Vietnamese guy and they left and I, we're all in a big group and so they fall behind and I'm still with the main group, but I'm just kind of slowing down in the group was moving away from me and I came around one turn in the trail, one corner, no Jew behind me, no group in front of me. So just in that instant I said, this is my chance. And plus I knew about where we were near the demilitarized zone and we were only several miles from the coast. So that's in the back of my mind. I think I could make it so I just took off the trail and headed up the side of a hill with my great escape, which only lasted for a very

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       few Mo. I don't even know the last two minutes, but a very few, few moments before I was recaptured. Where are you going to read some of that? Yeah, this is what happened. You do get recaptured. Here's your thoughts. I'm dead. It's all over. The zoo hovered over me. His Ak 47 muscles shifting from the center of my face to the middle of my chest. He shrieked you. You. Why you? His face burned red. His eyes wild and rage spit sprayed as he screamed at me. This is it. His fingers on the trigger. He's going to kill me and then you, I missed the trail. I got lost. He didn't shoot. He pointed his rifle away in a solid voice. He commanded. Get up. You do very bad. You have big problem now. He was shaking it raged. He motioned down the hill and said, go.

Speaker 5:          01:38:42       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:38:42       Nothing more than it was ever done to me. Never heard about the incident again. My psychological assessment is, uh, he was so embarrassed and would have been in so much trouble. Worried, I think. Yeah. Well, how'd you lose your principal? I was talking to some guy on emotion. He's just like, you know what, we're just going to cover that one out. Yeah, he was, you know, out of all the guards that I encountered, he was about the worst, the meanest despise me the most, I think of almost anyone that I encountered. And lucky me, I get stuck with him being my one single guard, that it was moving me after I got sick. Was He with you with that original group and then he stayed with you with your back? What? I've got to that first jungle camp, living in the cages, he was our interrogator there.

Speaker 4:          01:39:24       I almost actually felt sorry for the guy. His alias was so bad. It was as bad as my high school level. Spanish was. I mean, he just could barely speak English and he's trying to, terra gator some propagandize this and all this. But yeah, so he was the only guard, the really spoken in English at all. So when I, when I had to be separated from the group, they, they assigned him to be the one to stay back with me and move me Norris. And now again, fast forward, you're now on a truck. You're, you're now moving in vehicles. Okay. We got into north, we have walked all the way up across the north or to the north Vietnamese border on foot. So we're all the way just north of the demilitarized zone at this point. Uh, and then they put us on trucks to move us into north Vietnam.

Speaker 4:          01:40:08       And inside North Vietnam we'd some nights move and trucks, some days and nights would, would, would march, depending on the threat from American airstrikes. And of course the trucks are these old Soviet era things with no shocks. And by the way, you have a broken back at this point. And it's not like the roads in north Vietnam or in any kind of condition. So when we first got on the trucks, I mean after all this death, March north mind my, my attitude was haul trucks. This is wonderful. God, thank God. And got on the bed of that truck. It took about a minute and a half of driving down the road and that truck with no shocks, no springs slam, slam slam to uh, yeah and you literally had a broken back at this point. I literally had a broken back and, and of course, as you said, I think you described this to your wife as series of unfortunate events.

Speaker 4:          01:40:55       So yes, now you're out there and you see a flare in the sky. You recognize immediately, you know what's coming. You know, it's in his first two are flying Mohawks up off the coast. We would pick up targets on radar at night of the convoys moving along highway one inside North Vietnam and we turn it over to f four fighter jets from the four 92nd 97th, a fighter wing out of Thailand. And they were called the night fighters and they'd drop flares and then strike the target. So yes, I knew exactly what was taking place. So you yell out air strike. And then here we go back to the book, the first f four screamed down from altitude and bombs exploded nearby. And v I, N. T. O. N. V, a antiaircraft fire responded the next f four screeched toward us. More bombs, more anti aircraft. I began repeating the Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. Yea though I walk through the Valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me, for Thou art with me. Good God. The earth shook. Our truck banged about as if an earthquake soldiers yelled from other trucks, system were hit, the world shuttered and explosions and flames than it was done.

Speaker 4:          01:42:11       That was our first,

Speaker 4:          01:42:14       yeah. First or second night on trucks after we got into north Vietnam. Yes. So not only did I have the unpleasant bouncing around, that was extremely painful. All, sorry, I think I mentioned that book. Got a horrible case of heartburn at night too, is I got all this sour belts is going on and a, and then we got that, uh, that airstrike. And again, that wasn't the first or last airstrike that I experienced, but that was pretty horrific. And they hit some of the vehicles that we're going to do some of the Vietnamese soldiers now. Yeah. And I was by, at this point when I got right to the border, just pouring out of the trucks, I was married up with a second group of South Vietnamese prisoners, senior officer's south Vietnamese prisoner. So our group of prisoners was on one truck. But yeah, other trucks in a convoy got hit and people killed. And Luckily we didn't.

Speaker 4:          01:43:00       Now you get into another camp, and I'm going back to the book. The guards took us to a small hut with posts and enough to tie our hammocks a fast in the door shut in place, local militia guards outside. We settled in getting comfortable and arresting the door opened. A guard came in and said something, a South Vietnamese prisoner enter behind him. Lieutenant Hoang. My God, I knew it was Wayne who had died in this camp. Captain Wayne Finch. Wayne was dead. My God hung, stared as if at a ghost. Astounded to see me alive. He cried. I sat slump devastated at the realization that Wayne Finch was dead. My friend Wayne, who had helped me, cared for me. My friend Wayne, who I owed so much, he was dead.

Speaker 5:          01:43:52       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:43:54       Shocked. Disbelieving I introduced, hung to the others. He told us how everyone thought I was dead. How the group suffered on the march north after they left me, how to tall American pilots, join them. How Wayne continued to get sicker, lost hope, and grew week. I fell into sadness, twisting it into melancholy, self pity, sinking to the lowest point I had. No.

Speaker 5:          01:44:22       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:44:25       And that had to be to be devastating.

Speaker 3:          01:44:27       It, it was, you know, we had been separated and when I got to this camp with the new group of, of South Vietnamese, uh, when we arrived at the camp, the camp commander gave a speech and I could hear him say, Finn Finn in the south, one of the South Vietnamese officers translate for me. He said, do you know of a Finn? There was an American fin that died in this camp. And I said, no, I don't know any Finn. Uh, but what I did, what I should have put together with the bad pronunciation was finished and hung had been one of the guys helped drag me through the jungle with, with the sun. And as soon as I saw hung, I knew that, uh, that it was, it was fenced. Yeah. They took me to see the grave where he was, where he was buried. And, and at least that rough idea of where we were helped me when I came back to it in my debriefs to, to get that location to the Americans that eventually it took a few years, for several years, Williams' body was, was recovered and brought back. But that was, that was a low morale point for me on the trip. That was, that was devastating. You going to go into the potato story? No. Tell the potato store. Okay. I'll tell the potatoes because this is another guy there, there, there two Vietnamese. I mean a lot of people help me

Speaker 4:          01:45:32       all equal. I survive. Yeah. Tell him, tell him potato story and then I'll wrap it up for you cause yeah, tell the potato story. Okay. How are we doing? How are we doing on time? We're just going on and on and on. We're good. All right. Um, song, it all, it helped

Speaker 3:          01:45:44       me as we already do described, but in the second group of prisoners a, I came to know a one, uh, lieutenant colonel, Cane Yam, uh, who today lives in San Jose, California. Still a dear friend. But Kay, when he was captured a had a gold cross pen, I mean, real goals. It was a very valuable pin. When he was captured, he hit it in the lining of his, of his uniform and he was going to trade it for something for his own benefit. When, when he got to wherever he was going to get to. So I'm in the state that you've described. I'm just physically a wreck now. Emotionally, mentally in a low, uh, were being held at a, at a hut. There's a local militia guy guarding it outside. K goes to the wall, a thatched wall and talks to the guy and I see him hand his pen out to the guy and the guy disappears.

Speaker 3:          01:46:28       Couple hours later, the guy returns with a small bag and passes it in the bag were six potatoes. So Kay had traded his valuable crop. Gold cross pen for six potatoes, had a potato cooked each day for the next six days for me. And I ate it.K wouldn't take any potatoes. None of the other Vietnamese senior officers would take any of the potato. They were from me. And just, I mean, both the physical strength the potatoes gave me, but even more importantly, just the mental lift that, that his sacrifice a gay from a really brought me out of my, uh, out of my doldrums there. And, and, and gave me the spirit to go on. Unbelievable.

Speaker 1:          01:47:10       The, uh, one more thing that happens with Kay. You're, you're getting ready to leave the camp to go to a new camp, right? And K tap my arm. Look, he said the curious militia guard had been so interested in learning about South Vietnam and America. Who'd fetched my potatoes? Stood there looking like a kid with a new puppy. He came close to the truck and I lean against the state. Decide,

Speaker 2:          01:47:35       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:47:35       goodbye. He said, grinning is simple. Humanity made me smile and I said goodbye. Case on my astonishment. He wants to learn to say goodbye to you when you leave. I teach him. He good man. Yes. I thought,

Speaker 2:          01:47:53       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:47:53       No doubt he is. There are good men everywhere. It's the governments, the systems, the leaders that are bad. It's communism. That sucks. Not The people of North Vietnam. They are not so different from the south. Not so different from me.

Speaker 3:          01:48:15       I learned a lot of lessons on this trip. Um, I learned a lot of lessons about humanity and people and I do honestly believe we are all God's children. Know you. And I had the good fortune to be born where we were born in this wonderful country of ours. Uh, others have had the not so good fortune a bi came across good people in, in Vietnam. Uh, and he though he was my enemy, uh, was, was one. Sometimes people ask me if I, if I have any hatred for those guys and the treatment that I got and I, and I, and I don't, uh, I don't, uh, I think they were human beings, not so different than you and me. Uh, they had their, their news controlled by their government, their propaganda. Plus they were suffering airstrikes and everything else. They behave the way that they, they behaved. I guess the one guy is still don't care much for it. Was it sue? But we'd probably get over it if I ever, if I ever met the guy. Uh, so no, I don't, I don't have any hatred. They're, uh, they're just people like, like uni.

Speaker 1:          01:49:19       And there was even times, I mean, where you're walking through a village and now you're in north Vietnam where what you're just talking about, they'd been bombed. They lost their sons and they're trying to basically attack you to throw rocks at you. Right. And the guys that are guarding you actually, I don't think they shot at them, but they fired me over there and shot over their heads to to protect you all. Yes. Which I've found to be.

Speaker 3:          01:49:41       Yeah. My south Vietnamese friends, I mean you'll talk to people who have experienced in the Vietnam war and you get all kinds of different opinions of the South Vietnamese and good, worthless, whatever. And, and they have are all all varieties like we are, there are some that fought valiantly bravely like the guys at Firebase, Charlie, uh, the people that I was with is a prisoner of war. War were great human beings. And when we get attacked, yeah, the first thing they put me at, they've, that the communist guards, it's took me in the middle but then the south Vietnamese willingly with foreign perimeters around me and then the guards are on the outside firing is necessary. Alta

Speaker 1:          01:50:14       to protect me. One time going back to book, the Guard starts screaming, be nom. Hey, be nom hey and bottom line, bottom high, bottom high them,

Speaker 3:          01:50:27       which leads me is Bobby numb five high too.

Speaker 1:          01:50:32       And for those of you that don't translate that real quick, that's be 52 the bombs dropped. Hundreds of bombs fell are all around us. Big bombs nearly on top of us. I knew there was little chance of living through a B 52 struck, but by the grace of God, no bombs fell in our creator. The earth trembled at shook. It ruptured and heaved. Waves of crushing pressure blasted through a squeezing, hurting my head and ears. The suffocating pressure was painful, awful, frightening. It stopped all was cry it. I was dead. I knew it. I felt ringing in my years, throbbing in my head. I must be alive next to me. The officer's sat up unholstered his pistol. By the way, you'd be the guy drawn his pistol and held it to your head.

Speaker 3:          01:51:18       You made sure he does rescue during the beef. 52 straight. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:51:22       Kay was moving. Oh, there's began sitting up days but alive. No one could hear, no one spoke. We crawled out of the hole and started walking and direction. We'd been traveling.

Speaker 3:          01:51:33       Yeah, this was in, in north Vietnam. We'd come upon an area of a lot of bomb craters had been bombed frequently. And then, uh, the enemy shot to anti aircraft rounds. That seemed to be their signal. Two rounds was a, uh, was an airstrike. And then the other started shouting bottom high and all hell broke loose upon us.

Speaker 1:          01:51:51       Now you get to Hanoi, right? And you get a bed. A board. Okay. Board. There's a blanket though. There was a blanket. It gets cold in heaven and French bread.

Speaker 3:          01:52:06       Is that a style you called it [inaudible] it's like a small piece of French bread is what it looked like. But it was just, I mean it was kind of half rotten and pieces of rock and stick and in it was, it's funny even in the book because when you first talk about the French bread, French bread and did a club run tears to my eyes, a couple, a couple of paragraphs or maybe a couple of pages later, you're saying there was bugs in, but when you first got that French bread, the first I was put in solitary confinement, my first prison and I was brought a meal. And now the whole time I was captured down in the jungle, we got a ball of grapefruit, grapefruit size, ball of rice in the morning, a grapefruit size ball of rice in the evening for our food. That's what we got hiking up the Hotel Minh trail.

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       We would, in the evenings they would cook rice. The communist would, and we would get about that same equivalent about a ball size of rice. And then we would roll up a ball to eat during the, uh, the journey on the next morning. So it was the same thing to grapefruit sized balls or rice a day. And that's all that I had with an occasional piece of Manuk. Uh, yeah. And maybe some, uh, oh, what the heck do they call it? Bamboo shoot occasionally, but mostly just rice. So I get to Hanoi, I'm in solitary confinement. They bring me a meal. It's a plate of a, of a bean sprouts for a plate of bean sprouts with this piece of French bread on the side. And I'm sitting there for a lot of reasons. I mean, I, I knew that I was in Hanoi. I knew that this horrible trip of walking every single day and not knowing how I was going to survive through the day.

Speaker 3:          01:53:33       All that was over. I'm here, I'm in Hanoi. Oh. Plus they'd given me a bath and gave me a prison uniform and shaved me. Uh, I mean, I had not shaved the whole time, so I've been a prisoner for months. I have this huge beard. Um, and I sat there and they brought that food and I did, I cried. Tears rolled down my cheeks. I knew for the first time since I was shot down, there was no doubt in my mind. I was going to survive. That was no longer a question I had to do was gut out those last however long it was going to be in Hanoi. They had given me this wonderful food of bean sprouts and this piece of crappy French bread. But it was,

Speaker 4:          01:54:09       it was wonderful. That's, yeah. Beautiful. And here's, uh, as this continues here in Illinois, I'm going back to the book. I stood in the cell about 12 feet wide and 25 feet long. Six bunks lined up to my right head and against the wall to others lay lengthwise against the wall. To my left. The bunks were three by six foot pieces of wood resting on saw horses of the same width. Each was covered with a bamboo mat. A blanket neatly folded on one end between the bunks on my left, I saw two buckets just like the one in my ones in my solitary cells. A row of three small windows slits, six by 18 inches, opened high at the back, at the top of the back wall. Seven sets of eyes fixed on me. One approached and put out his hand. I'm John Murphy. Captain Air Force, how you doin Americans? A room full of Americans. Whoa, God bless you. Then that's your, you're with these other prisoners. And

Speaker 3:          01:55:19       I hadn't seen another American since. I split up from that group all that time ago on the trail. It was a glorious moment to come out of solitary confinement and be put in a room with seven other guys. And

Speaker 4:          01:55:31       this is one of the things that I talked about you as we were getting ready to record, I said, look, I want to read your entire book on this podcast because it's so good and nobody's going to

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       want to go by the book. Now. They just heard the whole, the whole book read to it. And in one of the decisions that I made was one of the things that you do in here is this is a book about you, but you do a wonderful and a beautiful job of describing and telling the stories of all these other heroes that you're with. And as a matter of fact, you call this chapter chapter 12 in the company of heroes with all these other Americans that you know, you, you told me on the way over here and you talk about it in the book you'd been in, you were there for, at this point, what, six months were you there at this point? Seven months? Yeah, something like that. Some of these guys had been in captivity for three years, five years, seven years, seven years.

Speaker 3:          01:56:29       The one guy talk about another, Jim Thompson had been a prisoner for nine years. I, I felt I needed to do that in this book. I've had some real mixed feelings about writing this book. I didn't want to do a book focused, you know, this happened to me story and I did all this great stuff. I know I suffered, but there were so many other prisoners from the southern experience, and that's a story I wanted to tell this, this different southern experience is different than the prisoners were shot down and captured in the north. So many of these guys, many, many of these guys suffered so much more than I did, spent so much more time in captivity than I did. Uh, so I do share those stories of those guys in the company of heroes. When I got the Hanoi, got into the prison of plantation gardens, I met these other guys and they had the truly incredible heroic stories to share.

Speaker 3:          01:57:15       And you do a phenomenal job in the book of, of describing, you know them, who they were or what they've been through. Bill gone. Al Krol. Boff Yup. John Parr cells. Bill Thomas, Bill Henderson, Dave Mott, just you go through the guys know those were the guys in my cell and I don't know, I don't know if you caught in there. Out of the eight guys in the self, four of us were named bill. That's just crazy. Eight Americans in a cell and four of his name bill. So I became new bill. Uh, there was a bill gap was an air force pilot, but six, four, six, five, he was big bill. There was a marine warrant officer who is some prehistoric elderly gentleman. The poor guy was 36 years old. We couldn't believe he'd survived. Uh, but he was old bill. And then we had a, a an air force, a ob 10 pilot who became young bills.

Speaker 3:          01:58:08       So we had four bills out of the, out of the eight guys. But yeah, then then the, the others and they, those guys had all suffered too. But then there were other guys in the camp, uh, shoot, uh, Dennis Thompson and, and Harvey, uh, brand, uh, two special forces guys capture along way their experiences. Uh, so many others, five, five guys, but TV station in way who are captured and tet, I mean, who would think that a TV, radio station, TV station crew would get captured, but they had all of their and their trials and, and then,

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       yeah, the most was, uh, was Jim Thompson and his nine years of suffering as a prisoner of war. And one of the guys I do want to highlight is Colonel Ted guy, someone to go to the book who are senior or senior ranking officer. Yep. Please. And someone's briefing, you kind of telling you what's going on and, and here's what, um, here's what Dave says. Dave Mott, he says, the SRO that's the senior ranking officer for the camp is Colonel Ted guy. He's in the shed up on top of the camp. That's where they've segregated the senior officers in NCO is from the rest of us. He's an air force lieutenant colonel who must've been promoted to full bird by now. He went down over Laos and an f four in 1968. He's a good leader and a real hard ass. He runs a tight ship, doesn't allow making any propaganda statements. No one can accept early release. We live by the code of conduct. He's taken a lot of beatings and torture for us. We call him the hawk. Al Crow. Both jumped in immediately. Yeah. And we're hawks heroes, just like Hogan's heroes on the TV show only. We don't have as much fun. He had a shit eating grin on his face. He also looked like crap.

Speaker 1:          01:59:57       So that's why I thought it was. Um, that's one of the, you know, you, you again, you go through all these guys and what they've done and you also talk about, you talk about some of those heroes that, that held the line and you also talk about another group who I'll go to here. Okay. Sometimes I could hear a lot of noise from the other side of the wall separating our road cells from those on the further end of our building, I could see the top of a basketball hoop and occasional volleyball arched high over an out of sight net. What's up with that? I asked, that's the peace committee came the answer. What's the peace committee? Eight guys who collaborate with the enemy. They've been ordered to stop, but they won't. They studied communism. Do propaganda, make radio broadcasts, even rat on other Americans for that. They get packages, get to write letters and can go outside whenever they want and play games. We call them the ducks because of the way they followed, followed the guards around and do their bidding. They'll rot in hell. I said that they will. The collaborators were, but a small but significant minority among us. There were 107 prisoners that plantation gardens. And except for the eight in the peace committee, all we're patriotic, loyal Americans who resisted enemy interrogations, propaganda and pressure to sign statements and make rock radio broadcasts. We resisted with everything we had.

Speaker 1:          02:01:32       And then, you know, you've got more time tying those guys back to Colonel Guy. I can't say enough about Colonel Guy and he's passed away several years ago

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       now. Uh, but what, uh, what a strong leader in, you know, we talk about military discipline and the requirement for it and officer's dissonance is that whatever in prison camp that discipline was so essential and so sought after by everyone. And we were lucky to have a colonel guy as our senior ranking officer. He was so tough and, and, and by the rules and the code and thank goodness, cause that's what we all needed to hear. Uh, and to, and to have that standard to a, to live by, uh, just a, a great and wonderful human being. When we got back, uh, you know, there were several who would've strangled some of those peace committee guys, especially some of our special forces guys were captured with us. Uh, but colonel guy put out an order and he said, this is a direct order. Everyone stay away from the peace committee. I'm going to take care of this. I got it. Don't you do anything? And Colonel Guy Press charges against the peace committee again and again was overwritten charges were never brought against them. But what did happen is colonel guys career was, was curtailed Farber short before it should have been. But I have the deepest respect for him as our, as our senior officer. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:02:52       Yeah. And again, I'm going to, I'm going to say this again. You go through these stories of, of some of the other heroes you just mentioned, Dennis Thomas Harps and right there at Thompson Harvey brand, Bill Murray. I mean you just, you go through these stories and then they're just all phenomenal and you do them such, such an honor telling their stories. So, uh, buy this book so that you can read these stories. Cause I don't have time to go through them all here. Right. The Oh the one thing I want to point out though is going back to the book, we also tried to keep our humor going within the cell and Alan, me as the central culprits telling disgustingly bad jokes back and forth. Owl was getting a lot better. His nausea was subsiding cause he was really sick. His naughty with subsiding in his boils healing.

Speaker 1:          02:03:44       Some of the guys exercised to fight the deterioration of their bodies. I couldn't even lie on my back, let alone trying to do sit ups. What I could do was get, was try to get into a position to try pushups. I tried once in the jungle and failed. I couldn't raise myself up off the ground. Now I was able to push all the way up once and halfway through a second. Pretty sad for a guy who could do a hundred pushups before I kept at fruit added for weeks until I was able to do several as part of my daily routine. And the reason I point that out is because I always say, you know, cause people get injured. People come with sickness. Do what you can. Yes, yes. And do what you can. And that's exactly what you are doing. So, so important.

Speaker 1:          02:04:34       December 8th ninth or December, 1972 after many weeks of quiet, we got bombed like none of us had ever been bombed before. Air Raid, sirens, wailed, barrages of Sam's fired and bombs poured down. American be 52 is that arrived in forest over underway. Bombs fell close and plantation gardens shook. We lay on our bunks, hoping our bombers knew where our camp was. Still, we fell back into a mindset we'd all developed in captivity. What will be, will be no sense in worrying about something you absolutely have no control over, which is going to stop above from landing on her head.

Speaker 3:          02:05:14       Yeah. That was the Christmas bombing in 1972 that Nixon ordered to finally bring the communist to conclude. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:05:21       Yeah. And I, I, I had to put this part in here. I had to read it. Go. So after those, after that massive bombing repercussion. So there's a guard that you, that you had nicknamed repercussion, repercussion, a guard so named because of his violent outbursts and threats against prisoners stood against the wall. As we milled around the water trough, he spoke some English old Bill Thomas walked over to them, him and said, you think those air strikes were bad? What the guard asked you think those airstrikes were bad last night, bill set again. Yes. Bad bombing. Well, you ain't seen nothing yet. Wait till they drop a bomb on your fucking ass. I gasped and smiled. Old Bill, proud marine. He'd been pretty quiet guy, but not anymore. We all glowed inside after the bombing. It was a huge morale boost. The bombings went on night after night, not without impunity be 50 two's got shot down there. Ghastly giant carcasses burning, falling. We wondered, sadly about the fate of the crews. We lost an aircraft yet they kept coming quietly. We cheered them on. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:06:32       that that was a huge morale boost and Bill Thomas, boy, bless his heart because he was always kind of a quiet guy, but he just let it let it all out there. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:06:40       That's so awesome. Okay, now we're wearing them in the Hondo Hilton. The infamous,

Speaker 3:          02:06:47       yeah, they moved us in the middle of all that bombing attacks. They loaded us up one night on trucks at the plantation gardens, drove around, I don't know, it seemed like for a couple hours. I think they're just trying to disorganize. We thought their tickets down in the country because of the bombings. Then they came to a stop and we got out of the trucks and found out we were only a few Blauer several blocks from where we started at the Hanoi Hilton

Speaker 1:          02:07:08       and now they set up like a little movie night for you guys. Oh yeah. For the, at the Hanoi Hilton, a little movie night and they, they set you down for the movie night. You guys are making fun of the projector operator and finally they tell you quiet, no talk. And then the movie starts back to the book. The film was of Jane Fonda visiting North Vietnam. We saw an American cavorting among the enemy leadership supporting cause

Speaker 4:          02:07:37       scenes appeared of her climbing into the governor's seat on an Nva antiaircraft gun wearing a clean white blouse, smiling broadly, laughing, dawning and north Vietnamese army helmet with live ammunition at or feet that would later shoot down American planes. In the film, she sent a message to American servicemen calling US war criminals. She said we were following the orders of other war criminals that were like the leaders of Germany and Japan in World War Two who were executed for their crimes.

Speaker 5:          02:08:14       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:08:15       I was stunned. We didn't dare speak out loud, but we had plenty to say to each other when we got back inside our cell days later, they showed us some news clippings from American newspapers and magazines. They all had news of war protests. One one was former US attorney general Ramsey Clark demanding that American stopped bombing north Vietnamese dykes. He had been attorney general under President Johnson during the buildup of American forces in Vietnam. Now he was making statements from annoyed that it was inhumane to bomb dykes and that we should never do it again. A photo showed him standing beside a dyke with a single bomb crater. I knew we did not have an air campaign to destroy the dikes. This was an errant bomb. The war protesters at home never bothered me. In fact, I took pride in fighting communism in this far corner of the earth so Americans could have the right to protest in the streets. It was a sacred honor to defend the right of other Americans to disagree with me or anything within our American system of government.

Speaker 5:          02:09:29       Okay?

Speaker 3:          02:09:30       Yeah. And I, I do believe that so strongly. They're, the core of our democracy is not that we all get in line and March 4th, uh, I'll take us to 1984. Uh, the strength of our American democracy as we can have different views and people disagree in the health of the democracy is when those disagreements can be argued and discussed, and then you reach a solution, a demo, or a democratic solution and you go forward. That's the beauty of our system. So yeah, it never bothered me. Even during the war I'd come up, people say, God, isn't this horrible at these guys? Know exactly what I said there. I am fighting as an American soldier to defend the American way of life, which is democratic disagreement, an argument, so they have added guys, you want to protest? Go protest.

Speaker 5:          02:10:17       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:10:17       Beautiful. Now you,

Speaker 4:          02:10:24       I'm good. I'm just going to go to the book. We joined the wrist rest of our cell mates and pressed clothes to Jose, Angela Dewa, Anzel Dewa autonomy rose marine, a tall marine corporal captured a couple of years before he quietly related what he'd gathered from the broadcast, so he was a translator. He was eavesdropping, listen to the radio translated. One of the guards was out in the courtyard playing a radio, which they never did. I never heard them, but obviously there was some important news coming says guard head is at a radio out in the courtyard listing and Jose heard what was said on the radio and he says it sounded like a peace agreement was signed in. The war has ended and you kind of get that confirmed back to the book. That afternoon. We were taken in the court yard with our fellow plantation garden prisoners from the cell.

Speaker 4:          02:11:10       Next door. Film crews stood behind a couple of big old funky cameras set up on tripods. We stood in rows as instructed, waiting for whatever might come and order passed through the ranks. Hawk says if it's good news, no reaction, no smiles, no shouting, nothing for propaganda. Yup. I love that. He's just hard to the end and then doc, who's the comp command, the camp commander, he, he says, he looks up and says the peace agreement assigned. You all go home. He waited for us to cheer nothing. He looked apologetically at the film director, then back to us with a hint of the scow and he goes through the whole, the whole points of, of what the peace accord has in it right in as he read the remaining highlights all faded into adult drone. I'd heard the most important one to me. The war's over. We're going home within 60 days. I made it. Thank you God. We went back to ourselves.

Speaker 4:          02:12:17       Yeah, that that was, it was a manageable Angie. We'll do it. Getting the heads up and then we confronted the guards and the next morning and they denied no, no, no, no, and and put, yeah. Then that afternoon we got let out in the courtyard and got the agreements read to us what a, what a tremendous feeling, but it was a tremendous feeling and then stop just short there because we weren't home yet. Right? We weren't going to believe it until it happened and you still had 60 days, 60 days and they actually consolidate other prisoners now. Right. They started doing releases earlier on or was supposed to be the longest held and most seriously injured. The got out first and then the releases were going to be spaced out in several groups over a period of 60 days. Back to the book here, after the new group joined us, we'd hear Godawful shrieks in the middle of the night. I thought it might be Ted Gustus, an intelligence officer captured in an ad hoc way in 1968 he'd been hung from ropes, denied water, severely beaten for extended periods, bashed in the head with an AK 47 and kicked in the stomach and an effort to gain valuable intelligence. He never revealed goddess was now a physical wreck who'd been driven to the precipice of insanity, sometimes dangling dangerously over its.

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       But it wasn't Ted who is screaming in the night.

Speaker 2:          02:13:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:13:36       It was Jim Thompson. Jim Kept to himself. He was hard to get to know. But in time he began to open up to me and share some things about himself. He was only 39 years old and God, he looked like hell. He'd been through more shit for a longer time than any other American soldier in history

Speaker 1:          02:14:02       in nine years. And you do a beautiful job of recounting the story that he told you. So this is the first person, the first person report of, of what happened. And again, it's an incredible, incredibly horrifying and heroic story that everybody needs to read about. And when he finishes telling you the story of, of, of how, what he'd been through up to that point of going back to book, I looked into his eyes and saw troubled soul. He'd survived captivity for nearly nine years longer than any other American soldier in history. It had taken a lot from him. My God, Jim, that's incredible. I said he smiled weakly and looked down. Prisoner releases began a few days later.

Speaker 2:          02:15:07       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:15:07       Yeah. Jim Is truly an unsung American hero. Most Americans don't even know of him. Uh, the longest held American prisoner military, prisoner of war in history. Uh, those, I mean, most people, they don't know much about the Vietnam war anyway. There's not very much taught in, in our history books or classes. But those who do know something about the Vietnam War, if you ask them who the longest held prisoner was, they will respond. Navy lieutenant of Alvarez, Lieutenant Alvarez was the longest held prisoner shot down over north Vietnam. He was not the longest held prisoner from the Vietnam War. Uh, Jim Thompson has several months, uh, more time in captivity then than have Alvarez. So I don't want to take anything away from, from Alvarez, but Jim never got the recognition really. I mean it's been mentioned here and there, but as far as people realizing and giving him the honor that he deserved a never received that as being the longest held American military prisoner in history and he's passed away now. I regret it.

Speaker 1:          02:16:13       Well we will do our our best to spread that word on here and I've actually ordered a book about him. Good. And I will, I will make sure I spread the word to the best of my ability about his service and sacrifice and heroism

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       and

Speaker 4:          02:16:31       the way you do it in here as an incredible tribute to what he went through as well.

Speaker 2:          02:16:37       Now

Speaker 4:          02:16:39       the days go by, they finally pack, get you to pack up your gear, give you some new clothes, put you on a bus and take you out. And here we go. Back to the book, we milled around for half an hour talking wants to ourselves and getting no information from the guards. The staff car returned and we were soon back on the bus, afraid we were heading back to the Hilton, but when we came to a row of derelict hangers, we knew we must be on Hanoi's Guy Lamb, no GLM Jhelum airport used by enemy Mig fighters, jets. Throughout the war, the bus turned at a shabby hanger with a Rickety control tower at its side. I be held, one of the most wondrous sites I'd ever seen before us was a big shiny, beautiful. See One 41 medevac plane parked on the ramp. The American flag and a Red Cross were painted high on its tail. The words US Air Force were printed boldly on the fuselage just behind the cockpit. I cannot describe the emotion that filled me. I can't even imagine.

Speaker 4:          02:17:55       And you guys load up. Take off pen. Here we go. Back to the book. I was happy yet anxious as the big jet rolled down the runway. Once airborne, we remained silent, absorbed in our thoughts. We seem to be waiting for something, but none of us knew quite what it was until the pilot came on the intercom. Thought you would all like to know that we have just passed beyond Sam missile range. We erupted in a spontaneous cheer. I was overwhelmed with joy. It was real. We were free. We were going home. Nothing could stop that now.

Speaker 2:          02:18:41       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:18:41       Yeah. We really, even though we didn't consciously know it or talk about it, we didn't have the feeling that we were home free until that moment when the pilot came on and said, cause yeah, we're the missiles couldn't shoot us down. We were on our, on our way headed to the Philippines.

Speaker 2:          02:18:59       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:19:02       I'm going to again skip through. We're almost, we're running a little long on time and, but one of the things I wanted to point out in here is that you got back, you're going through, you're in the hospital, you're going through some of your recovery and you get asked to talk a bunch. Hey, can you come talk to this group, talk to that group and you're saying, no, I don't want to talk to you. You don't want to talk to anybody, don't want to talk to anybody. And finally you get asked

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       one more time and I'll go to the book. I just want to ask you please to consider one last time. This group is the Baton Corregidor Survivors' association and they really want one of the returned Vietnam Pow [inaudible] to talk to them at their gathering tonight. You're the only one still here. I was blown away. Wait a minute. These are POW survived the Bataan death march in World War II and they want to hear about me after what they've been through it. Of course you agreed to do it and this is the part that I wanted, especially the vets because a lot of vets listen to this

Speaker 1:          02:20:04       by giving me an opportunity I couldn't refuse. They made me come out of my shell and speak publicly about what I'd been through. They opened the door to what would become the greatest therapy possible to help me deal with all that had happened to me. Many of my friends who have not been able to talk about what happened to them have not readjusted. Well, several still have major psychological issues, haunting them. A couple of days later, I got an invitation to speak to a high school assembly, which I accepted and the weeks and months ahead I'd be asked to talk to various groups and I agreed to do as many as I could. I strongly believe that the opportunity to share my experience has been one of the principal reasons I've been able to readjust and deal with life as well as I have. That coupled with my faith in God, love of family and my inherently optimistic nature.

Speaker 3:          02:21:02       Yes, yes, yes. I can't, that is probably the greatest bit of advice that comes out of this book. I mean, I came up, I didn't want to talk to anybody. I didn't think anybody could understand what I, what I had to say. And I think many vets have the same feeling, uh, you know, just leave me alone. I will get through this and plus you don't know what I, what I've experienced and you can't understand if I try to tell you about it.

Speaker 3:          02:21:31       First of all, they can understand to a degree, no one will ever be able to understand everything that you've been through. But they can't understand or degree and they do want the listen. Okay. That's the receiving end. For you to be able to share your experience or for me over the years to share my experience again and again and again and even to write this book. As painful as that process was a is a therapeutic process. It's a healing process to be able to talk about what you've experienced and if you think you have demons in your mind, share those demons to talk about it. It certainly has helped me. I, I'm, I'm doing well. I've been through a lot. I'm doing well and I think a huge part of that reason is, is thank you survivors of Bataan and Corregidor because I couldn't say no to you and by doing that it got me started talking about my experience.

Speaker 1:          02:22:25       Totally agree.

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       I totally agree. It's a beautiful advice and to close out the story here, you saying the book that you greet your children at the time, you greet your children every day with good morning. It's a beautiful day and you explain why you do that in the book.

Speaker 1:          02:22:52       In a quote, I truly believe that every day God has given me on this earth since I came home from captivity is a beautiful day. It doesn't matter if it's raining or snowing, windy or calm, hot or cold, sunny or overcast. Every day is a gift. Every day is beautiful and that is certainly something that I learned in war. Not as vividly as you did by any stretch, but definitely something that I know to be true. And it's something that I talk about all the time here,

Speaker 2:          02:23:40       that

Speaker 1:          02:23:43       when you see that darkness, the light is much more beautiful. It is.

Speaker 2:          02:23:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:23:54       And you know, you put together in this book, um, some eight that you call the eight steps to survival in a pow camp. And those I wrote right after or shortly after I got back, I mean the book was written just in the last several years with those eight steps for survival. I put those two papers shortly after I returned. And what I love about these is as, as I read through them here, they're not just for survival in a pow camp there for life there for life. They've been tested in the absolute harshest of conditions in a pow camp, but they can be applied to life. And, and it's actually things I talk about all the time. And it's amazing that that day or so much alignment, number one, eat. It sounds simple, doesn't it? But when you've got to force down nothing but plain boiled rice, day after day, month after month, eating becomes a difficult chore. Some found death easier. Now, how does that apply to life for me? Eat, eat the right foods, eat healthy foods, boom, done. You want to stay healthy. Next one, practice personal hygiene. When you are sick and starving, it's hard to motivate yourself to keep your body and surroundings clean. Do the best you can with what you have.

Speaker 4:          02:25:22       Phil to disease and disease leads to death.

Speaker 5:          02:25:28       And

Speaker 4:          02:25:29       again, for me to apply this to life, this is about discipline. And this is about routine. And this is about pride and, and maintaining those things. And even, you know, we've talked at one of those stories I talk about on here is the, uh, the Russians fighting the Chechens. And one of the things that in the debriefs into post operational debriefs, when they lost that first push down there, they said, you know, once the guy stopped shaving, right, then they stopped taking care of the weapons that go. Everything goes downhill. So what, to me, one of the things that this applies to, I mean, you're talking about it from also from a pure health perspective, obviously. Yeah. But it's also a psychological factor of yes, yes. Number three, exercise. Set up a daily exercise period. Do something. Even if you are in stocks and chains, you can at least flex a few muscles and do some deep breathing. Okay? There is no more excuses ever, ever, for not working out, for not doing something physical. Even if you're in stock, AIDS and chains.

Speaker 5:          02:26:43       Okay?

Speaker 4:          02:26:45       Yeah. Not in a recliner with a TV on. Unbelievable. Do not give up. The fight to stay alive is number four. Do not give up this fight to stay alive. No matter how sick you are, how serious your wounds or how hopeless the situation is, there's always a chance you can make it. Take that chance with your deepest courage. Fight for it.

Speaker 5:          02:27:09       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:27:10       Made again. You apply this every day. Look at the opportunities you have. I mean the opportunities that a normal person has, we don't even take advantage of those opportunities that we have. We don't even fight for those. Fight for those. Number five, established communications with other prisoners. Use Your initiative and imagination to make contact with others and then develop a chain of command.

Speaker 5:          02:27:36       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:27:38       Build relationships with people. Yeah. Just build relationships with people. Number six, follow the code of conduct. You must know the code before you find yourself in a prison camp. Then you should adhere to the articles as strictly as possible.

Speaker 5:          02:27:58       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:27:58       and that doesn't mean it here perfectly. No one could adhere perfectly, but adhere as close as possible. If you waver, come back to it. Don't waiver and think that you've, uh, you've failed and then just cave in and give in. Yeah, and that's one of the things, again, we were talking on the way over here. That was one of the changes after the experiences that you all had is what initiated those changes in the code of conduct to give it some flexibility, right? So that so that people could bounce back from and say, oh I Bro, you know, yesterday didn't make it. Today is a new day. Exactly. And I think that attitude is perfect for everyday life. You fall off the wagon on something. Okay, that doesn't do it. Get back on it.

Speaker 2:          02:28:41       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:28:44       Number seven, keep the faith. Faith in your family, your religion and your country. Maybe all that keeps you alive. Insane. Hang in there. You are not forgotten.

Speaker 2:          02:28:58       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:29:02       That needs no explanation. Right? And number eight, maintain a sense of humor. This is difficult, but both possible and necessary. A bit of humor helps keep away fits of total depression. And remember, depression can kill. So yes,

Speaker 3:          02:29:31       practice what I preached by my poor family and close friends. Know My, my very crazy sick sense of humor. But a, I do have one and I did throughout and I give a couple examples in the book where some very dire times I would come up with a stupid humor, but I get it.

Speaker 4:          02:29:47       Well I've talked about that as well and why we would be in the worst situations possible and always someone would be laughing about something. Yeah. And that's what like you said, that's what keeps the spirit going and, and keeps you on the, on the same side of things is to have fun with it. Yeah. Is there anything that, any points that I missed? I mean, again, I, I don't, I miss a lot of points. Anything else that, that, that you would recommend

Speaker 3:          02:30:13       man or that you wanted one to bring up? I don't think you missed anything, Jocko. You covered the book very thoroughly. Uh, you know, the, the, the title is through the valley, my captivity in Vietnam. And I'm saying that because I hope that this book will be of benefit and value to others and that's really what drove me to finish the book. I started it and I was wondering why I was writing it. But I think when the whole thing is put together, it's, it's a story of hope and the power of hope and how anyone can face very adverse conditions, challenges in life, be be the guys coming back with PTSD from, from, from combat. Uh, be it just a single mother somewhere. W with problems, others with difficulties. I think in reading this book you can come out of it with hope and a and hopefully with motivation to, uh, to overcome those difficulties and a, and have a, have a full, wonderful and beautiful life because it is a beautiful thing if, if we'll just grab a hold of that beauty and, and go for it and not on

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       whatever negative aspects there might be there. There's no doubt. And even though I did a may have done a thorough job, I read less than 10%, much less than 10%. There's so much more that you went through that he experienced and the other people that you talk about who went through what they went through. It's a phenomenal book. It's a phenomenal book through the valley. My captivity in Vietnam, there'll be a link for it. Yes. So you can go to go to the website and get right and get it ordered. Um, you guys know the deal. Do it quick. So you get a copy of this. I should add one thing because we talked about a lot of the negative stuff in the book. It does have a happy ending. Happy ending. At the end of this book is Melanie Ross reader, my wife. Uh, and, and that little love story is in there and how we came together. Uh, but she, and then the two younger kids, we talked about Spencer and Vicky, but uh, also a chat and a, and Chelsea, uh, have brought such joy to my life and brought this whole journey to a, to a conclusion. So, uh, there's the power of hope and there's also the power of love that comes out at the end of this. It's absolutely a, it's beautiful. It's a great, is a great book.

Speaker 6:          02:32:36       And

I had just, well we didn't get it all my surgeries after him back but I'm, I'm all fused together and wire together on my back. Yeah, I was going to ask what, what did you eat the whole time but this rice on the whole time while till I got to Hanoi and then why I said the bean sprouts was raped. But what I found, what I found is the keep that diet for about three weeks run. And so I had nothing but bean sprouts couple times a week for three weeks. Then we get pumpkin soup, cabbage soup Kohlrabi and yeah, and corroborate. Is there anything I don't really care for us and it's, I can't go love right. It's actually, but that was partly psychological cause I had to eat it. So I do truly love rice today. That's kind of vegetarian diet or less, right? Yeah. Yeah. My was very
