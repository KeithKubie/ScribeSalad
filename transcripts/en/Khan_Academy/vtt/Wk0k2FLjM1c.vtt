00:00:00.137 --> 00:00:01.271
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.271 --> 00:00:02.517
Today Paige and I are going to teach you

00:00:02.517 --> 00:00:06.094
all about your new best friend, the comma.

00:00:06.094 --> 00:00:10.375
It is a piece of punctuation
that has many many functions.

00:00:10.375 --> 00:00:12.990
We're just going to broadly
overview them today.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.913
The comma is an extremely
powerful piece of punctuation,

00:00:16.913 --> 00:00:18.857
can do a whole bunch of stuff.

00:00:18.857 --> 00:00:21.605
So Paige, what is the most pertinent

00:00:21.605 --> 00:00:24.193
or important thing that the comma does?

00:00:24.193 --> 00:00:25.783
- [Voiceover] I would probably say

00:00:25.783 --> 00:00:29.116
that it is separating sentence elements.

00:00:29.977 --> 00:00:33.440
- [Voiceover] So that's
like its broad super-power--

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.273
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:00:34.273 --> 00:00:38.635
- [Voiceover] But lots of
stuff falls under that.

00:00:38.635 --> 00:00:42.277
So it's like it has laser
vision but it can not only

00:00:42.277 --> 00:00:47.230
use that laser vision to
boil water, but it can also

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.281
cut through steel.

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:50.299
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:55.219
- [Voiceover] So this is a
superhero punctuation mark.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.052
I'll make that into a C for comma.

00:00:59.153 --> 00:01:01.735
So okay, so how is the comma
going to save the day today?

00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:03.644
How's it going to make
our sentences make sense?

00:01:03.644 --> 00:01:06.221
What are some of the
things that it separates?

00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:10.388
- [Voiceover] So it can
separate elements of lists.

00:01:15.152 --> 00:01:18.069
- [Voiceover] For lunch I had tofu,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.103
spam,

00:01:24.148 --> 00:01:25.148
and seaweed.

00:01:28.318 --> 00:01:29.380
A very Hawai'ian lunch.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.963
- [Voiceover] Mm-hm, delicious.

00:01:33.482 --> 00:01:34.315
- [Voiceover] So it's separating

00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:37.342
these elements of this list.

00:01:37.342 --> 00:01:40.592
I guess commas can also separate dates.

00:01:42.888 --> 00:01:44.951
- [Voiceover] That's right.

00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:47.760
- [Voiceover] So for example,
here in the United States,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.343
National Blueberry
Muffin Day is July 11th,

00:01:53.195 --> 00:01:54.947
and if we wanted to refer to a historical

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:58.947
blueberry muffin day,
let's say July 11th, 1981.

00:02:04.204 --> 00:02:05.037
- [Voiceover] Wow.

00:02:05.037 --> 00:02:07.858
- [Voiceover] It was the
best muffin day ever.

00:02:07.858 --> 00:02:08.705
- [Voiceover] I wish I could
have been around for that.

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:12.948
- [Voiceover] Yeah, okay, so
a comma can separate lists

00:02:12.948 --> 00:02:16.054
and it can be used for dates,
and we can also set off

00:02:16.054 --> 00:02:18.097
things at the beginning of sentences,

00:02:18.097 --> 00:02:21.097
like basically, everything is great.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:27.509
The comma has a bunch
of different functions.

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:29.773
It's this super-useful multi-tool.

00:02:29.773 --> 00:02:32.162
It's the superhero of
a piece of punctuation.

00:02:32.162 --> 00:02:34.286
So we're not going to cover
all of that in this video.

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:36.169
The most important thing
to remember about the comma

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:39.059
is what it does is
separate sentence elements.

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:42.182
It can separate clauses,
it can separate items

00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:45.470
in a list, it can separate dates.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.840
Usually, when you're
trying to make a separation

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.189
within a sentence, you use a comma.

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.612
So Paige, so what are some
things that commas can't do?

00:02:55.612 --> 00:02:56.593
- [Voiceover] That's a great question.

00:02:56.593 --> 00:03:00.287
So, commas can't go at
the end of a sentence.

00:03:00.287 --> 00:03:02.787
- [Voiceover] Okay, so I couldn't be like,

00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:05.120
I want to go swimming comma.

00:03:10.676 --> 00:03:11.591
It couldn't end a sentence that way.

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:12.424
- [Voiceover] Right, you need to say

00:03:12.424 --> 00:03:13.421
something after the comma.

00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:15.254
- [Voiceover] So this is no good.

00:03:15.254 --> 00:03:16.534
Or you have to keep going,

00:03:16.534 --> 00:03:20.534
like I'm going to go
swimming, and then sailing.

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:28.104
And end it with a period, like that.

00:03:29.406 --> 00:03:32.084
That's totally fine usage for a comma.

00:03:32.084 --> 00:03:34.072
If it's in the middle of a sentence

00:03:34.072 --> 00:03:35.573
but not at the end of a sentence.

00:03:35.573 --> 00:03:36.406
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:03:36.406 --> 00:03:39.222
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
commas only go in the middle.

00:03:39.222 --> 00:03:40.055
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:03:40.055 --> 00:03:42.244
- [Voiceover] So comma separates
stuff which therefore means

00:03:42.244 --> 00:03:45.354
it has to be in-between something.

00:03:45.354 --> 00:03:46.583
- [Voiceover] Right, there has
to be something to the left

00:03:46.583 --> 00:03:47.777
and something to the right.

00:03:47.777 --> 00:03:49.688
- [Voiceover] Cool, all right.

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:51.004
That's a comma--

00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:51.837
- [Voiceover] Yeah--

00:03:51.837 --> 00:03:52.670
- [Voiceover] Wouldn't you say?

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.621
- [Voiceover] I think we have
successfully met the comma.

00:03:54.621 --> 00:03:56.372
- [Voiceover] Cool,
you can learn anything.

00:03:56.372 --> 00:03:57.205
David out.

00:03:57.205 --> 00:03:58.070
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
