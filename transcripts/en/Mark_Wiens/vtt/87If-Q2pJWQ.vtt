00:00:00.332 --> 00:00:01.651
- Hey everyone, it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:01.651 --> 00:00:03.449
I'm in Manila, Philippines,

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.608
and for lunch today I am eating

00:00:05.608 --> 00:00:08.506
at a Filipino roadside restaurant.

00:00:08.506 --> 00:00:09.414
This is one of the restaurants

00:00:09.414 --> 00:00:12.102
that I am most looking
forward to eating at.

00:00:12.102 --> 00:00:14.074
This place is on the corner of the road.

00:00:14.074 --> 00:00:16.777
There's a mechanic's
shop kind of surrounding.

00:00:16.777 --> 00:00:19.086
It's a great environment,

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:21.010
and the Filipino food they serve here

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.789
looks absolutely incredible.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.372
(lively music)

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.845
Hello, hello.

00:00:33.845 --> 00:00:34.750
What is your name?

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.583
- Martina.

00:00:35.583 --> 00:00:36.491
- [Mark] Martina.

00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:37.602
Nice to meet you.

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:39.802
- Nice to meet you too.

00:00:39.802 --> 00:00:42.417
- [Mark] How old are you?

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:43.250
Four.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.500
(sizzling)

00:00:48.922 --> 00:00:51.172
(chopping)

00:00:52.856 --> 00:00:55.451
Can I have leimpo, two.

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:57.149
There were so many restaurants
I was looking forward

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.491
to eating at in Manila

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:01.579
but the legendary Aling
Sosing's Carinderia,

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.198
located on the corner of
a neighborhood street,

00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:06.283
shaded by a giant mango tree

00:01:06.283 --> 00:01:08.800
with an impressive array of Filipino food

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.780
was a local spot I couldn't wait to try.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.790
Like most carinderias, or
local Filipino food restaurants

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.592
in the Philippines, to order,

00:01:16.592 --> 00:01:19.180
all you have to do is walk
up to the front of the stall,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.735
check out all the glorious
dishes in front of you,

00:01:21.735 --> 00:01:24.428
and pick and choose whatever you like.

00:01:24.428 --> 00:01:25.760
- One tilapia?

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.462
- And one tilapia, yes please.

00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:29.788
Oh, thank you.

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:32.420
Oh, squid, can I have squid also.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.122
And also this, and also
one plate of this one.

00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:37.015
Pok med, yes.

00:01:37.015 --> 00:01:39.765
Okay, and two rice.

00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:50.198
The most challenging part

00:01:50.198 --> 00:01:53.115
is not ordering everything you see.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.974
Oh yeah, Mike is looking at all that food.

00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:02.557
Michael, look at all that food.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:04.909
I had read that this was place

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.675
would get just absolutely
jam packed at lunch time,

00:02:07.675 --> 00:02:10.460
so luckily Jing and I
came right at 11 a.m.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.808
We arrived here there were tables open

00:02:11.808 --> 00:02:13.353
but right now as we sat down

00:02:13.353 --> 00:02:14.439
it's completely full,

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.439
there no more tables left.

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:16.346
People are gonna start waiting

00:02:16.346 --> 00:02:18.663
and it's not even lunchtime
yet, it's just 11 a.m.

00:02:18.663 --> 00:02:20.824
It is a carinderia-style restaurant.

00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:23.274
It's a local Filipino food restaurant,

00:02:23.274 --> 00:02:24.756
and you walk up to the front,

00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:26.949
they have all of the dishes prepared,

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:28.627
all of the different stews,

00:02:28.627 --> 00:02:33.343
and all of the different
common, typical Filipino dishes,

00:02:33.343 --> 00:02:36.811
and then they also are known
for their grilled tilapia,

00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:40.040
and they're also known for
their inihaw na liempo,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.808
which is the grilled pork belly.

00:02:42.808 --> 00:02:44.886
So, this is one of those restaurants

00:02:44.886 --> 00:02:46.907
where you could just stand up there

00:02:46.907 --> 00:02:49.300
and pick and choose so many dishes,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.065
and it's hard to know when to stop

00:02:51.065 --> 00:02:53.036
because you wanna eat it all.

00:02:53.036 --> 00:02:54.979
This is also a great time
to come to this restaurant

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:56.804
because you see all the
dishes are prepared.

00:02:56.804 --> 00:02:58.410
And another thing I read
about this restaurant

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.154
is that they don't recook any more food,

00:03:01.154 --> 00:03:02.539
or they don't cook any more dishes,

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.303
so once that dish is
gone, you're out of luck,

00:03:05.303 --> 00:03:07.400
they won't have it again
for the rest of the day.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.051
I gotta start with the signature dish

00:03:09.051 --> 00:03:10.867
which is their grilled pork.

00:03:10.867 --> 00:03:14.122
They have it all in
just slabs of pork belly

00:03:14.122 --> 00:03:16.554
that they grill like that
but then when you order it

00:03:16.554 --> 00:03:19.909
they chop it up into bite-sized pieces.

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:21.525
Big bite-sized pieces,

00:03:21.525 --> 00:03:25.580
and you can see the, oh,
that's the skin right there,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.163
that chewy skin.

00:03:28.163 --> 00:03:30.589
Well, I think I'm just gonna
go in with my fingers for this.

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:32.636
I want to get a piece for my first bite

00:03:32.636 --> 00:03:37.361
that includes all layers of the belly.

00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:40.021
Oh yeah, you can see the skin, the fat,

00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:43.058
and immediately I can feel the
juices coming onto my fingers

00:03:43.058 --> 00:03:44.725
when I pick that up.

00:03:50.312 --> 00:03:52.073
It's so smokey,

00:03:52.073 --> 00:03:53.288
and then the meat is tender

00:03:53.288 --> 00:03:57.939
but then the skin is pretty rubbery

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.873
but that's all part of
the textural experience.

00:04:01.873 --> 00:04:03.114
Next up I'm gonna try the fish

00:04:03.114 --> 00:04:04.641
but I think I'm gonna make my sauce first

00:04:04.641 --> 00:04:06.620
with calamansi and chilis.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.379
I think this might be soy sauce.

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.507
I'm going to go for the soy sauce

00:04:10.507 --> 00:04:14.507
and then I'm going to add
this to my chili bowl.

00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:21.506
And then squeeze in the calamansi.

00:04:21.506 --> 00:04:23.696
Oh yeah.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:26.279
This is the sauce of champions,

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.837
and then just kind of mash
up this chili a little bit.

00:04:31.837 --> 00:04:33.915
I'm definitely gonna ask
them for some more chilis.

00:04:33.915 --> 00:04:34.748
Actually at the front there

00:04:34.748 --> 00:04:36.230
they had a whole panful of chilis,

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.697
so I think you can maybe go up there

00:04:37.697 --> 00:04:39.697
and self-serve yourself.

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:42.776
Alright, that's gonna
be perfect for the fish.

00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:44.848
Okay, grilled tilapia here.

00:04:44.848 --> 00:04:47.265
Oh, that feels nice and soft.

00:04:52.418 --> 00:04:55.364
Oh, you can see how juicy it is too there.

00:04:55.364 --> 00:04:56.753
Oh, wonderful

00:04:56.753 --> 00:04:58.171
and I gotta go in for some of that chili

00:04:58.171 --> 00:05:01.838
and that soy sauce and goodness.

00:05:06.528 --> 00:05:08.361
Oh, look at that bite.

00:05:10.265 --> 00:05:11.630
Oh, no I lost the chili.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.615
The chili fell over.

00:05:12.615 --> 00:05:16.032
Okay, I'll scoop that back into my spoon.

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:27.723
Oh, that tilapia is so nice and juicy

00:05:27.723 --> 00:05:29.350
and it has a nice smokey flavor,

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.294
and then just that simple
sauce, the soy sauce

00:05:32.294 --> 00:05:34.585
with the citrus-y calamansi,

00:05:34.585 --> 00:05:36.832
and the calamansi has a flavor that's,

00:05:36.832 --> 00:05:40.591
I think it's somewhere
halfway in-between an orange

00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:41.711
and a lemon.

00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:43.613
Maybe it has like little
bit of a sweet tinge to it

00:05:43.613 --> 00:05:45.922
compared to a lime or a lemon

00:05:45.922 --> 00:05:49.615
but it still has that nice
sour, citrus-y flavor.

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:51.990
It's just a simple sauce combination

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.751
that you can basically
eat with everything.

00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:55.726
This is a Filipino dish

00:05:55.726 --> 00:05:58.110
that I think it's eggplant, there's okra,

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.294
there are long beans, and
there's bitter melon as well,

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:02.366
and if I remember correctly

00:06:02.366 --> 00:06:04.297
this dish there's some shrimp paste

00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:06.695
or some krill paste that
gives it its flavor.

00:06:06.695 --> 00:06:09.228
So, I will dig into some,

00:06:09.228 --> 00:06:12.335
oh, and I think we might
have some fried pork in here

00:06:12.335 --> 00:06:14.645
that gives it its flavor too.

00:06:14.645 --> 00:06:16.478
Put this onto my rice.

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:24.702
Oh, that's awesome.

00:06:24.702 --> 00:06:27.048
It has a really nice garlic-y taste to it.

00:06:27.048 --> 00:06:28.499
That's really garlic-y and then you have,

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:31.423
I did get a piece of
like crispy pork belly

00:06:31.423 --> 00:06:32.524
I think in that bite.

00:06:32.524 --> 00:06:33.528
And that pumpkin is amazing.

00:06:33.528 --> 00:06:35.426
It's not like mushy at all.

00:06:35.426 --> 00:06:38.843
It's kind of like, or maybe it's a squash

00:06:39.835 --> 00:06:42.543
because it has a very silky texture to it,

00:06:42.543 --> 00:06:43.554
rather than being that like

00:06:43.554 --> 00:06:46.600
kind of mushy, dry texture.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.570
That's delicious.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.487
I gotta take one more bite of that.

00:06:51.332 --> 00:06:53.250
Extraordinary actually, extraordinary.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.333
And I'm gonna follow that
with some of this soup.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.576
Oh, wow.

00:07:01.576 --> 00:07:03.857
I was actually expecting
it to be plainer than that.

00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:05.063
Oh, that's really good.

00:07:05.063 --> 00:07:06.511
A little bit sour,

00:07:06.511 --> 00:07:10.011
and it has a very meaty broth taste to it,

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.030
and yet it's not too salty,

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.059
and the next dish I ordered is kaldereta,

00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:18.740
and this is another
well-known Filipino dish

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.540
but this is like a stew.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.340
Put this onto my rice.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.923
Let me get a little
bit more of that sauce.

00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:38.109
Oh, I love that sour taste to it.

00:07:38.983 --> 00:07:43.271
Kind of rich, kind of oily
stew with a sour taste,

00:07:43.271 --> 00:07:45.540
and then that meat is so tender.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.040
That'll be really good with a chili on it.

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:51.895
As soon as you bite into that chili

00:07:51.895 --> 00:07:55.416
that's just an eruption of chili.

00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:56.991
Oh, that makes, oh yeah,

00:07:56.991 --> 00:08:00.722
I'm a little bit of a chili addict

00:08:00.722 --> 00:08:02.240
but that tastes really, really good.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.911
And next I've got a squid dish.

00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:06.864
Oh, a leaf has fallen into the squid.

00:08:06.864 --> 00:08:09.916
Yeah, and I think it's
black ink with the squid.

00:08:09.916 --> 00:08:13.271
Let me just taste one of
the little heads actually.

00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:15.389
Put this onto my rice,

00:08:15.389 --> 00:08:19.600
and oh, I'm gonna add a little
bit more of that squid sauce.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.767
Oh, look at that darkness.

00:08:28.116 --> 00:08:30.393
That's very sweet

00:08:30.393 --> 00:08:34.324
and a little sour and salty.

00:08:34.324 --> 00:08:36.788
It almost tastes like
sweet and sour squid.

00:08:36.788 --> 00:08:39.381
And then the squid is very tender

00:08:39.381 --> 00:08:41.980
but it almost has like, you can sense

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.348
that it has like a
little bit of rubberiness

00:08:44.348 --> 00:08:46.697
underneath the tenderness.

00:08:46.697 --> 00:08:51.068
So, how they've cooked it,
it's very nice and tender.

00:08:51.068 --> 00:08:52.057
- How's the food?

00:08:52.057 --> 00:08:54.724
- Awesome, man, very, very good.

00:08:59.822 --> 00:09:03.596
We just ordered some of
these grilled pork skewers,

00:09:03.596 --> 00:09:05.159
pork barbecue.

00:09:05.159 --> 00:09:06.856
Oh, look at that.

00:09:06.856 --> 00:09:08.606
That looks wonderful.

00:09:12.658 --> 00:09:15.658
Okay, let me reach into
this pork barbecue.

00:09:15.658 --> 00:09:18.289
They've just really packed on the meat

00:09:18.289 --> 00:09:19.839
onto this skewer and then
there's a piece of fat

00:09:19.839 --> 00:09:21.172
at the end here.

00:09:25.718 --> 00:09:28.602
Oh, that's right off the grill.

00:09:28.602 --> 00:09:32.004
Oh, that is just ridiculously tender

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:34.626
without being too tender.

00:09:34.626 --> 00:09:38.424
Oh, and that almost has like a little bit

00:09:38.424 --> 00:09:40.236
of a sweet barbecue sauce to it.

00:09:40.236 --> 00:09:41.069
We didn't order this at first

00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:43.083
bu then Ying said we should order this,

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.916
so I'm glad we got it.

00:09:48.146 --> 00:09:50.229

Put some of this over the fish.

00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:36.385
Oh, and that's wonderful.

00:11:36.385 --> 00:11:39.167
