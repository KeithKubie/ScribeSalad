00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.260
White box testing, in general, and coverage criteria in particular, involve some

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.550
subtle concepts, so before I conclude this lesson, I want to have a

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.960
few more quizzes to make sure that we all understand these concepts.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.610
The first one involves a very simple piece of code, a straight line

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.540
of code, three statements, in which we simply read an integer and

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.180
then prints 10 divided by the value of that integer minus 3. Now,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.250
let's imagine that we have a test where there consists of three

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.250
test cases for this code, and what I'm showing in the test cases

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.580
is the input and the expected output. So for the first one,

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.280
the input is 1, and I expect the output to be minus 5.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.480
For the second one, the input is minus 1, I'm expecting to

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.120
have 2.5. And for the third one, the input is 0, and I'm

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.440
expecting to have minus 3.3333 as the result. Now the first question

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.180
I want to ask, is if we considered this test suite, and we

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.050
run it on the code, does it achieve path coverage? And remember

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.960
that path coverage is one of the strongest coverage criteria that we saw.
