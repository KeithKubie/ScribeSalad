00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:04.471
WHERE DISHONESTY RUNS RAMPANT,

00:00:04.505 --> 00:00:06.940
AND THAT MAKES THE FACT THAT
I FIRST THOUGHT HIS BUSINESS

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:09.977
WAS CALLED "GAY AUTO REPAIR"
THE LEAST OF HIS WORRIES.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.613
HIS BIGGEST PROBLEM:
CUSTOMERS NOT TRUSTING HIM.

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:15.716 line:0%
 
- I DO HAVE CLIENTS LIKE
THAT THAT ONCE THEY ENTER HERE,

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.018 line:0%
 
THEY THINK THAT
I'M READY TO RIP THEM OFF.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.920
- GREG SEEMED LIKE
AN HONEST MECHANIC,

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.022
BUT BEFORE HELPING HIM,
I NEEDED TO BE SURE.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.258
SO I BAKED HIM SOME COOKIES
WITH SALT INSTEAD OF SUGAR

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:27.761
TO SEE IF HE'D BE HONEST
ABOUT THE TASTE,

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.129
AND THE NEXT DAY,
I PAID HIM A VISIT AT HIS SHOP

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.565
IN GLENDALE, CALIFORNIA,
WITH MY HOMEMADE TREATS.

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:34.234
- I HAVE A LITTLE
SURPRISE FOR YOU.

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:35.936
I BAKED YOU THESE COOKIES.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.404
- FOR ME?
- YEAH.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:38.772
- [laughs]
- SO FEEL FREE TO HAVE ONE.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:43.577
- SURE.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.480
- WHO MADE IT? YOU MADE IT?
- MM-HMM.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.415
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:50.083
- VERY GOOD.
- YOU LIKE IT?

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:51.385
- I LIKE IT.
YEAH, A LITTLE SALTY.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.287
DIFFERENT.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.788
- GOOD ENOUGH.

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:57.257
THE PLAN: FOR GREG TO PROMOTE
THAT HE'S AN HONEST MECHANIC

00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:01.528
BY ONLY GIVING ESTIMATES WHILE
HOOKED UP TO A LIE DETECTOR.

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:04.097
- I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT,
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S--

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:07.734
- SOMETHING LIKE THIS WON'T
ONLY MAKE YOU LOOK MORE HONEST,

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:10.204
BUT IT WILL MAKE YOUR
COMPETITORS LOOK MORE DISHONEST

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:12.606
BECAUSE IT'LL MAKE
EVERYONE IN THE CITY GO,

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.442
"WELL, WHY ISN'T MY MECHANIC
HOOKED UP TO A POLYGRAPH?
