00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
&gt;&gt; Yes we would like the World Cup event in
South Africa to benefit the rest of the continent

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.050
and we want to do so and we want to do so
by making it possible for Africans to be able

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:22.150
to view the full matches through big-screens
and the signals are conveyed by telecommunications

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.290
to villages and cities across the continent.
Secondly, there will be millions of people

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.850
traveling to South Africa during that time.
We would like to convince them to also take

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.160
a look at some of the tourist attractions
that exist in all of the countries over the

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.540
continent. To visit other countries on their
way here, or on the way back. And we are doing

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.960
this through a project which we developed
in the NEPAD e-Africa Commission to promote

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.001
the event and indicate various countries,
how they might be able to benefit in the two

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:01.920
ways that I have mentioned.
