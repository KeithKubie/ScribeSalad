00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:22.233
(Zombie noises) Doctor 1: So, here we are again.

00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:26.717
You know, I've been thinking. Why is this thing so angry?

00:00:26.717 --> 00:00:28.800
Doctor 2: Maybe he's just hungry.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.484
D1: (Laughs) I'm not going in there to feed it.

00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:35.584
No, this seems like something very primal.

00:00:35.584 --> 00:00:37.167
D2: This is kind of a hard one,

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:41.834
because we don't really have any biological definitions for emotions like anger.

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:47.533
Sure, brain imaging studies have shown that some brain regions are more active when people are angry,

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:50.233
but these are almost always correlational.

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:52.602
When it's warmer outside, people wear less clothing,

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:56.102
but if I strip down to my birthday suit, it doesn't make it sunny.

00:00:56.102 --> 00:00:59.101
D1: (Laughs) It's like having someone run on a treadmill and saying

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:03.033
"Look at how much more his arms move when he runs faster!

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:05.901
The arms must be where running happens."

00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:09.518
D2: That's why working with people with brain lesions is so important to neuroscience.

00:01:09.518 --> 00:01:14.334
It adds some causal evidence that a brain area might be required for a behavior.

00:01:14.334 --> 00:01:16.301
Same with brain simulation studies.

00:01:16.301 --> 00:01:19.634
If stimulating a brain area causes a behavior,

00:01:19.634 --> 00:01:23.466
then that's good evidence that the brain region is involved in that behavior.

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:26.501
So like studies with cats in the 1950s

00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:30.650
showed that stimulating a small almond-shaped area deep in the brain called the amygdala

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.716
leads to aggressive or predatory behaviors.

00:01:33.716 --> 00:01:35.851
These things look pretty aggressive to me.

00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:39.701
D1: Right. But other studies have shown that stimulating different parts of the amygdala

00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:42.001
can actually suppress predatory behaviors.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.651
So it's kind of a complicated little brain structure.

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:49.017
D2: Yeah. And fMRI studies have found that the amygdala is active in violent criminals.

00:01:49.017 --> 00:01:51.301
D1: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Careful there.

00:01:51.301 --> 00:01:54.884
Just because criminals have the same active brain regions as people who are angry,

00:01:54.884 --> 00:01:57.435
doesn't mean that they're inherently aggressive.

00:01:57.435 --> 00:02:00.984
That's like saying because I kiss with the same face hole that I use to burp,

00:02:00.984 --> 00:02:03.251
then these two things are related.

00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:04.934
It's a false equivalence.

00:02:04.934 --> 00:02:07.483
D2: Huh! Never thought of it like that. That's a good point.

00:02:07.483 --> 00:02:11.083
D1: You know, the amygdala is part of the Papez circuit.

00:02:11.083 --> 00:02:16.766
This system was discovered by James Papez, who used the rabies virus to lesion different areas in the cat's brain.

00:02:16.766 --> 00:02:21.033
He found that the amygdala was physically connected to another region called the hippocampus --

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:26.616
a little seahorse-shaped area that is needed to turn short-term memories into long-term memories.

00:02:26.616 --> 00:02:29.701
It's thought that this connection between the amygdala and hippocampus

00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:31.584
links emotion and memory together,

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:35.867
so that you remember really emotional stuff better than boring everyday things.

00:02:35.867 --> 00:02:41.216
D2: Yeah, like Patient H.M. In the 1950s, surgeons removed both his left and right hippocampuses

00:02:41.216 --> 00:02:42.866
to treat his epilepsy.

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:47.617
But after the surgery, he couldn't remember any new information for longer than a few minutes.

00:02:47.617 --> 00:02:51.034
Zombies appear to be pretty forgetful, wouldn't you agree?

00:02:51.034 --> 00:02:54.470
D1: (Laughs) Absolutely. Between the amygdala-related aggression,

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.120
and memory deficits from the hippocampus,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.402
Papez may have actually accidentally created the first zombie cat.

00:03:01.402 --> 00:03:04.652
D2: Aw, come on now, let's not get carried away.

00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:08.069
But now we do have some testable hypotheses.

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.752
I'd put money on its aggression and memory problems being linked to abnormalities

00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:14.703
in its amygdala and hippocampus, respectively.

00:03:14.703 --> 00:03:18.569
D1: Great! So all we need to do now is figure out how to experimentally test this.

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.937
Do you think it'll let us examine its brain to verify our hypothesis?

00:03:22.937 --> 00:03:28.053
D2: Uh, you know, I think I might be more comfortable not knowing the answer to this one.

00:03:28.053 --> 00:03:34.170
D1: Hmm. Maybe we could get a graduate student to do it for us?
