00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:05.790
Man, the ringing is really loud today huh?
Wait, what do you mean I’m the only one

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.760
that can hear it? Ohhh that’s awkward.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.380
Hey Guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.221
The Hearing Health Foundation estimates that
right now as many as 50 million people in

00:00:19.221 --> 00:00:23.820
the US hear something that isn’t there.
A ringing, a buzz, a hiss, a crackle or pop,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.180
are all the sounds tinnitus can make. And
in 90% of people with tinnitus, it’s caused

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.789
by hearing loss, through aging, noise exposure
or an accident.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.239
So how can sound damage your hearing? Well
Tara talk did a good explainer on that in

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.539
a previous video, check out a link to that
in the description below.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.899
In a nutshell, sometimes the energy from the
loud sounds or from prolonged exposure can

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.049
damage the coating of the auditory nerve that
carries sound signals to the brain.

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:49.139
And once these cells are gone. They’re gone
for good.

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:54.339
But how does that cause a ringing in the ears?
Neuroscientists at Georgetown University Medical

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.329
Center say the annoying and sometimes debilitating
sounds are the brain trying to repair itself.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.469
A loud noise or extended exposure to noise
raises the activity of certain neurons in

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.439
the brain. For most people, these neurons
calm themselves after a while, but for those

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.549
with tinnitus, these cells remain hyperactive.
It’s like your nervous system is trying

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.190
to overcompensate for the loss, but instead
makes everything noisy.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.030
Tinnitus can be debilitating. An estimated
2 million people find their lives seriously

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.800
impacted by it. Not only can you not hear
things that well, like your buddy next to

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.582
you at the bar, but you have a constant ringing
in your ear. You might never hear the sweet

00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:31.439
sound of silence again. This can make a lot
of people anxious and have trouble sleeping.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.399
I don’t mean to sound like a stodgy old
person, but hearing loss is serious. The World

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.219
Health Organization estimates that over a
BILLION that’s right, that’s with a b,

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.369
are at risk for hearing loss. And it doesn’t
just affect old people. For the past two years,

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.500
I’ve had constant ringing in my left ear
and some nasty hearing loss, probably from

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.420
listening to music too loud. I’m like an
old lady always saying “what did you say?

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.229
Speak up Sonny!”. Trust me it’s not a
good time. And I’m not alone, The WHO estimates

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.329
that over 43 million young people between
the ages of 12–35 years live with disabling

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:05.329
hearing loss.

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.110
Some studies, like one published in JAMA showed
that hearing loss in young folks is on the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.000
rise. Ten years ago 1 in 5 adolescents suffered
hearing loss in 2005-2006 and the rate is

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.280
increasing. The WHO says that half of all
teens and young adults are exposed to unsafe

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.010
sound levels from personal audio devices.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.690
Worst of all there’s no real treatment,
once your hearing is gone, it’s gone. Humans

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.560
can’t regenerate hair cells in the inner
ear like some birds and reptiles can. So prevention

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.900
is key. Take ear plugs to concerts, turn down
those headphones, and take a break when you’re

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.900
in a noisy environment.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:47.190
Alright guys, do you guys ever get that annoying
ringing in your ears after a concert or listening

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.909
to music?
