00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.860
JAMES GRIME: One of the reasons
we're fascinated by

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.550
primes is that they are quite
weird in the way they behave.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.180
On one hand, they kind
of feel random.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.760
They are turning up all
over the place.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.740
Sometimes you have these long
gaps between primes.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.580
And then suddenly-- like buses,
you get a couple of

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.060
primes turn up at once.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.690
On the other hand, there are
things that we can predict

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.240
about primes and when they're
going to turn up, which is

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.030
slightly unexpected that
you can do that.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.590
They're not completely random.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.440
One of the first things I want
to show you, then, is a nice

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.030
easy thing.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.160
So everyone can do
this at home.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.520
We're going to write the numbers
in a square spiral.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.160
Start with 1 in the middle.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.750
Then you write 2.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.110
But you go around it--

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.100
4, 5, 6, 7, 8-- do you see
the pattern, then?

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.610
It's a square spiral.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.110
12, 13, 14, 15--

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.640
it's called an Ulam spiral--

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.400
Stanislaw Ulam, he was a
Polish mathematician.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.240
And he left Poland just
before World War II,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.770
and he went to America.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.530
And he worked on the
Manhattan Project.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.690
After World War II, he
went into academia.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.680
The story of this spiral is,
he sat in a very boring

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.610
lecture in academia.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.780
It was in 1963.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.580
And so he's obviously a fan
of Vi Hart or someone.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.870
He sat there doodling during
this boring lecture.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.140
And he's writing out
the numbers.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.540
Let's see, 30, 31, 32.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.920
The next thing he
did was start to

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.640
circle the prime numbers.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.270
So let's do that.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:49.240
2 is a prime, and then 3, and
then 5, and 7, and 11, 13, not

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.590
40, 41, 43, is prime,
and so on.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.330
And he noticed, and maybe you
can see, these stripes, the

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.060
prime numbers seem to be lining
up on diagonal lines.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.740
And if you do this larger, if
you do more and more numbers,

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.789
and you write them out
in a spiral, that

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.340
tends to be the case.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.260
I've got one here.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.510
This is a big Ulam spiral.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.566
I think this is something
huge.

00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:18.660
I think this is like
200 by 200.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.230
And so there's 40,000 numbers
or something here.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.470
Can you see, though, can
you see the stripes?

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.040
There's definitely some
stripes here,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.070
these diagonal lines.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.695
So prime numbers seem to be
lying on diagonal lines.

00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:35.940
Or to put it another way, some
diagonal lines have lots of

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.650
primes, and some diagonal
lines don't

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.430
have lots of primes.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.300
So you can see the stripes
start to form.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.760
BRADY HARAN: Are they
continuous stripes?

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.200
They look a bit broken
up to me.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.780
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, they are
not continuous stripes.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.630
But they have more than average
number of primes.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.248
So these stripes might be a good
place to look for more

00:02:57.248 --> 00:02:59.310
primes, bigger primes,
new primes.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.830
One thing people might say is,
oh, we're just seeing patterns

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.500
in randomness.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.080
Those aren't really
stripes at all.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.440
It's just the human brain.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.140
See, if you compare it
with randomness--

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.296
this, the same size, these
are random numbers.

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:19.500
And you can see, it's pretty
much white noise.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.110
I can't really see any
pattern in this.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.190
You can see that
that is random.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.350
And you can see that that
is something more

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.930
than just being random.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.030
BRADY HARAN: These ginormous
primes that get found, are

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.350
they found on diagonals?

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.470
Like this largest prime known,
was that on diagonal?

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.180
JAMES GRIME: The largest prime
known was a Mersenne prime,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.920
which is of the type 2 to
the power n minus 1.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.640
It's one less than a power of 2,
which is a way to look for

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.390
large primes.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.580
It's computationally kind
of easier to do.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.900
Perhaps it's not the most
fruitful way because they are

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.470
quite rare, Mersenne primes.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.040
This might be another way to
do it because this stripe

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.620
here, this diagonal,
has an equation.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.420
This equation is for this one
here, this half line, which

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.439
means it starts at three and
goes off to infinity.

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:27.980
The equation for that is 4x
squared minus 2x plus 1.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.830
Let me just try it.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.420
Let's do the first one here.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.600
So if x is equal to
1, yeah, that's 3.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.600
If we tried the next one here,
x equals 2, it's 13.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.280
And this one here, that's 31.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.920
And well, best do one more, just
to show you what comes

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.550
next, 56 plus 57--

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.140
is that a prime number, Brady?

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.072
BRADY HARAN: 57 is not
a prime number.

00:04:54.072 --> 00:04:54.980
JAMES GRIME: It's not
a prime number.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.280
So the next one isn't a prime
number, but 57 would be the

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.090
next number on that line.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.600
BRADY HARAN: So that's one of
the breaks in our dotted line?

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.110
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, so all these
lines, the, in fact,

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.220
horizontal lines, vertical
lines, and diagonal lines,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.830
they are all like this.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.030
All the quadratic equations
are like that.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.980
So what we're saying is, some
quadratic equations have more

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.890
primes on them than others.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.140
And that's the conjecture,
actually.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.400
That hasn't been proved.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.690
But that is the conjecture.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.690
It seems to be the case.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.600
So there are lines here that
have seven times as many

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.170
primes as other lines.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.930
And the best we've found is a
diagonal line that has 12

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.890
times as many primes
as the average.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.750
BRADY HARAN: Cool, has
that line got a name?

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.808
JAMES GRIME: I can write
it out for you.

00:05:46.808 --> 00:05:47.830
I think I had it somewhere.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.912
BRADY HARAN: Yeah, I'd love
to know what that line is.

00:05:49.912 --> 00:05:51.434
The golden line.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:54.240
JAMES GRIME: This golden line
that Brady has now decided to

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.500
call it, it's a quadratic
equation.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.770
It starts off quite
simply again.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.900
But the number you add
on is not plus one.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.890
It's plus something huge.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.090
This square spiral is called
Ulam's spiral.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.760
But there's one that
I like even more.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.230
It's called a Sack's spiral.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.320
And it works like this.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.940
You write the square
number in a line.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.390
The square numbers are 1, 4,
yeah, that is 2 squared, 3

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.770
squared is 9, 16,
25, and so on.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.330
So you write the square
numbers in a line.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.170
Then I connect them with what
is called an Archimedean

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.180
spiral like that.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.110
And then I would the other
numbers on that spiral and

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.100
evenly space it.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:55.050
So it goes 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.510
And if you mark off the primes
for that, I've got this

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:04.610
already sorted out for you, this
is the picture you get.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.810
And you can see the relations,
you can see the pattern, even

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.570
more strikingly, I think.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:10.720
Look at these curves.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.145
These are the primes.

00:07:12.145 --> 00:07:13.870
BRADY HARAN: And obviously,
you'll never get a prime along

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.270
there because those
are the squares.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.410
JAMES GRIME: Those are your
squares, that big gap there is

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.550
the squares.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:24.010
So it looks like we have
formulas, equations--

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.000
some formulas, anyway, that have
more primes than others.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.540
So if we can understand these
formulas that contain these

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:39.420
rich number of primes, then it
would help us solve important

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.650
conjectures in mathematics
such as the Goldbach

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.550
conjecture and the twin
prime conjecture.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:52.340
So prime numbers are not as
random as you might think of.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.960
There are equations to help
us find prime numbers.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.000
And now I want to show you some
equations that help you

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.630
find prime numbers.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.540
BRADY HARAN: So we'll have more
about ways to search for

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.210
prime numbers coming really soon
from this interview with

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.700
James Grime--

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.580
unless you're watching this in
the future, in which case this

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.560
stuff might already
be on YouTube.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.430
But you get the idea.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.150
But, I have a bit of a
confession to make.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.910
I've actually recorded some
stuff about the spirals and

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.370
prime numbers before--

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.740
not with James Grime, but
with James Clewett.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.660
And I kind of half forgot about
it and never got around

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.390
to editing it.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.429
This was, like, a year
and a half ago.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.630
I went back and had a look,
and it was actually really

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.490
interesting.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.120
So I've turned that into
a video as well.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.030
Now you can wait for that turn
up in your subscriptions, in

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.620
the next few days, or if you
can't wait, you can go and

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.630
have a look at it now.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.980
I've made the links available.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.900
The video's already up, so
go ahead and have a look.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.170
Thanks for watching.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.946
Plenty more videos, both of
stuff I've recorded, some of

00:08:55.946 --> 00:08:59.160
it quite a while ago, it turns
out, and stuff we've

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.250
still got to record.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.320
Really exciting stuff coming
soon on "Numberphile," so make

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.570
sure you've subscribed.
