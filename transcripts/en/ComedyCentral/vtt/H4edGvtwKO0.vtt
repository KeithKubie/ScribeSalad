  - â™ª Four and three
  and two and one

00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:09.976 size:88% position:44%
  - What's up, guys?

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.544 align:start position:0%
  I'm Matt FX and this is
  the Broad City music recap

00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:13.813 size:88% position:44%
  for episode nine,
  Apartment Hunters.

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:16.082 align:start size:88% position:13%
This is actually my last
recap for Broad City,

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:18.518
 but it also happens to be my
 favorite episode musically.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:19.919
 So let's just jump right in.

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:21.721 align:start size:88% position:13%
In this episode we
have a track called Qrs

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:24.190
 by a mysterious new
 producer called VHVL.

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:27.060
 All I really know about her
 is that her name is Veronica.

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:28.428
 The track runs under
 the really cool scene

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:29.996 align:start size:88% position:13%
 where Alanna's getting
 high in an attempt

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.697
to remember where her remote is.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.034
 And it was perfect with this
 woozy, kind of flowy feeling.

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:37.771
 (dreamy music)

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.611
 - Last year,

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:48.882 align:start size:88% position:13%
Brooklyn, real
department of Flatbush.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.853
 Living room,

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:55.388
 couch.

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:56.956 size:84% position:42%
  Sex on the couch.

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:03.396
Bad sex.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.131
Really bad sex.

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:06.833
 The worst sex.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.067
 Dale!

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.735 size:88% position:44%
  - If you check it
  out on SoundCloud,

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:11.571 size:88% position:44%
  you'll see that VHVL's got
  a really awesome penchant

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:13.906 align:start size:88% position:13%
 for eerie atmospheric
 Hip Hop beats.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.341
 They're kind of in the
 vein of Flying Lotus

00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:17.543
 or even like a zombie J Dilla.

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:19.011
I'm really excited to
see what she does next,

00:01:19.044 --> 00:01:20.546 align:start size:88% position:13%
 so I'm definitely
 keeping an eye on her,

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:21.881 size:88% position:44%
 and you should too.

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:23.182 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Just wanted to
 highlight a couple of

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:24.984
the transitions in the episode.

00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:27.186 align:start size:88% position:13%
 We've got a really
 cool transition by an
 artist called Kuhn,

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.590 align:start size:88% position:13%
also a contributor to
the Astro Nautica label.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.859
 The song is called Even Bears,
 and it runs under the scene

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:35.394
 where Amy Sedaris, our
 special guest realtor,

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:37.430 size:84% position:42%
  is driving the girls from
  apartment to apartment.

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:41.033
 - (beeping) Kio robot.

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:43.002 size:88% position:44%
  (screeching tires)

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:44.103 size:88% position:44%
  - Come on, let's hurry up.

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:46.606
 I gotta get home and
 feed my Oscar fish.

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.174 size:84% position:42%
  - Are we just leaving it?

00:01:48.207 --> 00:01:50.576 size:88% position:44%
 - One of my favorite things
 about working on Broad City

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.945 align:start position:0%
  is as a DJ I've been
  able to pull out a lot of

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:55.381
 exclusive, unreleased tracks
 now that I've gotten them

00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:57.283
 in submission from the show.

00:01:57.316 --> 00:02:00.153 align:start position:0%
 One of these tracks is a
 track called Tribal Beat V.2.

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:03.156 align:start position:0%
Still a demo by an artist
who's getting a lot of traction

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.690
 right now named Sweater Beats.

00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:06.959
 One is transitioned right
 before the creep's apartment

00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:09.028
 and I know this song
 is gonna be a banger

00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:10.663 size:84% position:42%
  when it comes out
  later this year.

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:13.166
 (techno music)

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.603
- Room is available now.

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:19.705 size:88% position:44%
 So this is the living room.

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:20.540 size:88% position:44%
  - Oh, man.

00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:23.843 align:start position:0%
 - And that was my last
 recap for Broad City music,

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:26.045
episode 109, Apartment Hunters.

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:27.380
There's no recap for next week.

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:28.681 size:84% position:42%
  It's all classical music.

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:31.184
 Shoutouts to Mozart,
 Bach and Vivaldi.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:33.085
 It's been a real honor
 working on Broad City,

00:02:33.118 --> 00:02:35.321
 and I'm really excited that
 we're getting a second season.

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:37.089
 Thank you so much for
