how well do experts actually do in terms
 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.530
how well do experts actually do in terms
of their predictions how do we measure

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540
of their predictions how do we measure
 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.470
of their predictions how do we measure
the accuracy of expert predictions how

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480
the accuracy of expert predictions how
 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.840

better math and science education where

and and that caused so much
 

00:12:21.329 --> 00:12:22.549
and and that caused so much

to go still so hopefully I can make a

great so let me also be brief I want to

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:39.660
great so let me also be brief I want to
 

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.889
great so let me also be brief I want to
ask four questions and then partly when

00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:42.899
ask four questions and then partly when

I have fun occasionally at Nate's

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:44.970
I have fun occasionally at Nate's
 

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.960
I have fun occasionally at Nate's
expense so the first question is why is

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:47.970
expense so the first question is why is
 

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.150
expense so the first question is why is
Nate solver so good what can we learn

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160
Nate solver so good what can we learn
 

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.150
Nate solver so good what can we learn
from that the second question is is nate

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160
from that the second question is is nate
 

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.240
from that the second question is is nate
silver any good

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:55.250

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.710
silver any good
third question is can you do better than

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720
third question is can you do better than
 

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.590
third question is can you do better than
nate silver and then the fourth question

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600
nate silver and then the fourth question
 

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.019
nate silver and then the fourth question
is how we can is is really what the what

00:13:03.019 --> 00:13:03.029
is how we can is is really what the what
 

00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:05.150
is how we can is is really what the what
what what's the future polling and how

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160
what what's the future polling and how
 

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.310
what what's the future polling and how
we can do better so why is nate silver

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320
we can do better so why is nate silver
 

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.380
we can do better so why is nate silver
so good at forecasting elections he

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:09.390
so good at forecasting elections he
 

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.370
so good at forecasting elections he
actually just described it what he's

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:10.380
actually just described it what he's
 

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.800
actually just described it what he's
doing is actually incredibly simple it's

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:12.810
doing is actually incredibly simple it's
 

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.170
doing is actually incredibly simple it's
based on I think three observations

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:14.180
based on I think three observations
 

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.280
based on I think three observations
looking at many polls is better than

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:16.290
looking at many polls is better than
 

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:19.420
looking at many polls is better than
looking at one poll it's kind of obvious

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:19.430
looking at one poll it's kind of obvious
 

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.889
looking at one poll it's kind of obvious
figuring out whether a poll is biased is

00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:21.899
figuring out whether a poll is biased is
 

00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:23.530
figuring out whether a poll is biased is
better than just taking it at face value

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:23.540
better than just taking it at face value
 

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.170
better than just taking it at face value
it's kind of obvious and polling is not

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180
it's kind of obvious and polling is not
 

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.240
it's kind of obvious and polling is not
the only information that we have and so

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:29.250
the only information that we have and so
 

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.230
the only information that we have and so
you need to take account of other

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240
you need to take account of other
 

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.840
you need to take account of other
information and uncertainty as well it's

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:32.850
information and uncertainty as well it's
 

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.699
information and uncertainty as well it's
also kind of obvious in fact much of

00:13:34.699 --> 00:13:34.709
also kind of obvious in fact much of
 

00:13:34.709 --> 00:13:36.650
also kind of obvious in fact much of
what Nate's doing and he's been explicit

what Nate's doing and he's been explicit
 

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.780
what Nate's doing and he's been explicit
about this and much of his work has been

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:38.790
about this and much of his work has been

about this and much of his work has been
happening in political science from the

that what we're gonna need is lots of
 

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:09.970

Nate actually made important
contributions to that but I think the

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080
contributions to that but I think the
 

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.540

a poll instead well the Google poll that

did really well and other polls that

00:43:30.699 --> 00:43:30.709

this year so I think that that's kind of

00:43:37.719 --> 00:43:37.729
this year so I think that that's kind of
 

00:43:37.729 --> 00:43:40.620
this year so I think that that's kind of
more likely to be the the game-changer

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:40.630
more likely to be the the game-changer
 

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:43.380
more likely to be the the game-changer
so let me add just two things to that so

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:43.390
so let me add just two things to that so

which you then have to calibrate which

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:27.980
and at that point it seemed like the
 

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:31.420
and at that point it seemed like the
Romney polling team saw it more or less

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:31.430
Romney polling team saw it more or less
 

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:33.010
Romney polling team saw it more or less
as the public polls did which at that

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:33.020
as the public polls did which at that
 

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:35.080
as the public polls did which at that
point had Romney narrowly behind but you

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:35.090
point had Romney narrowly behind but you
 

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:37.090
point had Romney narrowly behind but you
had a lot of time in the campaign still

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:37.100
had a lot of time in the campaign still
 

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:38.890
had a lot of time in the campaign still
you had a lot of uncertainty about what

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:38.900
you had a lot of uncertainty about what
 

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.780
you had a lot of uncertainty about what
might happen still toward the end of a

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:40.790
might happen still toward the end of a
 

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:43.030
might happen still toward the end of a
campaign is when the polls become much

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040
campaign is when the polls become much
 

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.440
campaign is when the polls become much
more reliable and so that's when you

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:44.450
more reliable and so that's when you
 

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:47.140
more reliable and so that's when you
might have the problems with with denial

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:47.150
might have the problems with with denial
 

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:48.970
might have the problems with with denial
right where if you're down by if you're

00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:48.980
right where if you're down by if you're
 

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:51.840
right where if you're down by if you're
down by two points in September it means

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:51.850
down by two points in September it means
 

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:55.060
down by two points in September it means
well let's shift our message a bit and

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:55.070
well let's shift our message a bit and
 

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:56.830
well let's shift our message a bit and
we can win what's the big deal if you're

00:51:56.830 --> 00:51:56.840
we can win what's the big deal if you're
 

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.840
we can win what's the big deal if you're
down by two points on election eve you

00:51:58.840 --> 00:51:58.850
down by two points on election eve you
 

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:00.820
down by two points on election eve you
probably gonna lose that election ninety

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:00.830
probably gonna lose that election ninety
 

00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:02.140

harder to tell to deliver that news to
 

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:07.510

making a forecast you know my view is a
 

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:32.300

theory isn't worth very much if it
 

00:58:32.310 --> 00:58:34.160

doesn't make good predictions in the

long run of course there are reasons
 

00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:38.300
long run of course there are reasons
that even you know that I face that

when you can't really test whether it
 

00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:44.720

but it's a way to avoid accountability I

00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:48.630
but it's a way to avoid accountability I
 

00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:51.410
but it's a way to avoid accountability I
think in a lot of respects you know a

00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:51.420
think in a lot of respects you know a
 

00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:53.270
think in a lot of respects you know a
lot of the theory I mean the disturbing

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280
lot of the theory I mean the disturbing
 

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.130
lot of the theory I mean the disturbing
thing to me is that in cases where we

00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:55.140
thing to me is that in cases where we
 

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:57.470
thing to me is that in cases where we
have been able to look at a lot of data

00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480
have been able to look at a lot of data
 

00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:59.510
have been able to look at a lot of data
and see how well experts are doing

00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520
and see how well experts are doing
 

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.640
and see how well experts are doing
overall when it comes to forecasting the

result with some exceptions is generally
 

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:05.570
result with some exceptions is generally
not very good right and that's the stuff

00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:05.580
not very good right and that's the stuff
 

00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:08.170
not very good right and that's the stuff
that we can actually test and usually

00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:08.180
that we can actually test and usually
 

00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:10.700
that we can actually test and usually
usually testability is a good criteria

00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:10.710
usually testability is a good criteria
 

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:12.770
usually testability is a good criteria
for for science right so that means all

00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:12.780
for for science right so that means all
 

00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:14.510

the theories which which aren't tested

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520
the theories which which aren't tested
 

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:16.940
the theories which which aren't tested
might be even worse potentially so it's

00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:16.950
might be even worse potentially so it's
 

00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:19.190
might be even worse potentially so it's
a little disturbing I think well there

00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200
a little disturbing I think well there
 

00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.660
a little disturbing I think well there
there's one factor you're missing here

00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:20.670
there's one factor you're missing here
 

00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:23.270
there's one factor you're missing here
which is so I have tenure I could come

which is so I have tenure I could come
 

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.070
which is so I have tenure I could come

those incentives it's even more

00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:34.920
those incentives it's even more
 

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:36.410
those incentives it's even more
surprising that I'm not making more

00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:36.420
surprising that I'm not making more
 

00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:41.020

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:43.310

that forecasting economic issues in some

00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:46.560
that forecasting economic issues in some
 

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:48.320
that forecasting economic issues in some
ways is much harder than forecasting

00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:48.330
ways is much harder than forecasting
 

00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:50.300
ways is much harder than forecasting
elections especially when you get up

00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:50.310
elections especially when you get up
 

00:59:50.310 --> 00:59:52.550
elections especially when you get up
close to the election right so that you

00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:52.560
close to the election right so that you
 

00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.410
close to the election right so that you
touched on this earlier I mean the the

00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:54.420
touched on this earlier I mean the the
 

00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:55.790
touched on this earlier I mean the the
predictions get more accurate as you get

00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:55.800
predictions get more accurate as you get
 

00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:58.310
predictions get more accurate as you get
closer to the event and I'm surprised

00:59:58.310 --> 00:59:58.320
closer to the event and I'm surprised
 

00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:02.230
closer to the event and I'm surprised
that neither of you commented on that

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240
that neither of you commented on that
 

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.940
that neither of you commented on that
yes well I mean you know there's a lot

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:04.950
yes well I mean you know there's a lot
 

01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:07.130
yes well I mean you know there's a lot
of noise and economic data and it's a

01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:07.140
of noise and economic data and it's a
 

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:08.540
of noise and economic data and it's a
very basic thing where you know why is

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:08.550
very basic thing where you know why is
 

01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:10.390
very basic thing where you know why is
it hard as just was saying to forecast

01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400
it hard as just was saying to forecast
 

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.470
it hard as just was saying to forecast
non-farm payrolls well there a lot of

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480
non-farm payrolls well there a lot of
 

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.610
non-farm payrolls well there a lot of
reasons but one is that there's a big

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:13.620
reasons but one is that there's a big
 

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:15.530
reasons but one is that there's a big
sampling error right I think the

01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:15.540
sampling error right I think the
 

01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:18.110
sampling error right I think the
sampling error alone is like when

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:18.120
sampling error alone is like when
 

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.600
sampling error alone is like when
standard errors like 70,000 jobs per

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:20.610
standard errors like 70,000 jobs per
 

01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:21.680
standard errors like 70,000 jobs per
month there's something and then so

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:21.690
month there's something and then so
 

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:24.470
month there's something and then so
you'll have reports where it's like the

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480
you'll have reports where it's like the
 

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.990
you'll have reports where it's like the
numbers forecasted to be 130 K and it

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000
numbers forecasted to be 130 K and it
 

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.600
numbers forecasted to be 130 K and it
comes in at 110 K it's like Oh gigantic

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:29.610
comes in at 110 K it's like Oh gigantic
 

01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:31.670
comes in at 110 K it's like Oh gigantic
gigantic miss like really that's better

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680
gigantic miss like really that's better
 

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.500
gigantic miss like really that's better

01:00:35.810 --> 01:00:35.820
right but people don't communicate that

right but people don't communicate that
very well and so by the way so there's a

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:37.410
very well and so by the way so there's a
 

01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:41.330
very well and so by the way so there's a

course you would find several variables
that might be better the consensus but I

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:45.810
that might be better the consensus but I
 

01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:48.289
that might be better the consensus but I
would still use the consensus index

01:09:48.289 --> 01:09:48.299
would still use the consensus index
 

01:09:48.299 --> 01:09:49.880
would still use the consensus index
number instead because I think it would

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:49.890
number instead because I think it would
 

01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:51.740
number instead because I think it would
perform better over the long run so you

01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:51.750
perform better over the long run so you
 

01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:52.939
perform better over the long run so you
do have to make judgments like that and

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:52.949
do have to make judgments like that and
 

01:09:52.949 --> 01:09:54.170
do have to make judgments like that and
hopefully they're informed by the kind

works in forecasting it so there's an

01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:57.480

01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.850

interesting body of work in psychology

01:09:58.850 --> 01:09:58.860

known as policy capturing in which

01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280
known as policy capturing in which
 

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.010
known as policy capturing in which
researchers try to create a statistical

researchers try to create a statistical
 

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:06.530
researchers try to create a statistical
model of the expert they try to create a

01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:06.540
model of the expert they try to create a
 

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:07.820
model of the expert they try to create a
gist achill model that captures the

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:07.830
gist achill model that captures the

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840
queue utilization strategy of the expert
 

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.560
queue utilization strategy of the expert
so you could create it's just a

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:12.570
so you could create it's just a
 

01:10:12.570 --> 01:10:13.760
so you could create it's just a
statistical model of a group of

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:13.770
statistical model of a group of
 

01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:15.380
statistical model of a group of
radiologists and how they make judgments

01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:15.390
radiologists and how they make judgments
 

01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:16.790
radiologists and how they make judgments
and then you'd compare what's more

01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800
and then you'd compare what's more
 

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.500
and then you'd compare what's more
accurate is it the expert or the model

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:18.510
accurate is it the expert or the model
 

01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:20.350
accurate is it the expert or the model
of the expert in a cross-validation

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:20.360
of the expert in a cross-validation
 

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.030
of the expert in a cross-validation
right so you could in principle do that

01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040
right so you could in principle do that
 

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.500
right so you could in principle do that
with Nate Silver - right you could have

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:24.510
with Nate Silver - right you could have
 

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:27.370
with Nate Silver - right you could have
Nate Silver and a model and we

01:10:27.370 --> 01:10:27.380
Nate Silver and a model and we
 

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:29.439
Nate Silver and a model and we
against each other I think that'd be

01:10:29.439 --> 01:10:29.449
against each other I think that'd be
 

01:10:29.449 --> 01:10:36.189
against each other I think that'd be
very frightening there is a macro

01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:36.199
very frightening there is a macro
 

01:10:36.199 --> 01:10:37.600
very frightening there is a macro
economics literature that does that so

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:37.610
economics literature that does that so
 

01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:40.120
economics literature that does that so
do you add judgment factors to the model

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:40.130
do you add judgment factors to the model
 

01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:41.910
do you add judgment factors to the model
so most of these Wall Street guys have a

01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920
so most of these Wall Street guys have a
 

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:44.500
so most of these Wall Street guys have a
principled model then they are judgments

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:44.510
principled model then they are judgments
 

01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:46.780
principled model then they are judgments
and my understanding of that literature

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:46.790
and my understanding of that literature
 

01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:48.490
and my understanding of that literature
is that those judgments actually do

01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:48.500
is that those judgments actually do
 

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:52.629
is that those judgments actually do
improve accuracy the psychologists more

01:10:52.629 --> 01:10:52.639
improve accuracy the psychologists more
 

01:10:52.639 --> 01:10:54.850
improve accuracy the psychologists more
skeptical the psychologists tend to find

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:54.860
skeptical the psychologists tend to find
 

01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:56.680
skeptical the psychologists tend to find
that the models outperform the experts

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:56.690
that the models outperform the experts
 

01:10:56.690 --> 01:10:58.990
that the models outperform the experts
from whom the models were derived so the

01:10:58.990 --> 01:10:59.000
from whom the models were derived so the
 

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.229
from whom the models were derived so the
psychological literature is but I think

01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239
psychological literature is but I think
 

01:11:02.239 --> 01:11:03.160
psychological literature is but I think
there have been a couple of exceptions

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:03.170
there have been a couple of exceptions
 

01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:05.979
there have been a couple of exceptions
that but I think the preponderance of

01:11:05.979 --> 01:11:05.989
that but I think the preponderance of
 

01:11:05.989 --> 01:11:07.390
that but I think the preponderance of
the evidence is that the models actually

01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:07.400
the evidence is that the models actually
 

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.629
the evidence is that the models actually
do better than the original experts

01:11:09.629 --> 01:11:09.639
do better than the original experts
 

01:11:09.639 --> 01:11:12.010
do better than the original experts
because the model tomorr consistent and

01:11:12.010 --> 01:11:12.020
because the model tomorr consistent and
 

01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:13.810
because the model tomorr consistent and
the experts get more distracted by

01:11:13.810 --> 01:11:13.820
the experts get more distracted by
 

01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:15.399
the experts get more distracted by
studio diagnostic use like you were

01:11:15.399 --> 01:11:15.409
studio diagnostic use like you were
 

01:11:15.409 --> 01:11:16.689
studio diagnostic use like you were
saying during elections about oh maybe

01:11:16.689 --> 01:11:16.699
saying during elections about oh maybe
 

01:11:16.699 --> 01:11:18.610
saying during elections about oh maybe
one or two but maybe you're really good

01:11:18.610 --> 01:11:18.620
one or two but maybe you're really good
 

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:20.140
one or two but maybe you're really good
at zeroing in on the sub then under

01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:20.150
at zeroing in on the sub then under
 

01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:21.669
at zeroing in on the sub then under
truly diagnostic use and discounting

01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679
truly diagnostic use and discounting
 

01:11:21.679 --> 01:11:23.290
truly diagnostic use and discounting
this the suits the HSU their diagnostic

01:11:23.290 --> 01:11:23.300
this the suits the HSU their diagnostic
 

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:26.410
this the suits the HSU their diagnostic
ones but Momo Momo most experts do get

01:11:26.410 --> 01:11:26.420
ones but Momo Momo most experts do get
 

01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:28.000
ones but Momo Momo most experts do get
distracted in them and the models don't

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:28.010
distracted in them and the models don't
 

01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:29.590
distracted in them and the models don't
get distracted by those things well yeah

01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600
get distracted by those things well yeah
 

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.740
get distracted by those things well yeah
I would say kind of a joe's question of

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:31.750
I would say kind of a joe's question of
 

01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:34.930
I would say kind of a joe's question of
when should you count for for subjective

01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:34.940
when should you count for for subjective
 

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:36.939
when should you count for for subjective
information and judgment calls of course

01:11:36.939 --> 01:11:36.949

how you define subjective information is

01:11:38.439 --> 01:11:38.449
how you define subjective information is
 

01:11:38.449 --> 01:11:40.479
how you define subjective information is
itself tricky but you know that that

01:11:40.479 --> 01:11:40.489
itself tricky but you know that that
 

01:11:40.489 --> 01:11:43.270
itself tricky but you know that that
ought to be an empirical question and

01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280
ought to be an empirical question and
 

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.229
ought to be an empirical question and
you can have a different answer in

01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239
you can have a different answer in
 

01:11:44.239 --> 01:11:47.020
you can have a different answer in
different fields I did a study of the

01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:47.030
different fields I did a study of the
 

01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:48.430
different fields I did a study of the
baseball forecasting program we had

01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:48.440
baseball forecasting program we had
 

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.709
baseball forecasting program we had
called pakoda compared it to the lists

01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719
called pakoda compared it to the lists
 

01:11:50.719 --> 01:11:52.899
called pakoda compared it to the lists
that were made by scouts and the scouts

01:11:52.899 --> 01:11:52.909
that were made by scouts and the scouts
 

01:11:52.909 --> 01:11:55.180
that were made by scouts and the scouts
actually their judgment actually did a

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:55.190
actually their judgment actually did a
 

01:11:55.190 --> 01:11:58.030
actually their judgment actually did a
fair bit better about 20% better than

01:11:58.030 --> 01:11:58.040
fair bit better about 20% better than
 

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.399
fair bit better about 20% better than
then my system alone did so that's a

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:00.409
then my system alone did so that's a
 

01:12:00.409 --> 01:12:02.500
then my system alone did so that's a
case where we're hey the scouts are

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:02.510
case where we're hey the scouts are
 

01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:04.330

money ball there are other cases where

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:06.230
money ball there are other cases where
 

01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:08.590
money ball there are other cases where
we're maybe in psychology where that

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:08.600
we're maybe in psychology where that
 

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.270
we're maybe in psychology where that
isn't the case but that's why I say we

01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:10.280
isn't the case but that's why I say we
 

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.070
isn't the case but that's why I say we
we need to collect data sets where we

01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080
we need to collect data sets where we
 

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.350
we need to collect data sets where we
actually can evaluate forecasters and

01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360
actually can evaluate forecasters and
 

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.010
actually can evaluate forecasters and
experts and see maybe there are some

01:12:17.010 --> 01:12:17.020
experts and see maybe there are some
 

01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:19.479
experts and see maybe there are some
heuristics kind of Maca used for when

01:12:19.479 --> 01:12:19.489
heuristics kind of Maca used for when
 

01:12:19.489 --> 01:12:21.189
heuristics kind of Maca used for when
judgment tends to help and when it

01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199
judgment tends to help and when it
 

01:12:21.199 --> 01:12:22.390

doesn't but we don't even have that many

01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400
doesn't but we don't even have that many
 

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:25.629
doesn't but we don't even have that many
case studies really to even even know in

a systematic way I don't think so let's

01:12:28.810 --> 01:12:28.820
a systematic way I don't think so let's
 

01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:31.360
a systematic way I don't think so let's
take a couple more questions

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:31.370
take a couple more questions
 

01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:38.060
take a couple more questions
perhaps upfront I'm an undergraduate at

01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:38.070

the University of Chicago and I had a

01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:54.020
prediction issues that were brought up
so I guess the first part is so what do

01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:54.030
so I guess the first part is so what do
 

01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:57.260

and so when you become an economist and

and so when you become an economist and
 

01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:43.880
and so when you become an economist and
you take econ classes you know that

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:43.890
you take econ classes you know that
 

01:13:43.890 --> 01:13:46.100
you take econ classes you know that

so you're worried you're very worried

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:17.250
so you're worried you're very worried
 

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:19.730
so you're worried you're very worried
about the role of ideology in economic

01:14:19.730 --> 01:14:19.740
about the role of ideology in economic
 

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:21.380
about the role of ideology in economic
forecasting and here I think you need to

01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:21.390
forecasting and here I think you need to
 

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:23.800
forecasting and here I think you need to
draw a sharp distinction between

a little bit addressed but they're they
 

01:15:10.389 --> 01:15:12.629
a little bit addressed but they're they
have a very very strong truth motivation

they're one the big bias they have two

01:15:15.719 --> 01:15:15.729
they're one the big bias they have two
 

01:15:15.729 --> 01:15:18.109
they're one the big bias they have two
big biases one they're overconfident

01:15:18.109 --> 01:15:18.119
big biases one they're overconfident
 

01:15:18.119 --> 01:15:20.009
big biases one they're overconfident
because it turns out the role of

01:15:20.009 --> 01:15:20.019
because it turns out the role of
 

01:15:20.019 --> 01:15:22.109
because it turns out the role of
economic forecasters on Wall Street is

01:15:22.109 --> 01:15:22.119
economic forecasters on Wall Street is
 

01:15:22.119 --> 01:15:24.929
economic forecasters on Wall Street is
not in fact to forecast the economy it's

01:15:24.929 --> 01:15:24.939
not in fact to forecast the economy it's
 

01:15:24.939 --> 01:15:26.580
not in fact to forecast the economy it's
to go to lunch with clients and be

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:26.590
to go to lunch with clients and be
 

01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:30.719
to go to lunch with clients and be
eloquent and so effectively they are

01:15:30.719 --> 01:15:30.729
eloquent and so effectively they are
 

01:15:30.729 --> 01:15:33.600
eloquent and so effectively they are
sort of the paid entertainment and again

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:33.610
sort of the paid entertainment and again
 

01:15:33.610 --> 01:15:35.100
sort of the paid entertainment and again
you can't get a lunch with clients and

01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:35.110
you can't get a lunch with clients and
 

01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:36.750
you can't get a lunch with clients and
so you know the economy could go up it

01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:36.760
so you know the economy could go up it
 

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.520

making good assumptions about what might

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:24.490
making good assumptions about what might
 

01:19:24.490 --> 01:19:26.580
making good assumptions about what might
happen if if Liberal Democratic support

01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:26.590
happen if if Liberal Democratic support
 

01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:28.590
happen if if Liberal Democratic support
collapses where might it go and it

01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:28.600
collapses where might it go and it
 

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.930
collapses where might it go and it
turned out that a lot of went back to

01:19:30.930 --> 01:19:30.940
turned out that a lot of went back to
 

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:34.860
turned out that a lot of went back to
labour instead of - to the Tories so you

01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:34.870
labour instead of - to the Tories so you
 

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:36.450
labour instead of - to the Tories so you
know that kind of thing where you have

01:19:36.450 --> 01:19:36.460
know that kind of thing where you have
 

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:38.700
know that kind of thing where you have
to make more assumptions and and it

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:38.710
to make more assumptions and and it
 

01:19:38.710 --> 01:19:40.530
to make more assumptions and and it
makes things a lot harder but you know I

01:19:40.530 --> 01:19:40.540
makes things a lot harder but you know I
 

01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:42.540
makes things a lot harder but you know I
think there are some constants my

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:42.550
think there are some constants my
 

01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:44.850
think there are some constants my
understanding is that the the across a

understanding is that the the across a
 

01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:47.070
understanding is that the the across a
wide variety of context and economic

wide variety of context and economic
 

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:50.400

doing well but yeah being able to have a

doing well but yeah being able to have a
 

01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:57.300
doing well but yeah being able to have a
two-way election is is a lot simpler you

01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:57.310
two-way election is is a lot simpler you
 

01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:59.160
two-way election is is a lot simpler you
know in fact in art in our models that I

01:19:59.160 --> 01:19:59.170
know in fact in art in our models that I
 

01:19:59.170 --> 01:20:02.280

as being undecided voters in essence it

01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:05.960
as being undecided voters in essence it
 

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.689
as being undecided voters in essence it
adds so much more volatility where if

01:20:07.689 --> 01:20:07.699
adds so much more volatility where if
 

01:20:07.699 --> 01:20:10.150

know there's a lot more uncertainty

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:15.170
know there's a lot more uncertainty

there if we have a three-way race and in
2016 then it's gonna be the hard to

using these techniques and whether they
are using them to tailor candidate

01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:41.640
are using them to tailor candidate
 

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:44.300
are using them to tailor candidate

it's a much richer data set than just
