00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
With all of these considerations, let's imagine we're working on a traffic light system.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We have three colors in here, red, amber, and green.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, we have a little piece of code in here,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which impacted the traffic based on the traffic light.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's assume this is part of some traffic stimulation.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So, if the light is red, then the traffic should stop.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If the light is amber, then the traffic should prepare to stop.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And if the light is green, then the traffic should go.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, being good programmers, we always assume that something goes wrong

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
if the light is neither red nor amber nor green,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
which in principle shouldn't happen, which due to some bug could happen.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What should be here where the question mark is? I'll give you four choices.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
First, we print out "This can't happen," on the console

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
in the hope that somebody will eventually see it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Second, we raise an assertion exception.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We knew that the program will immediately abort.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Third, we write down assert false thereby clearly documenting that this is not expected.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Last option, you write down pass, which is a Python statement, which does nothing at all.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
After all, this bug in the traffic light may well eventually go away

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
at the next cycle when we actually go back into some defined state.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Which of these four is the best option to go down here

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
considering the pros and cons about assertion that we see over to you.
