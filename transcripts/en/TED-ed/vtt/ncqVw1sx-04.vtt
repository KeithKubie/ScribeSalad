Dear subscribers,

00:00:01.583 --> 00:00:04.316
there are over 250,000 of you now,

00:00:04.316 --> 00:00:06.084
a critical mass

00:00:06.084 --> 00:00:07.561
at a critical time.

00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:09.012
We have the cumulative potential

00:00:09.012 --> 00:00:11.289
to impact global education.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:13.575
I've been assembled and given a voice for this video

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:16.319
to describe one way to do just that.

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:20.323
Please allow me 2.5 minutes to explain.

00:00:20.323 --> 00:00:22.250
My name is TED-Ed

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.662
and I am a symbol for both the TED-Ed website

00:00:24.662 --> 00:00:27.275
and the billions of videos available to you for free

00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:29.611
on the website known as "YouTube".

00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:31.161
Today I invite you on a journey

00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:33.577
on which you will learn how to use

00:00:33.577 --> 00:00:35.719
ed.ted.com to create a lesson

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.917
around the vast majority of videos on the web.

00:00:38.917 --> 00:00:40.771
When I say, "create a lesson,"

00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:42.928
I mean that you may use the TED-Ed website

00:00:42.928 --> 00:00:45.282
to search for any video on YouTube.

00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:47.311
Once you find the perfect video,

00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:49.617
the one that really blows your hair back,

00:00:49.617 --> 00:00:51.082
helps you understand,

00:00:51.082 --> 00:00:53.047
or that makes you pause and say,

00:00:53.047 --> 00:00:56.471
"My goodness, the universe is a fascinating place!",

00:00:56.471 --> 00:00:59.233
you may use TED-Ed to enhance that video.

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:01.440
You might use the "Let's Begin" section

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.962
to set context for interpreting the video

00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:06.898
or to define a learning objective for your students.

00:01:06.898 --> 00:01:09.701
Or, you might use the "Think" section

00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:11.135
to add multiple choice questions

00:01:11.135 --> 00:01:13.443
with time-coded video hints

00:01:13.443 --> 00:01:14.738
or open answer questions

00:01:14.738 --> 00:01:18.041
that beg for thought-provoking, written responses.

00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:21.184
Or, perhaps you'll use the "Dig Deeper" section

00:01:21.184 --> 00:01:23.044
to expand upon the video with articles,

00:01:23.044 --> 00:01:23.949
references,

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:25.483
or links to an application,

00:01:25.483 --> 00:01:27.384
or maybe even your blog.

00:01:27.384 --> 00:01:29.261
If any feature is not your cup of tea,

00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:30.954
just click "Exclude".

00:01:30.954 --> 00:01:32.539
And this new feature, "Discuss,"

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.042
it lets you create riveting discussions

00:01:35.042 --> 00:01:36.891
around your favorite bits.

00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:40.163
Learners, you can engage with lessons independently.

00:01:40.163 --> 00:01:42.923
The site will save your answers, notes, and ideas

00:01:42.923 --> 00:01:44.382
to your personal profile

00:01:44.382 --> 00:01:46.334
and track your learning over time.

00:01:46.334 --> 00:01:48.179
New lessons are added every day.

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.708
Teachers, as you build or distribute customized lessons

00:01:51.708 --> 00:01:53.410
to individuals or to groups,

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.643
you may use the site to track the progress

00:01:55.643 --> 00:01:58.450
of single students or your entire class.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.150
And no matter who you are,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.349
if you take the time to create a particularly stunning lesson,

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:06.523
please also take the time to nominate it.

00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:08.049
We will systematically feature

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:09.727
the best community-made lessons

00:02:09.727 --> 00:02:12.064
within the ever-growing TED-Ed library,

00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:13.728
free for the world to learn from,

00:02:13.728 --> 00:02:15.591
to customize and to share.

00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:17.026
The possibilities of this tool

00:02:17.026 --> 00:02:19.428
are as infinite as YouTube itself.

00:02:19.428 --> 00:02:21.797
And, we will be adding new features regularly

00:02:21.797 --> 00:02:23.665
in the months and years to come.

00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:25.034
To join me and many others

00:02:25.034 --> 00:02:27.836
in building a library of lessons worth sharing,

00:02:27.836 --> 00:02:30.845
simply click on one of the features that interests you.

00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:32.250
Thank you for your time.
