00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.426
We've talked about what orders are and

00:00:02.426 --> 00:00:06.467
we've talked about what happens to
them when they get to the exchange.

00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:12.240
Let's talk now about how do the orders
get to the exchange from you.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.171
Well, here you are with your laptop
connected to the internet and

00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:19.111
you've just entered
an order to buy some stock.

00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:22.426
Your buy order goes over
the internet to your broker.

00:00:22.426 --> 00:00:26.110
Your broker in turn is connected
to several exchanges and

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.181
the broker determines
where to route your order

00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:33.310
based on information it
knows about the exchanges.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.210
Let's suppose the exchanges we're
looking at are New York Stock Exchange,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.090
NASDAQ and BATS.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.840
For the stocks you want to buy,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.851
each one of these exchanges
has its own order book.

00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:48.150
Your broker has a computer located
at each exchange and it queries

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.323
the computer to say, hey, look at the
order book and tell me the prices there.

00:00:53.323 --> 00:00:56.594
Query has added all the exchanges and
your broker gathers and

00:00:56.594 --> 00:00:59.098
examines that information and
based on that,

00:00:59.098 --> 00:01:02.257
routes your order to the exchange
that has the best price.

00:01:02.257 --> 00:01:04.424
Let's say that's
New York Stock Exchange.

00:01:04.424 --> 00:01:09.791
Your order enters the exchange,
gets executed and the price comes back

00:01:09.791 --> 00:01:14.904
to your broker and forwarded back
to you and you get a confirmation.

00:01:14.904 --> 00:01:19.099
Now it turns out that because this is
happening constantly all the time,

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:22.265
there's multiple brokers,
hundreds of thousands,

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:25.498
millions of people making
orders that the order books at

00:01:25.498 --> 00:01:28.560
each of these exchanges
tends to be pretty similar.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.568
In other words,

00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:33.605
the prices don't differ much between
one or another and it's this

00:01:33.605 --> 00:01:38.450
sort of pressure that keeps prices the
same across these different exchanges.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.270
Let's consider another scenario.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.238
Suppose there's another client
of this same brokerage, Joe and

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:47.866
that Joe wants to sell some stock.

00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:52.334
Well, the brokerage can observe, hey,
I've got some clients who want to sell,

00:01:52.334 --> 00:01:53.923
some clients who want to buy.

00:01:53.923 --> 00:01:56.497
I can just make that
exchange internally and

00:01:56.497 --> 00:01:58.939
I don't even need to
go to the exchanges.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.160
This can be advantageous for the broker,
because a broker doesn't have to

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.586
pay now fees to the exchanges for
this transaction to occur.

00:02:06.586 --> 00:02:10.020
However, according to the law,
both the seller and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.846
the buyer have to get prices that
are at least as good as they

00:02:13.846 --> 00:02:17.143
would've gotten if they
had gone to an exchange.

00:02:17.143 --> 00:02:19.507
And eventually, at the end of the day,

00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:23.456
this transaction has to be registered
with one of the exchanges.

00:02:23.456 --> 00:02:28.851
Usually, it's recorded at the exchange
where that particular stock is homed.

00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:31.133
Let's consider one more example.

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:34.538
In this case,
Lisa also wants to sell some stock, but

00:02:34.538 --> 00:02:37.120
she uses a different broker than you do.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.910
There's one more kind of entity
out there called a Dark Pool

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.590
that acts as an intermediary
between brokerages and exchanges.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.950
So the Dark Pool is looking at the order
books of the various exchanges and

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.753
they're often making predictions about
which direction stocks are going to go.

00:02:55.753 --> 00:02:57.697
They actually pay the brokers for

00:02:57.697 --> 00:03:01.663
the privilege to look at the orders
before they go to the exchanges.

00:03:01.663 --> 00:03:05.553
And if they see an advantageous trade,
they'll go ahead and take it.

00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:10.026
So in this case,
this cell might be routed through

00:03:10.026 --> 00:03:13.973
the Dark Pool from broker
two to broker one.

00:03:13.973 --> 00:03:18.231
And again, the transaction never
makes it to the exchanges.

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:21.294
In fact, these days,
80 to 90% of what they

00:03:21.294 --> 00:03:25.050
call retail traders orders
never make it to the exchanges.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.950
They're either executed
internally within a brokerage or

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.106
filled using a Dark Pool.

00:03:32.106 --> 00:03:36.601
The brokerages in the Dark Pools
argue that, that's just fine,

00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:41.422
because both partners in this
transaction are getting prices at least

00:03:41.422 --> 00:03:45.604
as good as they would get at
the exchanges on the order books.

00:03:45.604 --> 00:03:49.330
But they're saving money, because they
don't have to pay the exchange fees.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.590
We've talked so
far about how the exchanges work and

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.520
how the order book facilitates
transactions at the exchanges.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.060
Now we've talked about how
orders get to exchanges or not.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.940
Now, let's take a look at how hedge funds

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.240
can exploit inefficiencies
in this system.
