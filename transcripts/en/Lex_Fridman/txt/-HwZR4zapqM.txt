Speaker 1:          00:00          The following is a conversation with Serratia of all. He's an educator and entertainer, a rapper, and an entrepreneur. He's the founder of school of Ai, which is an online education platform and community that makes topics and data science, machine learning, AI accessible to everyone. He's one of the most unique, eccentric and creative educators on the Internet, constantly innovating and reinventing himself. Many people love them, some people don't. But the inspiring thing about Sarraj is that he doesn't let the critic stopped them. He just learns from the criticism and improves. You should go to his youtube channel and subscribe for many accessible introductory videos and AI. Unlike cause youtube videos, this conversation was a relaxed low key chat about his personal story, his process, and his vision. This conversation is part or the artificial intelligence podcasts. If you enjoy, subscribe on Youtube, iTunes, or simply connect with me on Twitter at [inaudible] Friedman, spelledF , r I, d.

Speaker 1:          01:00          And now here's my conversation with Siraj, Jay z or Kanye, Kanye. Anybody better than Kanye in terms of producing music in terms of the full package, I mean her as a full package, probably Kendrick Lamar. Okay. You're one of the most unapologetically unique personalities in the Ai Community. So I want to talk to you today a little bit less about AI and a little bit more about what I think inspires thousands of people if not more about you Raj, which is the lack of fear and trying something different. Even if you fail and you openly and publicly are searching for yourself and try to define who you are as an individual, as a person. And I think the way you're doing that openly sort of online in video form and trying crazy things going all out in the most confident way of scene is pretty inspiring. And it, I think too many people in this world in general are just afraid to do that, to be fragile, to put themselves out there, especially the internet, especially youtube.

Speaker 1:          02:18          In the face of criticism, scrutiny. So many people love you, are inspired by you, but some people criticize you. Um, looking at, uh, you machine learning subreddit, how do you take such criticism, especially when you put so much of yourself in the content that you put out? When I first started it definitely hurt. I would post pretty much all my videos to reiterate what you said. Yes. In the machine learning sub reddit, but generally, yeah, it was mostly negative feedback and um, yeah, I mean it, it legitimately hurt, but I think what got me to

Speaker 2:          03:00          keep going despite that was that I felt like this field, the techniques, um, in AI were more significant than me. It's not about me. Like I can be the gesture, you know, I can be the joker, I can be that martyr that people can make fun of as long as people get it, that this is a very important technology and we can use it to make huge impacts in society. As long as people get that, I don't care what people say about me. Over time I've become more and more numb to the haters. We're at this point,

Speaker 1:          03:28          I feel like pretty much like oblivious finally. Well hold on a second. So that, that's a beautiful thing. It's about the idea that you're trying to spread about the sort of inspire and just open the eyes and the door to people that don't know anything about machine learning. Get them into it, get them excited, whether you're young or old or whatever. But you're also trying to find yourself like all of us are and doing it pretty publicly. So in that sense, criticism, I know criticism hurts me a lot when people, cause I am trying to put myself out there and I'm putting my ugly face and voice that I hate listening to out there. And it hurts when somebody says, this guy's an idiot that that doesn't, you're saying at this point it gets better. It gets better. It does get better because if you keep putting out value to society, eventually you'll have more lovers than haters. And the lovers just outweigh the haters. Okay. So your trajectory up to this point, it's been, let's say unconventional. You've pretty much made your way, uh, your own way and ignored what others have said. Or at least you know, the, the folks who may be pushed you to go towards the more conventional way. And you've been pretty honest about it. So let's, let's go to the beginning. Tell me where you grew up.

Speaker 2:          04:50          I was born in Houston, Houston, Texas. My parents are from India. I was born in, obviously in Houston. Spent 18 years there before I moved to New York for college.

Speaker 1:          05:02          Right. Columbia. But Columbia, what's it like growing up? I mean, is it, uh, so I grew up in Jewish parents. There's a lot of pressure to do certain kinds of things, right. And doctor, lawyer, scientist. Uh, what were your parents doing and what were they pushing you into doing?

Speaker 2:          05:17          So Jewish in Indian parents are pretty similar. I've learned that after having gone to Columbia, met a lot of Jewish people, may a lot of Jewish friends in San Francisco as well in and La. So there were similar in that they're like scientists, engineer, lawyer, you know, you need to marry, marry a good Indian girl or Jewish girl, you know, just to point out the similarity yet again. But, um, it was very much conservative. Do what you're told, don't question things too much, get a stable job and uh, go to a really, really good school because we're not going to pay for your college. So you need to really get a full ride to Columbia or some good school, which I did. So that thankful he pulled that off. So

Speaker 1:          05:57          what was your value system? What, uh, what do you, what, what did you find gave you meaning and you're in the early days? I, so one of the interesting things is you've grown a lot. You've developed a lie, you've evolved a lot. It's clear from just your path. Uh, I, I've read that you've changed your name and then gone back and you struggle with your identity and some very interesting ways. But let's start at the sort of the beginning who were trying to be, how, how we try to fit in.

Speaker 2:          06:31          So growing up in Houston, which was not inside of a city, but it was more like the farm lands, it's like majority, you know, Caucasian white people. And, um, yeah, I was like, we were the only Indian family in the area. So I felt kind of like an outsider growing up. So that, that, that feeling of being, feeling a little alienated from other people, I think that helped my creativity and to be able to look at things from both an insiders and an outsider's perspective, and to put those two perspectives together to create some new idea or thought or path forward. I definitely felt alienated and in my, what I was trying to be in, what I was trying to do was to fit in. So what that meant in the context of Houston and Texas was like, I want it to be more, let's just say white anglicised, American, white, Christian. You know, those values that everybody around me held that my family didn't necessarily hold. I want it to be more like that. So I wanted to be loved and liked. What point

Speaker 1:          07:41          did you change your name? You try changing your name to become more England size.

Speaker 2:          07:45          When I was 18, so right when I got my letter to Columbia, the acceptance letter, I legally changed it against my parents' wishes. And in fact they offered me money not to change it. Um, you told them? Yeah, the discussion and we had this discussion, like I'm changing my name to Jason Scott rebel because, uh, I feel like it would be easier just to, for everything to, for whatever reason I felt like that, like that at the time. And to get a job to get accepted by people too, you know, um, do a bunch of things. So I did it and when I got to Columbia, that's what I, the name I went by. Um, but just to like put things into even even more extreme perspective that I don't think I've said before. Not only did I change my name, but I like, I wore green contacts and I dyed my hair a little brown and I told people that I was, um, you know, half Brazilian. I really didn't like my ancestry, my ethnicity, and uh, I just felt like I want it to be something else. I'm going to reinvent myself. So that could be like more,

Speaker 1:          08:50          I mean this is the coolest theme that continues with you is really interesting. Did you have a vision of that? Of being half Brazilian or was this a off the cuff I had a vision. So like you're, you have like Steve Jobs, you have an intention behind that person. You see yourself as,

Speaker 2:          09:11          yeah. Yeah. More I think more social cause I was pretty introverted in high school, more popular, more liked and a funner, a better dancer. And

Speaker 1:          09:26          how did it feel being that, you know, that's a big step just going to college, leaving parents, parents behind. What did it feel like to a show up in New York?

Speaker 2:          09:36          It was super exciting. The first two, three months, we're super exciting and new and people I felt pretty accepted and that's not because I was, you know, looking back half Brazilian or whatever. I just, I'd never known what a culture like Columbia could be like. I, I'd never been in that kind of scenario where everyone's pretty, you know, educated and has a more worldly view, you know, to, to give you one example, in my public high school and I went to a pretty good public high schools, giant public high school feeder school for a lot of people in the area. I remember in our history class senior year, the teacher asks a question, is anyone watching the g 20 summit or know what that is? You're, are you familiar with the judgment? And so, and my class was like IB international baccalaureate, which is kind of like a piece, like an advance.

Speaker 2:          10:27          It's like the advanced program of that public high school. So it was like the smartest kids in the high school. Nobody accepted me, raise my hand because no one. And that's when I realized like does no one care about what's happening outside of the u s you know, but whereas in Colombia, everybody knew obviously what that was. And so that was cool. So I did feel more accepted. It's not because I don't think it was because I had changed my name or anything, but I had to learn that. So I changed it back. By the way, I changed my back. My name legally backs your name Sir Roger Hall, which is my original name. Yeah. One of that happen pretty quickly. Oh, it happened four years later. So when I moved to San Francisco after I left Colombia.

Speaker 1:          11:07          Was that with intention behind it as well? Well

Speaker 2:          11:10          that was intention. I had a startup at the time called lucid robotics and we were building a seven degree of freedom autonomous robot to help older people with als to pick things up off the floor, controlled by an iPad via remote, you know, camera vision, object detection, touch the object. And then autonomous grasping. This is like 2014. So I was like deep learning wasn't like really, um, feasible for on device. Would you use deep learning? No, of course. Yeah, you would have a robotic arm. Uh, for autonomous. I mean opening, I had the, uh, the grasping demo, which was cool simulation, a version of DRL, which was kind of right, but for product, if you want

Speaker 1:          11:53          to go product, most, uh, most industrial robotics, most manipulation is not going to use RL, at least from what I've seen. I mean, not Pieter Abbeel is trying to get, trying to start applying our own that space. But you look at Boston Dynamics, he look at, uh, uh, was Rodney Brooks is rethink robotics. There's no RL insight. It's interesting. If you waited a little longer and see how a deep learning version of that would have worked out, you ever think about getting back into the startup world? I mean, you're in a startup now in a sense that you're creating your own, whatever you want to call it, whether it's a youtube channel or a media empire, it's somewhere in between, right? The hope is to create an accredited university, accredited university. So what do you think is broken or is not broken about the university education system too expensive as money, money. What about the actual experience? Say it was all free. Say it was all the same. Do you think you think you can be improved upon? So you've been teaching a lot of very large number of people through uh, through online, through video forum. Do you think that's more effective as audacity model? What's Sebastian through and as explored and you have explored, do you think there is a, it's more effective than a classroom education?

Speaker 2:          13:20          I do think it's more effective, but there are still people who are going to want to get a bachelor's degree. Like, you know, certificates have their place, right? Bootcamps training programs, they all have their place. But the idea of a four year degree isn't going away anytime soon. So that needs to be upgraded to Internet status and that needs to be made free and to have that same student support quality. And I'm talking about the full spectrum of student support and not just um, support for a specific module of a course, but mental health, like the full spectrum of what a school like MIT provides needs to be made freely available online.

Speaker 1:          14:00          Is that where school of Ai Fits in? Yeah, it's just school. The guys building a global large community of people. Right. So you think that's, there's a future in which school of AI gets accredited status where you can get degrees and so on. That's, that's my, that's my dream. I've heard, you mentioned somewhere, I read mentioned somewhere that you want to essentially be a movie star, right? In that kind of swim in that realm. Is that still a dream of yours to exist in some kind of a height and status and realm of movie stars?

Speaker 2:          14:41          So definitely when I started there was a need for external validation. It wasn't all internal like, oh, I educated them, I feel good. It was also, I want to loved by the audience and I wanted to, and I felt like by becoming famous, that would be something that I could feel. And I felt like, you know, I've been doing this for three years now, which is not that long, but three years now I feel validated externally by now. Like why now? I'm good. So, so why do I want to be movie stars? So the reason I mentioned that is it's not for more, um, external validation, like my name on the billboards. Like I'm, I'm good. Like if I stay this famous, but I can continue to do this goal of getting like a accredited, you know, university, I will be happy. And like having, you know, a few close friends, you know, living in La, I'm good.

Speaker 2:          15:25          Like I don't need to be more famous anymore. Like I, I felt it. Why do I want to be a movie star? So let me correct you. I did want to be in a movie earlier, but now what it is is I want to either have a Netflix show or just join the mainstream in some ways. So I can propagate this message to the youth, which is the future of Ai. So to give you one example, last week I was at a party at a club in La called Dalilah's and Drake's dad shows up and Drake is there as well. And like, I didn't even know. He strikes out and we were like chatting and I was like, and then like one guy was like, hey, hey you Indian. I was like, yeah. He's like, hi, you cool. I was like, wow, that's all it takes.

Speaker 2:          16:05          But like they were like a crew, like they all knew each other. A bunch of rappers, Atlanta Mbos are pulling up SUVs and I'm sitting here trying to whisper sweet nothings about data and algorithms into the ears of these rappers because if and Jaden Smith, the reason I went there is because I heard a rap, Jaden Smith, he's will Smith's son. He made a rap called Calabasas freestyle and this is so nerdy. I know exactly the time marker at the two 45 minute mark, he mentioned the word neural net and the full line was that's what the neural net will become when the AI is sentient. And so that's when I saw hope because Jane not 2 million views on that music video. The youth listen to Jayden and hip hop has, you know, just their past rock music as the number one listened to genre in the United States.

Speaker 2:          16:47          I did not know that. And that's similar to something as powerful. That's powerful. So if I can be, I don't need to be the guy, I don't need to be the rapper like I was just doing it because no one else was doing it. If I can be the advisor to the guy, like I'm trying to get this stuff into the ears of these influential mainstream rappers in and if not that's not going to work. Then I'll try Netflix show like something like something's radical needs to happen to get people who care about like totally not unrelated topics like fashion and music and art and beauty culture news and focus it on data literacy. Technical literacy because that's where the jobs of the future are. And that's how we're going to stay competitive as a country. But I have a global view. So every country and everybody needs to be competitive and impacting society. So like we really got to bring this down to the Kim Kardashian level.

Speaker 1:          17:51          I like this a data literacy. You know, the Kardashians are several orders of magnitude more famous than any AI researcher, almost any scientists in the world. And so it's, it's nice that you're thinking basically how to break any aspect of this into the mainstream, into the real mainstream. And it sounds like you're not constrained to anyone medium or anyone. Path is basically anything and you're just creating all kinds of crazy things to try to get there. So where did rap come from? You uh, you started making rap videos, you have rap videos. I bought a bunch of different topics. Pretty good rhymes, but it is nevertheless about AI, which is hard to do. It's not, it's like a, it's a difficult dance you're playing, right? Cause, uh, cause rap is, you can educate me more, but there's a rap is more about not giving a damn. So not caring and in a certain there's a coolness to just like, uh, not giving a damn about anything and in your apps or is that kind of you are giving a damn about something and it's pretty uh, sort of technical and scientific, which currently has a weight of being nerdy, so it's not cool. So you're basically going up hill. Yeah. So what, what inspired you? What made you brave enough to put out the first one? Actually

Speaker 2:          19:27          that's a good question. And the people at the youtube space, we're like laughing and also looking at each other. Like what does he do? Talk to you about? Cause I made at the youtube space as a part of this creator camp. The first one alone la. Yeah. In La a long time ago. Like three years ago when I first started, well, produce, it's well written.

Speaker 1:          19:45          I mean the whole thing. So you didn't just, it wasn't like off the cuff, it was well done. So he said, okay. So let's take me through the genesis. Like what were your thoughts?

Speaker 2:          19:57          What were your hopes? What was your vision for it? I've always liked my favorite subject growing up in school as much as technology is, that wasn't really a subject growing up in school was English, like wordplay and how to communicate and put words together for maximum impact. And I've always had, um, when I, when, when, whenever I was studying for tests or anything like mnemonic devices like rhymes helped me memorize things. So what's the perfect medium for rhyming rap? The perfect medium that is also relevant to youth, the youth. So yeah, just putting together, you know, like how can I simplify all of neural network architecture into like two lines of English input times away, add a bias, activate. Obviously there's more to it.

Speaker 2:          20:45          Yeah. But it's easy. Remember it rhymes and then you add a beat to it. And there there's your, there's your way of studying and once you're out a test, you're in a test, you can just remember it much easier. So it's a pneumonic device. So I felt like that was my, um, drive. And I was thinking, well, if I, if I would like it, I guess I made the bet that there are other people who would do this as well because I would always make wraps just in my head about, you know, gps or like robots. Like I'd make songs and I know he's like super weird, but also like I'm also used to being weird. I'm, I'm used to being abnormal and not normal. And I think part of it was like having a chip on my shoulder of like, I'm going to bring my abnormal reality into the mainstream and change culture because I've got nothing to lose and I've got, I'll only be here for like a hundred years and like, let's just see what happens.

Speaker 1:          21:40          So the thing is, you know, that rep got, again, a lot of love, but it also got, you know, like the usual haters, right? Right. Because you are really making yourself fragile. You'd try and do something, you know from your perspective from the, you're been in society, you're not supposed to do that. Right. So you're totally doing what you're not supposed to be doing. And a as weird. And so people are reacting in that way. So what was your feeling like because you did more and they've gotten better.

Speaker 2:          22:14          Yeah, they keep getting better. That's the point. I'm, I'm approximate the day when nobody says cringey on the top comments. I will be happy we're getting there. I'm getting there. Yeah. Like every time it gets better. Like I take all that feedback. Like I also know that people who are commenting, cause I'm like uh, uh, a comment analysis machine. I read everything. I read all that data, I look at audience retention, I look at the jokes that I made a at that point and see did it go up or down based on that. And I've, it's all a big feedback loop. You know, for me, you look at

Speaker 1:          22:44          criticism, what, what do you in that in the full context you're able to see the criticism is just one person saying a thing, one another data point, another data.

Speaker 2:          22:55          Well you know, like my latest music video I've spent the most money on for sure, but I spent 10 k, 10 k on it and it's all done. Thank you. So production value, way better than ever before. Lyrical VA value that. Um, the, the, the musical value, the beat best I've ever done, the lyrical valued now that's where I know I need to work on. So it's like I'm moving up all these metrics and I know what to work on the next source. Like lyrically, I tried to fit an entire AI lecture into this last, I did fit an entire electric into the last Rep. Now I know that it doesn't have to be an entire AI lecture. It's more about how it sounds and, and people will pick out like one line. Yeah, they're not gonna memorize the entire thing. They'll pick out one line. And so you really got to focus on making that one line both impactful, educational and easy to remember. A catchy and then the rest can just kind of be filler and like Yo, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

Speaker 1:          23:50          What about, have you tried thinking of going like the na's route, like a gong less produced, more like using a dark room with a mic versus, there's like, there's a bunch of, I mean, it looks like a rap video. You recent one, like, you know those girls and there's a, it's well produced. Thanks. Have you, have you thought about just doing like, I dunno, yeah, Nas on Mike.

Speaker 2:          24:16          That's a great song. I Love Nas in, I, I right now I find too much fun making the youtube videos, like, yeah. And I'm also like, I feel compelled to do it for all of this year. Um, but when I reach a certain metric, I will, I might look into that.

Speaker 1:          24:36          Do you have a number in your head? They chasing? I do have a number. You want to share that number? 1 million? It's arbitrary. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. It's awkward for me if people don't know you have, I mean, you're approaching 600,000 subscribers. Yeah. I mean, is there a, you're probably one of the most popular youtube channels, uh, of on a technical topic. Well, that's not true. There's, um, there's a number file, computer files, uh, three ground. Yeah. Uh, but you're in that I'm up there. Yeah. Here in Europe. You certainly the only one wrapping, I mean the, one of the cool things while you, like I said, keep harboring on this cause it's inspiring to me I think is inspiring to a lot of people is that you're chasing, you're not, you're not trying to fit into anything. You're, you're trying to be trying, you are unique and you try to be yourself essentially. Yup. As you try to become more who you are and becoming unique, discovering that you're, that sound, that voice, who do you find yourself becoming? How have you changed in the three years that you've been working on your channel?

Speaker 1:          25:47          Not In terms of content, but in terms of who you are when you look in the mirror.

Speaker 2:          25:52          I think I've become more humble, more patient, more patient for sure. More patient with people that I work with or tend to work with more empathetic, kinder and that's more patient, more empathetic, kinder. Those are the big three. What, what, did you have a temper before? No, I didn't have a temper. I had, uh, I, I wasn't very patient with like to work with people. That's how I worked by myself for so long cause I wanted to move so fast and he always had to be like my way. It's not like I was like angry if someone that I just said, all right, we're not gonna work together. Thank you. So like I look back at like you'd ask city, I'm like, oh, I could have nicer. I always have to have in my way. They were trying for sure. Good team, good people. Yeah. You [inaudible] is a good team.

Speaker 1:          26:52          Uh, so yeah, working with others, you know, it's tough to create, especially when you're perfection, especially when you do the kind of output the you're doing. It's hard to create with others. So have you found, you said you've gotten better at it. Have you found a magic formula, but how you're able to collaborate with somebody else or, um, is it mostly, is, is most of the content, most of the idea, most of the core of what you're doing still just you on Mike.

Speaker 2:          27:23          I have compromised a little bit like I know how to compromise now. It's not just always my way. It's for the greater good like educating people and as long as we're all on that, you know, we all have the same goal. Like we can work together. You want to give me an example? Yeah. Sort of working with someone who wants to fund my movement, you know, with his, with his own funds and we have, you know, it was, it was kind of hard to like work together at first because we came at things from such different angles. Like I have a specialty and that's social media velocity. I can make content really fast and he has an angle, which is academic rigor and creating a, being able to create a very rigorous curriculum that can be analyzed and tested by authorities. And just like trying to combine those two. It's been hard as rough, but like, and it's been only like a month now, but like it's working out.

Speaker 1:          28:26          Let's talk about that. The rate of which you output content is incredible. It's pretty rich. And, um, you know, there's a lot going on in the videos. There's a lot of content, but in terms of rigor, sometimes your videos can lack rigor, right? Just because you're so focused. I mean, at least from my perspective, you can maybe speak to it is still focused on the creative art of it, that sometimes, uh, that's probably what your creative processes like is more, uh, treating it like a rap video versus sort of dealed school, uh, lecture. Yeah. So, uh, do, do you ever think about that? Do you ever consider slowing down, uh, or even slowing down here? I'll give you two examples. So one is sort of the angel rang, which you can, I could never see a Sarraj doing an ain't drink style video where it's just like you a very plain, you know, nothing really going on. Or have you ever considered taking, you know what? I'm sorry. Three blue one brown, is it three? Yeah, three blue on Brown, you know, taking, he takes sometimes over a month, right to do one video. Have you ever considered doing that?

Speaker 2:          29:38          I've considered it, but I am a now a slave to the youtube algorithm and I have a certain subscriber growth that I wanted to continue and it would be quite a risk to take some time away from that. And other youtubers have faced similar issues and it's part of the reason why so many top youtubers are burning out because the algorithm kind of doesn't allow you to take a break. Like either you keep submitting content at the pace you have or will stop sending new subscribers your way. Hmm. Not that, I mean it's a valid question like, you know, why not just do that? But I think I don't want to risk that is one risk. I don't want to take, like I'm on a very steady growth trajectory right now. The videos work well enough. I want to improve them at the rate that I am. Yes. I could slow down, make less and increase the quality even more. But I think I'm really going to try to do both quality and quantity. You maybe you can split because I actually don't know this stuff

Speaker 1:          30:41          at all. Uh, some of it just seems like a, what does it, alchemy, yeah,

Speaker 2:          30:45          the youtube game is so much a part of my existence, my life, my dopamine, my reward signals are so attuned to views and likes and comments. Interesting that I can't imagine not doing this. Yeah. You know, I'm sure after I hit a million, like I'm going to be like, whew, all right, time to stop. And then it's like, what, what else do I do now? But like, I really am gonna you know, I'm always going to be educating storytelling about AI and data and technology is just like, what is the next medium after youtube? I don't know. Like you said Netflix or something like Netflix would be sick. Yeah. Yeah. Netflix, if you're watching, you know, with, you know who it is right here. Uh, do you think you could walk away from Youtube for, uh, six months?

Speaker 1:          31:37          Uh, I wonder ultimately for your happiness, for your wellbeing, for your success as an educator and sort of, I'm a person that's putting a AI into the stratosphere, trying to make a famous, what's the best move? What do you think is the best move was the 2018 is about rap videos.

Speaker 2:          31:57          So this year is like focus on youtube into almost entirely and like, you know, trying to figure out the, the, the not just not focusing on youtube as a medium of distribution but in general focus on increasing the academic rigor of my content as well to you know, trying to develop this university.

Speaker 3:          32:17          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          32:18          Focus afterwards is um, try to get, yeah, like a Netflix show I think would be ideal.

Speaker 1:          32:27          Let's talk some specifics. Uh, who's the target audience? The youtube channel. So it could be a young people who don't have any programming or a machine learning experience could be programmers who just don't have any machine learning experience. It could be research sceneries or as a deep mind open Ai. So people who are like actively publishing in Europe and so on. Who Do you have in mind when you're making the videos?

Speaker 2:          32:52          So that keeps evolving. When I started it was like I wanted the developer market of which there were at the time, three years ago, 10 million developers. So, and most of them are concentrated on get hub, right. So and now get hub has a 29 million registered accounts. So it's grown a lot. But at the time before I started out, you know, I had a shroom trip to admit that publicly where I was like crying my eyes out. I was with some random Tinder date and I just had this revelation like looking up at the sky. She was like, I was like, I've got to do this. No one else is going to do this as I've got to do this. Cause trims kind of give you this ancient truth. We can talk about that. I'm read this book by Michael Pollan on psychedelics. Really Great Book, author of Omnivore's dilemma.

Speaker 2:          33:33          To get back to this though, so the goal when I started the youtube channel was to win the hearts and minds of developers everywhere. Yeah. And I've learned a bit of that game at Tulio, which was my last job because I was a developer educator. So I learned that you know how to do this. So I kind of applied that at scale and I feel like I did that more or less, maybe two years in, I kinda of Sorta to saturate that market. Obviously I don't have 10 million subscribers, but I saturated the market of developers who are also interested in video content and are also interested in me. So that, and so that's when I was like, okay, now I'm not just developers, but people, um, develop not just developers who, AI developers or like programming developers, but like other types of engineers. So people generally in stem, science, technology, engineering, mathematics. Now I feel like, and especially having lived in La for now four months and like kind of seeing what the scene is like outside of the Silicon Valley bubble. It's like people who don't code at all and don't care. So, but, but they are interested in technology. They have some interest in technology broadly. That's my, that's what my target audiences, you know, those are the kind of things,

Speaker 1:          34:45          but listen to podcasts actually, you know, it's like there's just curious about ideas. They don't want to. So probably no math or no, actually you know people love number file, right? Yeah, and I'm pretty sure a very large percentage of them don't understand most of what's being talked about. Yeah. Like at a, at a core mathematical level, but what they're enjoying is the, the seeming beauty of how everything just fits together. Yeah. Being explained and they just enjoy that. That there is a law structure to the universe. What does that, do you have an understanding why people are into a number of file?

Speaker 2:          35:24          I do have an understanding. It's not what you would think. I do have an understanding of very data driven understanding as a creator who looks at my analytics and looks at my audiences demographics. A lot of people want an Avatar that looks like them. A lot of people are like the sound of a person and how it makes them feel. It's not even about the content, it's about, it's about the intonation, it's about the medium that they're using. Like sometimes just having a pen and paper while not as efficient as say some online tool. Sometimes just like seeing that and seeing the market board. That's enough for them. So Daniel Shiffman is one example of a creator who does as well. A friend of mine, the coding train on Youtube, great channel. But other than like those things he does, he's a really good storyteller or they are really, really good storytellers.

Speaker 2:          36:13          And that's what it comes down to. Like grant three blue one brown is a coherent story from start to finish. No, no matter how long the content is, it has a start, middle and end and people like that that the sequential aspect of that as you've all Noah Harari said in his book as you've probably read, we are storytellers. We think we imagined we dream, we remember in stories. So as long as we can wrap math into a story, we can get more people interested in it. And in terms of like getting to this audience who doesn't care about code, I'm never going to stop talking about math. Math is the value that I bring to society. I know that from a data driven approach, right? As long as math is prevalent. Cause that's the thing that I can bring that not everybody, not every rapper in whatever can bring math. I can talk about math and I can make it cool. So it's going to be math, like don't work with Dick Talks about chess, right?

Speaker 1:          37:03          Yeah, exactly. I think it will take me in chess. Popular. They did. I'm sure it's a math and AI in technically I was gonna stick with you for a while.

Speaker 2:          37:12          Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And to be honest, I'm feeling disillusioned with differentiable blocks as the future and SGD like stochastic gradient descent as the future of Ai. But I'm sure a lot of people do. Yeah. You know, it's, it's amazing. And obviously it's doing a much of amazing things, but it's not the future of Agi. So, but for now I'm sticking with that.

Speaker 1:          37:34          You're going to have like angry, frustrated reps about the state of a neural networks today. It's almost like a, so like Tupac rapping about like the problems, you know, racial problems in society. You'd be rapping like a Jeff Hinton, the backpropagation. Okay.

Speaker 2:          37:53          That'd be sick. That's a great idea. See, I'm not the only one who's going to be a ramper about Ai. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Quoting, hinting at the beginning and then like dropping a beat.

Speaker 1:          38:05          Well, if you need any guitar tracks, uh, I'd love that lamb down. Okay. So, uh, how's your process of creating two videos changed over the years? What's that process like? I think it's fascinating for a lot of people who, uh, who are educators. I know that a lot of people are quite terrible and making videos. Uh, and uh, you're quite good and, and the, the whole production of it. So what's that process been like? What's it converged to and what advice do you have on how to do it well,

Speaker 2:          38:37          so I no longer do it all myself. I have a team now. Awesome. Yeah. I haven't edited her and an animator who help and so I'll kind of lay out the idea, the story, the concepts. I'll write it. I write every word like I'm never going to have someone write for me. To me that's the most disingenuous, dishonest thing you could do is to have someone else write the words that you speak. Not to call anybody in particular, but, but so, so I'll, I'll write it, I'll write the script and then there, and then I'll also tell them like what the animation should look like and what the assets are going to be. I'll also make the memes, um, but the editor will kind of stitch things together and the animator will at the animations. How do you,

Speaker 1:          39:27          the editor, how do you put your vision into their head and share that? Is that part of the sacrifice of the collaboration that you talk about?

Speaker 2:          39:35          Yeah. Yeah. So when I first started, there were certain little things that I could do because I was editing them that and because my turnaround is so fast as well, that I could just do, um, and my editor could do that as well. It's just the turnaround is so fast that, but he's getting better and we've worked together for maybe eight months now and he's reliable and he's getting better. So, but yeah, like you know, when it comes to like take this equation's, split it up and like take these variables. Obviously you need some domain knowledge there. So you just got to find a really great editor and turn them into a unicorn by giving them a domain knowledge through experience. Uh, what's it mean to be a unicorn? A Unicorn isn't a person who's really good at editing and AI.

Speaker 1:          40:21          Oh, I see. So you're almost educating them. Yeah. And the, wow. So you're growing all together. Is this in person or remote? Remote. He can do a remote too. Yeah. What's the hardest part of the whole process for you from start to finish? Is it the idea stage? The writing. The script is shooting, like standing in front of a camera and saying, do you have to ramp up for it?

Speaker 2:          40:49          We've got to ramp up. You got to turn, turn my swag on, turn the energy level.

Speaker 1:          40:53          Is that a lot of energy in those videos? So what, uh, what's that process like? How many takes you, you know, I want you to videos some youtube recently made me feel a lot better. Actually, because sometimes I'll do like, like even for an Intro, like for uh, for this conversation, I'll do an intro for like a minute about you. Right, right. And I'll probably do three takes of it. Yeah. And I used to feel bad about that cause I, I screwed up, you know, but I saw some youtube would do like 40 takes of like a three minute video, like some crazy number. Do you find yourself doing having to do a lot of takes because you have really complex material, like give a lot of different storylines flowing? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          41:36          I do. I do. I do several takes for sure. Uh, it's rare that I can do it all in one take. Usually like, you know, maybe somewhere to 30 seconds to two minutes and I'll mess up and they'll have to restart from that point. And Yeah.

Speaker 1:          41:51          Yeah. Just you use a use a teleprompter or do you use, do you remember? I use a teleprompter. Yeah. Just getting into like Stephen King details here. How do you write out a script? You just take like a loose notes or do you go

Speaker 2:          42:06          by word word by word? So it's kind of an essay. It's an essay. I'm writing essays every week, like three essays. If I were to take all my scripts that I made up till now, they would be like five books worth of Innosight. Yeah. As books. Do you remember a time when

Speaker 1:          42:21          you took way too long in a video? Like it was way harder than you thought you anticipated? And do you remember what that video might be?

Speaker 2:          42:31          Huh? Neuro ordinary differential equations. The nips paper. The neuro, sorry. No rips paper that a cause that the actual optimization step with the three integrals, I still didn't know

Speaker 1:          42:48          fully get it. That's a good question. Actually. When you do a video, especially some of the trickier concepts, do you, I mean, they're difficult to fully get, even if you teach a course, even if teach of course, multiple times on a topic, you learn something new every time you find yourself. I mean, Jewish degree, do you try to fully get a topic before you're doing a video on it?

Speaker 2:          43:13          How much do I know it when I say it? I've really gotten better at this over the years. Like so, um, I remember like the first year there was one video. What was deep mines thing? It was like the DNC, the differential neural computer. Honestly, I've, I felt like I knew 50% of that when I made that video like that. That was crazy. I don't know if you ever looked into this architecture. Yeah. Now I like at least 90, 90% understand it.

Speaker 1:          43:42          Do you uh, have a goal when you add memes or humor? Keep People's attention? You know what, one of the interesting things you mentioned and maybe you can dig into a little bit. You have like a, an analog, like a data analytics view of this thing. I do. So like audience retention. Yeah. So Do, I'm sure you have like a, almost like a sixth sense now of what things get an audience to keep their eyes on, on. Of course you probably always learning and nobody really knows. Like how do you mean

Speaker 2:          44:11          no, what worked and what didn't. If I retention drops at a certain point, whatever I said or showed or displayed, they're not good. If it increased, that's good. That's good. And you start to build it up and you can monitor that. Yeah. So what kind of things

Speaker 1:          44:29          have you learned? If you can, if you can simplify

Speaker 2:          44:32          into words, what are people, um, I mean you already mentioned like certain ways of talking that people just find appealing. This is the type of video where people like whisper into the mic, I need to look contagious tomorrow. Yes, I'm on. Great. What the heck is that? It creeped me out. Gen Z loves this younger than me. Yeah. It's just like a relaxing, you know, it's like one form of this, you know, different types of love and affection that we all need. This is like more of the intimacy. It fulfills a need, a very human need of like being close with someone. Obviously with Vr we can increase that, but it's one step of wow, I've never, so I've looked into it for just like a few minutes and never as a really nice explanation of it. That makes so much sense. The whispering brings us, it does a feeling of closeness to it even more so than just listening to the person directly as powerful. So you get, so stuff like that, what have you learned? What people connect and they want to keep watching relevancy matters. So you want your jokes should matter. Your meme should be relevant. Your you got to stay with the Times you gotta be in pop culture. You gotta be watching Pewdie Pie and bunch of other popular creators and know where the pulse is in terms of pop culture and be able to relate AI to it. And so that's a fulltime job.

Speaker 2:          45:57          How hard is it creating the memes? You know, it comes, it becomes second nature. Now that I make them, I used to just Google them and like find relevant, like Lstm meme, find one. Now I actually write them myself and so there I have more control. Yeah, she's better and they're funnier as well. Yeah, I and I, and you can't use 2018 memes like memes or are changing now the Pekichu meme is in, but like watch it go out next month. It's like things I care about that nobody knows. But like I'm, I'm really into mammalogy and like you and Ilan Musk, so you're, yeah. Yeah. Apparently he's into it. Have you noticed changes in the Youtube in um, in youtube was a medium since he started. He said, we get you a month by month. I mean a lot is changing right from Manas monetization to uh, just the number of people that are producing content to the algorithm behind youtube.

Speaker 2:          46:51          The have you actually, because you have your finger to the pulse, have you noticed substantive changes they can speak to? Uh, definitely not enough creator support. Definitely. I mean, I could complain about Youtube all day, so it's mostly complaints is mostly not been in the positive direction. He would say no, I love Youtube because they've given me a platform I could, I wouldn't be, you know, I wouldn't have the influence that I do be able to reach to many people. I do as I do without youtube. So I deeply appreciate youtube. In fact, I'm going to, I'm a contractor, like I get youtube ad revenue. I met in a way I worked for youtube, so they're great. However they could be better. And I've seen that happen to other creators and everybody has their list of complaints. For me specifically, one that I would say is like better resources for educators and they're working on, and I know, but it could be better. Are they transparent with the algorithm, you know? No. Do you think they should be?

Speaker 2:          47:51          Wow. I think they should be, but it wouldn't. They couldn't be because it would break their business model. They need a new business model that wasn't entirely ad based. Uh, so people will start to try to manipulate it. Exactly. So somebody who was starting a youtube channel now with zero subscribers, you have close to 600,000. You're trying to do a million by the end of the year. He has dual. So I know, you know, I I, I think 800 k's doable. But by February or March for sure. March for sure of next year. 1 million. 1 million. Yeah. Do people know you're aiming for this? I think some people do. I don't really try to talk about it too much. I mean, people love that kind of cause they love to help that, right? Yeah. It's, it's cool to have goals like that. I think, uh, people love to help you strive for that kind of thing.

Speaker 2:          48:42          1 million is a really cool number, especially for an AI channel. So yeah. Uh, I think I'm one of the subscribers, so thank you. I'm a subscriber to you as well. Awesome. So you, uh, so what advice would you give to somebody just starting out today? Zero zero subscribers or maybe advice to yourself. You're starting out then icology, do it. What kind of content would you create? What have you learned if you time traveled to the beginning? Just try out different types of videos, like trial, just to craziest most random ideas, as many as you can, and then look at the data and reiterate with what works, what a topic in deep learning or AI do you see is at least in the beginning, you've connected with beginners a lot. What, what topic do they struggle with the most? Like, what's the thing, what's the entry point that people struggle with and how do you recommend they overcome it?

Speaker 2:          49:36          Well, it always tends to be the math. So usually anything having to do with either linear Algebra, calculus, probability theory or statistics, the four pillars of deep learning, those are the four. So how would you, what would you recommend they do to overcome? At this point, there exists free content from many resources on the web for all of these things. It doesn't exist together as a cohesive curriculum, like basically everything you need. But it does exist across different courses on different platforms. And so what I've done is I've created like medic curriculums on get hub that I promote with youtube. And then they like curriculums consisting of different courses which other people have done as well. And so that's kind of acting as a pathway for people without a path. So I can provide path as a service learning path as a service. Well, we'll put what a topic, if you can look back, was the hardest for you to put together a video about [inaudible] technically for you.

Speaker 2:          50:43          I mean, you mentioned you, you mentioned some, but sort of something that you get to learn a lot for or maybe you grew a lot from in doing quantum machine learning. I hadn't seen that one from you. Cool. Yeah, I did it with d wave. That was pretty, uh, interesting. Started me down the rabbit hole of quantum mechanics and I still don't understand it. There's a whole movement of a, I know that MIT, this quantum machine learning people, I still, I don't, I don't know anything. So I do know about quantum mechanics. I don't know nothing about quantum computing or quantum machine hunting. Certainly don't, is that, is that something you're excited about? What's, you know, quantum computing in general? Is that something you're excited about? Absolutely. Absolutely. There's, there's a lot of promising research happening right now at MIT and other institutions specifically for speeding up a matrix matrix multiplications on quantum resistors. What you, I guess you would, you call him cubits. Yep. But, um, that's really cool because if we can do that, I don't even need gps anymore. But variational auto encoder sends me very popular with the quantum community. And simulated annealing, but there needs to be more problems that are, it's applied to, but graph problems basically like in graph theory, traffic optimization, traffic traffic, like optimization is one that, you know, they did with Volkswagen. So Volkswagen actually paid them for this and it worked.

Speaker 2:          52:22          But interesting. So there's actual applications that, is that a real world applications of this. See what topic in AI with top, again, computing is most exciting to you today. I really liked the idea of AI applied to healthcare, specifically genetic enhancement. Hmm. And brain enhancement and thinking and taking the idea of Alphago, of thinking in an alien way and combining that with human intelligence to create an intelligence that is greater than the sum of its parts. What do you mean alien way? So outside of the capabilities of the human brain kind of. Yeah. So like move 37 the move that shock least Sudo in that it was, it seemed like a bad move at first, but it turned out to be a better move. Right. And so this went against the grain of 2000 plus years of human theory and to go, you know, what, what, what moves should be played. So this was an alien way of thinking that was not only alien, it was alien and better. Right? So those two together is a unique benefit of AI. So when we combine that, what does the AI deep, what does the AI, human deep blue moment, what does that look like? And I think it's going to be in something related to healthcare, probably drug discovery in the next five years. If I were to make a bet,

Speaker 1:          53:37          well that that is one of the things that where you could really transform society. That's really interesting that you thinking about that. Who in deep learning community do you look up to sort of this researchers is somebody that maybe early on inspired you or continues to inspires you? I know you mentioned Trask um, a few other really good bloggers, but is there somebody a, the stands out besides those folks?

Speaker 2:          54:03          Yes. Oriol Vin Y'alls. Yeah, at deep mind. He's so cool. Neural conversational model. All of this work in sequence. The sequence modeling and just Alpha Star and Alpha fall and basically everything. Cool. I, you mentioned that

Speaker 1:          54:18          the road by Cormac Mccarthy is one of your favorite books. It takes place in a post apocalyptic America. So a, if human civilization destroys itself,

Speaker 2:          54:29          do you think AI will be part of that destruction? Yeah, but not in the way that it's going to make decisions for itself and uh, consciously decide that humans need to be this steroid and then, you know, do whatever it takes, it's going to be in the way that a human or a group of humans decides to exploit other humans using AI and they do something nefarious that involves some kind of your biochemical attack or propaganda

Speaker 1:          55:00          as an empowering tool for destruction that humans are doing anyway. So empowering the evil that is inside us humans. Yeah. But are you, uh, you've taught a bunch of topics and AI, right? Do you have a concern, existential threats or any kind of threats of AI in the near term or the long term? Is this something you think about? Is that something that concerns you? Is it does some percent of the population general public, at least the those, you know Sam Harris, even Ilan mosque and so on.

Speaker 2:          55:29          Yeah. I definitely felt when I first started like that, the existential threat was that AI was too concentrated. The knowledge of AI was too concentrated and the best way to get a desperate, as Elon Musk has said and he quoted Lord Acton on this, was to ensure that all of that power is centralized, so spreading the education, the knowledge of Ai, that data to the compute, the algorithms. That has been my goal so far to prevent that existential threat in terms of an AI, consciously deciding human humanity needs to be wiped out and then being able to execute that. I don't feel it's, I just really don't, I guess you could say his faith. I have faith that that's not going to happen. It's going to be, if it, if it does happen, it's going to be because of humans and then we decide to do something. Right.

Speaker 1:          56:17          Yeah. I share your, the centralized controls, one of the, we assume as form tribes and those traps can be destructive in that same way we need to distribute the control of Ai Algorithm. So no one tribe gets to, uh, is to monopolize it. So, uh,

Speaker 2:          56:38          what

Speaker 1:          56:41          kind of educator, artist human being would you like to grow to be in the next 10 years? What do you think that trajectory looks like? You mentioned focusing on youtube this year may be something, who knows what something like Netflix in the coming years, but if you look 10 years from now, what do you see yourself as?

Speaker 2:          57:05          Well, I have some ideas on that. It's just I'm not, I don't have the authority, I'm saying this out loud, but it's what goes on my head. I don't yet have the authority to put that out there into human consciousness, like a fashion line that uses technology and learning technologies specifically to adapt to its user. A quick a fashion line for engineers by engineers. Huh? Wow. Yeah, that'd be sick. Right? So one step at a time here before I build this media empire. But it's all about education in the end. You know, we're trying to make these things cool and relevant. So these are just mediums. They're all different. Keys of the piano of there are different instruments in the orchestra of education and some of these instruments haven't been utilized before yet in the way that they should be. Like Netflix, like music, hip hop music specifically and fashion even can be a tool for education.

Speaker 2:          58:00          Just that relevancy to get into vogue and you know, these magazines that puts it into their head into human consciousness, but fashion, art, music, fashion, music after Netflix, fashion line, uh, maybe an album. And uh, then I mean obviously like a book as well. And then just content in different forms of content, creating content around storytelling, around technology and then maybe even a product. And if I do a product that's going to be something related to genetic enhancement, um, or you know, maybe some kind of APP for the brain computer interface that is being developed by a friend of mine.

Speaker 1:          58:40          Listen, you're one of the most unique and ambitious people I know, which is why I wanted to talk to you today. And, uh, I think I speak for the rest of the world that, uh, except all the haters that, uh, we can't wait to see what you do next. Thanks so much for talking today, man. Thank you Lex.
