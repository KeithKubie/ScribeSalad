When I run git remote -v in my Chrome, I can see that both URLs

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:12.110
are github.com/cbuckey-uda/recipes.git, which is the URL of my fork on GitHub.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.460
You should have seen the URL of your fork, so

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.580
your username should have been here instead of mine
