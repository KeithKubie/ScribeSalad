00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.330
How do you apply the principle of building a relationship with your boss when

2
00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:07.570
your boss doesn't value relationships,
for example,

3
00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:12.571
he consistently avoids interactions that don't lead directly to a deliverable on

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.620
a current objective.

5
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.520
He avoids all other interactions such as those that are for the purpose of

6
00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:20.350
building relationships and chemistry within the team.

7
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.210
<v 1>Okay.
What would I do in that situation?
Both than,
again,</v>

8
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.040
obviously what I would do is I would build a relationship based on deliverable,

9
00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:30.610
current objectives,
right?
If that's what he's into,

10
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.770
I'm going to make that happen.

11
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.270
Like I'm going to be the guy that he thinks can get this to happen and that's

12
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.580
what our relationship is going to be based on and I'm fine with that.

13
00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:42.970
When he wants to talk about work,
I will talk about work.
I had bosses like that.

14
00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:47.290
I had plenty of bosses like that and what do you do when your boss is like that

15
00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:51.070
and play the game like,
okay,
we're going to you.
Let's just make this happen.

16
00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:52.150
Let's do this

17
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.520
now let me say this beat because he isn't personable.

18
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.730
<v 2>Okay.</v>

19
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.540
<v 1>This means that you have to be more personable,
not so much with him,</v>

20
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.480
but with the rest of the team,

21
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.540
because there's a lacking element within the team that you as a good team player

22
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:16.550
and team member and leader,

23
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.510
whether you're in a positional leadership or just a human leader,

24
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.560
you can improve the team by building a,

25
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.730
some of that human connection that bonds the team more so.

26
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.450
Even though my boss is in personable and is just about the business and just

27
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:37.280
about the current objective,
that's fine with me.

28
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.180
I'm going to do my best to support him and make him realize that I'm going to

29
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:45.440
got the guy that's going to make those objectives work and I'm going to build

30
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.510
the human connection with the rest of the team,

31
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.850
which will make our team stronger.
Now,

32
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.120
I'm not going to offend my boss by being the guy that is more popular than him.

33
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.290
[inaudible] some people have some,

34
00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:03.080
some people that have the attitude that this individual's talking about.

35
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.480
What would you call this person?
I'm just just like 100% work-focused.

36
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.690
So if I got a guy that's 100% work-focused sometimes that kind of boss finds the

37
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:17.330
person that wants to chat.
Annoying.
Yeah.
Right.
Unknowing

38
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.950
which is possible.
So you don't want to,
you don't want to be,

39
00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:25.870
you don't want to annoy the boss and he thinks all this,

40
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.080
all this guy joggle he just wants to build friends.
He's not here to work.
No,

41
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.350
you've gotta be careful about that.
And I,

42
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.840
and the weird thing is honestly I'm very work focused.

43
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.860
I'm very work focused and I have to like,

44
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.870
I don't want to really have to do any more,
but I used to like,

45
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.640
I'd have to consciously think about,
okay,

46
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.870
on top of actually I still do have to do it sometimes.
You know,

47
00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:48.400
like I have to consciously think about like,
okay,

48
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.640
I also need to like be nice and build relationship with the person that I've

49
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:58.850
don't normally interact with.
Right.
So you,

50
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.370
you do have to do that.

51
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.380
So formed the relationship with the rest of the team,
the good relationship,

52
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.820
and then from the best relationship that you can with the boss and that is going

53
00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:11.260
to help the whole team.
That's it.
It's as simple as that.

54
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.170
And I'll say one more thing about this.
You don't get to pick your leader.

55
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.900
Generally.
You don't get to pick your leader,

56
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.070
but you can pick the relationship that you have with your leader.
Yeah.

57
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.390
So what you're leaders into,
let's get in the game.

58
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:33.250
Let's build a good relationship.
Once again,
if someone's out there thinking,
oh,

59
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:35.260
so you just want me to kiss ass.

60
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.370
What I'm saying is not that I want you to kiss ass,
I'm singing.

61
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:41.740
I want you to win.
That's what I'm saying.

62
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.990
Because the better relationship you build with your boss,

63
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.580
the more influence you have over them,

64
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.860
the better chance you have of getting promoted,

65
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.650
the better chance you have of accomplishing the mission and taking care of your

66
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:52.090
team.
That's the way it works.

67
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.790
Why do I want to get promoted so I can get more money for myself?
No,

68
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:56.980
I want to get promoted so I can do the mission so I can take care of my team.

69
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.570
That's why I want to get promoted.

70
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.120
If it was just about like taking care of myself,
I wouldn't go work for this guy.

71
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.190
I'd go find another job and pick a different boss.

72
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.970
Cause you do get to pick your boss,
you can quit your job,
quit your day job.

73
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.980
So that's what you do.
You build that relationship hard as it is.
Good.

74
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.790
So

75
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.620
<v 0>yeah,
that's a good point.
With the d with the kind of,</v>

76
00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:24.090
the details of it where you can't just start trying to chat the guy up.

77
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.210
No he's not.
He doesn't like that.
Yeah.
No one does actually.

78
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.710
Even if you're a social person,
but you're,

79
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.990
let's say you're just focused on something,
you know,

80
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.690
and I don't know,
you're focusing on and your friend calls you and you're like,

81
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.200
oh well they called me.
It might be important.
Meanwhile,
yeah.

82
00:04:40.201 --> 00:04:41.850
And they're telling you about,
you know,

83
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.330
the episode of whatever last night and you're like,
Bro,
I'm working right now,

84
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.200
but I don't watch TV.
Tell me again.
Oh yeah.
Night night,

85
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.280
you're going to step step further than I had in mind.

86
00:04:50.281 --> 00:04:52.800
But I'm just saying that that's annoying no matter who you are.

87
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.310
So if you're thinking,
you know,
this boss is like,
he,

88
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.840
he doesn't like to quote unquote build,

89
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.570
build relationships and like all this stuff,
he's only been,

90
00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:05.400
you're gonna you run that risk of annoying him.
Big Step back dichotomy,

91
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.760
that dichotomy.
But there's little,
and usually it has to do with time too,

92
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.730
you know.
So if you go in and you just go,

93
00:05:11.731 --> 00:05:15.690
just little digs of like relationship building stuff but not,
don't take,

94
00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:18.090
don't go in there and be like,
hey,
did you catch the game last night?

95
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.160
Didn't do that stuff.
I don't care.
I can stuff.
But you know,
I dunno.
Nice tie,

96
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.970
boom out,
you know,
kind of thing.
I Dunno.
Don't say nice time.
I don't know.

97
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.280
Next question.

98
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.280
<v 1>The guy that's high level worker does not want to hear about his tie is not care</v>

99
00:05:34.771 --> 00:05:37.370
about his tie.
Yeah.
But that actually is noise a lot of,

100
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.550
<v 0>but yeah,
and,
and I don't know,
I haven't been in the corporate scenario.</v>

101
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.820
I think my whole life,
but yes.
So I don't know,

102
00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:47.550
that just seemed like something on the movies they made so long thing about your

103
00:05:47.551 --> 00:05:52.150
shirt that wasn't corporate though the night club.
But yeah,

104
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.270
leadership.
Yeah,
same cut for sure.

105
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.170
And the point is there's things you can say that don't take up his time and

106
00:05:58.171 --> 00:06:03.171
necessarily his full attention to annoy him that you can say or do.

107
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.600
That's what I'm saying.
I don't know what that is cause I don't,
I don't,

108
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.400
I don't work with you guys.
