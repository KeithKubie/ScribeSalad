00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.020
We're now ready
to talk about one

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.530
of the most famous events
in all of world history

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.189
that really was the
trigger for World War I,

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.920
or the Great War, as it
was called back then.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.720
So just as a little
bit of backdrop,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.900
in 1908, the Austro-Hungarian
Empire formally

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.385
annexes Bosnia and Herzegovina.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.450
It had already been occupying
it since the late 1800s,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.740
since the Ottomans
were being pushed out.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.076
But then in 1908, it
formally annexes it.

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:35.700
And just as a little
bit more backdrop,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.010
as the Ottomans were being
pushed out of the Balkans,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.580
it helped rekindle or
bring about more hope

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.711
of unifying the Yugoslavic
people, the southern Slavic

00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:50.210
people.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.520
When people talk about
Yugoslav, they're

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.800
literally talking about
the southern Slavs.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.070
So that literally
means southern.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.920
So you had these
nationalistic hopes.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.490
But now in 1908, it was
already being occupied.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.330
A significant
state, that would be

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.090
part of a potential
future Yugoslav,

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.550
was now formally annexed
by the Austro-Hungarians.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.470
Now, you also had an independent
kingdom of Serbia right here.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.230
And you can imagine
that this was the home

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.120
base of the
nationalistic movement.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.120
If only they could add the other
southern Slavic states to this,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.470
it could one day turn
into a greater Yugoslavia.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.870
So in that context,
we get to 1914.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.080
So let me draw a
little line here.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.190
So we're getting to 1914.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.060
June 28, which is one of
the most famous dates in all

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.300
of history.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.600
And you have the Archduke Franz
Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.940
They're visiting Sarajevo
which is now in annexed Bosnia.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.690
And when they are
there, there is a ploy.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.930
There is a scheme
to assassinate them,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.190
from a group-- they're
called the Young Bosnians.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.960
They have ties to
the Black Hand,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.320
which is this
nationalistic group.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.930
That has ties, many,
many people say--

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.450
all these things are all very
shady and behind the back,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.580
behind the scenes.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.440
But it has ties to elements
in the kingdom of Serbia.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.750
They attempt to assassinate
Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.050
And it's actually
a fascinating story

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.350
because the initial
assassination attempt

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.750
is completely,
completely botched.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.150
There's even one case of
a guy, one of the guys

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.290
who tried to be an assassin
when it gets botched,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.310
he tries to bite on
a cyanide capsule

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.240
and then jump into a river.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.110
The cyanide capsule
had gone bad.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.730
The river was only
10 inches deep.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.990
And so they were able to
get their hands on him.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.010
And one of the conspirators,
Gavrilo Princip--

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.010
at this point, once the
whole thing was botched,

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.920
he gives up on the whole
assassination attempt.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.360
And he's having, literally, a
sandwich at a cafe in Sarajevo,

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.580
thinking about how botched
their whole attempt was.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.040
And while that was
happening, a mistake

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.790
on the part of those planning
Archduke Franz Ferdinand's

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.830
route as he was
traveling within Sarajevo

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.510
has them driving right
near Gavrilo Princip.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.367
So he sees, all of a
sudden, that they've

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:15.700
taken the wrong route, that
they're driving right by him

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.600
again.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.570
Remember, his
people already knew

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.486
that there was an
assassination attempt on him

00:03:19.486 --> 00:03:20.810
earlier in the day.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.760
So they should have
been more careful.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.910
Now, Gavrilo Princip gets
up, puts his sandwich down,

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.030
and starts walking over to
where he sees Archduke Franz

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.160
Ferdinand and
Sophie's car going.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.244
Now, the drivers,
once they realized

00:03:33.244 --> 00:03:34.660
that they had made
a mistake, they

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.320
had taken a less safe route.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.990
They tried to back up, which
makes things even worse

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.780
because then the
car starts stalling.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.650
And Gavrilo Princip
literally walks up to the car

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.191
and is able to shoot Archduke
Franz Ferdinand and Sophie.

00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:49.440
And just to give you a sense
of how important this is,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.110
Archduke Franz Ferdinand
of Austria is the heir.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.330
He's the nephew of
Franz Josef, who

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.680
was the ruler of
Austria-Hungary.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.980
And so he is the
heir to the empire.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.850
And so he gets assassinated
by Gavrilo Princip.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:20.410
So Franz Ferdinand assassinated
by Gavrilo Princip.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.970
And we have right over
here a picture right

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.870
after Gavrilo
Princip-- I believe

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.030
this is Gavrilo Princip
right over here,

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.000
right after he was arrested.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.560
And just to get a
little sense of how

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.080
this was tied to this
whole Yugoslavian

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.560
nationalistic movement.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.100
This is what he said
once he was arrested.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.320
"I am a Yugoslav
nationalist, aiming

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.350
for the unification
of all Yugoslavs,

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.800
and I do not care
what form of state,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.180
but it must be free of Austria."

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.250
So this act, this
assassination motivated

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.870
by a nationalistic movement,
motivated by a desire

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.045
to maybe merge Bosnia and
Herzegovina with Serbia

00:05:02.045 --> 00:05:04.238
and maybe eventually
Croatia, with Bosnia

00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:06.040
and Herzegovina and Serbia.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.850
This assassination, as
we'll see in the next video,

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.630
is the trigger for
all of World War I.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.799
And the reason why it triggers
it is because, well, there's

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:15.840
many things you can cite.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.990
You could argue that many
of the empires in Europe

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.360
were already
militarizing, already

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.970
had a desire for conflict.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.260
But then you also had all
of these alliances that

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.154
essentially allowed the dominoes
to fall in all of Europe.

00:05:28.154 --> 00:05:30.320
And because they had these
empires, essentially much

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.720
of the world to be at
war with each other.
