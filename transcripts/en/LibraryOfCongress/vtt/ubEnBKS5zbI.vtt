&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.340
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.640
My name is Jennifer Harbster.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.440
I am a reference and research
specialist with the science,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.610
technology and business division
here at the Library of Congress

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.560
for two more weeks [laughs].

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.120
And as she said I'm going
to UC Davis and I am going

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.050
to do their astronomy
and physics out there.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.730
So you can't take me
away from astronomy.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.190
I'd like to welcome
you to today's program,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.810
New Horizons Journey
to Pluto and Beyond.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.720
This is our final program
of the 2015 series presented

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.170
through a partnership
between our division

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.920
and NASA Goddard Space
Flight Center.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.590
And next year will be
our ten year anniversary.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.440
So, yea. It's my pleasure to
introduce today's speaker,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.020 position:56%
Dr. Dennis Reuter, an astrophysicist
with an emphasis I'll have

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.260
to say on planetary studies.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.210
He is also co-investigator
for the New Horizons mission

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.980
and the instrument scientist
for Ralph, a color imager

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.700
and infrared spectrometer on
the New Horizons spacecraft.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.070
Now pairing with Ralph
is another instrument

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.510
on New Horizons called Alice.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.640
We will better understand
the composition of Pluto

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.720
and other objects in the
Kuiper belt by Alice and Ralph.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.330
And, yes, scientists have a
great sense of humor [laughs].

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.760
So I'm not sure if you caught the
Ralph and Alice pairing [laughs].

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.320
If you did not, it is
a [laughs] reference

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.330
to the 1950s TV show,
"The Honeymooners."

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.740
Dr. Reuter received his
undergraduate degree in chemistry

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.610
from the Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute or RPI and his doctorate

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.900
in physical chemistry
at UC Berkeley.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.700
He has been at NASA since the 1980s

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.530
and has received numerous
exceptional achievement awards

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.390
for his work and he also has
an asteroid named after him.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.010
Asteroid 4706 is Dennis Reuter.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.310
[ Laughs ]

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.530
I think [laughs] I was like,
I think I want a job like that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.950
where I get an asteroid
named after [laughs] me.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.880
Before New Horizons Dr. Reuter was
a laboratory scientist studying

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.080
spectra of earth in space using
heavy equipment in his lab.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.340
And then he began to
develop spectral instruments

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.850
for robotics space
exploration missions,

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.180
and I think we have a
little bit of show and tell

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.790
of some stuff that
is on New Horizons.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.520
He's also or has been
involved in five space missions

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.950
and among them are Landsat eight
and nine, New Horizons of course,

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.060
and Osiris Rex, which
is super exciting,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.510
if you haven't heard
about this mission.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.890
It's set to launch in September
of 2016 to the asteroid Bennu.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.010
The mission will bring samples
from Bennu back to earth

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.380
and that will be in 2023 maybe.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.190
So we'll have to schedule
[laughs] [inaudible].

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.990
Hopefully next year we can have
someone to come and from NASA

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.270
and talk about Osiris Rex.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.930
Today we'll learn about
the New Horizons mission

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.930
and explore the Kuiper
belt in an area of space

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.700
that we haven't had a chance
to look up at closely before.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.320
Dr. Reuter is going to highlight
some of the close-up images

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.370
of the Pluto system and talk
about the science behind it.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.570
These high resolution images
told incredible stories

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.910 position:56%
and help created a lot of excitement

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.650
in the scientific community
and the public.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.110
They're going to help us understand
the composition of the bodies

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.480
of the Kuiper belt and how
those compositions vary,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.020
but they're also going to help
us better understand the origins

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.370
of the solar system.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.090
So let's get to the Kuiper belt
and learning about New Horizons

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.510
and join me in welcoming Dr.
Reuter to the Library of Congress.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:18.090
[ Applause ]

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.780
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you very much and I
guess I should say that I'm lucky

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.270
to be the last one because
[inaudible] so it sounds

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.570
like everything is
going to go to heck.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.560 position:56%
Okay. As she said I'm Dennis Reuter.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.970
Now I'm a co-investigator
on the Pluto mission.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.550
There's roughly 25 or
so science [inaudible],

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.450 position:56%
but there's a larger group of
people working on it, collaborators.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.590
I'm going to, as you see we'll talk
about the results we're getting,

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.600
but I will talk a little bit
about the instrumentation because,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.940
you know, that's my thing.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.950
But when I'm giving this
talk, please bear in mind

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.080
that everything you're
saying really depends

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.530
on the efforts of a huge team.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.830
The people who built
the instruments,

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.800 position:56%
the people who built the spacecraft,
the people who ran the spacecraft

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.970
who actually planned the
operations then we get there.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.300
You know, the companies
that made the components.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.850
This is sort of a national
type effort.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.610
And it's common for these type
of missions that, you know,

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.400
we have contributions
from all over the country,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.000
university, government, industry.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.900 position:56%
So I'm very privileged to be part of
this and I thank you for funding it.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.250
[Laughs] Now, New Horizons
it completes the exploration

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.340
of the classical solar system and
I'll get to that in a little bit.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.620
But, you know, we've gone
through all the planets.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.300
Now, there's still a lot to
learn from all the planets.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.200
Every time we go to Mars
we learn something new.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.790
Every time we go to someplace
else we learn something new.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.740
I'm sure when we go to Bennu we're
going to learn something new.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.960
And we have an instrument on
Bennu that's kind of based on, or,

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.800
excuse me, on Osiris
that's kind of based

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.630
on the technology we
developed for New Horizons.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.950
But now we're sort of we
finished that just sort

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.270
of initial exploration part.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.460
Now we can really go back and
start looking at everything

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.620
in more detail and
as we already are.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.550
But perhaps we'll start
to look a little bit more

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.850
in detail the farther out
parts of the solar system.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.820
And that's what New Horizons also
did was it started the exploration

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.120
of that part of the solar system.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.160
Now this is a area that has been

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.500
around since the beginning
of the solar system.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.520
It's very pristine, it
hasn't been near the sun,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.820
so it hasn't been affected

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.170
by the various things
that the sun puts out.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.670
Very pristine material,
so if you want to go

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.520
and see what the solar system was
like 4 1/2 billion years ago, well,

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.650
that's a good place to go
because it really is maintaining

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.070
that character.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.050
The closest approach
was just this last July.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.010
It turns out that happens to be my
wedding anniversary also, July 14.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.310
[ Laughs ]

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So my wife is very understanding.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.010
I appreciated that very much
because we were not at home.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.990
[ Laughs ]

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.170
&gt;&gt; It also is the 50th anniversary
of the first transmission

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.150
of pictures from a spacecraft,
Mariner 4 from a planetary.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.890
So it's kind of fitting that way.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.450
And the results, as you'll see,
demonstrate why it's important,

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.370
it's very important to have
the ground-based observations.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.530
You know, you spend time.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.930
You can go out, you can look
at things for quite a while.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.960
They just add a huge amount to our
understanding, but until you get

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.360
up to the thing and say, "Oh my
goodness look at that little spot

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.730
over there," you really
don't understand the thing

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:35.860
and that's what going to these
moons or these systems are like.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.160
And Pluto helped.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.530
Pluto could have been
just sort of boring.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:43.460
It decided to be an incredibly
diverse and exciting object.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.030
And, you know, it's a rock star.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.030
I supposed I should
say it's a rock ice.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.050
[ Laughs ]

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.350
&gt;&gt; Because or it's an
ice star, I should say.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.650
It's cold out there.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.780
Well, the mission history,
the first concept

00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:01.050 position:56%
for what eventually became New
Horizons was put forth by Alan Stern

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.690
and other folks who were on the New
Horizons team back in about 1989.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.210
In fact, he gave a
talk at Goddard talking

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.550
about a possible Pluto mission.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.490
And there were a whole
bunch of iterations.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.830
Somebody was asked earlier there is
a iteration where there were going

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.280
to be two spacecrafts,
because when we fly

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.830
by Pluto has a six-day rotation
period and so when you get

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.100
up close you're going to see
whichever side you're close to.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.840
Well, if you want to see both sides
really good, you have one go by

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.500
and then another one
go by three days later.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.760
Well, that would have
been nice, but, you know,

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.550
it's expensive and
da, da, da, da, da.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:38.080
And so things would come
and go and come and go.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.980
We got involved at Goddard
back in about 1993 or so,

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.610
because one thing that's
characteristic for all these is

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.050 position:56%
that you want really light
instrumentation that's very capable,

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:55.050 position:56%
because in order to get out to Pluto
you want to go fast and to go fast

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.130
that means you just can't
have a whole lot of mass,

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.360
so you want to have
light instrument.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.540
And I'll show you, you know, sort
of the size of our instrument.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.110
You'll understand why it's light.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.810
But the New Horizons mission
was eventually proposed

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:12.350
and the proposal accepted
in November of 2001.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.230
So that's when we really
started on this.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:20.130
Now, 2001 to 2006 sounds like
five years, but to go from, "Oh,

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.060
I don't have anything to here,
I've launched it," that's a lot

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.360
of work to do in five years.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.450
So this is a very intense
period of time.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.340
It was also the first of the
new frontiers class of mission,

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.610
which is also with Osirus Rex.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:37.330
Yes, it's a sort of the largest
principal investigator type mission

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.630
there is.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.170
Launch was from Cape
Canaveral in 2006.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:45.080
It was the fastest thing
ever to leave the earth.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.260
That picture I had up at
front was of the launch

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.480
and it was like, oh, there it goes.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.850
I mean it was -- and it was cloudy,
so, you know, the whole launch

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.110
that you could see things was very
short, but it was very exciting.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:01.130
You know, the Jupiter fly by in
February, 2018, so basically,

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.540
you know, 12 months, 13 months
after launch we're at Jupiter.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.160
Well, usually it takes
years to get there.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.410
It took us nine hours
to get to the moon.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.770
You know, the Apollo
took [inaudible].

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.730
It's moving fast, right.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.030
Again, because you
want to get there.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.500
Now, Jupiter we got a gravity
assist got us out to Pluto faster,

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.740 position:56%
but we also got to practice the type
of things that we're going to do

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:25.230
at Pluto and we got some science
out that people hadn't seen before.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.510
There were publications on
it, it was very exciting.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:33.190 position:56%
We crossed Neptune's orbit just, you
know, about a year and a half ago

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:38.270
and got there at, you know,
on started to take data

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.250
that was higher resolution,
higher spatial resolution

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:45.630
than ever been taken
before in the May time frame

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.280
and then obviously the
closest approach is just blows

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.580
everybody away.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.020
So there's our solar system.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.850
We're all used to the
four inner planet.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.870
We live on one.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.970
We all know about the
forge gas giants.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.780
Those were the ones who were
visited by Pioneer and Jupiter.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.150
The asteroid belt, well that's,
you know, small particles

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.970
or small objects kind of like what
you see out at the Kuiper belt,

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.680
but they've been enclosed
since they've been, you know,

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.330
things have happened to them.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.070
And now we get to Pluto.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.230
And Pluto is at the
edge of the Kuiper belt.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.720
That's that new zone that's
of the pristine material

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.230
and that's what we want to be
studying now in the future.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.280
And I'll talk a little
bit about that.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.210
So the Kuiper belt, there
is sort of a spherical cloud

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.900
of objects called the
[inaudible] cloud and that's been

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.900
around forever, but it's way out.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.450
The Kuiper belt is flat,
kind like the solar system is

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:42.410
when things were condensing down
the whole system condensed down

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.160
and then the planets would
go and make, you know,

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.130
themselves out of that material.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.320
Well, the Kuiper belt
did the same thing,

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.890
but it tended to make
smaller objects.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:54.920
And so those things
were still there.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.550
Pluto is very large
for the Kuiper belt.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.460
We've only found one that
may or may be not be larger.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.110
You know, since it's hard to
tell, you see a speck of light

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.830
and you sort of say, well, I'm
going to tell you how big it is,

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.980
how bright that is and
how far away it is,

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.530
but then if the surface reflects
more light than you might expect,

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.570
then suddenly you've got a
connection between the size

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:17.870
and how bright the surface is.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:22.000
So they're assumptions that
are made, but Pluto and Eris is

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.080 position:56%
about the same size, but much larger
than most other objects out there.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.380
So here's our prime target.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.030
Now, when we were proposing
this it was Pluto and Charon,

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:37.040
it's moon that was
found in about 1967.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.230
Pluto itself was of course
discovered by Tombaugh, excuse me,

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.780
in 1930 by looking at pictures
flashing them back and forth

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.670
and trying to see that one
little spot that moved.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:48.970
I'm glad he did it.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:53.050
I wouldn't want to do
it, but in any rate

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:57.190
when we were first proposing
it was Charon and Pluto.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.530
By the time we launched
there was a Nix in the Hydra.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:05.620
By the time we got there, there
were four, five moons Charon, Nix,

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.750
Hydra, Kerberos and Styx.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:14.060
And, you know, this again was
found by ground-based observations,

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.760
but now as we were going out,
suddenly we're changing our design

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.250
because there's these objects
out there we didn't know about.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.320
We want to include them
in our observation.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.210
So it tells you that the process

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.720
of designing the encounter
was continual in launch.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.630
This is a relative
size of the thing.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.360
So Pluto, that's the big guy,
but it's still pretty small

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.330
and then the little guys
are really quite little.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.630
All right.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.930
But they're still important.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.870
They still maintain, they have
information about the system,

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.560
about what went on out there.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.210
Some of them are rotating
around really quickly.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.180
They're not what we expected.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.890
By the way, nothing
is what we expected.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.940
Our mission objectives.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.350
Well, I can go through
each of these.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.810
We had the group one objectives.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.220
Those are the things
that you had to do.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.420
And the group two objectives,
those were the things

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.720
that you really wanted to do,

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.550
but if it meant you
couldn't do a group one,

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:04.850
you didn't do a group two.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.700
And the group threes are
those things that you do

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.210
if you have a chance, right.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:09.510
But basically what they come

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.820
down to is [inaudible] understand
what does the surface look like?

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.240
What is the surface made of?

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.950
How does the surface
interact with the atmosphere?

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:23.800
Pluto has an atmosphere, it would
not be much if you went out there.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.430
You wouldn't feel, you
know, it's about a millionth

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:32.370
of the earth's atmosphere, but
it's there and it's supported

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.000
by stuff coming off the surface.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.470 position:56%
So there's still transport going on?

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:39.370
The same type of processes
that go on the earth except

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:44.040 position:56%
at 40 kelvin considering that
nitrogen freezes at about 50 kelvin,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.950 position:56%
you can kind of get the idea what it
would be like if we were on Pluto,

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.250
there would be no air here

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.240
and we would just be stuff
on the ground, right.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.560
Nice. We look at -- oh, I'm sorry.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.860
&gt;&gt; That's okay.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.160
&gt;&gt; We look at the ionosphere.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.600
We look at the ions.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.280
We've chosen the instruments
to really be able

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:04.370 position:56%
to sample the entire characteristics
of the atmosphere, the surface.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.700
We even use the radio communication
to get the idea of the mass

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:14.070
and we can look at the surface and
see how much power it's putting

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.400
out in the microwave, and that
tells us what the temperature is.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.280
We can also use the
infrared to get the measure

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.890
of the temperature in
an interesting way.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.190
I'll talk about a little bit.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:25.990
So we're trying to understand the
system as if it were, you know,

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:27.290
as if it were the earth, right.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.450
I mean this is the type of thing
you'd want to know about a planet.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:34.920
So the spacecraft, it's about the
same size as a baby grand piano

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.710
and you saw it sitting on a
rocket that's 300 feet tall

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.190
and there's just this
little tiny thing

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.770
up there going out
as fast as it can.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:46.560
Its powered by a plutonium reactor.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.210
Now, it just really makes it warm
and it generates electricity.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:54.280 position:56%
The problem is that Pluto you've got
roughly a thousandth of the amount

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.350
of light that's in the sun
as you do here, so, you know,

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:01.180
you really can't generate much
power or you need a, you know,

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.650 position:56%
a kilometer size solar cell to do so

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.850
and it's a little hard
to get that out there.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.780
So the instrument compliments.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.900
So, again we have Lorri, which
is a high resolution imager.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:15.390
And then we have MVIC and Leisa and
those are the components of Ralph

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.540
and it's a moderate resolution
imager, but it also has colors.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.260
That's what MVIC is and then
Leisa is the spectrometer.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.040
It's the thing that
looks in the infrared

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.840
and when light strikes an object,

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.860
parts of some of its wavelengths
gets absorbed and those wavelengths

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.350
that are absorbed tells you
what the materials made out of

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.080
and that's why we looked
on the infrared.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.970
It tells us what the
material is on the surface.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.210
The GV spectrometer,
that's primarily for looking

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:46.770 position:56%
at the atmosphere and then there
are these particles SWAP and Pepssi,

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.410
which are plasmid instruments.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.710
They're looking at the solar wind

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.290
and also the heavier
ions that are at Pluto.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.650 position:56%
And then there's a student
instrument called the Venetia Burney

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:57.980
Student Dust Counter.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.110
And that was added at the end
and it was very successful,

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:04.530
but basically what it does is it
looks for particles hitting it,

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:05.830
and counts how many there are.

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:08.890
So you get a measure of how many
dust particles are out there.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.730
This is what the spacecraft
looks like.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.710
It's that little thing
up at the top.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:16.120
This thing underneath is the third
stage rocket and that goes on top

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.560
of the spacecraft and this all fits
into this little area on the top

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.700
of that thing that you
saw was much larger.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:27.090
The spacecraft they separate,
you know, after a launch,

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:29.880
and actually this guy
went to Pluto too.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.050
The rocket engine, it
doesn't have anything on it.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.070
We just know it followed around.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.800
But here's the eyes and ears.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.440
Usually you don't talk about
things having sound and space,

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.630
but like I said, the
dust counter really looks

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.060
at things hitting it,
so it's kind of an ear.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.510
It's kind of motion of something.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:50.180
There's Ralph and Ralph
is about this big

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:53.000 position:56%
and I'll show you a picture of that.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.850
There's the Ralph instrument.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.650
And this is what's
interesting about it.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:57.960
It's two spectrometers in one.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.510
Its two cameras in one.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:04.880
The optics in front feed two
focal planes, two detectors,

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.400
kind of like what you have
in your cell phone, you know,

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.790
for taking pictures, but the
infrared one is sensitive

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.830
to infrared light and this
is stuff that was done back

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.780
in the early 2000s, so
it's not as high tech now.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.580
We had a 256 squared
array JWST is going

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:26.320
to have 4,000 pixel squared arrays,
you know, so things have changed,

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.890
but this is what we
were working with.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:32.720
This is the spectrometer
that's on Ralph.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.020
It's the Leisa spectrometer.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.320
[ Laughs ]

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; That gives you an idea of what
I'm saying is and this was a concept

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.910
that Don Janes and I came up with
and a lot of other as we found

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.560
out later, came up with also.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.660
But you basically put this
in front of the detector

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.480
and the wavelength changes
as you go along here.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.000
So a given [inaudible] only
sees a given wavelength, right.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.300
You kind of see this.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.040
This is actually not the
material that we use.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:00.290 position:56%
It's sort of an engineering
version just the people made to show

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.980
that they could make the codings.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.180
But actually I have some
that if you look at lights

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.520
and stuff you could see the
rainbow, and if you look

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.010 position:56%
at florescent light you can actually
see the atomic lines coming out.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.360
Okay, so we have both of
these things going on.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.380
By the way, everything that's done

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.280
on the spacecraft we don't have any
mirrors moving around or anything.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.880
The spacecraft has to move to look
at things, so if you want to look

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.290
at Pluto you look there, and
then if you want to look at one

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.700
of the moons you look over here
and then you look back here.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.780
And then, you know, so this is
the type of planning that goes on.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:34.280
Now, on the closest approach
day, you know, two days before

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.020
or three days before,
okay, we look at Pluto.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.320
We'll scan it, great.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.620
You know, move around and
look at the other ones.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.540
On the closest approach day it's
like, okay, I got to do this.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.500
We're moving a lot and
I'll show you a movie

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.900
that actually shows what we did.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.660
You would be amazed actually.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.240
I am. Again, this is
the spectrometer,

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.540
so this is the visible one.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.840
I forgot to bring the pointer.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.140
I always do that.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.440
Here, this is he visible one.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.770
[ Laughs ]

00:19:54.770 --> 00:20:00.530
&gt;&gt; And it's like long CCD arrays,
so they're, like, 5,000 pixels wide

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:04.960
and then this is our
infrared, 256 by 256.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.020
And this is a filter on top of it.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.320
There are actually two segments.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.000
There's a higher resolution,
higher spectra resolution segment

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.620
and a lower spectra
resolution segment

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.840
and this higher spectra resolution
has a really cool application.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.910
I will explain in a little bit.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.970
Okay, so this is the composition
information that we've got,

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.270
the four visible filters.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.250
We get the color out of
that, but we also have one

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:26.510
that looks at a band of methane.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.860
So it gives us complimentary
information to Ralph/Leisa

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.910
which looks at a whole
bunch of bands of methane.

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.220
A whole bunch of absorption
features of nothing.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.910 position:56%
And this is the characteristics and
basically what its saying is there's

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:40.170
about 250 colors, if you
will, in the infrared

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.910
that we looked at in
the visible part.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.210
Now, the high resolution,
that's nitrogen absorbs.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:52.170
You know, I mean it's not a strong
absorber, but if you put, you know,

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.900
meters of nitrogen, solid
nitrogen on the surface.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.380
And it's kind of what Pluto has,
it gets weak absorption features.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.780
Turns out that the shape of that
absorption feature is determined

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.650
by what the temperature of the
ice is and that's what we use

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.540
that little high resolution
segment for.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:10.710 position:56%
So we're actually using spectroscopy
to tell us the temperature

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.730
of something that there's no
way we could get, you know,

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.770
the amount of radiation
coming at 2.5 microns

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:19.080
from a 50K source is zero.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.010
Which is nothing coming out, but
we can see from the visible --

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:26.120
from the reflected solar
light what the temperature is

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.610
by looking at the spectrum.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:32.660
Remember, well I give you an idea.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.970
These are the type of resolutions
we're getting, so they're kind

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:38.960
of on the order of a
kilometer per pixel or better.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.760
In fact, Lorri gets down to
ten times better than this

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.950
at some positions, but it
doesn't get the whole surface.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:50.160
That's why we had to do sort
of this combination of things,

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.100
but getting down to
less than a kilometer

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:58.630
on an object that's been seen
at, I'll X that in a second,

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.810
but much lower resolution
is very important.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.840
Now this is our mission profile.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:09.260
Again, we launch in 2006, we go by
Jupiter, get the gravity assist.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:13.130
We get out to Pluto,
Charon and now, you know,

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.190
we're looking out as we go
along and there's another chance

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:17.970
that we'll be able to
do another observation

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.720
of another type of an object.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.860
I'll explain that a little bit
at the end, but it's not part

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:28.150
of the plan yet, but we're
trying to propose it a little.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.820
Well, that first image is
what you saw from the ground.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.970
That's the best image that we
had of Pluto before we launch.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.030
That's from the Hubble actually,
it's not from the ground,

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.540
you know it's our best thing.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.840
That's what we get when
we get close to Pluto.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.340
That's the heart feature
that we reported so often.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.640
And even at the heart feature,

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.070
now you can see that,
hey they do correspond.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.690
I mean, where the part feature
is it is a little brighter,

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:55.600
where the dark areas
is, it is darker.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.150
But, boy, you really don't see the
resolution that you get at that.

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:01.450
And that's not the resolution.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.750
We actually get higher than that.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.860
I just, you know, I have to have
a picture that fits on the screen.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.520
And I will show you some
higher resolution things.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.010
So this is what you
get by going someplace.

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:12.310
All right.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.890
This is the ground and then you get
out there and you see this and all

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.450
of a sudden you're saying,
"Well, goodness gracious,

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.380
there's things all over the
place here that are different."

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.160
And this is, you know,
when you put the colors in,

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.800
you start seeing composition
and so on.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.610
So here is some New
Horizons results.

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:31.180 position:56%
We didn't have any idea what we
were going to see when we got there.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.840
When we got there what we
saw was not what we expected.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.920 position:56%
I know it sounds odd, but, you know,
you kind of expect, well, okay,

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.000
it will be a solid feature.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.370 position:56%
It will look kind of like the
asteroids there was something light.

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.950
No. I mean, basically
every time you get an image

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.010
down somebody is saying, what
the heck or to that effect --

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.310
[ Laughs ]

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.550
&gt;&gt; -- is that image, you know.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:55.760
It's just been amazing the
type of things we're finding.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.210
We see things and it's not, oh,
yea, I understand that its --

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.130
golly, that doesn't seem to make a
lot of, you know, because now all

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.250
of a sudden you're trying
to understand things

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.690
that we've never seen before.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.010
Very diverse surface, evidence

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.250
of dynamic processes
including nitrogen flow.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.610
Solid nitrogen flow, I
mean kind of think of that.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:18.520
It boggles the mind that we're
talking about processes that happen

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.210
on earth, but they're
happening at 40 kelvin on things

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:24.980
that are solid nitrogen
and solid CO and mixed

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.810
with solid methane, you know.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.620
A lot of different surface
compositions are evident

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.060
and they're connected to
the geology and so on.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.580
Atmosphere with multiple haze
there, who expected that?

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.980
It's got a blue sky.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.460
Yeah, I expected it was going
to have a blue sky, right?

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:46.360
On and on and on and the first
paper that came out in sciences,

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.030
if you're interested,
it's an excellent paper.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:52.370
And I would, you know, if
you're interested in finding

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.570
out the real details that
would be a good place to go.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.970
Now, I'm going to talk
and the pictures

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.460
that are coming are going
to be in more detailed.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.250
I'm going to use place names.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.540 position:56%
They're informal, they're not agreed
to by the IAU or anything like that,

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.800
so, you know, just
keep that in mind.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.110
Now, there's Pluto and Charon in
color and you notice right away

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:10.410
that Charon looks kind of smooth,

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.220
except there's this weird
little red spot on top.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.520
Where the heck did that come from?

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.720
Oh, it looks like it's
possibly in a depression.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.970
Does that mean that
Charon has been hit?

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.930
Maybe. You know, there's
this area on Pluto.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:26.930
Well, look there's
craters all over the place.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.230
Over here and over here
and there, its flat.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.610
What's going on there?

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.010
You tell me, we'll all know.

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:37.310
[ Laughs ]

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.420
&gt;&gt; So, you know, we have theories,

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.770
but is that a surface
that's being refurbished

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.950
or is there something
coming up from underneath.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:49.730
This is the image we took
as we left the thing.

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.030
Look at that.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:54.170
I mean, you know, this is --
there's hazes in the atmosphere.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.930
This looks like what you'd see, you
know, if you looked at the arctic

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:59.330
in the earth, right, mountains.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.280
That's a very dynamic thing.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.880
It's not kind of what we expected,

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:07.560
three kilometer tall mountains
next to flowing glaciers.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:14.480
Sure. Now, as you get to the edge
of where the light is hitting,

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:21.030
you know, you start to get effects
that are showing you the height

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.830
of certain objects, because
now light is coming along

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:25.860
and it hits the mountain
that's up here.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.770
Well, now it makes
a shadow behind it.

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.210
Those are called crepuscular rays.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:31.550
You see these in the
earth all the time.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:32.850
You go out and look in the sky

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:36.390
and you'll see these little
spots of rays of light.

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:39.040
It's the type of thing
that's causing this --

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.040 position:56%
usually maybe it's a cloud that's in
a way that's not letting light go by

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.920
and you see light from
the other areas.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.220
But, yeah, you can see this.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:50.310
There's light coming in and
now it's this shadow behind it.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:53.490
Now, this helps us tell
how high the thing is.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.750
But it also tells us, again,
this is a very interesting world.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.370
Why is Pluto red?

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.510
Well, one of the things that people
have talked about is tholins.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:06.760 position:56%
And basically tholins are you take
methane and CO and nitrogen and you,

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:16.080
you know, throw solar radiation
and radiation from, you know,

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.540
hydrogen lines and cosmic
rays at it for a billion years

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.160
and it [inaudible] its
chemistry to happen

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.230
and you get basically gunk, right.

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:27.880
But the gunk has colors and that's
what we think is going on here.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.710
But you'll notice that, again,
there's that region over here

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:37.770
with the crater with also very
interesting other features that's

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:40.720
lots of craters and then there's
this flat area and it's light,

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.580
and the other stuff
is sort of reddish.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:46.860 position:56%
And, you know, really indicates that
something different is going on.

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.730
So this is that area over there.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.570
We think its older,
darker, it's been,

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.870
you know, we can see the craters.

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:55.950
We think it's been more processed
than this Tombaugh Regio.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:59.400
Again, you know, informal
names, but obviously named

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.240
after the discovery of fluid.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.610
You know, a nice bright
feature that's crater free.

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:07.910
Now, we'll start to look

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.170
at some specific areas
of this Tombaugh Regio.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.350
First, we'll look at number one.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.970
That's ice flow.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:17.270
You look up there.

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.250
Look at that.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.760
Nitrogen flying around mountains
and it's what you'd see in Alaska,

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.010
if Alaska were 300 kelvin colder.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:27.310
[ Laughs ]

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:28.610
&gt;&gt; When we wouldn't want that.

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:30.570
But you're also seeing
a polygonal cell.

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:31.970
What are those things?

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.320
Well, maybe they're
convection cells.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.860
Okay, but not what we expected

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:41.000
and you know we're still
- these are possibilities.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.120
We still have to link all
the various pieces together

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.830 position:56%
to get a full story, but this is the
type of information we're getting

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:50.570
out from this and this says
this is a very active system.

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.710
This is at the bottom of that area

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:56.900
between where you're
getting the cratered surface

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.920
and where you're getting
this new surface.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.950
Well, is that because the
cratered surface is --

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.050
the new surface is going backwards

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:07.060
and its leaving the crated surface
behind or is the new surface going

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.880
down and covering up
the crater surface?

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.490
You know, again, lots
of possibilities.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.060
That's the type of thing
we're going to be looking

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:18.330
at for the next -- well, let's see.

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.720 position:56%
The next time Pluto will be where it
is now is about 200 years from now.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.980
So people are looking
[laughs] you know, 200 years.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.190
I mean people are still looking at
the data that came out of Voyager

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.340
and Pioneer and we've
set things back

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.660
to the objects that they studied.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:37.270
It's going to be a while before
something goes back to Pluto.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:40.450
[Inaudible], you know,
it could always help.

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:43.390
Now, we have this area
of what we call Chaos

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.240
and what we think these are.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:49.320
These are mountains of
ice floating in nitrogen,

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:55.730
so nitrogen is a little bit more
dense than ice at 50 kelvin.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:57.590
And, you know, if there's
some heat process going

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.040
on underneath, which
we don't know yet.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.540 position:56%
You know, that would kind of explain
what's going on here, but we, again,

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:10.040
we see the interface between the
mountains, the sciatic region,

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.670
the cratered region and that flat
area over there, which, you know,

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.130
something's coming
up from the surface.

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:18.150
If its convection and
stuff that's coming up then

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.880
that surface is continually
being refreshed.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.360
We don't see it because it
keeps covering the craters

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.770
or some big event has happened.

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:30.100
Right. We're getting a snapshot
in time of something that's been

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.980
around for four billion years.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:36.150
If you look at me 55 years ago I
will bet you don't say, oh, yeah,

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:39.500
that's what he's going to
look like in 60 years or so.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.580
Anyway, you know, so it's
challenging and its part

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.670
of what makes the interpretation
interesting.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.300
Now, the color images, now you
look at these and you're starting

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:52.250
to see well now there's specific
colors that are associated

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:55.450
with the various types of
geology you're seeing, right.

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:59.390
In other words, the composition
is different than those areas

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:02.230
that look kind of different if
you looked at them in panchromatic

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:04.560
in sort of a broadband spectrum.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:09.030
Well, again, now we're learning
that other things are going on.

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:13.050
Is that places where there's been
more processing or is that places

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:16.770
where this stuff that was
processed was knocked off?

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:20.810
You know, again, you can always
have two observation per region.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.730
Now, you can kind of look at
things and say, well, gosh,

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.280
that kind of looks like
what you see on the earth,

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.120
and you see glacial
islands and Antarctica.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.270
And we see a little glacial
island there and by the way,

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:33.370
there's streaks coming
out over here.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:37.370
They sure look like wind streaks.

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:39.210
Again there is wind.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.630 position:56%
It's not high, you know, but, again,

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:44.510
over millions of years this is the
type of thing that might happen.

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:51.960
I don't know yet, that's one
of our processes going forward.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:57.740
The heat flow, again, you
know, the heat flow is what,

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.600
2% of what it is on
the earth, right.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.380
You know, it's not a
very strong heat flow.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.680
Is it making these things?

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.070
Maybe the gravity is much lower.

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:08.630
Do we have cryovolcanoes?

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:11.820
Now, we didn't see anything.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:17.820
Titan has often been chosen as
sort of Pluto's brother closer in

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.620
and when we went by
Titan we saw, you know,

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.010
nitrogen geysers coming up.

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.310
That's really cool.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:26.450
Well Titan is next to Neptune.

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:29.860
There's a tidal force
that can drive energy.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.100
And there's nothing really
here that's next to this.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.080
You know, Charon is
there, but its small.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.480
It shouldn't have that much
of a driving force in terms

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.880
of tidal driving, but
you look at these things

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.620 position:56%
and they look like volcanoes, right?

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:47.300
There's this vent and these
are sort of saying [inaudible],

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.870
and its surrounded
by an area that looks

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:53.810
like something came up
and formed a volcano.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:58.440
You don't see this, but
it's very, very suggestive.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.510
This was just weird.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:03.210
[ Laughs ]

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:05.700
&gt;&gt; I mean, you know,
the surface is stripe.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.600
This is what we called
the snake's skin surface

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.250
if you follow it around.

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:12.220
Again, I'm sure there's an
explanation for it, and,

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.980
you know, that's what we look at.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.340
But when we saw this
people just said "Okay,

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.290
somebody's playing around."

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:19.590
Right.

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:20.890
[ Laughs ]

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:24.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; it's very strange and we've
gotten some three dimensional things

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:26.800
and you go look at these and
you can see very nice three

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.000
dimensional structure.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.630
Now, we get to the parts that
is the compositional part.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:36.310
This is what we get
from the infrared.

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:41.090
This is what we going to
relate to the structure.

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:45.750
This is one of the first
spectra we got using Leisa.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:48.670
And there are two different
wiggly lines

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.240
and those wiggly lines show you
where light is being absorbed

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.140
in very narrow bandwidths.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.310
And you can see it's
quite different.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:57.160 position:56%
There's this nice little flat thing.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.840
This is a methane feature,
methane does.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.420
Methane those that too.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:05.540
So it looks there's nothing here,
but there's something else as well.

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.810
Okay. That can happen when
you mix stuff together

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:09.690
or maybe there isn't methane there.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:12.920
You know, again we're
interpreting these things.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.580
I'll tell you about the data.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.840
But this is cool because I
think this is the first spectrum

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.010
that was ever shown on the
Jumbotron at Times Square.

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:20.310
[ Laughs ]

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:23.150
&gt;&gt; This is, you know, you
just don't see that too often.

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:24.450
All right.

00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:26.390
Well, now we start to
look at other things.

00:34:26.390 --> 00:34:30.520
Water. Well, this is
odd, here's water.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:35.340
This nice little street
there, not much there.

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.380
Remember that mountainous area
over there that we think is water.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:43.300
Mountains we don't see the water in
the mountains, we see it around it.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:47.520 position:56%
Now, what that means is that when we
say there's water there we're seeing

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.820
pure water spectrum.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.950
Now, if you look at that
first spectrum I show you,

00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:54.060
remember there was the one that
was very characteristic of methane

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.990 position:56%
and there was one that was not,
well, there's still probably methane

00:34:56.990 --> 00:35:01.360
in both, but it's other stuff
is either on top of it or mixed

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:04.200
in with it, and it doesn't
look like pure water.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.590
These look like pure water, they
look basically what Charon looks

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.720
like and Charon is pretty
much pure water except

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.020
for I'll shows it's not.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.860
Again, what's going
on in the surfaces?

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.410
Is the surface producing water
there that is getting covered over

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:20.940
or is that an area that was
covered over and something came

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:25.300
and knocked it off and now
we're seeing the water again.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.010
Here's methane ice absorption.

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:32.030
Now, this is just the
absorption from Leisa.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:35.870
So you're not seeing any
of the visible images,

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:41.150
but you see features there and if
you put that over a Lorri image

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:46.710
at high resolution now you see
that, oh, look, this stuff,

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.570
flew out of methane in
that spot like plantum,

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:52.100
which is where that flat area was.

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.110
Methane is volatile.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:57.560
It's something that at Pluto
temperatures evaporates kind of.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:01.870
It takes a while, but you don't see
the methane over in this region,

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:10.080 position:56%
where the craters are and it's very
correlated with structural features.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.020
Same thing for nitrogen, right.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:16.200
Again, you see that area
right there, that's that area

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:20.420
where there's a lot of
evaporating type material.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.760
But again, not over
in that dark area,

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.450
and again associated
with [inaudible].

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:27.400
And again, all these
names are made up.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.990
Same thing with CO. Now
CO is a little noisier,

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:32.070
it's not as strongly absorbing.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.560
We haven't gotten all
the data down yet.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.000
I guess we'll get better as
we get more of the data down

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.540
and we can beat the noise down.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.350
But again, you see
its right in that area

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:44.800 position:56%
where you expect the volatile things
to be, not much over anywhere else.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.100
And then there's water.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.260
Oh, well, no water in
that area over there.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.840
A lot of it over here.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:55.890
So we're seeing that there's
a correlation in the geometry.

00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:01.830
And, in fact, if you remember that
picture I showed around that crater

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:08.310 position:56%
where they had that little streak of
water, that's this guy right here.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.330
You can see that the
spectra is telling us

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:14.270
about the geometry, geology.

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:16.330
It's very exciting.

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:18.440
But this is not the
only exciting thing.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.360
There's the other moon
out there, Charon.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.070
Again, you know, we
see this structure,

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:27.620 position:56%
this thing that's more bigger than
the Grand Canyon, sitting down here.

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.440
Where did that come from?

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:33.580
I mean, is that something that
happened because something hid

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:36.190
at the top and sort of fractured
things and then it made,

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:38.000
when something hits it's going

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.700
to flip the orbital
axis, the rotation axis.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:44.550
Charon and Pluto are kind of
like the Earth and the Moon,

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:49.740
they're tightly locked, so you
always see the same face of Charon

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.040
if you were standing on Pluto.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.490
And if you were standing on
Pluto you'd be pretty cold also.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:56.900
You don't want to do that.

00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:01.960
But at any rate, you know,
spectrally it's pretty bland.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.990
It's got water everywhere
except where there's ammonia.

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:07.950
And when there's ammonia, is this
area where there is a crater.

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:10.500
Well, does that mean that
that's a new crater that's gone

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.740
down and let the ammonia out?

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:16.880
Or has something been let out that
has formed ammonia after a while?

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.180
Is that a new thing?

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:22.140
Is this some way that we
can possible date impacts?

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.440
All right.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.570
Again, this combination
of composition

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:29.200
and geology is really telling us a
lot about what's going on, on the,

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.920
surface which is an
inactive surface,

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.160
something that we hadn't expected.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.450
Or we hoped for but we hadn't
expected it to be this [inaudible].

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:41.370
Now we got the Charon on the small
moons, and basically you're seeing,

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:45.820
you know we don't get as close to
them as we get to Pluto and Charon

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.740
because they were the objects
that we were going for.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.640
If you were going to choose whether
you get Charon and Pluto or one

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.710
of the small moons, you're
going to go with Pluto,

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:55.660
so we didn't really
move anything around.

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.910
We did actually though,
once we started

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:01.820
to see all these moons somebody
said "Oh, wait a minute,"

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:06.090 position:56%
somebody meaning Alan Sern,
[phonic] does this mean that now all

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.630
of a sudden we have to worry about
are we going to hit something.

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:09.930
All right.

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:14.190
So we spend a fair amount of time
doing a lot of modeling saying well

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:18.610
if material is coming off Pluto,
is where we're going safe?

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.440
If we start to see something
as we get close and we start

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:25.190
to see a lot more particles,
do we have a way to go

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:26.490
that we can get some place safe?

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:29.110
So, you know, we're still
getting the data down,

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:34.030
so you much rather get less
data, but then get it rather

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.900
than get a whole bunch of
data and then hit something

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.740
and then get nothing
out of it at the end.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:41.550
So there was a lot of planning
that went into what we finally did.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:44.830
Now, it turned out that if
you actually did the modeling,

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:48.560
Charon intended to sweep out
the materials that was up there

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:52.250 position:56%
and so the probability that there
was anything there was pretty small.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:54.880
But it took several years
to get us to that point,

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:58.050
several years where you know,
it was a fair amount of angst.

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:00.270
Let's put it that way.

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:05.930
Now this is when we're
living and here's the haze

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:07.270
of Pluto and that's blue.

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:09.770
It really is blue and I mean, you
know, this comes from the meth

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:13.960
from the MVIC observations, and if
you look at Pluto's haze it goes

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.020
up hundreds of kilometers in blue.

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:20.270
If you look at it in the
methane channel, which is blue is

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:26.330 position:56%
about .4 microns and the wavelength
is .4 microns, methane absorption is

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:30.530
around .9 microns, so it's about
2 1/2 times the wavelength of it.

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:34.640
You don't see much, you see haze
but its stops fairly far down.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.370
And again, the fact that
we're seeing these layers,

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:41.350 position:56%
is that because something is forming
and then coming down and staying

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:43.940
in one place for a while,
while other things occur?

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.300
You know, what is that
connected with?

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:49.050 position:56%
And again, this is the type of work
that goes on over the next few years

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:52.910
as we get more data and as
we learn from that data,

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:55.450
other things about the
surface that can help us point

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:57.510
to what's going on there.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:02.350
So here's our timeline,
and we're here

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:05.850
in the middle of the
science playback.

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:08.940
We'll do some close encounter
calibrations afterwards,

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.390
after the playback is done.

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:14.220
I mean, this is still a time
when we're still sweating things

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:17.180
out because if something happens to
the spacecraft we lose that data.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:22.870
For example, Leisa, we did,
you know, two very high --

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:25.820
four really high resolutions
-- four high resolutions scans

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:27.730
and one very high resolution scan.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.250
So far we've gone down two
of the high resolutions scan,

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.770
so we still have a
lot of stuff there.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.840
We have a whole bunch of
data that we took as we left,

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:38.670
looking through that atmosphere
that maybe we can look in that data

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:41.430
and see what's in the atmosphere
just like you do on the earth.

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:43.550
Is there methane up
there or is there CO?

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:46.670
You know, that sort of thing,
because it's a nice long path line

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:49.150
that we get from the sun.

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:55.650
We did change the direction of the
spacecraft after the encounter,

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:58.860
because there is a [inaudible]
object that we've identified

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:02.630
that we could get to and
do data collection on,

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:05.180
and if we hadn't done the change
we wouldn't have been able

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.480
to do it later on.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.390 position:56%
Now, there's still we have to write
a proposal and it has to be accepted

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:13.990
and da, da, da, da, da, da, to, you
know, actually do that measurement.

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:17.020
So we're not saying we're doing
that, but we did the change

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:22.580
because if we didn't do that
it would become a moot point.

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:24.270
So, work remaining lot.

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:29.720
We got about thirty
percent of the data down.

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.900
Most you guys might not remember
this, but back in the day

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.530
when we had modems that
connected us to the internet,

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:37.270 position:56%
remember the 300 [inaudible] modems.

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:38.570
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:41.010
&gt;&gt; Because that's the speed
the data's coming out, right.

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:42.550
[ Laughs ]

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:44.270
&gt;&gt; So, you know, you just
saw lines go like this,

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:45.570
that's the speed the
data's coming down

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:47.400
and we have gigabytes
worth of data, right.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.940
So it takes a while
and that's physics.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:52.090
It's far away, we can't
have the big radiator,

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:53.720
we don't have a huge
amount of power,

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.660
just takes that long
to get stuff out.

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:58.910
We still have some optimization
on the data from the instruments.

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:01.960
There can be artifacts and that's
why we're doing that calibration

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.950
to make sure that nothing has
changed in the time before

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:06.250
and after we went to Pluto.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:10.420
We still have to co-register all
the data from all the instruments,

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.370
so that we know exactly, yes,
when this is seeing that,

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:16.690
that was seeing this, we're looking
at different angles of things

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:21.360
because not only do
particles, the composition

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.740
of particles change how they
absorb light, it's the shape

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.040
and the size of particles.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.780 position:56%
And once you start getting particles
that are sort of the same size

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:30.400
as the wavelength of light, they
have different characteristics

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.020
than bigger or smaller particles.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:36.800
And then now we have to go and
do our combine modeling, right.

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.560
We have to take the data that we've
got that we trust and then go into,

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.230
say, well, what is the
geophysical composition all thermal

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:44.530
of da, da, da, da, da.

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:46.660
In other words, explain
what's going on.

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.500
What is the dynamics
that's going on?

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:49.800
How is it coupled?

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.630
Why are we seeing this
flat area that's smooth?

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:55.020
Is that something that's going
to go away after a while?

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:58.040
And by the way, as Pluto
moves away from the sun,

00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.690
the atmosphere is starting
to condense

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:01.070
and the fact we thought
it would be --

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:03.390
we were afraid it was going to be
gone by the time we got out there,

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.990
the fact that it's still
there's, it's nice.

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:07.290
Let's put it that way.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:11.800
And If you're interested in
more information there is this.

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.940
There's also a photo journal.

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.800
Every time I've tried
to copy the address

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.960
of the photo journal it would
mess everything else up,

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.260
so I said all right.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.190
You guys can just go to
New Horizons photo journal

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:24.540
and you see these images.

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:27.700
But these is the places to
go to get the data from.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.600
Now, what time is it?

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.900
&gt;&gt; 12:30

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.200
&gt;&gt; Ooh, Jesus.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:36.840
Okay so I got a little bit of time.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.660
What this is, is this is a
Ralph centric image of movie

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:45.220
of what was going on at Pluto, what
was happening during the encounter.

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.800
So remember what I said was
we have these fields of view.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:52.340 position:56%
I'm looking at you, you're Pluto and
now if I want to take the spectrum

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.980
of you I have to scan my field of
view plus you, and I'm going to go

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.580
over there and look at you because
you're Charon and do the same thing

00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:59.290
and you're KERBEROS, so
I'm going to do that.

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:02.630
And so I have to move around and
I have to change the orientation

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:08.320
of things and I have to do that,
so that if I take data with Ralph

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:12.770
that I can now also take data
with Lorri at the same time

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:17.310
or with the Alice spectrometer,
and by the way trying to explain

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:22.680
to people of a certain
age, what the relationship

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.010
between Ralph and Alice
is has been --

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:25.310
[ Laughs ]

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:26.860
&gt;&gt; -- a joy for the last ten years.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:33.370
At any rate, so there's a lot of
activity going on and all that had

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:36.780
to be planned, because it
takes four hours for light

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:39.460
to get from the earth to Pluto.

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.230
Hours for information to get back.

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:45.540
So if I said "Okay now start to
take data," it would say "Oh, well,

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:46.990
to bad I'm already past," Right.

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:50.400
Because remember the closest
approach really was hours.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.320
We're going 10,000 kilometers,
excuse me, ten kilometers a second,

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:57.710
right, so, you know,
3,000 kilometers an hour.

00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:59.060
You go and buy something
where you're getting

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.880
up to 10,000 kilometers with it,
that is much less of an hour,

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.370
so you have to have everything
well planned and you have

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:06.670
to know where things are.

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:10.010
That was another thing is that
we were concerned for a while

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.850
that maybe Pluto was not
quite where we thought it was.

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:15.670
And so we had this big plan
where we take all these data

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:19.290
and it wouldn't be a Pluto so you'd
have to put in more margin and then

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:20.590
that means you take less data

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:22.190
because you have to
scan more and so on.

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:26.130
So what this is it shows you what
happened during the encounter,

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.620
at least as far as
Ralph is concerned.

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:35.410
These long lines are the 5,000
pixel wide MVIC detector.

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:38.500
And we scan that across to
get color and [inaudible].

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:42.050
You also see a square one, that's
the Leisa field of view, okay.

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:46.760
So if I'm lucky and
it worked earlier.

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.760
So, okay, so now this is, oops,
let me get this out of the way.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.270
This is ninth of July.

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:55.430
Now, you see we're taking some
measurements, here's the tenth

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:57.610
of July we're taking
some more measurements.

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:00.260
That's the a Leisa field of view

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.930
and you're really not
feeling much of it, right.

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:05.440
The resolution is not that
great, but we're taking data

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.230
because we're getting
different phase angles,

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:09.110
we're getting different
information about this.

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:12.510
So there is information
in here that's important.

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:14.300 position:56%
Now we're up to the 13th, so we went

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.530
to the ninth till the 13th
in that period of time.

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:19.880
Now we're on the 14th, now
we're going to sit on the 14th

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.800
for quite a while, but
look what's happening.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.980
Look at all these operations
that are going out,

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:27.570
and we're doing things like going
the opposite way to get flat field,

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:30.050
and we're scanning,
there's a scan of Pluto,

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:32.540
there's two of our high
resolution scans of Pluto.

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:34.340
There's one of our high
resolution scans of Charon.

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:37.010
And I'm not expecting
you to follow all this.

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:38.310
[ Laughs ]

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:40.560
Just get the idea, there's
a lot going on here.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:44.240
This was all planned, you
know, well, not well before,

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.270
continually as we go to
Pluto, as we did practice,

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:49.280 position:56%
as we found out what actually occur.

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:53.810
Now you can also see that remember
how the objects were much smaller

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:57.010
than the detectors, now all of the
sudden those detectors are smaller

00:47:57.010 --> 00:48:00.370
than the objects, so we've
gone like a factor of a 1,000

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:04.110
in spacial resolution in that
period, that's impressive.

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:05.500
Now we're about leaving.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.700
This is still on the
14th, we're leaving,

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.900
we're still on the 14th
we're still taking data's

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:14.590
as we go out, now on the 15th.

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:17.360
All that time in the middle was
all the operations that were going

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:20.660
on in the 14th, so when I say
that this was a team effort

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:24.950
where the planners and everybody,
you know, to get that right,

00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:27.520
and the fact that we did
get it right was amazing.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.640 position:56%
And that picture I showed you was
the one that showed the haze layers,

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.050
you know, with the mountains and
everything, that had to be done

00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:36.790
in a very specific way, because
a lot of times we could just sort

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:38.890
of fire the thrusters
and scan across

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:40.190
and didn't have to
worry about things.

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:41.790
But as we got real close to Pluto,

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:44.060
now the spacecraft motion
got coupled to the motion

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.460
that you're doing with the scan,

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:47.970
and so I have to change
things at the same rate.

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:50.240
So now you have to not
only know where you are,

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:53.100
but you have to know how fast
you're going when you go by,

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.950
and put that into how you're doing
the scan or else you smear things,

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:58.330
and they did a wonderful job.

00:48:58.330 --> 00:48:59.640
So I think actually --

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.410
&gt;&gt; Wait, yeah, I'm sure
there are colleagues

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:04.060
with lots of questions, right?

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:05.360
&gt;&gt; And but I did it, I got --

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:07.960
[ Laughs ]

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:09.760
&gt;&gt; And I'm very much
appreciating you taking the time.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.390
[ Applause ]

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:16.120
&gt;&gt; And with the questions
if you can try

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.970
to repeat the questions
for the video.

00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:20.270
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:21.860
&gt;&gt; Okay, questions...

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:27.360
&gt;&gt; You mentioned thrusters, what
was the mechanism for pointing

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.970
and moved the whole craft?

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:30.270
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:35.450
There were lot of little rocket
motors, basically thrusters

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:37.030
that move the spacecraft around.

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:42.860
Now in a lot of times you'll
have, you know, spinning objects

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:44.360
that can move the thing around,

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.760
but here we didn't have the
[inaudible] thank you I couldn't

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.440
remember the name.

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:52.320
But here we didn't have the power
or the capability of doing that,

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.620
so we had to use the thrusters.

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.510
So you fire a little thruster and
it start moving the thing and then

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:58.490
when you got up to the speed
you wanted you stopped firing

00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:59.790
the thrusters.

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:02.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And you have enough fuel in the
thrusters for all this [inaudible]?.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.320
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:08.140
And for what would happen later on.

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:09.440
Yes.

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:13.910
&gt;&gt; When Charon was discovered it
considered to be a moon of Pluto,

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:16.960
is it still a moon of
Pluto or is it considered

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:20.000
to be two planets that
orbit each other?

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.840
&gt;&gt; That's an excellent question
and the answer is the latter.

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:31.320
They're all orbiting a central
mass location, so if you noticed

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:36.040
when you saw the orbits on
that movie I was showing you,

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.820
it looks kind of weird
they didn't look circular.

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:41.870
That's because they were based
on the position of Pluto,

00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:45.530
and as Pluto moves around it moves
around the center of gravity,

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:48.780
as do those other moons, so if
you plot something with respective

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.510
to the center of Pluto it sort

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:52.470
of distorts what the
other guys look like.

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:56.780
Yes, they're considered to be
at least a binary system now

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:59.390
of [inaudible] decimal
system, [inaudible] system.

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:00.690
Yes.

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:06.190
&gt;&gt; With the atmospheric it
was recently announced I guess

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:09.680 position:56%
that [inaudible] had found on the
comet some oxygen, were they testing

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.770
for oxygen on New Horizons as well?

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:14.070
&gt;&gt; We would love to.

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:16.500
The problem with oxygen is it's
not really a strong absorber.

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:24.380
Now, possibly some of
the, although I doubt it,

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:27.560
possibly some of the plasma
instruments might be able

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.050
to look for it.

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:32.230
But we'll see, you know.

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:36.260
It was a surprise and it's not
something that we expected at all

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.420
and I'd be surprised
if it were Pluto,

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:41.150
but then Pluto surprised me, so.

00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:42.450
Yes.

00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:44.360
&gt;&gt; How long does it
[inaudible] earth?

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:48.150
&gt;&gt; So we started taking, let's
say from the closest approach,

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:52.020
basically we're started taking
data down the day after, you know,

00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:54.910
the 15th of July, it's
still coming down.

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:58.690
We're expecting it to come
done through next summer.

00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:00.080
All right.

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:04.040
So it's still another six eight
months before it's all down.

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.340
Yeah.

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:06.700
&gt;&gt; The data --

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sorry I'm not repeating
your question, I'm sorry about that.

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:11.940
&gt;&gt; The data transmission
coming back,

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.090
is there any problem with noise?

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:16.050
&gt;&gt; So the question
is there is a problem

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:18.510
with noise interrupting the
data transmission coming back.

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:24.230
And the answer is as always there
is, because we're taking data

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:27.400
into various locations around
the world and if there happens

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:30.970
to be rain at one of those places
you can't necessarily get the data

00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:33.370
down, so you have to dump
it down some later time,

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:36.370
where there can be some
mechanical problem that causes you

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:39.080
or electrical problem that
causes you to skip something,

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:40.910
so you do another transmission.

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:43.790
You know, that's something
that we're always planning on.

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:46.470
As far as actually sort
of electronic noise,

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:47.880
it's been pretty good so far.

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:51.120
&gt;&gt; But nothing like
with solar particles?

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.420
&gt;&gt; : No, not yet.

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:53.720
Yes.

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:57.790
&gt;&gt; What's the trade off when you
have to go to a certain speed

00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:00.160
to get there within a [inaudible],

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.990
but what would have
been your options?

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:03.600
How slow could you have gone

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:07.060
so that you could extend the
orbit of Pluto [inaudible]?

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:10.540
&gt;&gt; So the question is how slow
would we have to go to orbit Pluto.

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:12.350
And the answer is real slow.

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:17.040
The problem is that, so remember
that rocket when it took off,

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.690
that's getting us out of
the gravitational field

00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:21.870
of the earth and its environment.

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:24.980
Well, to stop at Pluto
you'd basically have to have

00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:27.210
that rocket go in the
opposite direction, right.

00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:31.590
So kind of you need something
that's large to slow you down,

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:34.040
at that rate to slow you down.

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:37.980
So you can imagine that if you went
slower you wouldn't need that big

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:41.210
of a rocket, but still you
got to launch that rocket.

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:47.130 position:56%
So it's just really not practical
to orbit as we do it with chemicals.

00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:51.110
Now, it maybe that we can use
solar or electric propulsion,

00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:53.850
start something, take a long
time to get out there, you know,

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:57.370
and just continually throw
us backwards as we go,

00:53:57.370 --> 00:54:00.910
but that would be a
whole different study.

00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:02.330
Yes.

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:04.750
&gt;&gt; Probably this is not a
very sophisticated question,

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:08.170
but in the beginning you
were showing a picture

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:14.590 position:56%
of the Hubble telescope and if the
Hubble can take pictures of galaxies

00:54:14.590 --> 00:54:19.470
that are thousands and
thousands of light years away,

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:24.300
why could it not take close ups
for you from the body that's

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:29.540
in the hundreds of
millions say of miles away?

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:34.270
&gt;&gt; So the question is why can the
Hubble take pictures of objects

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:37.850
that are very far away, but when
it looked at Pluto it didn't have

00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:39.850
that much facial resolution.

00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:42.980
Well, if you look at a Hubble
picture of a star it's a point,

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:44.490
you don't see any resolution.

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:47.630
If you look up in a Hubble
picture of a galaxy, well,

00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:53.040
Pluto is 2,000 kilometers,
2,400 kilometers in diameter.

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:56.700
Galaxy is a 100,000
light years, right.

00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:59.640
So if I'm looking at
light at an angle,

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:03.500
even if it's far away makes
it reasonably good angle,

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.870
so I can see something
over that area.

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:09.740 position:56%
Pluto is very, very sub arch second.

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:14.690
You know, much lower resolution
than most objects on telescopes

00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:17.800
on the ground and barely, just
barely what the Hubble can do

00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:19.900
and that's why it's only
a few pixels across.

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.240
Yes sir.

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:24.290
&gt;&gt; When does it finally
run out of power?

00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:26.780
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:31.860
I've seen various plots and the
ideas that well, as we go further

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:35.320
out you don't have to run the
spectrometers or the images

00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:38.260
because there's nothing to see,
so you can back off power there,

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:43.270 position:56%
you can back off power on other
things and perhaps only run the ion,

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:46.850
you know, and the student dust
counter and things like that.

00:55:46.850 --> 00:55:49.390
I believe the estimate,
and don't quote me on this,

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:51.510
but I believe the estimate
is somewhere in the mid 20s,

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:54.530
30s that we start to get to
the point where, you know,

00:55:54.530 --> 00:56:00.300
we just even can't transmit the
data back anything like that.

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:02.270
Yes.

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:03.570
&gt;&gt; Me?

00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:04.870
&gt;&gt; Yes, ma'am.

00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:07.090
&gt;&gt; Okay. I just want to say I
was lucky enough to participate

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:11.300
in NASA's social event at John
Hopkins and I got to meet a lot

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:14.850
of the team, Dr. [inaudible]
and Dr. Green who said,

00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:18.290
you're right it's 20, 30 because
he said once you start backing off

00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:23.050
as just be fascinating,
like, in 2006 it launched

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:25.660
and just seeing all the images

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:29.050
that making Pluto now
seem more interesting

00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:32.370
than it was than just an icy body.

00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:34.870
So I want to cause
trouble, are you team planet

00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:37.410
or team small icy object?

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:39.800
[ Laughs ]

00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.930
&gt;&gt; So here's the person who's
trying to cause trouble,

00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:47.630
basically asking me if I think
it's a planet or an icy dwarf.

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:49.430
So I actually did, there's a thing

00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:51.860
on the Internet called
four questions and answers.

00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:54.010
My answer there was I don't think
Pluto cares what we call them.

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:55.310
[ Laughs ]

00:56:55.310 --> 00:57:00.890
&gt;&gt; And the reality is that it's
part of a new set of objects

00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:03.910
that just are going to tell
us huge amounts of data.

00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:07.930
Whether you call it a planet or
an icy planet or a dwarf planet,

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:10.150
that's a convention, right.

00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:13.410
It's, you know, they used to call,

00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:16.560
if you look at astrology I
believe the earth is not a planet,

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.450
but the sun is, right.

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:23.400
You know, there are
conventions that go into things.

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:24.710
It's up to you.

00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:29.110
I just think it's exciting to go
out there and see these things,

00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:31.760
you know, they tell
us about what we are.

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.060
&gt;&gt; Well done.

00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:34.360
&gt;&gt; I've been practicing.

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:35.660
[ Laughs ]

00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:37.160
&gt;&gt; Any other questions?

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.600
Yes, sir.

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.040
&gt;&gt; While the data is
still coming in,

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:45.900
we don't know your talk will be
looking forward to next summer

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:54.370
after the rest of it comes
in, but I'm curious the things

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:56.810
that you're seeing
and the bizarre things

00:57:56.810 --> 00:58:02.530
that you're seeing we can't test
with New Horizons what you would

00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:07.300
like to see from what you seen so
far on New Horizons two whenever

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:10.220 position:56%
that might be in the next 200 years?

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:14.510
&gt;&gt; Well, so then you guys can
push for New Horizons two.

00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:17.490
Obviously, I probably won't
be all that involved in it.

00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:20.440
I think what you'd basically
do is have perhaps very similar

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:25.600
instruments, but they be much more
capable now because, you know,

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:29.260
we have bigger arrays, we
can do more wavelengths.

00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:32.000
We would like to cover
more wavelengths.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.720
We might want to put on a
mass [inaudible] something

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.480
that can tell us what's there.

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:42.310
It would be very nice, and
we'd actually had in one

00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:45.280
of the many plans something
that would go to the surface.

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:49.720
Right now, it doesn't have
to land gently or, you know,

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:53.930
maybe we can make it so it's an
impact or as long as some parts

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:58.580 position:56%
of it is -- that would be something
that I think would be extraordinary.

00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:02.880
Now, the opposite side of that is
every time we have one of those

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:06.390
that goes into an atmosphere,
we find out that its going

00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:07.850
into some unique place right.

00:59:07.850 --> 00:59:11.620
You know, so it's not necessarily
represented of everything,

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:15.500
but if we could see the surface
that would be really nice.

00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:19.150
And that's something,
excuse me, that you can do

00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:22.630
without a huge amount
of back throws,

00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:27.200
because it's a small object, right.

00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:34.170
So you just have to
stop it, you don't have

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:39.080
to stop the 500 kilometer thing you
have, or excuse me, kilogram thing,

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.460
you just have to stop the
two kilogram thing and now

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.170
with technology we can make that
a very capable two kilograms.

00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:43.470
And you had a question.

00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:44.770
&gt;&gt; Can you say something
more about the atmosphere

00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:46.070
and the specification
how does this impact

00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:47.370
and planning how it affected
the instruments, what they read

00:59:47.370 --> 00:59:48.670
and so forth I think
is a critical thing,

00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:49.970
but wasn't it that whole
atmosphere assumed to be gaseous

00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:51.270
or semi gaseous on the
surface or whatever.

00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:52.570
&gt;&gt; So the question is how did
the structure of the atmosphere

00:59:52.570 --> 00:59:53.870 position:56%
or the proposed assumed structure of
the atmosphere affect the planning

00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:55.170
for the Pluto mission
from the very beginning.

00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:56.470
&gt;&gt; The precipitation that was
coming out of [inaudible].

00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:57.770
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:59.410
So the precipitation is
still its only coming

00:59:59.410 --> 01:00:03.360
from a few hundred
kilometers up and we only get

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.110
to within 10,000 kilometers,
so we didn't worry

01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:09.150
about it in terms of danger.

01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:12.410
Now in terms of what
we would like to see,

01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:16.010
how we would do the observations,
remember I mentioned that we have

01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:18.320
that radar, or excuse
me, the radio instrument

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.220
and also the other instruments
that we could take data

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:24.430
as we went behind the system.

01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:28.220
We were worried that if we didn't
get out there early enough.

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:31.030
One of the reasons we were
pushing for the 2006 launch was

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:32.860
that the atmosphere would be gone.

01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:36.680
So it really drove more our
impetus to get the launch as soon

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.610
as we possibly could than
anything, you know else.

01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:41.910
The instruments were going

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:45.320
to be pretty much what the
instruments were going to be

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:48.060
because we were going to look for
-- if there was less atmosphere,

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:49.400
we' were still going
to look for the things

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.990
that we expected to
be in the atmosphere?

01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:55.820
&gt;&gt; How soon will the
atmosphere totally [inaudible]?

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:58.960
&gt;&gt; Well, that's very hard to tell,
because again, we kind of thought

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.680
that it would be gone by now.

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:04.750
Now, we were doing
measurements [inaudible]

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:07.110
if a star goes behind Pluto,

01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:09.990
you know it doesn't shut
the light off immediately.

01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:12.190
You can kind of see
it slowly go down,

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:15.240
but you see atmosphere is
scattering light and we could tell

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.070
that the atmosphere was still
there and it surprised us.

01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:26.780
So if there is a, you know, a
mechanism that's causing convection

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:29.790
and causing evaporation
still from the surface well,

01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:31.090
if that can maintain

01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:33.960 position:56%
and the atmosphere can maintain even
though it's not necessarily near

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.260
the sun.

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:40.040
A lot of -- also what we're seeing
is that the colors of things,

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.540
you know, so if you got a black
surface it absorbs more light,

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:47.840 position:56%
it gets hotter, the sputnik plantum,
that flat area is very white,

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.130
well that may be a
reason why it's cold.

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:54.290
It's also kind of never really
gets the sun on it directly, so,

01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:57.620
you know, that may be why
it's still producing things

01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:59.760
or condensing things
from the atmosphere.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.850
So stuff may be coming from
other places and coming there,

01:02:02.850 --> 01:02:04.550
and forming that flat area.

01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:11.430
So did that answer your question?

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:12.800
Okay. Any others?

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.270
One more.

01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:17.230
&gt;&gt; You have an object that's

01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:20.860
over a billion years old
[inaudible] several billion?

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:22.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.530
&gt;&gt; And you were concerned that
the atmosphere might be gone

01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:27.950
or delayed a couple of more years?

01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:29.710
&gt;&gt; So remember this
thing orbits, right.

01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:32.190
And Pluto has a very
elliptical orbit,

01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:36.120
so it gets actually
inside the orbit of Neptune

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.460
for part of the time, okay.

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:41.160 position:56%
So the feeling was well, when you're
close to the sun you get warmth

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.450
and that's going to cause
the atmosphere to come up.

01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:46.300
Now as you go far out,
now it gets very cold

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:52.450 position:56%
and the atmosphere condenses, so
the perihelion was 1988 or something

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:53.750
like that, I forgotten exactly.

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:55.450
That's when it closest to the sun.

01:02:55.450 --> 01:02:56.930
As It goes out, it's
just getting colder.

01:02:56.930 --> 01:03:02.180
We thought that we
better get out there soon.

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:03.480
Anything else?

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.780
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.580
&gt;&gt; Well again thank
you very much for --
