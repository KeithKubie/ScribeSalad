with our genomes and it leads to
misunderstandings of evolution like the

misunderstandings of evolution like the
 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.269
misunderstandings of evolution like the
idea that religious belief is a mind

structures are parasitizing human beings
 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.009
structures are parasitizing human beings
and they are wasting the time and effort

and they are wasting the time and effort

and they are wasting the time and effort
that those human beings are spending on

reasonable interpretation which is that

reasonable interpretation which is that
these belief systems have flourished

these belief systems have flourished
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.890
these belief systems have flourished
because they have facilitated the

belief systems are built around
 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.760
belief systems are built around
evolutionary success and they certainly

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770
evolutionary success and they certainly

there is abundance and people can afford

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730
there is abundance and people can afford
 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.150
there is abundance and people can afford
to be good to each other the problem is

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
to be good to each other the problem is
 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.430
to be good to each other the problem is
if you have grown up in a period in

if you have grown up in a period in
 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.210
if you have grown up in a period in
which abundance has been the standard

which abundance has been the standard
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.940

people change in the face of austerity

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440
people change in the face of austerity
 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.630
people change in the face of austerity
and so what we are currently seeing is

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640
and so what we are currently seeing is
 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.640
and so what we are currently seeing is
messages that we have all agreed are

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650
messages that we have all agreed are
 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.460
messages that we have all agreed are
unacceptable re-emerging because the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470
unacceptable re-emerging because the
 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.530
unacceptable re-emerging because the
signals that we have reached the the end

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
signals that we have reached the the end
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.780
signals that we have reached the the end
of the boom times those signals are

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790
of the boom times those signals are
 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.610
of the boom times those signals are
everywhere and so people are triggered

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620
everywhere and so people are triggered
 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.200
everywhere and so people are triggered
to move into a phase that they don't

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
to move into a phase that they don't
 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.660
to move into a phase that they don't
even know that they have despite the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
even know that they have despite the
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.969
even know that they have despite the
fact that human beings think that they

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979
fact that human beings think that they
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.800
fact that human beings think that they
have escaped the evolutionary paradigm

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
have escaped the evolutionary paradigm
 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.620
have escaped the evolutionary paradigm
they've done nothing of the kind and so

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
they've done nothing of the kind and so
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.230
they've done nothing of the kind and so
we should expect the belief systems that

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
we should expect the belief systems that
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.500
we should expect the belief systems that
people hold to mirror the evolutionary

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510
people hold to mirror the evolutionary
 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.500
people hold to mirror the evolutionary
interest that people have rather than to

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510
interest that people have rather than to
 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.880
interest that people have rather than to
match our our best instincts when we are

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
match our our best instincts when we are
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.280
match our our best instincts when we are
capable of being good to each other

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290
capable of being good to each other
 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.160
capable of being good to each other
because there's abundance we have those

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170
because there's abundance we have those
 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.960
because there's abundance we have those
instincts and so it's not incorrect to

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970
instincts and so it's not incorrect to
 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.260
instincts and so it's not incorrect to
say that human beings are capable of

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270
say that human beings are capable of
 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.000
say that human beings are capable of
being marvelous creatures and being

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010
being marvelous creatures and being
 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.920
being marvelous creatures and being
quite ethical and I would argue there's

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
quite ethical and I would argue there's
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.990
quite ethical and I would argue there's
a simple way of reconciling the correct

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
a simple way of reconciling the correct
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.880
a simple way of reconciling the correct
understanding that religious belief

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890
understanding that religious belief
 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.850
understanding that religious belief
often describes truths that in many

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860
often describes truths that in many
 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.370
often describes truths that in many
cases fly in the face of

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380
cases fly in the face of
 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.680
cases fly in the face of
we can understand scientifically with

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690
we can understand scientifically with
 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.030
we can understand scientifically with
the idea that these beliefs are adaptive

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040
the idea that these beliefs are adaptive
 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.850
the idea that these beliefs are adaptive
I call it the state of being literally

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860
I call it the state of being literally
 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.270
I call it the state of being literally
false and metaphorically true a belief

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280
false and metaphorically true a belief
 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.250
false and metaphorically true a belief
is literally false and metaphorically

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260
is literally false and metaphorically
 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.610
is literally false and metaphorically
true if it is not factual

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620
true if it is not factual
 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.980
true if it is not factual
but if behaving as if it were factual

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990
but if behaving as if it were factual
 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.560
but if behaving as if it were factual
results in an enhancement of one's

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570
results in an enhancement of one's
 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.490
results in an enhancement of one's
fitness to take an example if one

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500
fitness to take an example if one
 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.520
fitness to take an example if one
behaves in let's say the Christian

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530
behaves in let's say the Christian
 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.460
behaves in let's say the Christian
tradition in such a way as to gain

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470
tradition in such a way as to gain
 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.100
tradition in such a way as to gain
access to heaven one will not actually

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110
access to heaven one will not actually
 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.510
access to heaven one will not actually
find themselves at the pearly gates

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520
find themselves at the pearly gates
 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.030
find themselves at the pearly gates
being welcomed in but one does tend to

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040
being welcomed in but one does tend to
 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.760
being welcomed in but one does tend to
place their descendants in a good

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770
place their descendants in a good
 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.040
place their descendants in a good
position with respect to the community

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050
position with respect to the community
 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.720

that those descendants continue to live

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730
that those descendants continue to live
 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.540
that those descendants continue to live
in so if we were to think evolutionarily

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550
in so if we were to think evolutionarily
 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.210
in so if we were to think evolutionarily
