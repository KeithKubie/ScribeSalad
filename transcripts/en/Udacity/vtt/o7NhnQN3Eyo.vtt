00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.880
So we've all seen it.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.050
When we load an older app
on our nice new device,

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.930
sometimes icons look really,
really blurry.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.980
In these cases the app most likely
used a low-resolution asset for

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.210
a UI element that was
given a larger size.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.370
An easy first step to improving an app
is to make sure it has a high-resolution

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.100
assets like this one.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.590
Much better, right?

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.720
While you should generally
provide assets for

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.880
all these major density buckets, it's
normally okay to include just XHDPI or

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.970
XXHDPI assets, and let Android scale
them down or down-sample them.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.494
It's not ideal, but
if you had to pick one,

00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:42.125
provide the higher density assets and
not just the lower ones.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.030
However down-sampling has risks.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.510
There's a minor performance hit
when Android has to do scaling for

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.740
you on the fly.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.968
Additionally, Android's down-sampling
algorithm is really optimized for speed,

00:00:53.968 --> 00:00:55.630
not perfect scaling.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.810
It doesn't look great at all if you have
to down-sample from a very large 16 by

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.200
16 hundred pixel graphic to
a small 200 by 200 pixel space.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.050
The good news is,

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.850
there are lots of great tools out there
for automatically creating graphics for

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.910
all the major density buckets
when your creating you're app.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.210
One example that's useful for
icons is the Android Asset Studio.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.800
