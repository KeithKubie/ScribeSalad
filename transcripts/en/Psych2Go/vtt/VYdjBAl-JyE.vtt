00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.959
Sadness, loneliness and anxiety are normal
feelings that everyone has experienced.

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:11.210
These feelings can be triggered by specific
events, like the loss of a loved one or a

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.900
humiliating work experience.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.930
But when our dark emotional state begins to
cause physical symptoms and lasts for long

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.130
periods of time, it can dramatically affect
our everyday behavior and inhibit us from

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.439
leading normal healthy lives.

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.939
Despite the social stigma associated with
it, major depressive disorder is surprisingly

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:30.939
common.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.290
Studies show that 13% of the global population
will suffer from depression at some point

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.290
in their lives.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.290
And even the World Health Organization considers
depression to be a major factor in diseases

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.480
of all types.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.190
Despite depression being seemingly so commonplace,
the causes of depression and the different

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.530
factors that make it more likely to occur
are often misunderstood.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.940
So, what types of thought processes lead more
easily to depressive states and what makes

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.260
some people more likely than others to suffer
from chronic depression?

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.829
In a landmark 1992 study, Rose and Abramson
established a clear link between three pessimistic

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:10.330
tendencies, also called negative inferential
styles and chronic depression.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.100
Number one: Cause.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.740
The first occurs when an individual blames
global causes for negative life events instead

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.170
of specific causes.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.200
Someone who makes these types of attributions
will look at a negative event as caused by

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.659
something that cannot be changed by them and
extends across all areas of their life instead

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.450
of addressing the specifics of the situation
and looking to move forward from it in a positive

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.450
way.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.479
At the same time, they also assume that their
successes are one-off situations that are

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.530
lucky or coincidental and not a result of
their own effort and behavior.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.450
Number 2: Consequence.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.060
Even if someone does not assume that they
are the main unchanging cause of negative

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.010
events in their life, they may still have
trouble seeing how a negative situation could

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.840
turn out positively.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.440
People with this outlook on life see the worst
in every situation and assume the worst possible

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.740
outcomes.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.470
Even though they might not blame themselves
for a particular event, they tell themselves

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.509
that there's no way to recover from it, believing
that they will forever be dealing with the

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.520
consequences of the negative situation.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.090
Number 3: Self-image.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.370
Individuals with this third tendency regularly
compare themselves with others who are performing

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.000
better than them in a certain task.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.569
Because they view themselves so negatively
and believe that they are the cause of every

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.060
negative life event, they cannot see a way
forward from their current situation.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.260
They see themselves as the root cause of every
issue and so feel a deep sense of hopelessness.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.111
Although there are many different factors
which contribute to chronic depression, these

00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:48.420
negative attribution styles always play a
major role.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.050
Helping individuals who suffer from depression
to seek therapy focused on developing more

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.959
positive ways of thinking, building a strong
self-image and better understanding the root

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.630
causes of their emotions and how to constructively
deal with them is an essential part of treatment.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.760
As with most illness, the deep shame that
accompanies depression can be paralyzing.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.450
Please help end the stigma associated with
depression and other mental illnesses by coming

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.250
forward to speak about your own struggles,
encouraging others to come forward and always

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.340
being willing to listen without judgment.
