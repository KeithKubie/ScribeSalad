so the object of my discussion today is

so the object of my discussion today is

so the object of my discussion today is
to suggest that we all seize the day and

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290
to suggest that we all seize the day and
 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.710

this is a perhaps a rather grim image

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720
this is a perhaps a rather grim image
 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.570
this is a perhaps a rather grim image
but it suggests i think the urgency of

but it suggests i think the urgency of
 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.490
but it suggests i think the urgency of
the problem that most of us are facing i

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500
the problem that most of us are facing i
 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.800
the problem that most of us are facing i
suspect that all of us do some kind of

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810
suspect that all of us do some kind of
 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.990
suspect that all of us do some kind of
job to preserve our data but i'd be

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000
job to preserve our data but i'd be
 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.940
job to preserve our data but i'd be
willing to bet that most of us don't do

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950
willing to bet that most of us don't do
 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.970
willing to bet that most of us don't do
nearly what we need to do to preserve it

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980
nearly what we need to do to preserve it
 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.220

you really are hoping for but there's
 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.490
you really are hoping for but there's
also the question of archiving that

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500
also the question of archiving that
 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.680
also the question of archiving that
longer-term storage maybe you don't need

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690
longer-term storage maybe you don't need
 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.600
longer-term storage maybe you don't need
every state of your dissertation maybe

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610
every state of your dissertation maybe

digital archiving is a little different

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:35.990
digital archiving is a little different
 

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.050
digital archiving is a little different
than the mainstream because I i consider

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:38.060
than the mainstream because I i consider
 

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.970
than the mainstream because I i consider
archiving and the research process to be

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:39.980
archiving and the research process to be
 

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.430
archiving and the research process to be
intertwined with each other they don't

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:42.440
intertwined with each other they don't
 

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.560
intertwined with each other they don't
happen at separate moments they happen

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:44.570
happen at separate moments they happen
 

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.690
happen at separate moments they happen
simultaneously so it's important to

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:46.700
simultaneously so it's important to
 

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.640

archiving issues involved this is the

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480
archiving issues involved this is the
 

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.480
archiving issues involved this is the
typical one would you start your

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:58.490
typical one would you start your
 

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.550
typical one would you start your
research and then you store it somewhere

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560
research and then you store it somewhere
 

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.260

what I'm calling archiving there and
 

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:05.170
what I'm calling archiving there and
then you start drafting your paper the

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:05.180
then you start drafting your paper the
 

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.790
then you start drafting your paper the
the results of your research and then

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800
the results of your research and then
 

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.010
the results of your research and then
you can't find that thing that you were

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:09.020
you can't find that thing that you were
 

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.660
you can't find that thing that you were
looking for and like I said it's either

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:10.670
looking for and like I said it's either
 

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.600
looking for and like I said it's either
because I it's there and you can't find

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:13.610
because I it's there and you can't find
 

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.540
because I it's there and you can't find
it or you lost it so two things two

this talk was meant mostly for
 

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.080
this talk was meant mostly for
undergraduate so I kind of fix this one

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.090
undergraduate so I kind of fix this one

case you needed a refresher here is

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:09.140
case you needed a refresher here is
 

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.140

where you add information about other

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:11.150
where you add information about other
 

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.230
where you add information about other
information so there's two ways that

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240
information so there's two ways that
 

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.700
information so there's two ways that
you're going to encounter out there to

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:15.710
you're going to encounter out there to
 

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.560
you're going to encounter out there to
actually add this information at the at

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:17.570
actually add this information at the at
 

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:19.330
actually add this information at the at
the at the most basic level not at the

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:19.340
the at the most basic level not at the
 

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.770
the at the most basic level not at the
level of where the library had submitted

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:20.780
level of where the library had submitted

when you're working with files you can

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920
when you're working with files you can
 

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.830
when you're working with files you can
either put the meta data inside the file

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:27.840
either put the meta data inside the file
 

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.480
either put the meta data inside the file
for example when you open up a Microsoft

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:29.490
for example when you open up a Microsoft
 

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:30.920
for example when you open up a Microsoft
Word you can click on file and go to

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:30.930
Word you can click on file and go to
 

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.720

properties is going to open up that
 

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.000
properties is going to open up that
window and that's where you put the

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:35.010
window and that's where you put the
 

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.320
window and that's where you put the
information and that made the data and I

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:36.330
information and that made the data and I
 

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.720
information and that made the data and I
was going to be stored in the file the

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:38.730
was going to be stored in the file the
 

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.640
was going to be stored in the file the
other option is to have a tool itself

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:40.650
other option is to have a tool itself

and keeps them at a data separate for
 

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.360
and keeps them at a data separate for
from the item so in this particular case

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:47.370
from the item so in this particular case
 

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.450
from the item so in this particular case
is an example from cetera so that's

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:50.460
is an example from cetera so that's
 

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.920
is an example from cetera so that's
important to keep in mind because the

search strategies that you're going to
 

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.000
search strategies that you're going to
use in the future have to revolve around

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.010
use in the future have to revolve around
 

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.650
use in the future have to revolve around

and we're going to take a little detour

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:53.210
and we're going to take a little detour
 

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:57.190
and we're going to take a little detour
into the world of audio file formats and

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200
into the world of audio file formats and
 

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.150
into the world of audio file formats and
archiving

00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:58.160
archiving
 

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.510
archiving
and we're going to look backwards a

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520
and we're going to look backwards a
 

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.160
and we're going to look backwards a
little bit because we've been looking so

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:03.170
little bit because we've been looking so
 

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.900
little bit because we've been looking so
far at things that are already in

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:04.910
far at things that are already in
 

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.000
far at things that are already in
digital form and and this is on digital

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.010
digital form and and this is on digital
 

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.290
digital form and and this is on digital
archiving but a lot of the questions

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:08.300
archiving but a lot of the questions
 

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.380
archiving but a lot of the questions
that come up these V audio are actually

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:11.390
that come up these V audio are actually
 

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:14.620
that come up these V audio are actually
to do with transferring items from the

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:14.630
to do with transferring items from the
 

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:18.250
to do with transferring items from the
old analog world into digital formats

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:18.260
old analog world into digital formats
 

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.610
old analog world into digital formats
and storing them and i'm going to say

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:21.620
and storing them and i'm going to say
 

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.250
and storing them and i'm going to say
much of the same that my colleagues have

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:24.260
much of the same that my colleagues have
 

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.300
much of the same that my colleagues have
also said it's beginning to feel a

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:25.310
also said it's beginning to feel a
 

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:26.830

little bit like a revival meeting we're

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840
little bit like a revival meeting we're
 

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.410
little bit like a revival meeting we're
all like i have an archiving problem and

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:29.420
all like i have an archiving problem and
 

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.160
all like i have an archiving problem and
i'm here today to talk to you about it

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:32.170
i'm here today to talk to you about it
 

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.650
i'm here today to talk to you about it
so here are some of the formats that we

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:35.660
so here are some of the formats that we
 

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.000
so here are some of the formats that we
have to deal with and these are things

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.010
have to deal with and these are things
 

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:38.260
have to deal with and these are things
that come up off and in the music

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:38.270
that come up off and in the music
 

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.870
that come up off and in the music

i'm happy to say we've managed to keep

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880
i'm happy to say we've managed to keep
 

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.600
i'm happy to say we've managed to keep
out of the collection so far so we don't

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:55.610
out of the collection so far so we don't
 

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.130
out of the collection so far so we don't
have to deal with those I'm and some

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:57.140
have to deal with those I'm and some
 

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.900
have to deal with those I'm and some
other esoteric formats down in the

00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:58.910
other esoteric formats down in the
 

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.350
other esoteric formats down in the
bottom there but the key things to think

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360
bottom there but the key things to think
 

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.420
bottom there but the key things to think
about with audio and video are the audio

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:04.430
about with audio and video are the audio
 

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:07.090
about with audio and video are the audio
formats themselves for both the analog

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:07.100
formats themselves for both the analog
 

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.480
formats themselves for both the analog
and the digital files the when we're

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:10.490
and the digital files the when we're
 

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:12.550
and the digital files the when we're
going back into the analog world we have

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:12.560
going back into the analog world we have
 

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.620
going back into the analog world we have
to think about the playback equipment

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:14.630
to think about the playback equipment
 

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:16.390
to think about the playback equipment
that's going to be able to bring those

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400
that's going to be able to bring those
 

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.190
that's going to be able to bring those
formats into the digital realm so that's

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:18.200
formats into the digital realm so that's
 

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.320
formats into the digital realm so that's
a major thing to think about the

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:20.330
a major thing to think about the
 

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.850
a major thing to think about the
encoding equipment which we're going to

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:21.860
encoding equipment which we're going to
 

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.070
encoding equipment which we're going to
use to actually do the digital files

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080
use to actually do the digital files
 

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.520
use to actually do the digital files
from analog sources and that brings up

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:27.530
from analog sources and that brings up
 

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:28.960
from analog sources and that brings up
the issue of storage requirements

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:28.970
the issue of storage requirements
 

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.850
the issue of storage requirements
because a lot of these audio and video

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:30.860
because a lot of these audio and video
 

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:34.060
because a lot of these audio and video
files are massive especially video I'll

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:34.070
files are massive especially video I'll
 

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.580
files are massive especially video I'll
just put a disclaimer in here that video

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:36.590
just put a disclaimer in here that video
 

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.380
just put a disclaimer in here that video
is not really my expertise it's kind of

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:38.390
is not really my expertise it's kind of
 

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.540
is not really my expertise it's kind of
just along for the ride here a lot of

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:40.550
just along for the ride here a lot of
 

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:42.310
just along for the ride here a lot of
the issues are the same but most of the

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320
the issues are the same but most of the
 

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.360
the issues are the same but most of the
tools i'm going to be talking about

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:43.370
tools i'm going to be talking about
 

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:46.360
tools i'm going to be talking about
today are specific to audio and then

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:46.370
today are specific to audio and then
 

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:47.650
today are specific to audio and then
lastly there's the issue you've heard

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:47.660
lastly there's the issue you've heard
 

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.990
lastly there's the issue you've heard
about of metadata which is critical for

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000
about of metadata which is critical for
 

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.330
about of metadata which is critical for
all of these various digital archiving

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:52.340
all of these various digital archiving
 

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.690
all of these various digital archiving
things so triage my first suggestion

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:55.700
things so triage my first suggestion
 

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.660
things so triage my first suggestion
here echoes what you've heard already

00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:58.670
here echoes what you've heard already
 

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:00.670
here echoes what you've heard already
which is that i think the critical thing

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:00.680
which is that i think the critical thing
 

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.920
which is that i think the critical thing
is to decide out of the files you have

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:02.930
is to decide out of the files you have
 

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:04.570
is to decide out of the files you have
which are the ones that are really

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:04.580
which are the ones that are really
 

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:08.230
which are the ones that are really
important to preserve I think for audio

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240
important to preserve I think for audio
 

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.880
important to preserve I think for audio
most of us probably have the experience

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:09.890
most of us probably have the experience
 

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:11.530
most of us probably have the experience
where we have you know casual listening

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:11.540
where we have you know casual listening
 

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.130
where we have you know casual listening
files

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:12.140
files
 

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.140
files
may have downloaded that we don't really

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:14.150
may have downloaded that we don't really
 

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:17.110
may have downloaded that we don't really
care if they're on next summer but we

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120
care if they're on next summer but we
 

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.550
care if they're on next summer but we
then have things that might be oral

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:18.560
then have things that might be oral
 

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.340
then have things that might be oral
histories or family audio that we might

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:21.350
histories or family audio that we might
 

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:23.620

want to have in 20 or 30 years so you're

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:23.630
want to have in 20 or 30 years so you're
 

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.030
want to have in 20 or 30 years so you're
going to make different choices based on

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:25.040
going to make different choices based on
 

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.430
going to make different choices based on
the actual type of material that you're

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440
the actual type of material that you're
 

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.140
the actual type of material that you're
looking at and I think one of the most

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:29.150
looking at and I think one of the most
 

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:30.700
looking at and I think one of the most
important places to start it's just to

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:30.710
important places to start it's just to
 

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.620
important places to start it's just to
do a survey of the materials that you

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:32.630
do a survey of the materials that you
 

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.810
do a survey of the materials that you
have in audio and video format and make

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:34.820
have in audio and video format and make
 

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.400
have in audio and video format and make
some decisions about what's critical

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:36.410
some decisions about what's critical
 

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:38.470
some decisions about what's critical
what's casual you don't really care

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480
what's casual you don't really care
 

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.930
what's casual you don't really care
about losing it in the year to medium

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:40.940
about losing it in the year to medium
 

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.880
about losing it in the year to medium
you want to keep it for a couple years

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:42.890
you want to keep it for a couple years
 

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:44.560
you want to keep it for a couple years
you may want to refer to it and then

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:44.570
you may want to refer to it and then
 

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.900
you may want to refer to it and then
critical you have to have that you're

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:46.910
critical you have to have that you're
 

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.280
critical you have to have that you're
going to make different decisions in

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:48.290
going to make different decisions in
 

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.820
going to make different decisions in
archiving based on those things and not

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:51.830
archiving based on those things and not
 

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.130

okay folks we can we can all agree that

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:55.910
okay folks we can we can all agree that
 

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.030
okay folks we can we can all agree that
it's okay to let some of this stuff go I

00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:58.040
it's okay to let some of this stuff go I
 

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.420
it's okay to let some of this stuff go I
mean from personal experience I think

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:01.430
mean from personal experience I think
 

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:03.370
mean from personal experience I think
it's important to you know parse your

it's important to you know parse your
 

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.990
it's important to you know parse your
content and realize because otherwise

it's really honestly an unmanageable

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:06.980

formats with new formats coming up every
 

00:38:34.359 --> 00:38:39.059
formats with new formats coming up every
year and you know which is generally not

00:38:39.059 --> 00:38:39.069

something you can just memorize once

00:38:40.979 --> 00:38:40.989
something you can just memorize once
 

00:38:40.989 --> 00:38:43.799
something you can just memorize once
because things change faster than you

00:38:43.799 --> 00:38:43.809
because things change faster than you
 

00:38:43.809 --> 00:38:46.529
because things change faster than you
can memorize them so when you are your

00:38:46.529 --> 00:38:46.539
can memorize them so when you are your
 

00:38:46.539 --> 00:38:49.049
can memorize them so when you are your
own archivist you just go you follow the

00:38:49.049 --> 00:38:49.059
own archivist you just go you follow the
 

00:38:49.059 --> 00:38:51.989
own archivist you just go you follow the
steps that we always followed when we

00:38:51.989 --> 00:38:51.999
steps that we always followed when we
 

00:38:51.999 --> 00:38:53.969
steps that we always followed when we
dealt with whatever collections and

00:38:53.969 --> 00:38:53.979
dealt with whatever collections and
 

00:38:53.979 --> 00:38:56.069
dealt with whatever collections and
whatever formats that come our way so

00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079
whatever formats that come our way so
 

00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:58.799
whatever formats that come our way so
first is identify the scope and the

first is identify the scope and the
 

00:38:58.809 --> 00:38:59.849
first is identify the scope and the
purpose of your

00:38:59.849 --> 00:38:59.859
purpose of your
 

00:38:59.859 --> 00:39:03.029

the previous presenters emphasize that

00:39:05.279 --> 00:39:05.289
the previous presenters emphasize that
 

00:39:05.289 --> 00:39:08.190
the previous presenters emphasize that
you know how important it is to keep

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:08.200
you know how important it is to keep
 

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.529
you know how important it is to keep
track of everything you do where while

00:39:10.529 --> 00:39:10.539
track of everything you do where while

you do it which is which is I which is
 

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.809
you do it which is which is I which is
ideal but it's not always the case when

00:39:15.809 --> 00:39:15.819
ideal but it's not always the case when
 

00:39:15.819 --> 00:39:18.180
ideal but it's not always the case when
it's it's not always possible because

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:18.190
it's it's not always possible because
 

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:19.589
it's it's not always possible because
there could be situations when you know

00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599
there could be situations when you know
 

00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:21.720
there could be situations when you know
something started and you didn't know it

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:21.730
something started and you didn't know it
 

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.700
something started and you didn't know it
will grow up into something interesting

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:23.710
will grow up into something interesting
 

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:26.729
will grow up into something interesting
or you realize that some you know social

00:39:26.729 --> 00:39:26.739
or you realize that some you know social
 

00:39:26.739 --> 00:39:28.859
or you realize that some you know social
network chatter that you you know

00:39:28.859 --> 00:39:28.869
network chatter that you you know
 

00:39:28.869 --> 00:39:30.630
network chatter that you you know
conducted for a while actually grew up

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640
conducted for a while actually grew up
 

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.430
conducted for a while actually grew up
in an interesting project and now it has

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:32.440
in an interesting project and now it has
 

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.319
in an interesting project and now it has
to be saved as a part of the project so

00:39:34.319 --> 00:39:34.329
to be saved as a part of the project so
 

00:39:34.329 --> 00:39:38.460
to be saved as a part of the project so
basically while sometimes you know that

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:38.470
basically while sometimes you know that
 

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:40.529
basically while sometimes you know that
you're dealing with the gray that you're

00:39:40.529 --> 00:39:40.539
you're dealing with the gray that you're
 

00:39:40.539 --> 00:39:41.970
you're dealing with the gray that you're
dealing with something important and you

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:41.980
dealing with something important and you
 

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:43.589
dealing with something important and you
can't keep track of it as you go

00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599
can't keep track of it as you go
 

00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:45.749
can't keep track of it as you go
sometimes you just realize after a while

00:39:45.749 --> 00:39:45.759
sometimes you just realize after a while
 

00:39:45.759 --> 00:39:47.460
sometimes you just realize after a while
that you have a bunch of material by two

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:47.470
that you have a bunch of material by two
 

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:49.440
that you have a bunch of material by two
digital materials that you need to

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:49.450
digital materials that you need to
 

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:51.660
digital materials that you need to
archive somehow and figure out which

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:51.670
archive somehow and figure out which
 

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:52.979
archive somehow and figure out which
one's of them are more important than

00:39:52.979 --> 00:39:52.989
one's of them are more important than
 

00:39:52.989 --> 00:39:55.259
one's of them are more important than
the others and this is basically

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:55.269
the others and this is basically
 

00:39:55.269 --> 00:39:59.700
the others and this is basically
analogous to our archival world where we

00:39:59.700 --> 00:39:59.710
analogous to our archival world where we
 

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:02.220
analogous to our archival world where we
have ongoing institutional donors with

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:02.230
have ongoing institutional donors with
 

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:04.319
have ongoing institutional donors with
whom we give them all kinds of

00:40:04.319 --> 00:40:04.329
whom we give them all kinds of
 

00:40:04.329 --> 00:40:05.819
whom we give them all kinds of
guidelines and ask them to follow

00:40:05.819 --> 00:40:05.829
guidelines and ask them to follow
 

00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:07.829
guidelines and ask them to follow
conventions and to keep the metadata as

00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839
conventions and to keep the metadata as
 

00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:10.650
conventions and to keep the metadata as
they go along or we have archives that

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:10.660
they go along or we have archives that
 

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.390
they go along or we have archives that
we accession from I don't know a great

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400
we accession from I don't know a great
 

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.849

writers who never kept any truck well

00:40:14.849 --> 00:40:14.859
writers who never kept any truck well
 

00:40:14.859 --> 00:40:18.299
writers who never kept any truck well
about of his materials so then you just

00:40:18.299 --> 00:40:18.309
about of his materials so then you just
 

00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:20.249
about of his materials so then you just
get whatever you get and you try to

00:40:20.249 --> 00:40:20.259
get whatever you get and you try to
 

00:40:20.259 --> 00:40:22.410
get whatever you get and you try to
figure out what what's the best way to

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:22.420
figure out what what's the best way to
 

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.319
figure out what what's the best way to
deal with it once you have it so in a

00:40:25.319 --> 00:40:25.329
deal with it once you have it so in a
 

00:40:25.329 --> 00:40:27.779
deal with it once you have it so in a
way that's the same thing if you neglect

00:40:27.779 --> 00:40:27.789
way that's the same thing if you neglect
 

00:40:27.789 --> 00:40:29.910
way that's the same thing if you neglect
it to keep track of your materials and

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920
it to keep track of your materials and
 

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.759
it to keep track of your materials and
now you want to don't panic you know

00:40:32.759 --> 00:40:32.769
now you want to don't panic you know
 

00:40:32.769 --> 00:40:36.359
now you want to don't panic you know
it's it's okay you just Oh start with

00:40:36.359 --> 00:40:36.369
it's it's okay you just Oh start with
 

00:40:36.369 --> 00:40:38.160
it's it's okay you just Oh start with
the first step and identify what's the

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:38.170
the first step and identify what's the
 

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:39.479
the first step and identify what's the
scope of the things you need to collect

00:40:39.479 --> 00:40:39.489
scope of the things you need to collect
 

00:40:39.489 --> 00:40:42.059
scope of the things you need to collect
then you know this if you identify it

00:40:42.059 --> 00:40:42.069
then you know this if you identify it
 

00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:45.420
then you know this if you identify it
right then you select whatever is within

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:45.430
right then you select whatever is within
 

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:47.940
right then you select whatever is within
your scope and what's outside then you

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:47.950
your scope and what's outside then you
 

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:50.759
your scope and what's outside then you
see how you can do minimal arrangement

00:40:50.759 --> 00:40:50.769
see how you can do minimal arrangement
 

00:40:50.769 --> 00:40:52.349
see how you can do minimal arrangement
and description so that you can navigate

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:52.359
and description so that you can navigate
 

00:40:52.359 --> 00:40:54.930
and description so that you can navigate
the materials and they are useful and

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:54.940
the materials and they are useful and
 

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.819
the materials and they are useful and
you know what's the best preservation of

00:40:56.819 --> 00:40:56.829
you know what's the best preservation of
 

00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:58.650
you know what's the best preservation of
storage methods and then you figure out

00:40:58.650 --> 00:40:58.660
storage methods and then you figure out
 

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.509
storage methods and then you figure out
what kind of access you want to give

00:41:00.509 --> 00:41:00.519
what kind of access you want to give
 

00:41:00.519 --> 00:41:03.599
what kind of access you want to give
yourself on the word for that so

00:41:03.599 --> 00:41:03.609
yourself on the word for that so
 

00:41:03.609 --> 00:41:06.749
yourself on the word for that so
basically you'll so they lease across

00:41:06.749 --> 00:41:06.759
basically you'll so they lease across
 

00:41:06.759 --> 00:41:11.849
basically you'll so they lease across
key a definition I you know paired mine

down to two

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:13.180
down to two
 

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:17.609
down to two
sirs what exactly is the digital

00:41:17.609 --> 00:41:17.619
sirs what exactly is the digital
 

00:41:17.619 --> 00:41:19.620
sirs what exactly is the digital
materials that you collect pertain to

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:19.630
materials that you collect pertain to
 

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:22.440
materials that you collect pertain to
and what kind of purpose they supposed

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:22.450
and what kind of purpose they supposed
 

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:24.420
and what kind of purpose they supposed
to serve and these decisions would be

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:24.430
to serve and these decisions would be
 

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:26.430
to serve and these decisions would be
defined your future your further steps

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:26.440
defined your future your further steps
 

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.559
defined your future your further steps
because let's say for example if the

00:41:28.559 --> 00:41:28.569
because let's say for example if the
 

00:41:28.569 --> 00:41:30.809
because let's say for example if the
materials are for the purpose of being

00:41:30.809 --> 00:41:30.819
materials are for the purpose of being
 

00:41:30.819 --> 00:41:32.970

list you sit down and once you have the

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760
list you sit down and once you have the
 

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.220
list you sit down and once you have the

want to archive everything that has to

00:41:56.579 --> 00:41:56.589
want to archive everything that has to
 

00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:58.440
want to archive everything that has to
do with my Columbia affiliated

00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:58.450
do with my Columbia affiliated
 

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:00.540
do with my Columbia affiliated
activities and then you sit down and you

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:00.550
activities and then you sit down and you
 

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:01.890
activities and then you sit down and you
write down everything that you can think

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:01.900
write down everything that you can think
 

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.020

make a clone of the other of the hard
 

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:07.450
make a clone of the other of the hard

important you all of a sudden see is
 

00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:57.770
important you all of a sudden see is
part of something important and then the

00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:57.780
part of something important and then the
 

00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:59.180
part of something important and then the
question is what do you do with this

00:53:59.180 --> 00:53:59.190
question is what do you do with this
 

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:01.880

thing that probably will be archived and

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:13.620
thing that probably will be archived and
 

00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:16.640
thing that probably will be archived and
taken care of as people go and that's

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:16.650
taken care of as people go and that's
 

00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:18.710
taken care of as people go and that's
the best practice but you know I just

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720
the best practice but you know I just
 

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.480

think people don't know what's important

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:20.490
think people don't know what's important
 

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:22.970
think people don't know what's important
what's not very often until some time

00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:22.980
what's not very often until some time
 

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:25.040
what's not very often until some time
some years later when they look back and

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:25.050
some years later when they look back and
 

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:26.360
some years later when they look back and
all of a sudden they see that something

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:26.370
all of a sudden they see that something
 

00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:27.710
all of a sudden they see that something
that didn't think is important is

00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720
that didn't think is important is
 

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.900
that didn't think is important is
important and then you can go archive

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:29.910
important and then you can go archive
 

00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:32.030
important and then you can go archive
and beg them up and as many places you

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:32.040
and beg them up and as many places you

a funny example of that actually because

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:35.950
a funny example of that actually because
 

00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:37.500
a funny example of that actually because
during the whole Monica Lewinsky scandal

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:37.510
during the whole Monica Lewinsky scandal
 

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:39.870
during the whole Monica Lewinsky scandal
was a moment where lots of folks were

00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:39.880
was a moment where lots of folks were

and so actually after the scandal broke

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:48.660
and so actually after the scandal broke
 

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:51.120
and so actually after the scandal broke
obviously Lewinsky and President Clinton

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:51.130
obviously Lewinsky and President Clinton
 

00:54:51.130 --> 00:54:53.579
obviously Lewinsky and President Clinton
never appeared together again but they

00:54:53.579 --> 00:54:53.589
never appeared together again but they
 

00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:55.680
never appeared together again but they
had in the past a couple of times and

00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:55.690
had in the past a couple of times and
 

00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:57.329
had in the past a couple of times and
there was only one fellow who happened

00:54:57.329 --> 00:54:57.339
there was only one fellow who happened

to have video footage of them together
 

00:55:00.190 --> 00:55:02.099
to have video footage of them together
so that became the shot that everybody

00:55:02.099 --> 00:55:02.109
so that became the shot that everybody
 

00:55:02.109 --> 00:55:05.370
so that became the shot that everybody
saw and you know at the time of what he

00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:05.380
saw and you know at the time of what he
 

00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:08.000
saw and you know at the time of what he
knew it was would ever be relevant but

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:08.010
knew it was would ever be relevant but
 

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:10.559
knew it was would ever be relevant but
but to flip that on its head I think one

00:55:10.559 --> 00:55:10.569
but to flip that on its head I think one
 

00:55:10.569 --> 00:55:12.539
but to flip that on its head I think one
of the things that really all the

00:55:12.539 --> 00:55:12.549
of the things that really all the
 

00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:16.019
of the things that really all the
speakers at hit on is if you if you

00:55:16.019 --> 00:55:16.029
speakers at hit on is if you if you
 

00:55:16.029 --> 00:55:18.450

don't have a strategy for managing your
 

00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:20.549
don't have a strategy for managing your
personal archives then you're going to

00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559
personal archives then you're going to
 

00:55:20.559 --> 00:55:22.980
personal archives then you're going to
end up in that open / archived position

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:22.990
end up in that open / archived position
 

00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:24.930

you've got everything and you don't know
 

00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:27.779
you've got everything and you don't know
what everything is so actually taking

00:55:27.779 --> 00:55:27.789
what everything is so actually taking
 

00:55:27.789 --> 00:55:29.370
what everything is so actually taking
some time to think about how can I

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:29.380
some time to think about how can I
 

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:32.279
some time to think about how can I
organize this how can i maybe automate

00:55:32.279 --> 00:55:32.289
organize this how can i maybe automate
 

00:55:32.289 --> 00:55:33.930

some of the file naming or things like

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:33.940
some of the file naming or things like
 

00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:36.059
some of the file naming or things like
this in order to to really make it

00:55:36.059 --> 00:55:36.069
this in order to to really make it
 

00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:37.620
this in order to to really make it
easier for me down the road to say oh

you can go back and find it later figure
 

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:53.999
you can go back and find it later figure
out what's why important anything I

then go back later and say did I really
need these things and sort of cool

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:17.230
need these things and sort of cool

interesting problem and I think we're

00:56:29.249 --> 00:56:29.259
interesting problem and I think we're
 

00:56:29.259 --> 00:56:30.660
interesting problem and I think we're
just getting our heads around it as a

speech has suddenly become captured and

and it's hard we look at it it looks
 

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.280
and it's hard we look at it it looks
like the kind of written texts we had in

like the kind of written texts we had in
 

00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:45.840
like the kind of written texts we had in
the past and we think we've got to have

the past and we think we've got to have

example shows but but I think we do need
