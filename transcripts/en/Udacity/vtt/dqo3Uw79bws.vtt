00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.018
So, let's see if we can figure out the disk access time. Suppose we have a disk

00:00:05.018 --> 00:00:07.787
that has a 1000 cylinders and 10 sectors

00:00:07.787 --> 00:00:11.970
per track. Suppose that the head assemble starts out

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.022
at cylinder 0, at one end of the

00:00:14.022 --> 00:00:17.214
disk, and the cylinders are of course numbered 0

00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:21.550
through 999. Suppose that the speed at which the

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.430
head assembly can move is 10 microseconds per cylinder.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.718
So it's moving at linear speed. And the

00:00:28.718 --> 00:00:32.900
disk rotates 100 times per second. Suppose we have

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.020
a perfect controller in the bus, or very, very

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.394
fast relative to this. And suppose that there is

00:00:39.394 --> 00:00:41.176
no previous request so we don't have to

00:00:41.176 --> 00:00:44.776
worry about queuing. So the question for you is

00:00:44.776 --> 00:00:47.436
what is the average time to read a randomly

00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:50.476
chosen byte from this disk, where every bite on

00:00:50.476 --> 00:00:53.600
the disc has the same chance of being requested?
