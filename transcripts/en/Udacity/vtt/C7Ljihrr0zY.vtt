00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.217
I'm keeping a list of books I want to read. Realistically, this would probably

00:00:03.217 --> 00:00:06.974
have 50 items in it, but right now I'll keep it short. I'll start reading again

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:10.067
when you're writing your own programs from scratch in Java. Let's say there are

00:00:10.067 --> 00:00:14.186
six books in my list to read for now. I'll store them as strings in an array

00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:18.220
list, so they would be indexed like this. For now I'll store them as strings to

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.740
make this exercise less typing, but if I were doing this for real, I would

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.134
probably make a book class, so I could store authors and my friend who

00:00:23.134 --> 00:00:28.206
recommended the book to me. Now a friend just recommended that I read Why

00:00:28.206 --> 00:00:32.598
Zebras Don't Get Ulcers. I've decided that I want to read it after I read Night

00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:37.026
Watch but before I read Next. What would method should I use to insert Why

00:00:37.026 --> 00:00:40.869
Zebras Don't Get Ulcers after Night Watch and before Next without removing

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:43.641
anything from the list?
