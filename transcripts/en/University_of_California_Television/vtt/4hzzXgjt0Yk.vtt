00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:04.467
- [Narrator] This UCSD TV
program is presented by

00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:06.751
University of California Television.

00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:07.950

to keep up with the latest programs.

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:21.533
(piano music)

00:00:23.213 --> 00:00:26.002
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.502
Bipedal, naked, large brained.

00:00:31.224 --> 00:00:35.289
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.706
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:42.867
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:44.950
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:48.485
We grow up slowly.

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:51.165
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:51.165 --> 00:00:53.248
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.073
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.073 --> 00:00:58.240
understanding of the past.

00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:02.184
Carta brings together experts from

00:01:02.184 --> 00:01:06.646
diverse disciplines to
exchange insights on who we are

00:01:06.646 --> 00:01:08.313
and how we got here.

00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:11.803
An exploration made possible by the

00:01:11.803 --> 00:01:14.303
generosity of humans like you.

00:01:30.434 --> 00:01:32.934
(piano music)

00:02:01.343 --> 00:02:03.161
- That's kind of a
gruesome picture isn't it?

00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:06.972
But I like to imagine Darwin
in the dissecting room

00:02:06.972 --> 00:02:09.715
actually helping us all out.

00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:11.988
So this is a lecture that's
an experiment for me.

00:02:11.988 --> 00:02:13.088
It's shifting the focus.

00:02:13.088 --> 00:02:15.120
All of my previous lectures
about evolution and medicine

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.428
have been about traits, things
like height and pneumonia

00:02:18.428 --> 00:02:19.891
and cancer and all the rest.

00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:21.882
Today I'm going to shift
gears and try to apply

00:02:21.882 --> 00:02:24.372
the things we learned about how to analyze

00:02:24.372 --> 00:02:26.731
why traits are vulnerable to disease,

00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:29.867
and ask instead why
genes that cause disease

00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:31.896
persist in the genome despite

00:02:31.896 --> 00:02:34.244
the actions of natural selection.

00:02:34.244 --> 00:02:36.026
Evolution of medicine,
just to be very clear,

00:02:36.026 --> 00:02:38.238
is not a specialized method of practice.

00:02:38.238 --> 00:02:40.583
There's nothing alternative
about it whatsoever.

00:02:40.583 --> 00:02:42.068
It's simply applying the well established

00:02:42.068 --> 00:02:44.843
basic principles from evolutionary biology

00:02:44.843 --> 00:02:46.666
to medicine and public health,

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.308
and trying to use them
to improve human health.

00:02:49.308 --> 00:02:50.986
So the central question
I've been preoccupied by

00:02:50.986 --> 00:02:53.259
is why do bodies have traits that

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:55.029
make them vulnerable to disease?

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:56.031
Completely different from the

00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:57.996
usual medical research question.

00:02:57.996 --> 00:03:01.461
Most medical research is about
why people are different.

00:03:01.461 --> 00:03:04.546
Our interest is instead
about why we are all the same

00:03:04.546 --> 00:03:08.290
in ways that are kind of like
the gas tank on the pinto.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.228
There are things about our bodies,

00:03:11.228 --> 00:03:12.892
from our backs to our appendices,

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:15.071
we'll get to that in a moment.

00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:16.230
The first half of medical school

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.497
you must react with awe if
you're paying attention at all.

00:03:20.497 --> 00:03:22.830
The loop of Henle in the kidney?

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.839
No details now, but oh my gosh.

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:27.558
If you're not astounded,
you're not paying attention.

00:03:27.558 --> 00:03:30.243
Everybody recognizes
how great the heart is

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:32.113
and the valves in the right
place at the right time

00:03:32.113 --> 00:03:35.118
and the pump does not need
to be oiled every few months.

00:03:35.118 --> 00:03:37.593
The eye is miraculous in the fact

00:03:37.593 --> 00:03:41.760
of its astounding function,
although it's not well designed.

00:03:42.814 --> 00:03:45.214
The human hand is almost equally good

00:03:45.214 --> 00:03:47.130
in terms of all of those
muscles and tendons

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.048
and joints working in tandem to allow

00:03:50.048 --> 00:03:52.665
us to do amazing things.

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:56.340
The clotting mechanism had
better work well or else,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.574
and then the part of
biology that I thought

00:03:58.574 --> 00:04:01.288
was absolutely ridiculous and stupid

00:04:01.288 --> 00:04:03.903
and at least made me mad
when I was a medical student

00:04:03.903 --> 00:04:05.996
and now I find fascinating because of

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:08.425
taking an evolutionary
viewpoint, is biochemistry

00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:10.648
and intermediary metabolism.

00:04:10.648 --> 00:04:12.574
(audience laughs)

00:04:12.574 --> 00:04:14.405
For any students in the
audience I assure you,

00:04:14.405 --> 00:04:16.120
don't pay attention to your professors.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.057
Go to evolutionary
thinking about these things

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:19.112
and it will make sense.

00:04:19.112 --> 00:04:20.484
That's the first half of medical school.

00:04:20.484 --> 00:04:22.946
Second half, you get to the
clinic and what do you see?

00:04:22.946 --> 00:04:24.167
Somebody goofed.

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:27.658
You start off with the wisdom teeth, why?

00:04:27.658 --> 00:04:30.491
You go further to the appendix, whoa!

00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:32.726
You go further to the place in your arm

00:04:32.726 --> 00:04:34.844
that always breaks when you fall forward.

00:04:34.844 --> 00:04:36.066
Why isn't it bigger?

00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:37.517
The coronary arteries, couldn't they

00:04:37.517 --> 00:04:40.170
just be a little bit wider please?

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.410
And as for that birth canal, why not

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.978
just have a zipper on the
front instead of, it's,

00:04:45.978 --> 00:04:49.096
and then there's the spine
as I mentioned before.

00:04:49.096 --> 00:04:50.379
And the body could be so much better

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:51.731
in so many different ways.

00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:54.561
These are traits, not genes, just traits.

00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:56.653
And the old answer about
why natural selection

00:04:56.653 --> 00:04:59.639
didn't do a better job is
well it's a random process

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.356
and it's not that strong.

00:05:01.356 --> 00:05:04.097
That is absolutely one
important contribution

00:05:04.097 --> 00:05:07.647
to why bodies aren't
better, but it's only one.

00:05:07.647 --> 00:05:09.763
And a foundation for evolutionary thinking

00:05:09.763 --> 00:05:13.050
in medicine has been to analyze
every kind of vulnerability

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.135
of a trait in terms of six possible

00:05:15.135 --> 00:05:19.936
different evolutionary
reasons why we're vulnerable.

00:05:19.936 --> 00:05:21.419
I'm going to list them very quickly,

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:22.576
and I've given many many lectures

00:05:22.576 --> 00:05:24.337
about these applying to traits.

00:05:24.337 --> 00:05:25.901
They're on the web if you're interested.

00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:27.064
Today I'm gonna zip through them

00:05:27.064 --> 00:05:29.206
and apply them to genes.

00:05:29.206 --> 00:05:31.755
One is natural selection just can't do it.

00:05:31.755 --> 00:05:33.418
Two is we're living in an environment

00:05:33.418 --> 00:05:36.465
very different from the
environment in which we evolved.

00:05:36.465 --> 00:05:38.691
Three is that pathogens,
bacteria and viruses

00:05:38.691 --> 00:05:40.687
evolve faster than we do.

00:05:40.687 --> 00:05:43.128
Four is trade-offs,
nothing can be perfect.

00:05:43.128 --> 00:05:44.931
Everything can be adjusted in ways

00:05:44.931 --> 00:05:46.374
that are better, but at the cost

00:05:46.374 --> 00:05:48.140
of making something else worse.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.403
Five, and this is a deep one.

00:05:50.403 --> 00:05:52.263
Natural selection does
not shape any organism

00:05:52.263 --> 00:05:55.962
for health, or longevity or
happiness or cooperation.

00:05:55.962 --> 00:05:57.976
It shapes all of them for maximizing

00:05:57.976 --> 00:06:00.286
their ability to transmit their genes.

00:06:00.286 --> 00:06:01.891
Very disturbing idea.

00:06:01.891 --> 00:06:04.845
The last is, useful defenses
that seem like diseases

00:06:04.845 --> 00:06:08.349
such as fever, pain,
nausea, vomiting, cough,

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:09.934
and all the rest.

00:06:09.934 --> 00:06:12.052
Now I'm going to shift
though my usual talk

00:06:12.052 --> 00:06:14.289
and give up on talking about traits,

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:15.775
and ask about genes.

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:17.834
The focus of so much
modern medical research,

00:06:17.834 --> 00:06:22.761
and ask why do genes that
increase risk of disease persist?

00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:25.873
And the first thing I recognized
as I started down this path

00:06:25.873 --> 00:06:28.251
is that we don't need to just
talk about the usual foci

00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:31.285
of medical research which are the myriad

00:06:31.285 --> 00:06:34.071
kinds of specific variations in genes

00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:35.655
that make us vulnerable to disease.

00:06:35.655 --> 00:06:39.431
We also need to talk about
genes that we all share

00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:40.571
that are fixed.

00:06:40.571 --> 00:06:42.265
Fixed means we all have it.

00:06:42.265 --> 00:06:44.639
That make us vulnerable to disease.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.087
This led me to just say
there's four different

00:06:46.087 --> 00:06:48.141
kinds of genes we should
be thinking about.

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:50.902
First are the regular
ones, widespread variation,

00:06:50.902 --> 00:06:53.448
all the regular genetic studies.

00:06:53.448 --> 00:06:56.233
Two, variation between populations.

00:06:56.233 --> 00:06:58.451
DARC is a gene that almost everyone

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:02.009
in Africa has because it
protects against vivax malaria.

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:05.375
Hardly anyone living in
northern climates has this gene.

00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:07.863
Fixed or missing genes
for everybody recently.

00:07:07.863 --> 00:07:09.927
Recently, the past few million years.

00:07:09.927 --> 00:07:12.927
The one that studies Neu5Gc and GLO.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.279
More about those in just a moment.

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:20.681
The fourth category is
genes that we all have,

00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:23.930
such as genes that make bilirubin

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.280
and genes that make dopamine,

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.013
all of which make us
vulnerable to disease.

00:07:29.013 --> 00:07:30.290
So a big shift in thinking here.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.325
Not just variations among individuals

00:07:32.325 --> 00:07:35.235
and their different genes,
but genes that we all have

00:07:35.235 --> 00:07:37.106
that make us vulnerable to disease.

00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:39.078
The first reason, limits of selection.

00:07:39.078 --> 00:07:41.019
Lot of selection can't do things

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:45.800
and the biggest limit to
selection is mutations happen.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.706
About 60 to 130 per
individual per generation

00:07:49.706 --> 00:07:51.707
and a deep question for another time

00:07:51.707 --> 00:07:54.935
is how on earth the genome
can fail to melt down

00:07:54.935 --> 00:07:57.023
given the difficulty of
getting rid of each of those,

00:07:57.023 --> 00:08:01.050
but they are all gradually
selected out by natural selection

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.388
except that natural selection
is by no means all powerful.

00:08:04.388 --> 00:08:06.462
There's something that
geneticists call drift,

00:08:06.462 --> 00:08:08.728
which is really referring
to random factors

00:08:08.728 --> 00:08:11.137
that make genes become more or less common

00:08:11.137 --> 00:08:13.401
just by luck of the draw, not because

00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:17.281
of anything pushing them to
higher or lower frequencies.

00:08:17.281 --> 00:08:19.354
This can result in good genes being lost,

00:08:19.354 --> 00:08:21.925
and bad genes becoming more common.

00:08:21.925 --> 00:08:23.458
Here is the biggest question

00:08:23.458 --> 00:08:26.314
that faces us in medical genetics today.

00:08:26.314 --> 00:08:29.011
We all thought just about 15 years ago

00:08:29.011 --> 00:08:30.774
that the highly heritable diseases

00:08:30.774 --> 00:08:34.333
such as schizophrenia,
autism, bipolar disease,

00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:36.613
and things like diabetes and all the rest,

00:08:36.613 --> 00:08:38.099
that they were highly heritable,

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:40.740
we know there are
variation in these diseases

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.456
is caused by genetic variations,

00:08:42.456 --> 00:08:44.562
so we should be able to find the genes

00:08:44.562 --> 00:08:46.202
and fix these diseases.

00:08:46.202 --> 00:08:47.477
This has been one of the greatest

00:08:47.477 --> 00:08:49.886
disappointments in modern medicine.

00:08:49.886 --> 00:08:51.203
We're making some progress,

00:08:51.203 --> 00:08:53.368
but it was a huge disappointment.

00:08:53.368 --> 00:08:56.670
This is a graph done by
one of my former students

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.691
and his colleagues looking
at genes for schizophrenia.

00:08:59.691 --> 00:09:00.934
I say genes, what I really mean

00:09:00.934 --> 00:09:02.873
for the technically inclined is alleles,

00:09:02.873 --> 00:09:05.599
that is different variations
that influence risk

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:08.134
of something like schizophrenia.

00:09:08.134 --> 00:09:11.683
These are ones that are
relatively uncommon,

00:09:11.683 --> 00:09:12.986
and they have relatively large effects

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:15.120
increasing the risk of schizophrenia

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.213
by as much as five to 10 times,

00:09:17.213 --> 00:09:19.757
but they're very, very rare.

00:09:19.757 --> 00:09:22.536
These are alleles that
are relatively common,

00:09:22.536 --> 00:09:26.393
and their effect on schizophrenia
is really quite tiny.

00:09:26.393 --> 00:09:30.196
They increase the risk by 1% or 2% or 3%.

00:09:30.196 --> 00:09:33.931
Notice that they all
fall on the same line.

00:09:33.931 --> 00:09:37.039
Notice next that there
are no genes over there.

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:38.050
There are no effects.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:41.131
There are no common genes of large effect.

00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:42.790
What happened to them?

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.786
Natural selection eliminated
them is the main hypothesis.

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.786
But more important here,

00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:51.907
all of these genes have the exact same

00:09:51.907 --> 00:09:54.287
proportion of variance explained.

00:09:54.287 --> 00:09:58.736
And that proportion of variance is .04%

00:09:58.736 --> 00:10:02.296
which is an eensy teensy
teensy amount of explanation.

00:10:02.296 --> 00:10:03.804
This has been terribly frustrating.

00:10:03.804 --> 00:10:08.040
A gene that causes less than 5% of 5%

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.135
is not gonna get you very far in terms

00:10:10.135 --> 00:10:11.970
of explaining these diseases.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.284
Sickle cell disease has been the

00:10:13.284 --> 00:10:15.060
exemplar for evolutionary medicine,

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.891
but I'd like to suggest to
you it's a very poor exemplar.

00:10:17.891 --> 00:10:19.744
It's interesting because of the mechanism

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:22.675
that maintains the frequency of the

00:10:22.675 --> 00:10:25.936
alleles that cause sickle cell disease.

00:10:25.936 --> 00:10:27.463
It was first discovered actually in part

00:10:27.463 --> 00:10:29.222
by people, colleague of mine at Michigan

00:10:29.222 --> 00:10:30.962
Jim Neel and his colleagues,

00:10:30.962 --> 00:10:33.013
and they pointed out that
when they went to Africa

00:10:33.013 --> 00:10:36.410
and looked at the distribution of malaria

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.822
and the distribution
of sickle cell disease,

00:10:38.822 --> 00:10:41.113
it was about the same.

00:10:41.113 --> 00:10:42.768
And then they thought about it more deeply

00:10:42.768 --> 00:10:44.586
in a genetic way, and recognized

00:10:44.586 --> 00:10:47.422
something that's called
balancing selection.

00:10:47.422 --> 00:10:50.481
This maintains the
frequency of the alleles

00:10:50.481 --> 00:10:52.033
that cause sickle cell disease.

00:10:52.033 --> 00:10:53.593
You have to have two of them to get the

00:10:53.593 --> 00:10:56.420
sickle cell disease at
a certain frequency.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.183
If you have two regular hemoglobin copies,

00:10:59.183 --> 00:11:01.012
you're vulnerable to malaria,

00:11:01.012 --> 00:11:02.865
but you don't get sickle cell disease.

00:11:02.865 --> 00:11:05.594
If you have two of the sickle
cell kinds of hemoglobin,

00:11:05.594 --> 00:11:08.325
you get severe disease, often dying young

00:11:08.325 --> 00:11:10.514
and usually not being able to reproduce,

00:11:10.514 --> 00:11:12.563
but if you have one of each,

00:11:12.563 --> 00:11:15.617
and you're living in Africa
where malaria is common,

00:11:15.617 --> 00:11:17.692
or around the Mediterranean
where it's common,

00:11:17.692 --> 00:11:19.188
it's not just Africa,

00:11:19.188 --> 00:11:21.105
you get some malaria protection

00:11:21.105 --> 00:11:23.063
and anemia is not too severe.

00:11:23.063 --> 00:11:25.984
These people do better in
terms of having more offspring

00:11:25.984 --> 00:11:27.946
than these or these and this means

00:11:27.946 --> 00:11:30.956
so long as that gene isn't too common,

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:32.577
if it gets too common then a lot of people

00:11:32.577 --> 00:11:34.062
get two copies and it's terrible.

00:11:34.062 --> 00:11:36.289
If it's really rare, no benefit,

00:11:36.289 --> 00:11:38.397
but middle range, fascinating example

00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:41.646
but again, it's not a great example

00:11:41.646 --> 00:11:44.183
because what natural selection does

00:11:44.183 --> 00:11:45.474
when these kind of things happen

00:11:45.474 --> 00:11:47.177
is find some other solution.

00:11:47.177 --> 00:11:50.076
This has only been going
on for 10 to 20,000 years,

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:51.947
and we don't have very many other examples

00:11:51.947 --> 00:11:53.665
of balancing selection.

00:11:53.665 --> 00:11:55.723
I say this because so
many of my colleagues,

00:11:55.723 --> 00:11:58.646
especially in psychiatry are
constantly making up stories

00:11:58.646 --> 00:12:01.761
about possible traits, like
schizophrenia for instance,

00:12:01.761 --> 00:12:04.711
resulting from heterozygote
advantage or balancing selection

00:12:04.711 --> 00:12:06.499
and there's really not
much evidence for that

00:12:06.499 --> 00:12:09.666
except for other kinds
of hemoglobinopathies

00:12:09.666 --> 00:12:11.024
protect against malaria.

00:12:11.024 --> 00:12:13.756
There are a few others, but
it's not a common explanation.

00:12:13.756 --> 00:12:15.297
Shouldn't be the exemplar.

00:12:15.297 --> 00:12:17.817
Something that should be though
is something like dopamine.

00:12:17.817 --> 00:12:19.595
You probably are all aware that dopamine

00:12:19.595 --> 00:12:23.157
in the substantia nigra in
the brain and basal ganglia.

00:12:23.157 --> 00:12:24.993
If you don't have enough of it and your

00:12:24.993 --> 00:12:27.676
neurons are dying off, you
get Parkinson's disease.

00:12:27.676 --> 00:12:28.843
It's common.

00:12:28.843 --> 00:12:31.305
Why are we vulnerable
to Parkinson's disease?

00:12:31.305 --> 00:12:33.145
Well turns out that it's inherent

00:12:33.145 --> 00:12:35.066
to the nature of the dopamine molecule

00:12:35.066 --> 00:12:37.942
when it's metabolized,
the dopamine molecule

00:12:37.942 --> 00:12:41.048
makes hydrogen peroxide,
and other oxygen radicals.

00:12:41.048 --> 00:12:43.236
These things, whenever they
glom onto a piece of tissue

00:12:43.236 --> 00:12:44.999
fry it essentially.

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:48.010
Dopamine is an inherently toxic molecule

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.150
and we're not going to
be able to replace it

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.667
because it's been used to
regulate motivation systems

00:12:52.667 --> 00:12:54.348
for about a billion years now.

00:12:54.348 --> 00:12:56.266
No chance of changing that,

00:12:56.266 --> 00:12:58.094
but it's also inherently dangerous.

00:12:58.094 --> 00:12:59.496
There are built in protection mechanisms

00:12:59.496 --> 00:13:01.730
in those nerves to protect
them against the effects

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.436
of dopamine, and when those
aren't working quite right

00:13:04.436 --> 00:13:08.085
for one reason or another,
people get Parkinson's disease.

00:13:08.085 --> 00:13:10.416
Second explanation, mismatch
with the environment.

00:13:10.416 --> 00:13:12.481
We used to think that common diseases

00:13:12.481 --> 00:13:15.451
were caused by common genes
and we would find them,

00:13:15.451 --> 00:13:17.426
but that turned out not to be the case.

00:13:17.426 --> 00:13:20.969
Hardly any common diseases
are caused by common genes

00:13:20.969 --> 00:13:22.307
or large effects.

00:13:22.307 --> 00:13:24.977
Most disease genes that have large effects

00:13:24.977 --> 00:13:28.228
are what George Williams
and I have called quirks.

00:13:28.228 --> 00:13:29.988
Quirks are not defective.

00:13:29.988 --> 00:13:32.020
They're genes that have bad effects

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.353
only in modern environments.

00:13:35.221 --> 00:13:36.869
And this leads to the paradoxical finding

00:13:36.869 --> 00:13:38.445
that most highly heritable diseases

00:13:38.445 --> 00:13:41.243
are caused by the environment.

00:13:41.243 --> 00:13:42.838
Doesn't that sound odd?

00:13:42.838 --> 00:13:44.726
Quirks, harmless in a natural environment,

00:13:44.726 --> 00:13:46.663
cause disease in a novel environment.

00:13:46.663 --> 00:13:49.180
Ken Weiss, a geneticist
says a widespread dispersion

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.232
of these common risk
alleles, they're benign,

00:13:52.232 --> 00:13:53.939
so if that proves they're benign

00:13:53.939 --> 00:13:55.790
so if they're associated with disease

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.628
this means that they're interacting

00:13:57.628 --> 00:14:00.388
with modern environments to cause disease,

00:14:00.388 --> 00:14:02.580
pointing the finger to the environment.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.584
So next time the New York Times says

00:14:04.584 --> 00:14:07.584
we found a gene for atherosclerosis,

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.741
it's probably a gene
that didn't do much harm

00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:13.134
back in the environments of the sort

00:14:13.134 --> 00:14:14.749
that Mike Gerwin has been studying.

00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:15.876
It's a gene that interacts with

00:14:15.876 --> 00:14:18.881
big macs to cause heart attacks.

00:14:18.881 --> 00:14:20.057
Nearsightedness.

00:14:20.057 --> 00:14:21.993
Whether you're nearsighted or not,

00:14:21.993 --> 00:14:24.325
depends almost entirely on your genes,

00:14:24.325 --> 00:14:26.443
so why didn't natural
selection get rid of them?

00:14:26.443 --> 00:14:29.100
Answer, hardly anyone is nearsighted

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.035
in ancestral environments.

00:14:31.035 --> 00:14:32.871
Something about modern environments boosts

00:14:32.871 --> 00:14:34.245
their rate so that everybody who

00:14:34.245 --> 00:14:36.352
has those genes gets nearsighted.

00:14:36.352 --> 00:14:40.929
Three candidates for that,
one is doing close work.

00:14:40.929 --> 00:14:42.454
Two is high doses of sugar.

00:14:42.454 --> 00:14:45.153
Three, low levels of light
because of living indoors.

00:14:45.153 --> 00:14:47.712
Yet to discover exactly what this is,

00:14:47.712 --> 00:14:49.405
we could eventually cure or prevent

00:14:49.405 --> 00:14:52.493
nearsightedness if we
could find the answer.

00:14:52.493 --> 00:14:55.336
Scurvy, our ancestors didn't have

00:14:55.336 --> 00:14:57.719
scurvy because they made their own.

00:14:57.719 --> 00:15:00.556
Ancestors back a few million years.

00:15:00.556 --> 00:15:02.737
They made their own vitamin C, but we lost

00:15:02.737 --> 00:15:05.056
the ability to make vitamin C,

00:15:05.056 --> 00:15:07.236
and we lost it right about here.

00:15:07.236 --> 00:15:09.417
Owl monkeys, marmosets, and humans

00:15:09.417 --> 00:15:10.838
and gorillas, we can't make it.

00:15:10.838 --> 00:15:13.010
Lemurs and others can.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.701
Why did that ability get lost?

00:15:15.701 --> 00:15:17.710
One hypothesis has been that
it's just because we had

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.098
so much fruit in our
diet it didn't matter,

00:15:20.098 --> 00:15:21.976
and that's a perfectly plausible one,

00:15:21.976 --> 00:15:24.339
but other people have
suggested that changes

00:15:24.339 --> 00:15:26.599
in this particular enzyme increase

00:15:26.599 --> 00:15:28.759
our ability to store fats.

00:15:28.759 --> 00:15:31.150
Very interesting to try
to answer that question.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.994
Third reason is infection.

00:15:32.994 --> 00:15:35.376
Pathogens evolve faster than we do.

00:15:35.376 --> 00:15:37.319
It's too bad and it's amazing that

00:15:37.319 --> 00:15:39.973
we can ever, ever outrun them.

00:15:39.973 --> 00:15:41.739
Therefore it's very strong selection

00:15:41.739 --> 00:15:43.481
to survive whatever kinds of pathogens

00:15:43.481 --> 00:15:45.588
and infections are around, but whenever

00:15:45.588 --> 00:15:48.825
you see a mutation that
gets selected so strongly

00:15:48.825 --> 00:15:50.759
to prevent infection, you should look

00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:52.062
very carefully to see if there might

00:15:52.062 --> 00:15:54.556
be bad side effects to that gene.

00:15:54.556 --> 00:15:56.636
Turns out that there's lots
of evidence about this.

00:15:56.636 --> 00:15:59.354
A nice recent paper goes
through many of them.

00:15:59.354 --> 00:16:03.158
Shows pretty convincingly
that each epidemic shapes

00:16:03.158 --> 00:16:06.107
quite dramatic changes
in allele frequencies.

00:16:06.107 --> 00:16:09.186
Furthermore it points out that CCR5,

00:16:09.186 --> 00:16:13.016
you get HIV protection if you
have this particular mutation,

00:16:13.016 --> 00:16:15.237
but you're more vulnerable to West Nile.

00:16:15.237 --> 00:16:16.995
If you have an O blood
type you get protection

00:16:16.995 --> 00:16:20.135
against malaria, but you're
more vulnerable to cholera.

00:16:20.135 --> 00:16:22.777
We need to not think about
good genes and bad genes.

00:16:22.777 --> 00:16:24.471
We need to be thinking about variations

00:16:24.471 --> 00:16:26.861
that have costs and benefits.

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:28.756
Trade-offs, nothing in
the body is perfect.

00:16:28.756 --> 00:16:30.005
Everything is a trade-off.

00:16:30.005 --> 00:16:32.098
My favorite example is bilirubin.

00:16:32.098 --> 00:16:33.575
Why make bilirubin?

00:16:33.575 --> 00:16:35.278
It's toxic, it turns you yellow.

00:16:35.278 --> 00:16:38.006
Turns out it's wonderful
at stopping reactive oxygen

00:16:38.006 --> 00:16:40.676
species from burning up your tissues.

00:16:40.676 --> 00:16:43.516
And people who have a disease
causing high bilirubin levels

00:16:43.516 --> 00:16:45.774
have heart attacks at
half the rate of others.

00:16:45.774 --> 00:16:47.828
Very important for practical terms

00:16:47.828 --> 00:16:49.656
in a neonatal nursery, where kids

00:16:49.656 --> 00:16:50.832
are routinely put under lights

00:16:50.832 --> 00:16:53.678
for even mild increases
in bilirubin even though

00:16:53.678 --> 00:16:56.166
that bilirubin decreases
the number of reactions

00:16:56.166 --> 00:16:59.070
to oxygen species in their bodies.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.096
Genes for aging, George
Williams pointed out

00:17:01.096 --> 00:17:02.934
a new explanation that is they might

00:17:02.934 --> 00:17:06.240
have benefits in childhood
when selection is strong

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.144
and costs only later in life,

00:17:08.144 --> 00:17:11.327
the so-called antagonistic
pleiotropy theory.

00:17:11.327 --> 00:17:13.463
If in fact we could eliminate aging,

00:17:13.463 --> 00:17:16.337
and the mortality rate stayed
the same throughout life

00:17:16.337 --> 00:17:18.659
as it is age 20, most of us would live

00:17:18.659 --> 00:17:21.428
to about age 800 to 1,000.

00:17:21.428 --> 00:17:25.201
Amyloid beta is the bad guy
for causing Alzheimer's disease

00:17:25.201 --> 00:17:27.253
but it's demonstrated
recently that in fact

00:17:27.253 --> 00:17:29.406
it's a potent anti-microbial.

00:17:29.406 --> 00:17:31.377
Every single one of these
genes seems like it's

00:17:31.377 --> 00:17:34.180
just a bad actor, but
it's there for a reason.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.275
Not all are.

00:17:35.275 --> 00:17:36.897
We shouldn't assume it, but we should

00:17:36.897 --> 00:17:38.839
consider the possibilities.

00:17:38.839 --> 00:17:41.400
And then our gene work,
he's shown that all humans

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.958
are missing a gene that our
primate ancestors all had.

00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:48.291
That is one for Neu5Gc, and it turns out

00:17:49.792 --> 00:17:51.331
that two or three million
years ago we lost it,

00:17:51.331 --> 00:17:53.660
but we keep eating other foods

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.653
that have that in it, and it may well be

00:17:55.653 --> 00:17:59.081
that causing it, that that
causes inflammatory reactions

00:17:59.081 --> 00:18:01.969
which might be responsible
for the high burden

00:18:01.969 --> 00:18:05.483
of inflammatory disease in humans.

00:18:05.483 --> 00:18:07.024
It might be that the reason that happened

00:18:07.024 --> 00:18:10.601
was to help us avoid the kind of malaria

00:18:10.601 --> 00:18:14.221
that influences chimpanzees
because that molecule

00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:18.203
is what the malaria
molecule, pathogen uses

00:18:18.203 --> 00:18:19.796
to get into blood cells.

00:18:19.796 --> 00:18:22.398
Reproduction can increase,

00:18:22.398 --> 00:18:24.987
change can increase
reproduction and harm health.

00:18:24.987 --> 00:18:28.805
Apo E4 increases
progesterone and reproduction

00:18:28.805 --> 00:18:32.042
even though it causes heart
attacks and Alzheimer's disease.

00:18:32.042 --> 00:18:34.519
Even BRCA gene, causing breast cancer,

00:18:34.519 --> 00:18:38.042
has been said to increase
number of offspring.

00:18:38.042 --> 00:18:40.186
And finally defenses, such as pain, fever,

00:18:40.186 --> 00:18:43.016
and all the rest are
useful but at a high cost.

00:18:43.016 --> 00:18:46.116
Wrapping up, why do disease genes persist?

00:18:46.116 --> 00:18:47.871
The same six categories that proved

00:18:47.871 --> 00:18:50.499
so useful in trying to
understand why certain traits

00:18:50.499 --> 00:18:53.799
are vulnerable to causing disease

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:56.513
helps us understand genetic variations

00:18:56.513 --> 00:18:58.483
and genetic uniformities

00:18:58.483 --> 00:19:01.122
in ways that make us
vulnerable to disease.

00:19:01.122 --> 00:19:02.615
Constraints leave us with mutations

00:19:02.615 --> 00:19:05.014
and heterozygote
advantage vulnerabilities.

00:19:05.014 --> 00:19:08.102
Mismatch results in
quirks that were harmless,

00:19:08.102 --> 00:19:09.510
now causing disease.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.006
Trade-offs come with benefits, but costs.

00:19:12.006 --> 00:19:14.114
Pathogens create arm races.

00:19:14.114 --> 00:19:17.156
Reproduction sometimes
shapes changes in genes

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:19.455
that increase reproduction
at a cost to health.

00:19:19.455 --> 00:19:21.742
And defenses are dangerous and costly.

00:19:21.742 --> 00:19:23.629
Again going back to four
different kinds of genes,

00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:25.821
variations among individuals, variations

00:19:25.821 --> 00:19:29.442
among human subgroups, recent
changes that we all have

00:19:29.442 --> 00:19:32.767
such as losing the ability
to synthesize vitamin C,

00:19:32.767 --> 00:19:34.601
and then other things
like dopamine that we all

00:19:34.601 --> 00:19:36.540
have had for a very long time.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.373
We need to be thinking
about all these different

00:19:38.373 --> 00:19:41.182
kinds of genes and their ways in which

00:19:41.182 --> 00:19:43.700
they make us vulnerable to disease.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.151
This exercise of writing this lecture

00:19:45.151 --> 00:19:46.611
was fun for me because it came out

00:19:46.611 --> 00:19:49.312
with surprising conclusions
I hadn't anticipated.

00:19:49.312 --> 00:19:51.246
First, there's a very high proportion

00:19:51.246 --> 00:19:53.880
of disease vulnerability genes

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.864
that are shaped by benefits of
protecting against infection,

00:19:57.864 --> 00:20:00.087
and two they persist because of selection

00:20:00.087 --> 00:20:02.104
for infection increasing reproduction

00:20:02.104 --> 00:20:04.606
and extending lifespan.

00:20:04.606 --> 00:20:06.227
Those of you who are
interested, we now do have

00:20:06.227 --> 00:20:08.745
a scientific society of
evolutionary medicine.

00:20:08.745 --> 00:20:10.261
It's called the International Society

00:20:10.261 --> 00:20:11.947
for Evolution Medicine and Public Health.

00:20:11.947 --> 00:20:15.560
We have a meeting in Europe
that you'd be welcome to go.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.593
EvMedEd is a resource, and EvMedReview.com

00:20:18.593 --> 00:20:20.320
offers news for the field,

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.898
including right now a meeting that's open

00:20:21.898 --> 00:20:24.923
for anyone who wants to
attend November 10 in Berlin.

00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:27.567
And information about jobs at ASU.

00:20:27.567 --> 00:20:28.685
Thanks very much.

00:20:28.685 --> 00:20:31.435
(pleasant music)
