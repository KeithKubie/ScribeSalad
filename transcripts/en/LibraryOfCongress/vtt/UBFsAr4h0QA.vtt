00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.940
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Nylrady:
Good afternoon.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.240
My name is Kenneth Nylrady.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.540
I'm a reference specialist in
the Library's European Division,

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.390
and on behalf of the European
Division and our Chief,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.550
Grant Harris, I'd
like to welcome you

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.940
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.860
The European Division is one
of four area studies divisions

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.380
in the Library, and
is responsible

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.380
for recommending materials
and reference for most

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.850
of the countries of Europe,
except Great Britain,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.970
and Ireland, Spain, and
Portugal, and European part

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.030
of Turkey, which is
covered by other divisions.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.890
Highlighted today is
the Russian collection,

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.140
which numbers some
1.6 million items,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.400
whether in Russian
or about Russia.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.580
Our speaker today has
made very good use

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.760
of our rich Russian collections.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.340
Judge Stephen Williams practiced
law in New York City at the firm

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.920
of Debevoise Plimpton, and as
an assistant U.S. attorney.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.580
And then taught law
at the University

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.210
of Colorado Law School from 1969
to 1986, with visiting years

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.530
at UCLA, Southern Methodist
University, and the University

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.840
of Chicago, where he was also
a fellow in law and economics.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.090
He was appointed to the
U.S. Court of Appeals

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.750
for D.C. Circuit in 1986.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.730
Besides his current book,
he is also the author

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.920
of "Liberal Reform in an
Illiberal Regime: The Creation

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.370
of Private Property in
Russia, 1906-1915," published

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.530
by Hoover Institution
Press in 2006.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.390
Today, he will be speaking
about his current book,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.870
a biography of Vasily
Maklakov, "The Reformer:

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.480
How One Liberal Fought to
Preempt The Russian Revolution,"

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.490
published by Encounter
Books in 2017,

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.620
available at fine book
stores everywhere.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.500
I am pleased and honored to
introduce to you Judge Williams.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.060
[ Applause ]

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.740
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams: Well,
first, I want to thank both Ken

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.420
and the Library of Congress.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.360
I think it's true as to
both of them, without --

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.760
I couldn't have written
the book, possibly.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.420
The Library of Congress
has a fine collection

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.860
of the Duma Records, which
were the principal things

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.610
that I used here, but the Duma
Records are obscurely arranged

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.850
in the sense that the spines
do not clearly indicate what is

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.190
inside the spines.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.380
So very often, I would find
myself groping for what it was

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.680
that I wanted, and Ken very
often came to the rescue

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.840
and managed to fish out from
the shelves what I needed.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.720
So I'm extremely grateful
personally to him,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.010
and also to the Library
of Congress.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.830
And also to Peter Roudik,
who I can see there,

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.990
although since the klieg
light is in my eyes,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.550
I can't see him very well.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.330
But -- excuse me?

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.690
&gt;&gt; It's not loud enough.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:21.990
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams:
It's not loud enough?

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.290
I was concerned with that.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.590
Now?

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.290
&gt;&gt; The silver one
is the speaker.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.500
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams: The
silver one is the speaker?

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.800
What's this here for?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.100
&gt;&gt; This is for the --

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.400
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams: Okay.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.700
This one has a green light.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.000
Okay, but this one counts?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.300
&gt;&gt; That one counts.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.600
&gt;&gt; Can we turn this up some?

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.210
&gt;&gt; Just wait and see --

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.510
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams:
Can you hear?

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.750
&gt;&gt; Say something again.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.180
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams:
Say something again.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.470
&gt;&gt; Let me turn this one.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.770
Go ahead. Can we test it?

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.350
Can you test it?

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.650
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams: Yes.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.950
Yes. Can you hear?

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.250
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's better.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.550
&gt;&gt; That's --

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.850
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams:
That's good?

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.150
Okay. Okay.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.450
So, at any rate, I am
very grateful to them

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.320
and both the institution
at the Library of Congress

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.310
for making my research,

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.570
and obviously many other
people's research, possible.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.990
Today, I want to
do three things.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.030
One is to talk of Maklakov
himself personally,

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.450
so you develop, I hope,
some appreciation for him --

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.620
which, working on it
for 10 years, I did.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.230
I came to feel he was a friend.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.930
And the second thing is
to look at the problems

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.620
that anyone trying to promote
the rule of law in Russia

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.570
in the critical period, 1905
to 1907 -- critical for me,

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.400
critical for Maklakov, because
that was when he was most active

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.210
in it -- to promote the rule of
law, the obstacles they faced.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.610
And finally, I want
to close with a note

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.980
on just a particular snippet
of a debate that he had

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.850
where his primary adversary
was Alexander Kerensky,

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.050
because I think it shows
a kind of elegant way

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.400
in which a speaker

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:20.180
in an adversarial relationship
can deal with a demagogic bully,

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.630
if I may use that term.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.410
So first, Maklakov --

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.340
it is harder to see
here than I thought.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.020
I may hold my notes to
get them closer to me.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:38.200
He's born in 1869, and
his father combined sort

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.520
of three capacities in his work.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.920
He was a scientist,
an ophthalmologist

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.960
who published research
in ophthalmology.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.290
He was also a clinical
physician, and in addition,

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.190
he was a manager,
somewhat indirectly.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.550
Because he worked at the Moscow
Eye Clinic, which still exists,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.000
and is still an eye clinic.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.010
It's a handsome building
in Moscow.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.220
And there were, in what appears

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.090
to have been a quite
typical czarist arrangement,

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.140
three layers of management above
him, but the actual holders

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.380
of those positions did
not do any management.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.000
They were there because
they were aristocrats,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.310
and they needed to
be taken care of.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.830
So they were given
positions in the hierarchy

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.880
of the institution, leaving
the actual work of management

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.880
to people below that level,

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:42.220
including Alexei
Maklakov, my man's father.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.520
His mother -- his mother
was very well-educated,

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.690
spoke four languages, and
she was very religious.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.500
And I emphasize the
religion because --

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.150
first place, Maklakov writing
about her emphasizes it,

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.940
and the second place, it's
reasonably clear that in Russia

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.740
of that era, if you're a
highly-educated intellectual

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:13.230
person, religiosity is not the
first thing that comes to mind.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:18.810
So that -- the Maklakov
household brought together two

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.020
different intellectual
strains in what appears

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.200
to have been harmony and love.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.360
And I think helped set
the threshold for Maklakov

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.300
as someone who can deal
with people who disagree

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:38.790
on very fundamental issues in
as harmonious a way as people

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.350
who disagree on fundamental
issues can.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:49.910
Incidentally, his mother died
shortly before he became 12.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.050
In due course, his
father remarried.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:58.170
His stepmother is not the
-- as you would expect,

00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:59.780
there's not quite
the devotion to her

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.670
as there was to his mother.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:06.720
But I think she -- Maklakov's
father was already very

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.600
well-connected, both
intellectually and politically,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.530
and I think the -- his --

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:17.690
the stepmother, Alexei
Maklakov's second wife,

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.370
brought him in touch
with more and more

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.100
of the intellectual elite.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:31.310
So these were around all the
time of Maklakov's later youth.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:38.630
His time at the university
-- first, at the university,

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.620
his reputation for
eloquence was established.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.250
There had been a --
there was famine in 1891,

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:50.140
and there was a practice
in the university

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.820
of a student orchestra having
a concert, the proceeds

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.890
of which were normally given
to help impoverished students

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.960
at the university get along.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.960
But at the time of this
famine, the idea came forward

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.530
that it would be good to
devote the proceeds that year

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:13.700
to famine relief, but
not everyone agreed.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.460
There was a large meeting in
a large hall, with students.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.740
There was students
gathered on one side

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.500
of the room advocating
the traditional treatment

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.070
of the proceeds -- on the
other side of the room,

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.280
advocating famine relief.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.550
They sort of proceeded alternate
sides, and then Maklakov spoke

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:37.180
on the side of famine
relief, at which point,

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:44.040
the line for using it for the
traditional purpose faded away,

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.110
and the decision was
made to give it to --

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.830
to devote it to famine relief.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:59.580
He was at risk in the university
of becoming a perpetual student.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.870
He had three majors, a
couple of years at natural --

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.520
in natural sciences,
then a long period --

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.850
I think four, maybe even five
years in history, and finally,

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:15.640
he turned to law, and he got his
law degree in less than a year.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.050
Why did he leave history?

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.000
I think natural science
wasn't really that good a fit,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.230
but why did he leave history,

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.940
in which he was doing
extremely well?

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.830
Well, he had a tendency to
get into scrapes, and --

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.570
actually, this had happened
when he was at the gymnasium,

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.890
but they were less
consequential.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.220
It was more consequential
at the university level.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.120
What were these scrapes?

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.930
They were their involvement in
demonstrations, none of which,

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.260
as far as I can make out,
involved any violence.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.400
But it was also true
that Maklakov's approach,

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.360
at least sometimes in
these demonstrations,

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.890
was distinctly in-your-face.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.870
So there's a period --
a point in one of them

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.710
at which some authority figure
is trying to get the students

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.580
to clear out of a
space, and Maklakov says,

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.560
"We won't disperse until
you clear out the police."

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.690
That did not go over well.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.900
The person representing
authority said, "Grab him,"

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.260
and he was grabbed, and --

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.050
so that brought that
episode to an end.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.210
Partly as a result of
this and similar episodes,

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:33.550
a guy named Bogolubov, who
was a high-ranking character

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.930
in the university, later
actually became Minister

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:41.700
of Education, was heard
to say, "So long as I'm

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.060
at this university, Maklakov
will not become a professor."

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.350
So that was naturally
daunting to Maklakov,

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.050
in terms of thinking
of his career,

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.290
even though he was
very strongly supported

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:57.360
by the most distinguished
history professor,

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.420
Paul Vinogradoff, who
later went to Oxford.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.790
And in fact, Vinogradoff
tried to talk him

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:07.920
out of being disswayed [sic]
by this remark of Bogolubov.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.180
But Maklakov, wisely, I think,
and probably for other reasons,

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.760
switched out of history
into law.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.820
Besides this remark
of Bogolubov,

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.750
which obviously put a chill
on his history career,

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.970
he received for these activities
something called a wolf's

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.750
passport, which was
not actually a passport

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.620
to anything except
possibly oblivion.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.630
It meant, essentially, you
were barred from the university

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.060
until this passport
should be revoked,

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.030
and there was no
particular procedure

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.450
for getting it revoked.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:48.750
So it was the end of an
intellectual career, really,

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.890
or at least potentially, it was.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.190
Now, I'd mentioned

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.090
that Maklakov's father was very
well connected, and he was.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:59.250
And he managed to get this
reversed, but it did mean

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.600
that there was a period
when Maklakov was at risk

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.520
of essentially having his
career blighted for what,

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.420
in the long run of things,
seems no good reason at all.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:19.460
At this point, I want to
introduce my Maklakov's brother.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.420
My Maklakov is Vasily.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:26.150
The brother who's interesting
and important is Nikolai.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.890
They have the same
family background,

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.320
and Nikolai turns
out, in many respects,

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.860
to be the virtual opposite.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:39.930
At this period when my
Maklakov is, at every stage,

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.020
resisting government
arbitrariness,

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:48.320
his brother Nikolai is staging
government arbitrariness.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.700
And the most sort of
intense development

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.540
of this is the Beilis trial.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:00.590
The Beilis trial, sometimes
called Russia's Dreyfus trial,

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:05.560
involved a Jew who had
the unfortunate fact

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.610
of being Jewish, and being
located in the vague,

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:14.070
general vicinity of a
place where the corpse

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:18.770
of a child who'd been
brutally murdered was found.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.590
And the other thing that
was hard luck for Beilis was

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.090
that some anti-Semites in
the area had the bright idea

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.310
that this was an occasion --

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:32.930
this should be used to have
a trial for blood libel,

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:37.230
an accusation that Beilis --
first that Beilis had done this,

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:41.900
and that it was all part of a
Jewish project to produce blood

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.670
for somewhat mysterious
Jewish rituals.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.260
So this trial proceeded,
stage-managed

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:54.640
by Nikolai Maklakov,
with Vasily Maklakov --

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.550
I think it's fair to say
the lead defense attorney.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:02.620
I do want to quote the remark
of a juror who was questioned

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.270
by a reporter after the case.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.260
"Karabchevsky, we
didn't understand.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.980
Gruzenberg, we didn't trust.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.200
Maklakov hit the
nail on the head."

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.900
So it sounds as if his
argument was quite pivotal

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.970
in the acquittal of Beilis.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:28.970
So Nikolai, meanwhile, was not
only generally stage-managing

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.080
this, but doing extremely
fishy things,

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.770
of which the clearest example
is eavesdropping on the jury.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.030
Although, as someone pointed
out, it must've been sort

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:43.010
of depressing, because people
on the jury kept remarking,

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.400
"There doesn't seem to be
any relevant evidence,"

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.700
which was true.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.140
There wasn't.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:52.160
So the question is, why are
these two brothers brought

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.460
up in the same household
so different?

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:58.190
And my theory, entirely
speculative,

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:06.690
is that Vasily Maklakov was
often and seriously the target

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.640
of regime arbitrariness,
and he responded to that,

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.440
as almost anyone might, with
a deep hostility to that sort

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.450
of thing, and a determination
to fight it.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.170
Of course, he fought it
on behalf of other people.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:24.930
While so far, it appears
Nikolai had no such experience.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:29.450
So, if you have a rebellious
child, take consolation.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:33.410
You may be breeding a great
champion of the rule of law.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:38.410
The -- a word about his friends.

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:41.500
I want to leave time for
other important things.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.340
The most important one
there, really, is Tolstoy.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.500
He first saw Tolstoy quite
by accident, when he was sent

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.290
because of an epidemic
-- not an epidemic.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:53.690
That overstates it.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:58.170
A rash of diphtheria into
the house of friends,

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:00.380
and incidentally,
the father/husband

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:05.480
in this house was the model for
Stiva Oblonsky in Anna Karenina.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.780
Anyway, so he's sent
as a child there.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.450
He sees this old man
with a long, white beard

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:17.280
and wearing a smock, and he asks
the mother/wife figure there,

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.460
"What is this?"

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:24.490
And she says, "Well, that's
the great writer Leo Tolstoy.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:28.860
It's all right for
a writer to go --

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.010
a great writer like him to
go around dressed like that.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.840
But for ordinary people,
it's not suitable."

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:40.120
So that -- he learned
that lesson.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:45.380
He participated with Tolstoy
in actually delivering relief

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:49.440
in the famine of
1891, and after that,

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.810
Tolstoy developed the practice
of calling upon Maklakov to go

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:58.540
for walks with him in
the city of Moscow.

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:04.590
And Maklakov was sufficiently
self-conscious about this

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.710
to ask himself, "Why does
great writer ask a callow youth

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.340
like me to do this?"

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.370
And his answer was based on
something that Tolstoy had said

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:21.790
about the way he moved around
at his estate, Yasnaya Polyana.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.090
He didn't go by horse,

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:27.500
or at least typically
didn't go by horse or foot.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:31.720
He went by bicycle, and he went
by bicycle, Tolstoy explained,

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.910
because bicycling through
the ruts and avoiding stones

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:40.150
and so forth kept his mind
occupied and prevented him

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:41.900
from serious thinking.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.490
Serious thinking,
he wanted to avoid,

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:49.780
because it would be tiring, tire
his sort of key brain cells.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:54.550
So the urban equivalent of that
was to have Maklakov along,

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:58.610
diverting him, but not
challenging his thinking

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.360
in any serious way.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.730
Tolstoy also made
referrals to Maklakov

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:09.140
of cases involving
religious eccentrics, who,

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.390
as you can understand, quite
naturally went to Tolstoy.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.950
And these gave Maklakov
experience --

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:20.620
first place, seeing a side of
life that he had no exposure to.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:25.250
He's a -- almost an -- I mean,
I think it's fair to say,

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:30.080
a different world from
sophisticated, urban Moscow,

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.840
and also gave him
experience trying cases

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.830
to juries in that environment.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:40.580
And he came away not only, it
appears, with a great ability

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.380
to handle juries, but a
great respect for them.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.250
And I think that
played out in his view

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:50.380
of politics more generally.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:56.460
Did this relationship have any
effect on Maklakov's character?

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.960
It seems to me, one can argue
both ways, but I would suggest

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:06.790
that his finding, that you could
have a deep relationship --

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:10.150
and I think, on Maklakov's
side, clearly one effectively

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:16.310
of love -- for someone who
disagreed fundamentally

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:20.460
on issues of political
economy, for example --

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.400
you could do that, and
there was no problem at all.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.800
And that that partly accounts

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:31.130
for Maklakov being the very
gregarious person that he was,

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:35.000
and during the times
of political conflict,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.700
talking to people on every
side, a very healthy thing.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.750
Another friend is
Alexandra Kollontai,

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.590
who at the relevant
period, is sort of migrating

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.240
from Menshevism to Bolshevism.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:55.810
Not exactly Maklakov's ideology,
not that at all, but a --

00:20:55.810 --> 00:21:00.960
not merely a close
friend, a lover,

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:05.410
and someone with whom
he got along very well.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.320
And even -- I mean, her letters

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.950
to him show her identifying
speeches that he made

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:15.030
with which she finds very
impressive, and so forth.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:19.090
But they were both
mavericks in their parties.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:23.900
He did not really belong in
the Constitutional Democrats,

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.680
for reasons I may or may
not have time to go into,

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.040
but he definitely
didn't belong there.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.240
She didn't really belong
with the Bolsheviks.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:35.110
At one point, she told an
Italian communist, "If you hear

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.310
that I've been arrested
for stealing the silverware

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:41.230
in The Kremlin, just chalk it
up to my disagreeing with Lenin

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:44.910
on some issue of rural
policy," which --

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.900
so she was very realistic
about her party.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:56.480
Let me turn now to the -- in a
way, I'm going to try to turn

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.640
around the approach
I took in the book.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.980
The approach I took in the book
was recounting Maklakov's work

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.650
in various projects and --

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:12.480
throughout the period
1905 to 1917, what he did,

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.910
how he did it, and so forth.

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:18.520
Now I'm going to turn that
around and view it as a roadmap

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:24.830
for the challenges confronting
anyone interested in creating

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:28.770
or enhancing the rule
of law in this period.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:32.700
So at this point, the -- it's
a more analytical approach

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.700
than a sort of historical
approach.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:42.660
How do these things fit into the
development of the rule of law?

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:49.320
First, I want to say that I
think if there was ever a time

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.470
when the rule of
law had a chance --

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.050
had a chance for
making progress,

00:22:56.050 --> 00:23:00.500
this period 1905 to 1917 is it.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.330
The first part of that
period, you have four Dumas.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:08.250
They're the only period when
you have a legislative body

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.110
in Russia.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:14.430
To be sure, the first two
Dumas were very radical.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.830
The last two Dumas
were very conservative.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:26.560
So that was not necessarily
a program for reform.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.340
Neither of them was
a program reform,

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:33.460
because the radicals took on the
administration very vehemently,

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:39.310
provoking the administration --
the regime to be more hostile.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:44.230
But at least it was a period
when there was an institution

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.890
for discussion of
Russia's legal problems.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:51.080
So it was an opportunity
of that sort,

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:56.620
and a somewhat representative
legal institution, the Duma.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.680
And in this period,

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.640
the bureaucracy was
distinctly divided.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.620
There were reformist
elements in it,

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.470
and highly reactionary
elements in it.

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:10.110
The Czar, I think it's fair
to say, was reactionary,

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.230
but it was also very wobbly,

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:18.170
a virtue in an extremely
reactionary person, so that --

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:22.220
you know, looking at the
broad scene, you might say,

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.240
"They could've done
something useful."

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.860
But they didn't.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:32.270
And then there's the period
of the provisional government,

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:35.000
where the liberals, in
principle, take charge.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.390
They are in charge of the
provisional government.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:40.610
They have all kinds of
obstacles, to be sure,

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:45.590
but if the rule of law
is to be supported,

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:50.500
that seems like a good
opportunity for it.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:55.840
So the -- what I'm going to
do is to divide obstacles

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.850
to the rule of law into
two types, and I'll try

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:02.190
to match them up in all cases --

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:06.210
formal institutional
defects, and informal lacks.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:09.130
The formal institutional
defects are, for example,

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:13.060
impediments to judicial
independence.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:17.130
The informal ones are
the social attitudes

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.380
that underlie everything.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:23.710
They underlie both the
capacity to adopt reforms,

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.880
and the ability, once a
reform has been adopted,

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:32.920
for it to take root and generate
the real sort of protection

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.240
that we'd like to see
from the rule of law.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.970
And so I should say that the --

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:41.980
of course, the purpose
of the rule of law,

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.380
the primary purpose, is
to protect the people

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.120
from state arbitrariness.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.240
At least, I think that's
the definition I will use,

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.940
so we'll have to accept
it for this afternoon.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:57.150
So I'm going to try to
go quickly through these.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:01.170
Yeah. But as I say,
in each case,

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:05.300
I'll match the institutional
problem with a sort

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.480
of social attitude problem.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.810
First, let's take
judicial independence.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.860
Nominally, that had
been established in 1864

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.920
with the protection of judges
against being kicked out,

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:23.350
or demoted, or transferred,
but the person who was Minister

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:27.650
of Justice during most of
this period testified later

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:32.030
that he had the ability to
bend judges to his will.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:35.350
His word, "bend," and I
think it's fair to say

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.630
that he was not understating
his powers.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.840
And presumably, judges
got the message.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.320
I've never been able to figure

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.870
out exactly what his techniques
were, just as, I have to say,

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:51.020
dealing with current Russian
judges, who I think it's fair

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.580
to say exemplify
the same problem --

00:26:53.580 --> 00:27:00.070
how it is that they tend to
succumb to regime pressure.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:04.600
But there is regime pressure,
and it is successfully exerted.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.820
And what about the
relevant social attitudes?

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:11.680
In the elite, let's take
Tolstoy, perhaps the most --

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.480
indeed, the most extremely
example, but still --

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.370
but not that far
off from his fellow,

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:19.830
highly intellectual, colleagues.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.330
He took seriously the Biblical
injunction, "Judge not,

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.310
that ye be not judged,"
and taking that view,

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.530
and also the view that
all state exercise

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:34.230
of power was illegitimate,
and equally illegitimate,

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.860
he wasn't interested in
nuances of the difference

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:41.370
between an independent court
and a submissive court.

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.200
So he was no friend at all.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.800
And the -- no friend
at all on this issue.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:50.390
He was a good friend
as a person.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:57.160
And the others of the literary
elite, although perhaps not

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.250
as extreme as Tolstoy,
shared this sort

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:03.230
of at least indifference
to the kind of protections

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.960
that Maklakov and
anyone interested

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.380
in the rule of law would be.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.450
What about the peasants?

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:16.670
They had a number of aphorisms
stating their view of law.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:20.370
One of which, for example, is,
"If all the laws were removed,

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.450
people would live justly."

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:27.120
Well, that doesn't seem like
a good foundation on which

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.220
to build a rule of law state.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:37.000
So, again -- I mean, this is
sort of a very strong case,

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.050
I think, of an institutional
defect --

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.180
a formal institutional defect

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:46.780
and a strong social attitude
defect for anyone trying

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:50.650
to build the rule of law.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:53.410
Second, remedies for
official lawlessness.

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:55.700
It's really quite
a similar story.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.320
There were all kinds
of gaps in the system.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.760
It's -- I can't find
specific attitudinal --

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.850
or, evidence of specific
attitudinal differences,

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:09.440
but I think it's part of the
passivity that people notice

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.550
in Russians of that
era, perhaps other eras.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:16.140
I think can be chalked up to --
because it relates to the fact

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.340
that there aren't remedies.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:21.210
There's nothing you can do.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.960
Third, centralization
of state authority.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:31.300
I won't go into it, but the --
again, we turn to Alexander II,

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.520
and we have a creation
of institutions

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:38.530
of local self-government, which
are valuable and important.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:41.320
But they're -- above
all, they're subject

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.900
to discretionary review by the
Ministry of Internal Affairs.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:51.390
And so the people in those
institutions are accustomed not

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:55.420
to making local legislative
decisions within a framework

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.480
of law, but making local
legislative decisions

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.780
within a framework

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.340
of discretionary
review from on high.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.270
That seems to me
quite different,

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:11.200
as kind of training
for the rule of law.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.940
Now, property rights.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:16.050
One could go on and on about
property rights, and of course,

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:18.530
perhaps I did in my first book.

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:23.890
But on -- if we're talking
about land and other property,

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:30.080
apart from the peasant -- what
the peasants had, I think it --

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.970
you know, it was recognized.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:36.700
So that subject to what I said
about the lack of independence

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:41.690
of judges, and about
the gaps in remedies

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:45.520
against lawless official action,

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.060
there was protection
for property.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:52.020
When you get to the peasant
level, I'll simplify quickly

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.580
to say that, until
the Stolypin reforms,

00:30:55.580 --> 00:31:00.990
you have essentially
limits on your --

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:04.990
a family's lot size was subject

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:07.270
to reduction depending
upon the --

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:11.450
or perhaps it'll be increased
depending upon essentially the

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:16.180
number of workers in each
family on the commune.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:20.290
And the ability to cultivate
the land was circumscribed

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.570
by the need for coordinating
with all the other people,

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:25.760
because of the tiny lot size.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.510
And the Stolypin reforms, though
I think they're important,

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:35.480
barely scratched
the surface in that.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:39.420
Attitudes, the attitude
aspect of property.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:44.690
Contrast the west, where private
property's generally recognized

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:49.500
as a bulwark against
the centralized state.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:54.940
There was no such
parallel in Russia.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.580
Property, instead of
representing independence,

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:03.100
because it gives the holder
a sufficiency, as it were --

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:08.830
property there represented an
extreme form of dependence,

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:14.810
because the richest -- all
of the regular landowners

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:21.130
who had serfs, at least until
1861, were highly dependent

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:25.480
on the Czar for keeping
the serfs in their place.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:29.820
So it symbolized
dependence, not independence,

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:34.220
and it symbolized dependence of
a particularly oppressive kind,

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:38.090
dependence enabling the
dependent people the better

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:40.660
to oppress their serfs.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:45.490
Then the peasants, I think,
only word needs to be said

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.190
about their view of property --

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:49.990
they had been property
until 1861.

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:51.850
That is not a very
good background

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:53.820
for having a high
respect for it.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:33:01.550
I want to -- I'm going
to flip through a number

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:05.200
of things quite quickly.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:13.980
Let me -- I'll resume my
regular notes on this issue.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:20.530
The direct government efforts to
prevent private associations --

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:26.040
you know, the Biblical --
or, the saying of Jesus,

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.900
"Whenever two or three
are gathered together

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.280
in my name, I am there."

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:34.170
I think one can impute to
the czarist regime a parallel

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:37.260
but radically different slogan.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.690
"Whenever two or three
are gathered together,

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:44.120
and my minions are not there,
they're probably up to no good,

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.590
and therefore, it's a good idea

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.950
to prohibit private
associations."

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:52.170
Maklakov encountered this
at a fairly early stage,

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:56.830
because the -- as I said, the
student orchestra funds were

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:59.290
to be allocated to
peasant relief.

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:03.450
Well, how was that
to be administered?

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:07.430
The watchful eye of the state
kept an eye on how that was

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:10.800
to happen, so that Maklakov

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.000
and the other students couldn't
just use their own entity.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.660
It had to be something
approved by the state.

00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:21.820
And actually, they worked out
a compromise that made it look

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.630
as if the students were
not being subservient

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:31.410
to the government, but in
fact, they sort of were.

00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:35.400
Maklakov was active on all
these issues, including the ones

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:40.800
that I've omitted
because of time.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.510
But the upshot was something
where, it seems to me,

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:48.880
is beautifully summarized by
Tocqueville in a description

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.300
of pre-Revolutionary France.

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.110
"When the Revolution happened,
one would have to search most

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:57.590
of France in vain for 10 men
who had the habit of acting

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:00.450
in common in an orderly
way, and taking care

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:02.690
of their own defense themselves.

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:06.150
Only the central power was
supposed to take care of it."

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:09.620
And I would argue that Russia
had created a similar --

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:14.610
the Russian regime had
created a similar situation.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:21.920
I want to turn to -- yeah,
I think I should turn,

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:29.870
at this point, but I would
welcome questions later.

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:35.110
I want to turn to this debate
between Kerensky and Maklakov.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:39.680
The issue is turning into
a statute a decree enacted

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:44.920
in October 1906, which
released various bonds

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.740
on the peasant estate.

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:51.330
And, as Maklakov said in
introducing the measure --

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.180
he was the reporter
for the committee

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:54.970
which was in charge of it.

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:57.600
It was a bill initially
supported by the government,

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.270
incidentally, some sign
of actual reformers

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:04.680
at work in the government.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.540
He acknowledged that, first
place, the bill itself --

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:13.090
the Decree of 1906
was itself limited.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:16.740
The bill which he was
offering was somewhat limited,

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.070
in the sense that it did
not make radical changes

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:26.540
with the 1906 Decree, and he
had a very clearly stated reason

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:27.840
for that.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.590
If they -- he believed that
if they stuck within the sort

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:34.570
of general parameters
of the bill,

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:38.060
essentially removing
restrictions

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:42.890
on the peasant estate, it
would probably get approval

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:47.520
at the state council, and
would become a true statute.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.000
There were others who
wanted to take the occasion

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.910
to remove restrictions --
similarly arbitrary restrictions

00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:01.100
on Jews, and Maklakov would've
been delighted to do that.

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:05.160
But he said, and
argued very firmly,

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:10.070
that this would defeat
the whole project.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:15.180
So anyway, Kerensky basically
acknowledges that the Decree

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.720
of 1906 was good, that
the bill extending it,

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:25.750
even if only modestly, was good,
but he wanted to do two things.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:29.710
He wanted to trash
Stolypin, who was the creator

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:33.140
of the 1906 Decree,
and by extension,

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:39.790
since Maklakov was
promoting essentially a decree

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:44.820
of Stolypin, by innuendo,
he trashed Maklakov.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:51.180
And Maklakov responded to
this with great moderation

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:55.820
and discretion, and I just want
to read to you what he says

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.360
in response to the accusation

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.830
that he's being some
way soft on Stolypin.

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:08.450
"For me to recognize when
my opponent is right --

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:10.880
" that was Stolypin --

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.770
"to recognize the desserts
of my political foe is a duty

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:18.720
of political honor, and I
have here fulfilled it."

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:23.080
And that seemed to be --
to very nicely put paid

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:26.430
to the Kerensky attack
on Maklakov.

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:29.370
There are other things
I can go into on that,

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:32.990
but I think I should stop.

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:36.850
So I'd be delighted
to have questions.

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:39.750
&gt;&gt; Thank you for that.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:42.620
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams: Eric?

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:46.560
&gt;&gt; So he had legal training.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:53.680
In the Revolutionary
Movements of 1905 and 1917,

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:58.310
and just more generally, his
theory of law and the rule

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:01.010
of law -- how did
he come to reconcile

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:04.280
that with those Revolutionary
Moments?

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.630
And -- I mean, there
were debates in them,

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:09.300
and we have jurists about
principles of natural law

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.970
versus positive law, and whether
the Revolution was compatible

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:17.150
with that, and whether -- I
mean, there were other thinkers

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:20.150
in the Kadets who said,
"Well, we promote rule of law,

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:24.060
but revolution can be part of
that if we embrace principles

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:28.000
of natural rights, and
thereby impose natural right

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.010
into the legal system.

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:32.250
And thereby, reconcile
all of these things."

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:35.790
Did he have sort of a
philosophy of natural right?

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:37.090
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams:
If I can,

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:40.680
I'll try to take a
two-tracked approach to that.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.080
One is, part of what
you're saying sounds

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.630
in very high legal
theory, and on the whole,

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:52.640
I would say that Maklakov
tended to avoid that.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.950
Now, one area where perhaps
you would say he didn't was

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:59.290
on the question of coups
d'état, coup d'états,

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:00.840
whatever the plural is,

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:05.650
where his position was
a quite practical one.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:08.980
That is to say, how
does it all work out?

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.540
He acknowledges that they're
illegal when they happen,

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:16.450
but sometimes -- and he points,
for example, to the coming

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:21.520
to power of Catherine the
Great -- they work out well.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:29.300
And they become accepted by
the society, and that's it.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.070
You've just got to move on.

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:34.780
He did not think that that was
true of a coups of November --

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.780
of June 3, 1907, the coup

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:42.130
by which the Czar
changed the franchise

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:43.480
for the election of the Duma.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.330
That's why we go from the
radical first two Dumas

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:50.370
to the conservative
third and fourth Dumas.

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:56.180
So he did not accept that as
a coup that got legitimized.

00:40:56.180 --> 00:41:03.210
Then, as to the -- I think it's
fair to say that in the truly --

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:06.250
well, in the February
revolution,

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:09.790
where the Czar's regime
-- where the Czar --

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:13.410
where Czar Nicholas was
compelled, effectively,

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:17.370
to abdicate, he pretty
strongly believed

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:22.690
that the liberals taking power
should do everything they could

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:27.710
to make his brother
Michael the Czar.

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:32.850
Which was actually what
Nicholas tried to bring about,

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:36.340
while all the others
except for Milyukov tried

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:39.650
to discourage that, I think
because they felt it would get

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:43.380
in the way of their
exercise of power.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.580
And also, I think
they had no sense --

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.080
and this goes back to the sort

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.400
of cultural attitude
toward institutions.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:55.860
They had no sense of the
advantage of having a framework

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.070
for reaching decisions.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:04.020
The Duma had a very narrow
franchise starting in June 1907.

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:10.760
So the Duma that was
around in February 1917 was,

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.060
in certain respects,

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.520
illegitimate and
unrepresentative.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.130
There were actually
ways in which

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:19.530
that could've been changed,
because there was a practice

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:23.500
in other institutions
of bringing back

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:27.300
into the current
institution former members

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.840
of the institution.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:34.070
So the Duma -- the fourth Duma
could've added back in people

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:35.920
from the first, second,
and third,

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.000
and thus made it a more
representative institution.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.410
As far as I can make out,
the liberals spent no time

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:47.140
at all thinking about
this option,

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:54.470
and I can only attribute it
to an indifference to sort

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:59.120
of institutional
continuation, and normalcy,

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.290
and balance of powers.

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:05.670
Somewhere in my notes, I have
a favorite quotation of mine,

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:11.190
which is Maklakov quoting the
poet Nekrasov, "It isn't easy

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:13.860
to correct the work
of centuries."

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:19.890
And I think the liberals, saving
Maklakov and a few others,

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:23.580
had very little sense of that.

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:28.830
Yes?

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:33.850
&gt;&gt; Lena Lebocek [assumed
spelling], Russian linguist.

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:42.690
Could you tell us, how and
where did you find documents

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:45.750
and records, if it
was in Russian?

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.110
How you learned old
Russian [inaudible]?

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:48.410
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams: Oh.

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:49.710
The Russian writing?

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:51.010
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:52.310
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams: I
find that very difficult,

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:54.210
but the printer --
the happily --

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:59.300
the Russian printing that I was
looking at was almost always

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:02.800
in the 20th century,
and overwhelmingly

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.700
in the Duma records, which
are really pretty clear.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.280
And I can't remember
whether they had --

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.390
to what extent the typography
is a little -- it certainly --

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:15.090
it's slightly different

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:19.130
from current typography,
but not radically.

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:25.060
So that was not a serious
problem, which is not to say

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:27.500
that I was able to read
it easily or fluently.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.990
But I was able to
work through it.

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:33.980
As for the handwriting
of Russians,

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:38.600
I'm completely at sea in that.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.980
I was told at an early
stage in this venture

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:46.060
that Maklakov's handwriting
was absolutely indecipherable.

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:49.820
That's by people who read
Russian handwriting all

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.120
the time.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.990
So I never even tried.

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:59.690
And in fact, I didn't come
across letters out from him,

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:01.060
which would've been
helpful, anyway.

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:03.970
There's a great cache
of letters in to him,

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:09.740
some of them Alexandra
Kollontai, some of them also

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.120
from another girlfriend of his,

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:15.690
which gives an interesting
picture of his life,

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:18.760
including his romantic life.

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:26.430
Yeah? That's fine.

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:30.930
&gt;&gt; So what was his relationship
with the Octobrists like?

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:32.950
I've been reading
recently about an attempt

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:35.760
by the Trubetskoy
brothers to create a party

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.340
of peaceful renewal between
the Kadets and the Octobrists,

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:45.600
and as far as I can tell,
they got basically themselves

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.490
and a couple of cousins
to join, but nobody else.

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:49.810
But, I mean --

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:51.310
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams: I mean,
that's a really good question.

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:55.300
&gt;&gt; So was he actively trying
to maybe create some sort

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.070
of coalition of right --

00:45:57.070 --> 00:45:58.370
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams: He was.

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:01.020
He was a great believer in
coalitions, and the chapter

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:04.330
on national liberals
talks a lot about that.

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:07.030
There was extraordinary
stubbornness.

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:10.680
I mean, he had been a
Constitutional Democrat

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:15.080
from its founding congress.

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:20.420
He was active in that founding
congress, but he was at odds

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:23.710
with them on a number of
very important issues,

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:26.170
the most important being
actually the question

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:28.010
of peasant property.

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:31.390
But the other thing
is that, in --

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:35.410
particularly in the third
Duma and the fourth Duma,

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:39.430
the Constitutional
Democrats were very reluctant

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:41.860
to form alliances
with other parties.

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:45.900
And particularly --
Milyukov had the idea,

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:53.930
which I find slightly crazy,
that the three keys --

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:57.610
the three important things
to address were the scope

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:01.200
of the franchise, removal
of the state council

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:06.070
as a coordinate part of the
legislature, and establishment

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:12.040
of a rule that the government
must be responsible to the Duma.

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:16.950
And so -- called them the three
locks, and seemed to believe

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:19.380
that until they could
be unlocked,

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.980
no progress could be made.

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:23.920
And there's an interesting --

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:30.610
sort of a debate in the Kadet
party, where they go from a kind

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:36.120
of extreme formulation
by Milyukov,

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.140
which seems to make cooperation

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:42.520
with other parties a very
low order of priority,

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:46.950
to a slight change on
the basis of people

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:51.530
like Maklakov seeking
more compromise,

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:54.840
and more affiliation
with other parties.

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:58.740
But the change in the language
is miniscule, I have to say.

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:04.570
So the obduracy of the
Kadet party and the --

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:09.160
and particularly of
Milyukov was extreme.

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.230
On that, I should add something.

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:16.200
In 1917, the era of the
provisional government,

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:20.510
question of agricultural
reform is again before them.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:23.030
Maklakov comes up
with a proposal

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:27.770
which would not involve
any sort of upsetting

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:32.840
of the then-prevailing
property regime,

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:36.820
but it would favor
smallholders by making --

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:39.180
by providing differential
tax rates,

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:42.870
with higher taxes on
the larger tracts.

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:46.140
So since the principal concern

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:49.710
of the Kadets was
distributional,

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:53.760
favoring the poor
peasants at the expense

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.540
of large landholders, it seemed

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:59.160
to fit their purposes
quite well.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.790
They wouldn't listen --
well, they listened to him.

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:06.430
He gave a speech, and they said
almost by acclamation, "Well,

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:07.790
that's not our policy.

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:09.840
There's no point in
us discussing that."

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:13.660
They did not attack
it on the merits.

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:17.220
They just said, "This isn't
the way we view things."

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:18.520
And it's true.

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:22.210
I mean, they had been arguing
for something much more drastic

00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:25.200
for more than a decade.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:29.600
And they weren't about
to listen to proposals

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.920
which would accomplish a great
deal of what they really wanted

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.740
without the disruptive effects,
which were in the middle

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:41.820
of World War I -- would've
had very serious consequences.

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.140
And see, I wanted
to say another thing

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:48.710
about institutional
continuation.

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:54.420
Although addressing the war
would've been very difficult

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:58.510
under any circumstances, because
there basically was a great

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:02.280
social divide in Russia on that.

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:06.630
I do think that a
legislative body, expanded,

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:08.730
as I've suggested,
to be more liberal

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:14.390
than the fourth Duma was,
would've provided a forum

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:18.170
for debating that,
which might've led

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:20.750
to an agreed-on policy.

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:24.160
I mean, in the end, it
went by default to Lenin,

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:29.160
who had a policy which, in the
end, if it was not a majority

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.210
that agreed on it,
at least those

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:34.980
who disagreed were ineffective
in taking any other --

00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:38.140
in bringing about
any other view.

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:40.340
And in many respects, it seems

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.540
to me one could say Lenin
was right, but the --

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:49.790
it would've been far better, I
think, and possibly achievable,

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:52.740
to arrive at a conclusion,
whatever it was,

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:56.290
by debate among interested
parties.

00:50:56.290 --> 00:51:01.870
Rather than by, as happened
in October, a coup d'état,

00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:05.970
although one of the easier coup
d'états that ever happened.

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:07.270
Yes?

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:14.310
&gt;&gt; Were there foreign thinkers
or constitutions that engaged

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:17.110
in some way that they --

00:51:17.110 --> 00:51:18.410
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams:
That's interesting.

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:23.300
That's a wonderful question,
because there's one event

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:27.040
that inspired great
ridicule on his part.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:31.380
There was a conference between
Milyukov and Count Witte

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:37.330
in late 1905, when
things are shakiest.

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:43.830
And Milyukov says, "What the
Czar should do is promulgate

00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:45.310
a constitution.

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:47.200
He should take either
the Belgian

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:52.210
or the Bulgarian Constitution,
translate it, and promulgate it

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:55.490
as Russia's Constitution,"
without any thought

00:51:55.490 --> 00:52:01.100
of slight differences that might
exist between, first place,

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:09.450
a vast empire, and second place,
a country encrusted with --

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:12.130
I don't want to use
the term backward,

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:16.040
but with social expectations
radically different from those

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:19.700
which underlie a
constitutional regime.

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:25.160
And Maklakov has
great fun with that.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:29.170
I think it's fair to say
he might be criticized

00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:33.850
for not paying enough attention
to foreign possibilities.

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:36.790
He was an admirer of the
British Constitution,

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:40.210
for reasons that I think you can
see, that fit into his notions

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:45.420
of gradualism and -- well,
certainly gradualism.

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:49.470
He never mentions the
American founding.

00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:52.830
In fact, he speaks quite
scoffingly [sic] of the idea

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:55.380
of people getting
together in a room

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:57.830
and concocting a constitution.

00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:00.450
I mean, I happen to think
they did an awfully good job,

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:04.020
and maybe that's because
I'm paid to enforce it.

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:10.760
But anyway, he never
seriously addressed that.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:17.640
And switching to his side, I
think he was probably right

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.390
to think that the constituent
assembly, which was, in fact,

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:25.450
elected, of course,
at the end of 1917 --

00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:27.860
it's hard to say what
they would've done

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:32.600
if the Bolsheviks had let them
try in creating a constitution.

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:38.090
Because the kind of deficits in
social thought that I've tried

00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:42.180
to outline would've been
a very serious obstacle

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:46.200
to making headway on that.

00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:50.070
Yes?

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:53.790
&gt;&gt; I think you started by saying
something about you wanted

00:53:53.790 --> 00:54:05.520
to show how someone could stand
up to a party, or to a bully.

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.030
I forget -- how did you put it?

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:09.330
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams: Oh, yes.

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:11.750
&gt;&gt; But how did -- what
would your conclusion be?

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:13.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams:
Oh, no, that was --

00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:18.820
that was the episode
that I reported --

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:23.740
well, there are other
aspects of that debate,

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.040
in terms

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:30.570
of the Maklakov/Kerensky
challenge in 1916.

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:33.380
But let me tell you more
about Kerensky's bullying.

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:34.680
&gt;&gt; Do speak into the micro --

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.980
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams:
Oh, yeah.

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:37.280
Yeah. Yeah.

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:38.580
Yeah. Let me tell you more about
Kerensky's bullying technique.

00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:39.880
First place, there was
constant misrepresentation

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:44.920
of what Maklakov had said, and
just goes on, and on, and on.

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:47.740
Second place, there
was this innuendo,

00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.870
that since this decree
came from Stolypin,

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:54.980
and Maklakov is working
within the framework of trying

00:54:54.980 --> 00:55:02.060
to improve that decree, as well
as turning it into a statute,

00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:10.050
Maklakov is therefore, in some
way, tainted with all the sins

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:15.840
that the liberals generally
attributed to Stolypin.

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:27.990
And -- I mean, I think the
-- I find it dishonest,

00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:31.660
bullying in the sense of
going -- charging on and on,

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:37.240
even in the face of mild
correction by Maklakov,

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:43.270
and not a way in which people
who are seriously wishing

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:47.500
to advance the argument
would debate.

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:51.890
But Maklakov really
never picks up --

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:57.940
never responds by
mirroring those techniques.

00:55:57.940 --> 00:55:59.540
Quite the opposite.

00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:05.470
He responds possibly by even
being more inclined to a sort

00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:08.310
of cool, analytical view,

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:13.510
and a non-accusatory
view than he normally is.

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:15.520
Although, you see,
those are attributes

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:18.170
of his debating style
all the time,

00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:21.910
so maybe it's not
that much different.

00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:29.900
But he's not blown into echoing
the misbehavior, by my lights,

00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:34.230
and I think definitely
his lights, of Kerensky.

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:39.290
I have to say that I'm probably
the only person in the field

00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:43.220
of Russian history
who's read that debate,

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.030
and I feel it gave me to --

00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:52.140
an exposure to Kerensky that I
would never want to have again.

00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:58.300
And that gives me a perspective
on Kerensky that scholars

00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:01.070
of the period would
all benefit from.

00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:04.830
I tried to share
that in the book.

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:09.920
&gt;&gt; One more question.

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.220
&gt;&gt; Just a quick question.

00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:15.010
I know that your
book ends with 1917,

00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:18.970
but how did he fare
after the Revolution?

00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:20.620
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams:
The book actually goes on.

00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:23.100
There's a chapter
called "Exile."

00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:28.250
So we have actually 40 years
covered in less than 20 pages,

00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:30.770
and he was named
Ambassador to France

00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:33.260
by the provisional government.

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:37.380
In October, he heads
off to France,

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:41.660
but before he can present his
credentials at the Quai d'Orsay,

00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:43.880
the provisional government
has fallen,

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:46.160
and the Bolsheviks
are in charge.

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:50.920
So he's left there without
credentials, essentially,

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.800
or without working credentials.

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:58.550
Now, France didn't recognize
the Bolshevik regime until 1924,

00:57:58.550 --> 00:58:01.440
so there's a seven-year
gap during

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:06.840
which Maklakov essentially
occupied the Russian Embassy

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:09.430
in Paris, and carried

00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:12.310
on responsibilities
as best he could.

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:18.010
The responsibilities fell
into a variety of forms.

00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:22.540
In the very first period,
it was trying to make sure

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:25.290
that some Russian
voice was heard

00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:27.600
at the Paris Peace Conference,

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.910
and I think he did
as well as one could.

00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:35.100
But the people at the Paris
Peace Conference were just not

00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:38.650
that interested in what
defrocked Russians,

00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:40.660
as it were, might have to say.

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:43.940
They also weren't interested in
what the Bolsheviks had to say,

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:46.530
because they were very
doubtful whether the Bolsheviks

00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:48.120
would survive.

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:51.400
So that was one project
where I think he tried

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:53.260
as well as he possibly could.

00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:59.320
The other great activity really
was being a Russian voice

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:04.880
in Paris, a channel between
the émigré community

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:06.860
and the French government.

00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:09.420
And I should say, the French
government, to its credit,

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:13.780
actually created an office
to which it appointed him,

00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:18.740
to be this representative from
the Russians to themselves,

00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:25.350
and he had to do such things
as -- when a -- let's see.

00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:30.320
There was a -- I'm
trying to remember.

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:37.920
There were two assassinations,
and one was by a --

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:48.650
I think it's a Pole in Poland,
and he's arrested and is sent

00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:51.170
to a military tribunal.

00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:54.430
When the Russians hear that --
Russians in Paris hear that,

00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:57.720
they think, ugh, that's
the end for this poor guy.

00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:01.970
And the assassination was
one they were generally

01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:04.040
sympathetic to.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.070
So they were -- did
not like the idea

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:12.780
of this person getting a quick
brush-off at a military trial.

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:19.150
In fact, it turned out that the
Poles had selected this means,

01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:21.350
because they could control it.

01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:23.790
Not a model of the
rule of law, perhaps.

01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:26.230
They could control
it, and make sure

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:29.940
that nothing drastic happened
to this guy, and actually,

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:32.210
Maklakov, through
an intermediary,

01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:36.350
learned what was up, and was
able to pacify the Russians.

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:38.790
So he was doing that
sort of thing.

01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:41.560
And the other thing he
had to do a great deal was

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:46.050
to help Russians get
their papers out of the --

01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:49.610
out of the Russia -- out
of the French bureaucracy,

01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:53.990
and as I point out in the
book, Maklakov is recognized

01:00:53.990 --> 01:01:00.420
in a novel published in France
in, I think, 2015 as someone

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:03.800
who has helped one
of the characters

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.490
of the novel get
admission to France.

01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:14.830
And so his cast shadow going
forward about 100 years.

01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:17.350
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:01:17.350 --> 01:01:19.090
&gt;&gt; Stephen F. Williams:
Thank you.

01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:20.890
Whoops.

01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:26.110
[ Applause ]

01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:27.410
&gt;&gt; Thanks for coming.

01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:28.710
That was --

01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:31.480
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of The Library of Congress.
