00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.064
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In all the problems so far, we've been setting up equations with words, and

00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:08.038
then solving them. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; We're going to try that same approach, but this time with

00:00:08.038 --> 00:00:11.776
geometry. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; We're going to look at angles. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; An angle is used to represent a

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:15.632
certain amount of rotation. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; You might have heard doing a 360. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you're

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:19.631
looking out in one direction and turn all the way around, you've gone 360

00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:23.878
degrees. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, some angle is only part of 360 degrees. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; We're not going to

00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:28.494
look at just any angle, we're going to look at some special angles that have

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:29.830
unique relationships.
