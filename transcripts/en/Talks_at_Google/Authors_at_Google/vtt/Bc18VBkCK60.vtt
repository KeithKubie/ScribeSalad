Hello, welcome. My name is Chris Tafay.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:16.170
The Authors at Google speaker series is honored
to welcome author Greg Bear to Google Santa

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.690
Monica.
Greg Bear is the author of more than 30 books

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.270
of science fiction and fantasy, including
Quantico, Blood Music, the Forge of God, and

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.750
Darwin's Radio.
The recipient of two Hugo awards and five

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.240
Nebula awards, Bear's books cover topics as
diverse as galactic conflict, artificial universes,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.059
networked intelligence, genetic engineering,
and nanotechnology.

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.380
In addition to being a prolific writer, Bear
has also served on political and scientific

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.670
action committees, advising Microsoft, the
U.S. Army, the CIA, Sandia National Laboratories,

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.510
and other groups and agencies in the course
of this rather remarkable career.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.050
Please join me in welcoming Greg Bear as he
discusses his latest book, Mariposa.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.050
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.390
Greg: Thanks for coming out here, and thanks
to all the people in the far flung corners

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.320
of the world here.
Mariposa is a follow-on to Quantico, which

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.840
had an interesting history which is nearly
legendary now.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.810
As a science fiction writer, I thought I was
continuing to write science fiction, but some

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.990
of my editors suddenly realized I was moving
into technothrillers, and they didn't want

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.240
to do that.
And so, I was kind of caught betwixt and between

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.590
in a little bit of trouble.
Finally, it came out, and it turned out it

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.580
didn't matter.
People liked the book, and it was one of my

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.670
best selling books.
So publisher came back to me and said, "Let's

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.950
do another one."
And I think that living well is a dish best

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.140
served cold.
So we're on No. 2 of an impossible series

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.290
here, which -- and I still don't know, you
know, is technothriller or science fiction

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.909
 -- I don't think there's much distinction.
Back when I was a kid, reading analog, John

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.810
W Campbell would publish stories that would
deal with, you know, new fighter aircrafts,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.020
superfighter aircraft with a pilot jacked
into the control system working on a hallucinogenic

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.619
drug to heighten his sense of perception -- top
secret, superfast, over North Cape, crashes.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.700
How do you get him out?
That's a Tom Clancy story.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.150
But it was an analog science fiction.
So I grew up thinking that technothrillers

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.180
were science fiction.
I think Mariposa -- I'm actually moving into

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.459
another cycle here, which I was a little surprised
with.

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:26.700
When I finished Quantico, the book was published
in 2005, written between 2003 and 2004.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.810
It describes a severe economic downturn in
the United States.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.260
Well, that may or may not be prophesy, because
it was perfectly obvious to me that was coming.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.120
In Mariposa, a couple of years down the road,
we're coming out of that, but we have major

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.640
difficulties.
And so, in coming so close to the future that

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.010
you actually live what you're writing about,
I think I need to listen to myself a little

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.660
more in terms of the stock market, which I
didn't.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.319
Yah, I'm not supposed to be a prophet.
I don't think science fiction typically is

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.120
prophetic, but it does in this case -- I think,
when we get that close to the present, we

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.880
need to be really kind of politically sensitive
and organically sensitive.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.989
I regard politics as biology.
And that biology can be predicted if you think

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.349
of trends, of personalities, of countries
that have personalities, of psychological

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.129
profiles -- think of a nation having a psychlogical
profile.

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:25.849
So maybe I'm a profiler of our country.
And in Mariposa, what I'm profiling is a major

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.600
security problem.
Our security problem is that we put ourself

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.569
in so much debt, perhaps $20 to $40 trillion
over the next ten years, that we owe our soul

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.050
to the company store.
Now, we've been pretty plush up until recent

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.140
times.
And so, our instincts aren't honed for that

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.930
particular difficulty, and our security instincts
really aren't honed for that at all.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.790
We still think, you know -- despite the economic
downturn, we still believe that we're in charge

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.790
of our destiny.
But if you look at what's going on right now

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.799
with Clinton going to China and Obama going
to China.

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:05.590
They're not being very hard on China, why?
Because China owns us -- a substantial portion.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:12.849
[pause]
So the upshot of all of this is that, in Mariposa,

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.350
we've got a major security problem with internal
sources.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:25.200
That is, Axel Price is a CEO of a major corporation
in Texas, which provides government services

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.150
and training.
And that's been a real issue for me, because

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.250
I don't believe we should be outsourcing things
like prisons, military logistics and that

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.720
sort of thing.
Along the way, we're also dealing with the

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.400
situation that I had in Quantico -- the description
of our security problem as being not so much

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:49.800
from outside, which is the typical technothriller,
but from within. [pause]

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.960
I think the dictum that I follow -- ascribe
to most -- is Pogo's dictum, "We have met

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.930
the enemy and he is us."
And both Quantico and Mariposa are about our

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.340
eternal problems.
And we've really been our own worst enemies

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:02.600
since the beginning.
If you think of the worst war we ever fought,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.750
it was with ourselves.
[coughing] Excuse me.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:15.770
I've been fighting off a cold here.
The whole notion of our history being a kind

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:22.050
of a tangle of strong passions fighting up
against each other is fine as long as we're

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.311
stable, as long as we don't have severe imbalances.
But with this economic situation, what if

00:05:25.311 --> 00:05:30.960
our internal enemies decide they want to reenact
something that's been supposedly gone for

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.360
150 years?
And that's the situation.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.630
Now, in Quantico, my characters -- Rebecca
Rose, an FBI agent -- is now on furlough in

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.730
Mariposa.
She's looking to start a life -- to live a

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.199
life -- which she's never really had.
Because an FBI agent, as a female in a patriarchal,

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.970
male-oriented community, she's never been
able to really do that.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.840
But she's on furlough, she started to set
up a family.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.420
She's trying to adopt a girl.
And this is where things get interesting,

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.400
because I'm now going back full circle to
novels that I wrote in 1989, realizing the

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.909
political situations I was talking about in
1989 -- in a novel called Queen of Angels

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:12.780
 -- are happening today.
The setup is perfect to just blend Mariposa

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.410
into the universe of Queen of Angels, which
is a universe in which you have computers

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:23.930
becoming 'competors' and eventually thinkers
 -- in which you have, in 2047, everyone been

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.710
therapied.
Effective mental therapy gets rid of all of

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.150
our little foibles -- our mental foibles.
And in Mariposa, the Mariposa Treatment is

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.319
the very beginning of that therapy.
And it's a mixed bag, because it's brand new.

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:42.290
Mariposa takes away all the stops, all the
epigenetic learning that you've been through

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.970
as a biological organism.
PTSD, a major problem of today's world, is

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.789
simply being treated by Mariposa.
Mariposa starts off as a chemistry.

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:53.660
What is cancer? Cancer is tissue learning
bad habits.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.130
Cancer is tissue that has been removed or
it's basically had the stops removed from

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:03.479
its destiny and becomes immortal or wants
to be immortal.

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:06.539
And those are epogenetic stops that's clamped
on DNA -- on genes.

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:13.080
You put a clamp on a gene, and that's the
epogenetic information on top of the sequence

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.460
of the gene.
And this is just as important in the body,

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.860
but also in your personality, in your psychology.
Because, as you go through life, the stress

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.830
built up on you, puts clamps on certain genes.
You start to, from birth, organize yourself

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.660
to fit into the environment which you're in.
And if you're in a battle situation or a law

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.840
enforcement situation with high stress or
violence or anything else, after a while,

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:43.389
you become locked into a rut of behaviors.
And those behaviors [inaudible]

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:51.240
Now, the whole sequence of Mariposa is that,
in treating cancer, our mad doctor has discovered

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.780
that you can also stop emotional problems.
But in removing the stops of the emotional

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.080
problems, it turns out you're also taking
away the stops of socialization.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:06.310
So there's an element of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:13.270
You become a Tabula rasa -- a newborn baby
with adult emotions and information.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.090
The upshot of it all is that Mariposa works
sometimes.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:22.550
But, in this novel, it's just the beginning.
And the opening chapter is the vice president

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:26.479
murders his wife.
We have an undercover agent working in Texas

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:30.330
from the FBI.
And then, we have a security conference in

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.210
the Los Angeles Convention Center that goes
badly wrong.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.829
But, in that security conference, you get
to look at all of the concerns, the emotions,

00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:43.510
and the technology of the present day taken,
say, humpty umpty years down the road -- just

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:47.350
a few years down.
The whole notion of 24-hour surveillance and

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:51.230
4K video is just down the road.
We can have it.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:57.140
We can put the glasses on and have our lives
completely recorded in 4K video -- better

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.130
than HD.
You can have your car set up so that it feeds

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.731
video to the police if someone's tailgating
you.

00:09:01.731 --> 00:09:07.450
In other words, you have a society with no
lubrication allowed whatsoever, because everything

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.960
can be caught on camera.
The cops can't misbehave badly.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:17.670
You can't speed. You can't irritate people.
You can't do any of that, because if you do,

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.610
they'll get you.
So the whole idea of freedom becomes less

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:30.830
and less tolerant as we move on.
Now, the combination of all of these elements

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:35.600
leads to a science fiction scenario.
And so, I think that technothrillers and science

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:41.790
fiction are pretty much the same.
Politically, when I wrote Quantico, I thought

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.680
it was a liberal spree.
I thought that I was really coming down hard

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:50.920
on the kind of bad rule that we're facing:
Putting heavy duty stress on our law enforcement

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:57.330
people, on our soldiers, on our army, military.
Turned out that conservative websites gave

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.500
it good reviews and thumbs up, because they
thought it was fair and balanced.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:05.320
I must have been doing something wrong.
In Mariposa, it's equally fair and balanced.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.290
That is, it's another liberal's greed.
And the whole message behind it is, Bad Kings

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:13.170
Kill the land .
If you choose bad leadership -- if you choose

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.290
not wisely as to who is going to control you
 -- you face the consequences.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:22.290
And we are, in Mariposa, facing the consequences
 -- still -- of those years in which we sold

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:28.450
our soul to the company store.
And we're still facing that, and we will for

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.980
years to come.
If America could be put into receivership

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.779
financially, what are we going to sell off
first?

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:40.190
The national parks? The military system?
Already we've sold off military training and

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:46.450
logistics to private companies.
What's the next step?

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.670
So that's the future I'm looking at.
The upside is, this is a hopeful book.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.640
None of my books have been dystopias.
They're talking about people having a hell

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.470
of a hard time -- but surviving.
And at the end of my novel, my characters

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.730
all survive.
They're all doing well -- except for one thing,

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:07.370
they're completely liberated.
You have two main characters, Rebecca Rose

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:14.560
and my computer programmer, Nathaniel Trace,
who has been working on a 'competor,' Bob

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:21.470
Jones.
Does anybody recognize what I'm paying homage

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.700
to here -- a worldwide computer system that
could control the financial system?

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.230
It's Bloss Systems, written by D.S. Jones.
Nathaniel Trace and Rebecca have one thing

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:28.870
in common.
They are free of social concern.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:33.720
Whether they be Dr. Jekyll or they be Mr.
Hyde, we don't know, but for them, the world

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.230
is completely fresh and new.
And so, I'd like to go on in the next book

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:42.540
to describe that world that they see with
completely fresh eyes.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:55.110
I'm not sure where the politics are here or
the technology or where the genre, boundaries.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:12:05.820
I don't see any of these things as dividing
or stopping me from moving into one territory.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:20.060
But I do know that, in Mariposa, we are now
heading into that land of Queen of Angels.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:28.800
And, in fact, in this book, you'll meet the
main character of Queen of Angels, which is

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:36.750
set in 2047, police detective named Mary Choi.
In this novel, she's ____.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:46.180
So we're neatly tying it in.
And of course, Queen of Angels leads into

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:53.500
Movie Mars, Heads, and Omni Computing and
all. [mumbling]

00:12:53.500 --> 00:13:16.430
I'm having great fun with the book.
It's kind of fun to go back and not mash it

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:26.089
together, though, they say robots and empires,
but to find that it really does go close to

00:13:26.089 --> 00:13:42.610
the politics I was describing, it appears
I was working against in the 1980s are still

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:48.370
with me.
We haven't solved anything.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:59.100
These are 30-year-old problems.
So that's where I'm at with this book.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:12.670
I've got a lot of technological details in
here -- biological and programming lines and.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:25.270
[mumbling] Can I answer any questions?
Yeah, any questions from out there in the

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.300
vast ether too.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.310
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:42.440
Q Do we need to read the Quantico first before
we read this one?

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:57.490
A Not really. You'll probably enjoy it if
you do, but in this one, the plot of Quantico

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:11.810
is kind of a reveal.
It's a background that's eventually kind of

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:18.920
creates suspense until you know what actually
happened.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:29.170
So I've very cleverly set it up so that if
you don't read the novel -- but you will get

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.050
more information.

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:54.330
Q So in the books, you seem to present technology
 -- enabling abilities of technology -- as

00:15:54.330 --> 00:16:07.480
sort of a risky, but ultimately beneficial,
and capable of handling the issues.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:24.040
I'm curious as to what you really believe
the chances of technology at solving some

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:44.779
of these other very real problems, such as
debt and things like that.

00:16:44.779 --> 00:16:45.779
A National debt?

00:16:45.779 --> 00:16:57.080
Q As a stand-in for very big problems that
we all have?

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:10.370
A
The national debt, of course, is kind of a

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:13.319
psychological, monetary, hormonal problem;
isn't it?

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:18.410
I mean, money is permission to get working.
And the way it's manipulated and hypermanipulated

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:23.010
and metamanipulated around the world is very
tough to understand except from a biological

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:32.630
perspective.
It's like a brain trying to find blood sugar.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:37.680
And every so often, it'd have an epileptic
seizure.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:48.220
And the blood sugar is allocated in the incorrect
ways -- goes to the incorrect areas to solve

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:58.140
problems.
I think that's what happens when the economy

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:06.450
gets filtered.
We lose the ability to connect between the

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:15.590
symbolic value of money and the ability to
get work done.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:24.780
So you have things that are hypervalued, but
really aren't.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:34.530
And suddenly, people find themselves with
less incentive to do work than they thought

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:39.420
they had, and they slow down.
They get depressed.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:50.630
How's that not like an organism with blood
flow and all of that?

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.250
So solving that problem is more of a psychological
problem than a technological one.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:19:03.360
And that's really interesting.
You could set all the economics in the world

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.220
to zero if everyone agreed to.
And just start over again and say, "Okay,

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.320
you know."
And they've done this in countries that had

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.539
hyperinflation.
Set it all back to zero.

00:19:10.539 --> 00:19:16.650
Basically reorient, re-naturalize, re-normalize,
like quantum mechanics -- if it doesn't work,

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:23.720
normalize it.
And that's an interesting idea.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:29.539
Other larger problems.
Therapy, in Queen of Angels, was designed

00:19:29.539 --> 00:19:39.160
to remove the last of our medieval variations.
You know, if you take a look at a medieval

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:47.539
painting or Renaissance painting and look
at all these characters with moles and warts

00:19:47.539 --> 00:19:52.690
and noses and distortions and hunchbacks and
everything.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:20:01.380
We watch the Dutch masters painting their
towns and their cities.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:12.440
We realize that today, physically, we're probably
better off than them, but mentally, we still

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:18.669
have all those warts and all of those bends
and problems.

00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:27.900
Get rid of those, and what do we have?
A different society.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:34.880
In Mariposa, we're coming to grips with the
early stages of that.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:46.340
What do we want to be?
How do we want to define ourselves?

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:54.550
How do we want our personal interactions to
build?

00:20:54.550 --> 00:21:01.530
How efficient do we want to be?
How sane do we want to be?

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:10.169
I mean, again, this notion that we get socialized
by clamping down various genes -- acquire

00:21:10.169 --> 00:21:15.860
an epogenetic veneer -- as we get older, is
probably one hundred percent accurate.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:21.260
That's probably what happens to us.
And PTSD, under those conditions, is learning

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:28.480
bad habits, which work well on the battlefield
or in crime situations or in violent situations,

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:34.669
but work very poorly when you're at home in
bed trying to sleep.

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:45.040
All of these things, then, come back to what
is our evolution and metaevolution and how

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:53.490
do we want to direct ourselves, and again
[mumbling] The question -- of whether it'll

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:57.530
work or not -- is irrelevant, because of course,
sometimes it'll work and sometimes it won't,

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.030
just like all the technology we use.
Technology is a human endeavor.

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:08.170
Not doing it is not an issue.
We can't stop ourselves from doing it, because

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:15.929
we always offer that carrot at the end of
the stick, "Okay, things are going to be better."

00:22:15.929 --> 00:22:24.919
Q My question was more to, What do you actually
believe about, you know, the likelihood of

00:22:24.919 --> 00:22:28.010
beneficial outcomes in the future?

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:32.390
A You have it happen all the time.
I mean, would you go back to 1924?

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.059
Q Twenty-four sounds bad, no. [laughter]

00:22:34.059 --> 00:22:38.690
A What would you go back to?

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:45.220
Q If I could get stock in the, well no, '24
wasn't that bad.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.500
It was '29 that was bad, so.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:57.160
A Those five years you could have fun.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.450
Q Exactly.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:10.929
A You can sell real estate for five more years.

00:23:10.929 --> 00:23:15.530
Q Just keep looping.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:16.530
A Yep.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:30.220
Q No, I guess it was more like, Do you actually
see the future as being that bright, given

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:34.539
the -- obviously, technology has gotten us
this far.

00:23:34.539 --> 00:23:41.780
And there are issues, but it seems overall
to be a benefit.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:50.760
As a futurist, what do you see in the near
future?

00:23:50.760 --> 00:24:04.380
A What concerns me most right now is, I don't
think most people believe there is a future.

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:11.500
They don't see any difference or change that
will benefit them.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:22.300
And they're afraid nearly all of the time.
And so, they go back to the more cozy stuff,

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:28.690
which is the more acceptable stuff about zombies
and vampires.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:36.720
These are monsters they know.
The future is a monster they don't know.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:42.370
And what do they do?
They romanticize zombies and vampires.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:50.460
I mean, pretty soon, we're going to have zombie
babysitters, if we don't have them already.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:56.690
Kids -- it's going to be like the Frankenstein's
monster.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:04.750
It isn't scary anymore.
So, we've taken our old monsters and normalized

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:14.960
them, and our new monster is the future.
And we don't want to know what it is, because

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:27.710
we don't know what we want to be.
We just don't.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:38.880
America is at a crossroads now.
What do you all want to do?

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:53.160
Do we want to go back to a Golden Age that
never existed?

00:25:53.160 --> 00:26:04.029
Do we want to move ahead to a liberal view
of the world that never worked before?

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:12.550
We just don't know.
We don't know how to handle our finances,

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:23.010
how to handle our freedom, our equalities.
And yet, somehow, America always stumbles

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:30.250
along.
We've been in worse situations. So yeah, I'm

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:36.100
optimistic.
But think about it, we have been in much worse

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:43.090
situations, where our passions have produced
extraordinary violence.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:56.179
And Mariposa is about avoiding that, about
not allowing people to have their worst passions

00:26:56.179 --> 00:27:05.760
rule the world.
Along the way, that means of course, you got

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:27.090
to kick some butt and bring out some pole
axes and all that sort of stuff.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:36.110
Q So I got a question.
So it seems to me that Axel Price's company

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:44.840
is very similar to maybe another company that
you might have modeled it on?

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.919
A Several different companies.

00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:52.960
Q Yeah, I mean, it's an amalgamation, but
the one that stood out for me was Blackwater

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:58.310
and even the name is similar to the owner
there.

00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:59.310
And yeah, and so.

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:00.679
A It does sounds like a bomb-building prison.

00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:02.010
Q Yeah, it does. It does. So?

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.110
A Jonathan Price.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:07.830
Q So, the Blackwater comparison was clear
to me, but since it's an amalgamation, what

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:15.140
other companies out there is this -- I guess,
it's sort of -- dystopian corporation that

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.539
you're kind of modeling?

00:28:18.539 --> 00:28:20.700
A Well, you know, I'm thinking of -- all of
the service companies that provide services

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:25.520
for Washington, D.C.
-- and full disclosure, I've received checks

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:30.270
from many of them for attending ___ conferences
and so on.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:35.700
There'd be KBR, Kellogg, Brown, Route.
These companies have always been very helpful

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:41.000
in Washington, D.C. in setting up conferences,
in providing logistic support, and all sorts

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.010
of support activity.
Where I find them to be less than useful is

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.150
when they're allowed to kill people without
consequences.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:52.110
Soldiers aren't. And that seems dysfunctional
to me.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:54.559
Or when we're going to sell off 'death row'
to a private company.

00:28:54.559 --> 00:29:05.300
That I don't want to see.
That I think is going much too far, the privatization

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.740
of security and our armed forces is not a
good idea.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.360
One, because an army is beholden to the civilians
that pay for it.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.669
And if you have a firewall between payment,
punishment, and performance, and someone can

00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:14.700
get away with not delivering on their contractual
obligations, or violates those contractual

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.700
obligations, or is never given any obligations
under the contract, except vague ones, doesn't

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.059
work for me.
America is about Americans controlling their

00:29:17.059 --> 00:29:18.830
firepower.
It's not about removing your sense of guilt

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:23.970
or responsibility by assigning it to somebody
else that you can say it was their fault.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.390
We should be guilty.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:32.990
Q Does assigning it to someone else sort of
open up freedom for Americans in a sense?

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:34.549
A How will that be?

00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:40.049
Q Well, you have freedom if you don't have
to think about those things, right?

00:29:40.049 --> 00:29:47.029
A Yeah, you have freedom of guilt, but if
you're guilt-free, you're dysfunctional.

00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:56.600
You need to be therapied at that one. [laughter]
Mariposa is for you. No guilt, no glory.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:05.870
But yeah, I think that that would be one of
the reasons people might want to give this

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:13.510
up is, they want to live in their BMW, buy
their BMW, have their home theater, and never

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:20.130
leave the house, because you don't want to
pay taxes to -- you don't want to build community.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.130
Don't be responsible for community or for
country.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.130
Patriotism without responsibility or without
a sense of country seems to me to be kind

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:23.130
of a loose cannon.
You have a question?

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:24.130
Oh, collating -- still collating.
Yeah. Oh, whichever one want to go first,

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:25.130
sure.
San Francisco. All right.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:26.130
Q Sort of, you have a great breadth of knowledge
and even depth into the research here.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:27.130
I was wondering if you could sort of go into
what comes first -- your plot or your research?

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:37.130
Do you go and read a whole bunch of different
things, and then, file them away as sort of,

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.100
"Oh, I could use this at some point in the
future."

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:44.750
Or do you weave your plot, and then, sort
of go and do deep dives into finding out the

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:45.750
specifics on the technologies?

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:49.730
A You know, yes on all accounts.
I've been privileged to be kind of at the

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:57.720
birthry of a lot of these activities in government.
So in a sense, 9/11, but even before then,

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:06.169
by being in consultation with Sandia, NASA,
and NASA administrators working on the Citizens

00:31:06.169 --> 00:31:08.570
Advisory Committee through the '80s and '90s.
Seeing not only how government works, but

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.750
also how the personalities interact of what
people who have been in government.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:14.880
Let's say, the whole cold warriors talk about
the Cold War days -- utterly chilling.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.809
You know, thank God that went away.
But it went away with surprising speed, because

00:31:17.809 --> 00:31:20.240
the first meeting I had with the Citizens
Advisory Counsel was in 1983, Star Wars defense

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.250
was proposed that same year, Soviet Union
started to collapse in 1981.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:25.789
And we could see that there were severe problems,
but the reports from the military were that

00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:39.149
the problems were going to get worse and worse
and worse and eventually computers will be

00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:44.779
controlling the situation.
So, that basically inspired me to write Eon,

00:31:44.779 --> 00:31:46.660
realizing all of those situations and the
personalities and the technologies.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.660
I had to figure out, What happens if something
comes in and interferes?

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.660
The old story in science fiction was, aliens
would unite us.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:54.734
What if an alien opportunity comes in and
divides us to the point of driving us to war?

00:31:54.734 --> 00:32:03.200
Like, you know -- I don't know -- a solid
gold meteor landing in the middle of a primitive

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:11.830
village.
What would you do with it?

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.770
So yeah, it's a little of both -- all of those
things together.

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:14.770
And then, later on, coming into Homeland Security,
talking at the FBI Academy in Quantico, talking

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:15.770
to agents, putting their personalities in
place.

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:16.770
The stories come later in that case, but some
of the research is already there.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:17.770
The impetus.
You had a question, sir.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:18.770
Q So, this is a frequently asked question,
but How would you recommend getting into writing?

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:19.770
You know, it's a nano Rhymo?

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:20.770
A You have to write.
You know, in your copious spare time.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:21.770
I don't know how many hours you work here
 -- a lot, I suspect.

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:22.770
But in your copious spare time, you have to
set aside an hour a day or in the morning

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:23.770
before you come in.
I know my friend, Joe Haldeman, used to get

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:24.770
up very early in the morning and write and
then go off and ride a bike and all that sort

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:25.770
of stuff for exercise.
Yeah. One hour a day, put aside, make sure

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:26.770
your family and your work don't interfere
with -- and write.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:27.770
And if you write a page a day, you have a
novel at the end.

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:28.770
Second clue, don't be afraid.
You don't have to show it to anybody.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:29.770
Maybe no one will ever see it.
But then you write, it's your own personal

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:31.720
thing.
You try it out. You have fun with it. You

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.720
relax.
And the zen of relaxing is the most important

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.720
thing.
If nobody ever has to see it, you're free.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.729
But if at some point, you come along and say,
"Well, this is pretty good."

00:32:37.729 --> 00:32:38.729
Then, you can hand it out to sympathetic friends
and relatives.

00:32:38.729 --> 00:32:39.729
If you don't have people who are supportive,
don't hand it out.

00:32:39.729 --> 00:32:40.729
Just send it straight off to the editor, because
if you're going to be rejected, you might

00:32:40.729 --> 00:32:41.729
as well be rejected by a stranger.
Yeah, that's the way to go.

00:32:41.729 --> 00:32:42.729
Any other thoughts about writing?
What are you working on?

00:32:42.729 --> 00:32:43.729
Q Kind of a future history thing.

00:32:43.729 --> 00:32:44.729
A That's where we all get started.
One of my first ideas as a kid was, "Let's

00:32:44.729 --> 00:32:45.729
write this future history going out to billions
of years of history."

00:32:45.729 --> 00:32:46.729
It's great fun. Ended up in City at the End
of Time.

00:32:46.729 --> 00:32:47.729
Q Oh, I'm not going that far. A few decades.

00:32:47.729 --> 00:32:48.729
A No, yeah, exercising and modeling and playing
with ideas.

00:32:48.729 --> 00:32:49.729
It's all great fun.
There's no reason you can't just continue

00:32:49.729 --> 00:32:50.729
to be fun.
But also, if you actually get something good,

00:32:50.729 --> 00:32:51.729
who knows?
Other questions? Yes.

00:32:51.729 --> 00:32:52.729
Q One of the things you were talking about
was how the technology is -- to intentionally

00:32:52.729 --> 00:32:53.729
misparaphrase you -- you were saying how people
are enjoying staying home and using their

00:32:53.729 --> 00:32:54.729
widescreen TV and avoiding the inconvenience
of going out and noticing that there is a

00:32:54.729 --> 00:32:55.729
city out there.
In many ways, this is sort of a culture variant

00:32:55.729 --> 00:32:56.729
back to when the city out there was the culture,
because there wasn't much culture you could

00:32:56.729 --> 00:32:57.729
get at home.
So, I suspect what's happened is the economies

00:32:57.729 --> 00:32:58.729
of scale have made it feasible to create a
culture, which is physically nonlocal.

00:32:58.729 --> 00:32:59.729
But that's driven out of the economy of scale
with that sort of cheaper to deliver to people

00:32:59.729 --> 00:33:00.729
on average than trying to deliver it in a
city.

00:33:00.729 --> 00:33:01.729
Do you see any opportunity for -- it's easy
to say 'technology' -- I meant more technology

00:33:01.729 --> 00:33:02.729
in a sense of the opportunities for the society
_____ technology whether technology will remove

00:33:02.729 --> 00:33:03.729
those economies of scale that's driving the
culture away from the cities and essentially

00:33:03.729 --> 00:33:04.729
make those same communities still there, but
they're smaller, so that they -- and you're

00:33:04.729 --> 00:33:05.729
only localizing them.

00:33:05.729 --> 00:33:06.729
A We certainly see that in the notion of small,
suburban, apartment buildings and malls.

00:33:06.729 --> 00:33:07.729
Well, your shops are nearby.
But I find those areas rather boring.

00:33:07.729 --> 00:33:08.729
What you want is the unexpected, but what
Americans seem to have been trying to go for

00:33:08.729 --> 00:33:09.729
for the last 20 years is "Only the expected,
thank you."

00:33:09.729 --> 00:33:10.729
No surprises, I want to pay for a uniformity
of excellence with no surprises.

00:33:10.729 --> 00:33:11.729
We see it in our retailing, in our entertainment
industry.

00:33:11.729 --> 00:33:12.729
We are really -- as we try to force ourselves
to be more and more uniform.

00:33:12.729 --> 00:33:13.729
At the same time, we want to be more and more
prosperous.

00:33:13.729 --> 00:33:14.729
When in fact, it seems to me that the most
prosperous and successful person out there

00:33:14.729 --> 00:33:15.729
is the one who's constantly surrounded by
good surprises.

00:33:15.729 --> 00:33:16.729
You can't generate that by having a controlled
environment.

00:33:16.729 --> 00:33:17.729
In a city, a well-ruled city is full of lovely,
strained, and sometimes awkward surprises.

00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:18.729
And that's what makes a biography.
My friend Larry Nevin says, "I've got enough

00:33:18.729 --> 00:33:19.729
money.
I just don't have enough memories."

00:33:19.729 --> 00:33:20.729
I think that's a beautiful philosophy.
And memories are not made by uniformity or

00:33:20.729 --> 00:33:21.729
expected expectations that are fulfilled.
They are made by surprises.

00:33:21.729 --> 00:33:22.729
Any other.
As long as not too much surprise.

00:33:22.729 --> 00:33:23.729
Surprise heading over into technothriller
shock, I'd like to avoid too.

00:33:23.729 --> 00:33:24.729
But on the other hand, I simply like to read
about it, so.

00:33:24.729 --> 00:33:25.729
Q Okay, another question.
So I was fascinated by your statement that

00:33:25.729 --> 00:33:26.729
you felt that your Quantico novel was kind
of a leftist screed in a sense.

00:33:26.729 --> 00:33:27.729
I can see the sort of -- what people traditionally
sort of think of as left-oriented themes in

00:33:27.729 --> 00:33:28.729
Mariposa -- I haven't read Quantico -- but
what would you say are the right-leaning themes

00:33:28.729 --> 00:33:29.729
that you think your readers have sort of grasped
on to?

00:33:29.729 --> 00:33:30.729
A Well, actually, I think it's the characters
have their own politics.

00:33:30.729 --> 00:33:31.729
I don't impose my politics on the characters.
Most of my law enforcement characters are,

00:33:31.729 --> 00:33:32.729
in fact, conservative.
Even Rebecca Rose is very kind of hard-bitten

00:33:32.729 --> 00:33:33.729
law enforcement.
And I think that appeals to people rather

00:33:33.729 --> 00:33:34.729
than having views imposed on psychologies.
So I think that's what they're getting.

00:33:34.729 --> 00:33:35.729
They're getting an honesty of the depiction
of the reaction of the characters.

00:33:35.729 --> 00:33:36.729
As to whether the situation in Mariposa is
leftist or not, it certainly criticizes prior

00:33:36.729 --> 00:33:37.729
administrations.
But at this point, the president in Mariposa

00:33:37.729 --> 00:33:38.729
is a Democrat and she still faces incredible
difficulties.

00:33:38.729 --> 00:33:39.729
And some of them, you know, come from missteps
in her own administration.

00:33:39.729 --> 00:33:40.729
A lot of them come from the past.
But that's with all presidencies.

00:33:40.729 --> 00:33:41.729
Q So what would be like a left view of the
government or a right view of government sort

00:33:41.729 --> 00:33:42.729
of through the eyes of the characters in Mariposa?

00:33:42.729 --> 00:33:43.729
A I think it'd be more the realization that
history still ruled, the passions of history

00:33:43.729 --> 00:33:44.729
still ruled.
And I don't think conservatives would feel

00:33:44.729 --> 00:33:45.729
at all comfortable with that notion.
When we have Axel Price at the end of the

00:33:45.729 --> 00:33:46.729
book -- I won't spoil too much -- spouting
off his philosophy of life, it is I think,

00:33:46.729 --> 00:33:47.729
you know, a philosophy that many conservatives
would find very appealing.

00:33:47.729 --> 00:33:48.729
And yet, at the same time, you realize he's
trying to destroy our nation.

00:33:48.729 --> 00:33:49.729
Why?
Why would he want to do that?

00:33:49.729 --> 00:33:50.729
What is he reenacting here?
Well, he's reenacting a passion of 50 years

00:33:50.729 --> 00:33:51.729
ago.
A resentment that's built up for over centuries.

00:33:51.729 --> 00:33:52.729
And that's something we usually ascribe to
the Middle East.

00:33:52.729 --> 00:33:53.729
We often say, "The Middle East is a place
where history goes to die."

00:33:53.729 --> 00:33:54.729
They all hate each other.
Well, what's going on here? Same thing.

00:33:54.729 --> 00:33:55.729
So I think that that would be considered to
be -- I think some conservatives would resent

00:33:55.729 --> 00:33:56.729
that assertion.
Part of their philosophy is Confederate.

00:33:56.729 --> 00:33:57.729
On the other hand, the liberals will take
no comfort from this book, as I'm saying basically,

00:33:57.729 --> 00:33:58.729
"We all have to work together here."
Not all of the country that's conservative

00:33:58.729 --> 00:33:59.729
is going to go along with my Bond Billan's
attitudes.

00:33:59.729 --> 00:34:00.729
Who knows what's going to draw us all back
together again?

00:34:00.729 --> 00:34:01.729
But we do need to do that.
We do need to come together.

00:34:01.729 --> 00:34:02.729
And it's possible that this financial situation
we're entering will be the equivalent of World

00:34:02.729 --> 00:34:03.729
War II forcing us to do that.
We have a decision to make.

00:34:03.729 --> 00:34:04.729
Are we going to finance our own country, or
are we going to watch it go down the drain

00:34:04.729 --> 00:34:05.729
 -- be owned by foreigners?
It's a big decision.

00:34:05.729 --> 00:34:06.729
&gt;&gt; Any other questions from D.C.? No? Okay.
Thank you very much.

00:34:06.729 --> 00:34:07.729
A My pleasure.
Thank you.

00:34:07.729 --> 00:34:07.730
&gt;&gt; [Applause]
