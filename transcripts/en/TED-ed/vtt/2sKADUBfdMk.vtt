00:00:06.817 --> 00:00:09.728
What mammal has 
the social life of an insect,

00:00:09.728 --> 00:00:11.957
the cold-bloodedness of a reptile,

00:00:11.957 --> 00:00:14.677
and the metabolism of a plant?

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:18.977
Bald and buck-toothed, naked mole rats 
may not be pretty,

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:21.498
but they’re extraordinary.

00:00:21.498 --> 00:00:23.596
With a lifespan of 30 years,

00:00:23.596 --> 00:00:26.968
their peculiar traits have evolved 
over millions of years

00:00:26.968 --> 00:00:30.305
to make them uniquely suited 
to survive harsh conditions,

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:34.926
especially long periods without oxygen.

00:00:34.926 --> 00:00:39.715
In the deserts of East Africa, 
naked mole rats feed on root vegetables.

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:44.747
They dig for the roots with teeth that
can move independently, like chopsticks.

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:46.725
But even with these special teeth,

00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:51.674
a single naked mole rat doesn’t stand 
a chance of finding enough food;

00:00:51.674 --> 00:00:56.485
the roots are large and
nutritious, but scattered far and wide.

00:00:56.485 --> 00:00:59.184
A large workforce has 
a much better chance,

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:02.173
so naked mole rats live in colonies.

00:01:02.173 --> 00:01:07.145
Similar to ants, bees, and termites, 
they build giant nests.

00:01:07.145 --> 00:01:09.205
Housing up to 300 mole rats,

00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:13.016
these colonies feature complex 
underground tunnel systems,

00:01:13.016 --> 00:01:14.296
nest chambers,

00:01:14.296 --> 00:01:16.216
and community bathrooms.

00:01:16.216 --> 00:01:20.485
Also like insects, naked mole rats 
have a rigid social structure.

00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:22.655
The dominant female, the queen,

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:25.155
and two to three males 
that she chooses,

00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:29.406
are the only naked mole rats 
in the colony who have babies.

00:01:29.406 --> 00:01:31.733
All the other naked mole rats,

00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:33.086
male and female,

00:01:33.086 --> 00:01:36.876
are either soldiers, who defend 
the colony from possible invaders,

00:01:36.876 --> 00:01:38.366
or workers.

00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:41.377
Teams of workers are dispatched 
to hunt for roots,

00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:44.345
and their harvest feeds the whole colony.

00:01:44.345 --> 00:01:47.916
Living in a colony helps naked mole rats 
find enough food,

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:51.874
but when so many animals live in 
the same underground space,

00:01:51.874 --> 00:01:54.665
oxygen quickly runs out.

00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:56.556
Mammals need a lot of oxygen;

00:01:56.556 --> 00:01:58.985
we use it to make the energy 
that fuels everything

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:00.865
from maintaining our body temperatures

00:02:00.865 --> 00:02:02.055
to our heartbeats

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.995
to voluntary movements.

00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:06.366
Without oxygen, we quickly die.

00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:10.335
In fact, no other mammal could survive 
the oxygen depletion

00:02:10.335 --> 00:02:13.716
experienced in a naked mole rat colony.

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:16.605
Naked mole rats can thrive in low oxygen

00:02:16.605 --> 00:02:20.096
in part because they’ve abandoned 
one of the body functions

00:02:20.096 --> 00:02:22.387
that requires the most oxygen:

00:02:22.387 --> 00:02:24.286
thermoregulation.

00:02:24.286 --> 00:02:26.334
Most mammals are warm-blooded,

00:02:26.334 --> 00:02:29.255
meaning they have to keep 
their body temperature consistent.

00:02:29.255 --> 00:02:32.356
Naked mole rats don’t get enough 
oxygen to do this.

00:02:32.356 --> 00:02:34.676
Instead, they’re the only mammals

00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:38.236
whose body temperature fluctuates 
with their environment,

00:02:38.236 --> 00:02:41.217
making them cold-blooded, like reptiles.

00:02:41.217 --> 00:02:43.544
They also have a special 
type of hemoglobin,

00:02:43.544 --> 00:02:46.506
the molecule in the blood 
that transports oxygen.

00:02:46.506 --> 00:02:50.545
Their hemoglobin is much stickier 
for oxygen than ours

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:54.376
and can pick oxygen up 
even when it’s scarce.

00:02:54.376 --> 00:02:57.476
In response to a real oxygen emergency,

00:02:57.476 --> 00:03:01.096
naked mole rats enter 
a state of suspended animation.

00:03:01.096 --> 00:03:02.907
They stop moving,

00:03:02.907 --> 00:03:04.156
slow their breathing,

00:03:04.156 --> 00:03:06.366
and dramatically lower their heart rate.

00:03:06.366 --> 00:03:11.101
This greatly reduces the amount of energy,
and therefore oxygen, they need.

00:03:11.101 --> 00:03:16.439
At the same time, they begin 
to metabolize fructose, like a plant.

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:21.246
Fructose is a sugar that can be used 
to make energy without burning oxygen.

00:03:21.246 --> 00:03:25.145
Usually, mammals metabolize 
a different sugar called glucose

00:03:25.145 --> 00:03:27.070
that makes more energy than fructose,

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.306
but glucose only works 
when oxygen’s available.

00:03:30.306 --> 00:03:35.116
Human brain and heart cells have 
some cellular machinery to use fructose,

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:38.234
but not nearly as much as naked mole rats.

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:43.625
Naked mole rats are, in fact, the only
mammals known to have this ability.

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:46.204
While we can hope humans won’t ever need

00:03:46.204 --> 00:03:48.965
to exclusively live 
in underground tunnels,

00:03:48.965 --> 00:03:53.245
there are many situations where 
we would benefit from needing less oxygen.

00:03:53.245 --> 00:03:56.195
During heart attacks 
and other medical emergencies,

00:03:56.195 --> 00:04:02.006
people often die or sustain debilitating 
organ damage from oxygen deprivation.

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:06.236
Could we replicate the naked mole rat’s 
use of the fructose pathway

00:04:06.236 --> 00:04:08.076
for human health?

00:04:08.076 --> 00:04:12.133
It took millions of years of evolution 
to bring the behavior of an insect,

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:14.516
the temperature regulation of a reptile,

00:04:14.516 --> 00:04:16.855
and the energy production of a plant

00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:19.444
together in one little mammal,

00:04:19.444 --> 00:04:21.395
but maybe, with enough study,

00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:25.406
we can replicate just a few 
of their wild adaptations.
