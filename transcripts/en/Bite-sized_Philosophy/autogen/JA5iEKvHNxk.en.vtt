00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
people to recover from that so the
 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.229 align:start position:0%
people to recover from that so the
father<00:00:49.739><c> should</c><00:00:50.039><c> be</c><00:00:50.070><c> an</c><00:00:50.280><c> encouraging</c><00:00:50.940><c> force</c>

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
father should be an encouraging force
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.389 align:start position:0%
father should be an encouraging force
but<00:00:51.539><c> can</c><00:00:51.719><c> be</c><00:00:51.870><c> a</c><00:00:51.899><c> tyrannical</c><00:00:52.680><c> and</c><00:00:52.920><c> crushing</c>

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 align:start position:0%
but can be a tyrannical and crushing
 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
but can be a tyrannical and crushing
force<00:00:53.699><c> and</c><00:00:54.000><c> so</c><00:00:54.120><c> that's</c><00:00:54.329><c> very</c><00:00:54.829><c> that's</c><00:00:55.829><c> a</c><00:00:55.949><c> very</c>

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 align:start position:0%
force and so that's very that's a very
 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
force and so that's very that's a very
difficult<00:00:56.309><c> thing</c><00:00:56.730><c> to</c><00:00:56.760><c> get</c><00:00:56.940><c> right</c><00:00:57.239><c> partly</c>

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 align:start position:0%
difficult thing to get right partly
 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.540 align:start position:0%

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.310 align:start position:0%
it with with the aim of making the best
in<00:01:12.990><c> you</c><00:01:13.140><c> come</c><00:01:13.439><c> forward</c><00:01:13.820><c> but</c><00:01:14.930><c> but</c><00:01:15.930><c> getting</c><00:01:16.140><c> that</c>

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
in you come forward but but getting that
 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.380 align:start position:0%
in you come forward but but getting that
balance<00:01:16.560><c> exactly</c><00:01:17.250><c> right</c><00:01:17.430><c> is</c><00:01:17.610><c> very</c><00:01:17.850><c> difficult</c>

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 align:start position:0%
balance exactly right is very difficult
 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.899 align:start position:0%
balance exactly right is very difficult
and<00:01:18.600><c> so</c><00:01:19.320><c> it's</c><00:01:19.500><c> easy</c><00:01:19.680><c> to</c><00:01:19.770><c> for</c><00:01:20.340><c> a</c><00:01:20.369><c> father</c><00:01:20.670><c> to</c>

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 align:start position:0%
and so it's easy to for a father to
 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.330 align:start position:0%
and so it's easy to for a father to
swing<00:01:21.210><c> too</c><00:01:21.450><c> much</c><00:01:21.630><c> into</c><00:01:21.990><c> judgment</c><00:01:22.619><c> let's</c><00:01:23.100><c> say</c>

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 align:start position:0%
swing too much into judgment let's say
 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.070 align:start position:0%
swing too much into judgment let's say
and<00:01:23.580><c> then</c><00:01:23.880><c> of</c><00:01:24.060><c> course</c><00:01:24.090><c> mothers</c><00:01:24.570><c> can</c><00:01:24.750><c> play</c><00:01:24.900><c> this</c>

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
and then of course mothers can play this
 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.020 align:start position:0%
and then of course mothers can play this
rule<00:01:25.290><c> too</c><00:01:25.530><c> to</c><00:01:25.890><c> swing</c><00:01:26.189><c> too</c><00:01:26.430><c> far</c><00:01:26.460><c> into</c><00:01:26.850><c> the</c>
