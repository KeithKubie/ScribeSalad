00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.530
Welcome back.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.080
We'll now use a little bit of
what we've learned about work

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.540
and energy and the conservation
of energy and

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.240
apply it to simple machines.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.650
And we'll learn a little bit
about mechanical advantage.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.760
So I've drawn a simple
lever here.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.830
And you've probably
been exposed to

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:15.890
simple levers before.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.040
They're really just kind
of like a seesaw.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.910
This place where the
lever pivots.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.970
This is called a fulcrum.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.090
Just really the pivot point.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.480
And you can kind of view this
as either a seesaw or a big

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.710
plank of wood on top of a
triangle, which essentially is

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.760
what I've drawn.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.750
So in this example, I have
the big plank of wood.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.729
At one end I have this 10
newton weight, and I've

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:33.720
written 10 in there.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.640
And what we're going to figure
out is one, how much force--

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.480
well, we could figure out
a couple of things.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.300
How much force do I have
to apply here to

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.430
just keep this level?

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.800
Because this weight's going
to be pushing downwards.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.370
So it would naturally
want this whole

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.200
lever to rotate clockwise.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.540
So what I want to figure out is,
how much force do I have

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.860
to apply to either keep the
lever level or to actually

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.450
rotate this lever
counterclockwise?

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.040
And when I rotate the lever

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.310
counterclockwise, what's happening?

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.810
I'm pushing down on this
left-hand side, and I'm

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.490
lifting this 10 newton block.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.950
So let's do a little thought
experiment and see what

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.200
happens after I rotate this
lever a little bit.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.970
So let's say, what I've drawn
here in mauve, that's our

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.140
starting position.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.550
And in yellow, I'm going to draw
the finishing position.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.040
So the finishing position
is going to look

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.290
something like this.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.091
I'll try my best to draw it.

00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:36.120
The finishing position is
something like this.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.890
And also, one thing I want to
figure out, that I wanted to

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.000
write, is let's say that the
distance, that this distance

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.610
right here, from where I'm
applying the force to the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.245
fulcrum, let's say that
that distance is 2.

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:54.990
And from the fulcrum to the
weight that I'm lifting, that

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.020
distance is 1.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.430
Let's just say that, just for
the sake of argument.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.570
Let's say it's 2 meters and 1
meter, although it could be 2

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.340
kilometers and 1 kilometer,
we'll soon see.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.300
And what I did is I pressed down
with some force, and I

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.960
rotated it through
an angle theta.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.540
So that's theta and this
is also theta.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.540
So my question to you, and
we'll have to take out a

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.390
little bit of our trigonometry
skills, is how much did this

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.060
object move up?

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.700
So essentially, what
was this distance?

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.850
What's its distance in the
vertical direction?

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.150
How much did it go up?

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.550
And also, for what distance did
I have to apply the force

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.070
downwards here-- so that's this
distance-- in order for

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.770
this weight to move up this
distance over here?

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.680
So let's figure out
either one.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.700
So this distance is what?

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.830
Well, we have theta.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.870
This is the opposite.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.410
This is a 90 degree
angle, because we

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.060
started off at level.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.780
So this is opposite.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.250
And this is what?

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.890
This is the adjacent angle.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.840
So what do we have there?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.900
Opposite over adjacent.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.920
Soh Cah Toa.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.760
Opposite over adjacent.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.750
Opposite over adjacent.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.490
That's Toa, or tangent.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.780
So in this situation, we know
that the tangent of theta is

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:19.070
equal to-- let's call
this the distance

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.702
that we move the weight.

00:03:20.702 --> 00:03:21.400
soon.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.480
So that equals opposite over
adjacent, the distance that we

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.050
moved the weight over 1.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.490
And then if we go on
to this side, we

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.070
can do the same thing.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.110
Tangent is opposite
over adjacent.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.530
So let's call this the distance
of the force.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.030
So here the opposite of the
distance of the force and the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.240
adjacent is this 2 meters.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.340
Because this is the hypotenuse
right here.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.530
So we also have the tangent of
theta-- now you're using this

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.030
triangle-- is equal to
the opposite side.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.250
The distance of the force
over 2 meters.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.020
So this is interesting.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.500
They're both equal to
tangent of theta.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.530
We don't even have to
figure out what the

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.380
tangent of theta is.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.190
We know that this quantity is
equal to this quantity.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.150
And we can write it here.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.250
We could write the distance of
the force, that's the distance

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.089
that we had to push down on
the side of the lever

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:22.460
downwards, over 2, is equal to
the distance of the weight.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.070
The distance the weight traveled
upwards is equal to

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.350
the distance, the weight,
divided by 1.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.110
Or we could say-- this
1 we can ignore.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.500
Something divided
by 1 is just 1.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.130
Or we could say that the
distance of the force is equal

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.100
to 2 times the distance
of the weight.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.270
And this is interesting, because
now we can apply what

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.870
we just learned here to figure
out what the force was.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.750
And how do I do that?

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.500
Well, when I'm applying a
force here, over some

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.950
distance, I'm putting energy
into the system.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:54.710
I'm doing work.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.260
Work is just a transfer of
energy into this machine.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.100
And when I do that, that
machine is actually

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.270
transferring that energy
to this block.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.670
It's actually doing work on the
block by lifting it up.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.640
So we know the law of
conservation of energy, and

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.280
we're assuming that this is a
frictionless system, and that

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.730
nothing is being lost to
heat or whatever else.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.000
So the work in has to be
equal to the work out.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.590
And so what's the work in?

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.310
Well, it's the force that I'm
applying downward times the

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.430
distance of the force.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.670
So this is the work in.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.500
Force times the distance
of the force.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.880
I'm going to switch colors
just to keep things

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.050
interesting.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.120
And that has to be the same
thing as the work out.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.770
Well, what's the work out?

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.190
It's the force of the weight
pulling downwards.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.700
So we have to-- it's essentially
the lifting force

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.330
of the lever.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.320
It has to counteract the force
of the weight pulling

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.950
downwards actually.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.610
Sorry I mis-said it
a little bit.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.030
But this lever is essentially
going to be

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.820
pushing up on this weight.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.190
The weight ends up here.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.200
So it pushes up with the
force equal to the

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.300
weight of the object.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.040
So that's the weight of the
object, which is -- I said

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.440
it's a 10 newton object -- So
it's equal to 10 newtons.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.250
That's the force.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.190
The upward force here.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.630
And it does that for
a distance of what?

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.480
We figured out this object, this
weight, moves up with a

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.730
distance d sub w.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.380
And we know what the distance
of the force is in terms of

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.760
the distance of w.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.360
So we could rewrite this as
force times, substitute here,

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.930
2 d w is equal to 10 d w.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:43.830
Divide both sides by 2 you d w
and you get force is equal to

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:50.150
10 d w 2 two d w, which is
equaled to, d w's cancel out,

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.510
and you're just left with 5.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.090
So this is interesting.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.500
And I think you'll see where
this is going, and we did it

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.490
little complicated this time.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.490
But hopefully you'll realize
a general theme.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.790
This was a 10 newton weight.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.700
And I only had to press down
with 5 newtons in order to

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.460
lift it up.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.500
But at the same time, I pressed
down with 5 newtons,

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.880
but I had to push down
for twice as long.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.880
So my force was half as much,
but my distance that I had to

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.190
push was twice as much.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:25.470
And here the force is twice as
much but the distance it

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.480
traveled is half as much.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.350
So what essentially just
happened here is, I

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.640
multiplied my force.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.490
And because I multiplied
my force, I

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.100
essentially lost some distance.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.710
But I multiplied my
force, because I

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.320
inputted a 5 newton force.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.200
And I got a 10 newton force out,
although the 10 newton

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.030
force traveled for
less distance.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.230
Because the work was constant.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.460
And this is called mechanical
advantage.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.450
If I have an input force of 5,
and I get an output force of

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.250
10, the mechanical
advantage is 2.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:57.660
So mechanical advantage is equal
to output force over

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.260
input force, and that should
hopefully make a little

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.910
intuitive sense to you.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.220
And another thing that maybe
you're starting to realize

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:07.110
now, is that proportion of the
mechanical advantage was

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:13.480
actually the ratio of this
length to this length.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.660
And we figured that out by
taking the tangent and doing

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.670
these ratios.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:20.200
But in general, it makes sense,
because this force

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.340
times this distance has
to be equal to this

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.820
force times this distance.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.410
And we know that the distance
this goes up is proportional

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:34.169
to the length of from the
fulcrum to the weight.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.340
And we know on this side the
distance that you're pushing

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.260
down, is proportional to the
length from where you're

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.020
applying the weight
to the fulcrum.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.640
And now I'll introduce you
to a concept of moments.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.890
In just a moment.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.240
So in general, if I have, and
this is really all you have to

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.350
learn, that last thought
exercise was just

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.370
to show it to you.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:09:03.740
If I have a fulcrum here, and
if we call this distance d 1

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.590
and we called this
distance d 2.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:12.335
And if I want to apply
an upward force here,

00:09:12.335 --> 00:09:15.770
let's call this f 1.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.830
And I have a downward force,
f 2, in this machine.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:27.970
f 2 times d 2 is equal
to d 1 times f 1.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.220
And this is really all
you need to know.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.630
And this just all falls
out of the work in is

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.880
equal to the work out.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.540
Now, this quantity isn't
exactly the work in.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.520
The work in was this force--
sorry, F2-- is this force

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.130
times this distance.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:47.370
But this distance is
proportional to this distance,

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.610
and that's what you
need to realize.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.610
And this quantity right here is
actually called the moment.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.560
In the next video, which I'll
start very soon because this

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.730
video is about to end.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:56.660
I'm running out of time.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.330
I will use these quantities to
solve a bunch of mechanical

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.560
advantage problems. See
