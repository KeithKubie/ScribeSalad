[music playing]

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.934
JAMES CAMERON: You won't
find bodies at Titanic.

00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:10.232
You won't find skeletons.

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:12.300
The bones actually
dissolve into solution

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.900
very rapidly at that depth.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.400
What anybody has explored the
wreck find is pairs of shoes.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.433
MAN: It takes years for
a skeleton to vanish,

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:28.734
but the shoes treated
with tannic acid--

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:29.800
they won't eat them.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.233
So all around the
Titanic are the shoes.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.300
There's a scene,
where we were filming,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.766
and we came across a
pair of woman's shoes--

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:46.900
Yeah.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.333
--next to a pair
of girl's shoes.

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.199
These were people.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.467
These were people.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.433
Those shoes got to
the bottom on people.

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:56.000
MAN: They were in their cabin,
because the cabin was all

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.800
around, the destruction of it.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.166
And there was a hand-mirror.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.233
This is the human element.

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:01.433
This is what people touched.

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:02.967
It's what they lived with.

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:03.967
MAN: Amazing.
