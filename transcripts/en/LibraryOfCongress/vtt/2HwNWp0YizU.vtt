[ Applause ]

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.140
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Wow.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.440
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: This so exciting.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.500
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Isn't it?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.030
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: I wish every kid

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.020
in this room could
come up to the stage

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.600
and see what I'm seeing.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.490
And I want to remind
every kid in this stage

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.510
that when you grow up,
you can do this too.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:54.540
[ Applause ]

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.500
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Well,
I'm just kerplump.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.990
But I am Carla Hayden,
the Library of Congress.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.480
Thanks.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.670
[ Applause ]

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.970
As you can imagine, Justice,
this is one of my favorite times

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.130
of the year to be
at the festival.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.470
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: this is amazing.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.560
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN:
And to have you.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.200
And I have a bio, I think
when they talk about a person

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.530
who needs no introduction,
you might be that person.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.020
But I would like to read just a
little bit, if you don't mind.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.320
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: I don't mind.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.620
CHP: How about it?

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.920
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: They might mind.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.390
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Well, Justice
Sotomayor is an associate

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.550
justice of the US Supreme Court
and she was born in the Bronx.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:54.330
Well. [Audience] She earned a
BA from Princeton University

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.060
and a JD -- oh, little
applause, little applause.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.910
And a JD from Yale Law school.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.460
And in 1991 President George
H. W. Bush nominated her

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.190
to the US District Court,
Southern District of New York.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.300
In 1997, President Bill Clinton
nominated her to the US Court

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.800
of Appeals for the
Second Circuit.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.030
And then President
Barrack Obama nominated her

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.830
to the Supreme Court.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:33.600
[ Applause ]

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.940
On May 26, 2009, and she was
confirmed on August the 8, 2009.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.510
Becoming the first
Latina on the high court.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:52.360
[ Applause ]

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.680
And she's a bestselling author.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.210
"My Beloved World,"
among others.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.720
However, Justice, you have
done something remarkable,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.280
a first for the book festival.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.580
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.030
And how many years has
this been going on now?

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.410
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: 18 years.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.950
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
That's a long time.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.010
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: In 18
years we've never had

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:22.650
on the main stage books that
were written for young people.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.790
But because of you and --

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.910
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
Carla, kids are powerful.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.880
They are.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.610
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I
know, but it took you

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.780
to get us on the main stage.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.160
And, so that really
intrigued me,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.230
because I'm a former
children's librarian and we know

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.560
about the power of books,
but what motivated you?

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.830
With all the things that you
could do and people asking you

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.790
to write other books,
why would you write

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.680
for young people, what was it?

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.780
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: Well, with respect

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.150
to the middle school
book, "The Beloved World

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.130
of Sonia Sotomayor," kids you're
going to meet my cousin Miriam.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.880
She's six months
younger than I am

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.000
and I tortured her always
telling her I was older.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.700
Now we're older and she tortures
me telling me I'm younger.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.570
But, she's a middle school
bilingual education teacher.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.250
And when I wrote my parent
book, "My Beloved World,"

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.950
she asked me immediately

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.990
to start writing a
middle school book.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.290
But, you know, I have a day job.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.150
And sometimes I'm very very busy
and it took me a number of years

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.960
to try to make the
time to write this.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.630
So, I decided to write
this, as I was thinking

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:02.540
about writing it I thought, "But
really, how about young readers,

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.410
this may not quite be
appropriate for them yet."

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.210
So, if I'm going to do
one I should do the other,

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.130
shouldn't i?

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.120
And then I thought,
"It's a real challenge,

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.640
how do I tell my story
to young readers in a way

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.750
that they can understand
in words,

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.550
but that they could
see as well?"

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.700
So, I thought about it and I
said, "Ah, an illustrated book."

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:39.910
And then I had the pure
fortuity to find an illustrator,

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:47.450
Lulu Delacre, who could
turn my story into pictures.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.110
And beautiful pictures.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.270
And, so, "Turning
Pages," was born.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:00.110
And that's me walking up the
steps of the Supreme Court.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.440
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: I
understand she's here.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.810
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
That's me with the high heels.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.070
Not today.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.270
But I have worn high heels.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.250
I like them.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.350
And there's a little
frog, the Coqui,

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.510
which is a symbol
of Puerto Rico.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:25.240
[ Applause ]

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.140
And in my hands there's a key.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.380
And that's what this
book is about,

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.720
the key to success in my life.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.340
It's the secret that I
want to share with kids.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.750
It tells and explains this
book how I became successful.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.390
And what's the answer -- I
could tell you to read the book.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.160
I hope you will anyway.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.190
But what I know is that I'm here

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:06.360
as a Supreme Court Justice
only because of books.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.510
Because reading books

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:16.040
[ Applause ]

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.210
Opened the world to me.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.990
So, that's what this is about.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.350
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And, Justice,
and I'm going to tell everybody,

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:28.800
I don't get to endorse books
much now or anything like that,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.800
but let's just say,
I love this book.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.520
I got an advance copy,
that's one of the perks.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.200
And I couldn't -- it
was just so evocative

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.110
of what the power
of reading can do.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.990
You started with
your grandmother

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.980
and I had a grandmother that
read to me or did words,

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.280
and tell us about that.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.460
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
Well, I'm going to start

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.820
by telling you that probably
the most important person

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.100
in my life was my
abuelita, my grandmother.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.590
When I started writing
my parent book,

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:10.960
it was because one day during
the confirmation process my

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.320
mother turned to me and
said, "Sonia, they forgotten

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.920
about Midseres [assumed
spelling].

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.710
That was my abuelita's name.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.580
And I said, "I know, mom,
because thankfully you're here

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.900
with me and you've been
so important in my life,

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.330
but I will find a way

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.420
that everybody will
know about abuelita."

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.560
And my way was to put
her into my adult book.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.190
So, I then created
this children's book

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:45.340
and I include a picture of her
at my high school graduation.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.080
And, so, that's my abuelita.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:56.130
And the first scene that
you see in "Turning Pages,"

00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.570
is me walking with her,
going on Saturday morning

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.930
to buy a chicken for
dinner Saturday night.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:10.340
So, she's very much a part
of this book, and in fact,

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:16.090
I dedicated this book to her, my
mother and the role model women

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:21.320
in my life, because they
have really set the stage

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.620
for who I became.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.340
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And
then you talked about --

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:29.320
sorry, but I know this
book by heart now.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:36.130
And librarians and teachers
and anyone that believes

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.180
in the power of books and
reading and literacy is going

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.700
to get so much, because you
talk about seeing yourself

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.950
or not seeing yourself in books.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:49.930
Books were a lifeline for you
and you need to see yourself.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.160
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
books, you know, most of us,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.740
not all of us, but most of
us, and especially those of us

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:01.110
who come from modest
backgrounds, we don't get

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.700
to see much of the world when
we're growing up as kids.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:10.430
We all -- anyway, tend to live
within a few blocks of our home.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.180
That's where we usually play,
most of our friends are there,

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.280
unless you live in big cities
like New York, and everybody has

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.620
to travel when they're
in New York.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:24.400
But for most people
your world is very small

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.100
or at least the world
that you inhabit.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.720
The bigger world is
something you have to explore

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.520
with time and age often.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.220
And, so, books give
you a chance to do

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:40.080
that in a way nothing else does.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.050
You see, television and
movies, and even the internet,

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.840
they present you with pictures,

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.230
but what they don't
let you do is imagine.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:57.580
The power of words is in
creating pictures in your mind

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:03.420
and when you can do that
without television or movies

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:07.180
or real pictures telling
you what you should imagine,

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.910
it can become more special.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:15.900
And, so, for me I explored the
world as a child through books

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.260
and I saw the possibilities
of things

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.690
that I never could have
imagined without reading.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:28.590
I could never have imagined
traveling to faraway places.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:32.860
And now I do it, but it
was that wish to do it,

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.350
that lust to meet other people
in the world, came from reading

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:42.290
about where other people
lived and wanting to see it.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.160
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: What
about the thinking

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.970
about a legal profession or law

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.240
and how reading helped
you get into that?

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.700
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: Well, mothers

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.950
and fathers are not
going to like this.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.250
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Uht oh.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.550
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: Look,

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.450
in my life there
were no lawyers.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:06.500
I grew up in a housing project,
which is a place where people

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.430
without resources,

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.740
the government helps
them find housing.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.730
And, so, there were no
lawyers in the projects.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.750
And there were no lawyers
anywhere in my life.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.680
And, so, I had no
opportunities to know

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.810
about really the law,
except in a bad way.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.900
A lot of my cousins and a lot

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.370
of people I knew got
arrested by the police.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:36.540
Andi knew they went to court
and it was very painful

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.330
for our families and friends.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:45.700
But that's not a good sort of
image of what law is all about.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.460
However, through television
I found a TV lawyer,

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.510
the first one, Perry Mason.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:13:00.630
[ Applause ]

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:05.960
And he showed me that
lawyers could help people.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:11.520
And, so, my first childhood
understanding of lawyers

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.760
and law was that
they help people.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:21.100
And that seemed like a really
good thing for me to do.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:25.260
But it took a lot longer,
my getting a little older,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.260
going to college and doing
other things to realize

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:35.910
that what law helps
people do is live together.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:40.520
You see, laws help our
relationships with one another.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:45.410
The laws tell us certain
limits of what we can do with

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.380
and to and for each other.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.900
Laws are not morality,
they're not right and wrong,

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.510
they are a way of
regulating our relationships

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.430
so we can manage our
competing interests.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:05.230
You know? When your
mother tells you,

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:10.170
"You can't borrow your
brother or sister's toys

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.630
without asking them
for permission."

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.460
That's the first seed of
teaching you what laws do.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.420
You can't steal other
people's property.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:25.580
You can't take that without
them saying it's okay.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:30.200
That is regulating
our competing interest

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.060
and telling us how we
can live better together.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.450
And I wanted to be
a part of that.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:42.850
I wanted to be a part or a voice
in how we live with each other.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:50.140
And that became my reality
by reading about what law did

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:54.470
and does and the good
it's done in society.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.600
You know, I was born
on May 25, 1954,

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.570
one month before a very
important Supreme Court case was

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.510
decided, Brown versus
Board of Education.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:12.040
[ Applause ]

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.220
We are sitting in this room,
one collection of people

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.060
of all races, of all
backgrounds, of all --

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.470
of both genders,
because of Brown.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:28.520
Before this our society
was segregated.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:33.050
And segregated right here
in the nation's capital.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.620
When I was born I have
friends who tell me stories

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:41.330
of traveling south to
Florida, getting on the train

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:46.030
and stopping in Washington
DC and having to go

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.790
into a segregated car.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:53.940
Brown changed my life and all
of our lives for the better.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:57.830
Now, there are some laws
that are not very good.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.620
They're not good because
you don't like them, right?

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.990
You can find one, I'm sure.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:09.490
But, laws are made by people

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.320
and we can change laws
that we don't like.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.490
And we can work hard to do that.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.820
[applause] The point is that
the law can't get it right all

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.580
of the time.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:27.660
Some very good laws are passed
and as society changes they have

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.520
to be amended or altered,

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.520
because they're not doing what
people thought they would do.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.730
And sometimes the society
sits back and says,

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.970
"There are some things that
are not constitutional,

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:45.470
like segregation and we
have to change that."

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:53.250
And, so, for me, books again
were the key to my deciding

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.980
to become what I am today.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:00.960
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Now, you also
though, liked comic books.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.800
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: Oh, yeah.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.610
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And you
wanted to be a superhero.

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:07.910
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: Oh, yeah.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.210
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: See,
that's in here too.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.510
And Nancy Drew.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:11.810

Can I show that picture?

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:13.110
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Oh, yeah,
show them that picture.

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:14.410
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: All right.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:15.710
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And Nancy Drew.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:19.500
Shout out to Nancy Drew.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.100
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: Hold on.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:29.150
That's me when I was
diagnosed with diabetes.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.510
Can I read that passage to them?

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:31.810
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Sure,

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.810
the beauty of the words
tell about this story.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.550
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
When I was 7 I got sick

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.650
and was diagnosed with diabetes.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:43.460
I was so afraid of the big
needle used to take my blood

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.420
for testing at the
hospital, that I ran outside

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.320
and hid under a parked car.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.620
That's me under the car.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.650
I would have to get shots
every day to stay alive.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.420
All those needles were scary.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:08.730
I found my courage in an
unlikely place, comic books.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.340
After reading stories
of regular people

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.110
who had secret super powers
that could save the world,

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:21.190
I imagined being as brave
and powerful as they were.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.510
Then I learned how to
give myself the shots

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.670
and in time I got used to it.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:32.030
Books that seemed were magic
potions that could fuel me

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.790
with the bravery of superheroes.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:39.510
So, me as Supergirl.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:47.360
[ Applause ]

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.670
Lulu did such an incredible
job on every scene,

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.790
but yes, even comic books.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:59.040
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And I think
that she's here, Lulu is here.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.340
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: Lulu DeLacre.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.140
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Oh,
would you please stand up.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:12.540
[ Applause ]

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.230
And for Nancy Drew fans,
you really were evocative

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:18.620
of Nancy Drew during them.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:19.920
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR: Now,

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.410
there were no annex
in my life back then.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.910
I lived in a project and then

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:27.540
in a big building
complex later in life.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.600
I've only lived in a house once.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:37.690
And that house creaked
all the time and it came

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:42.330
from the roof -- not the roof,
but the ceiling of the house

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:46.150
and I really thought that my
friend was keeping something --

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:49.360
someone prisoner in the attic.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.950
It took ages before I admitted
this to her and she took me

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:56.980
up there and said, "No, Sonia,
there's no people up there,

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.790
it's only because it's
a tin roof and it sounds

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:02.140
like there's footsteps
up there."

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.860
But Lulu put me in a staircase,

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.840
which was much more
familiar to me.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.320
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: She also
showed you being delighted

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.640
with the delivery of a
box of encyclopedias.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.940
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.580
The most beautiful
thing in the world.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.760
Now, the encyclopedias
today are online,

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.270
they're not selling
them as books anymore.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.520
And I actually know
there's some value sometimes

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.230
to online reading.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:33.140
Those encyclopedias,
if you click on them,

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.430
on something they're
describing, they do a sort

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.790
of 3D image and move it around.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.100
And that's pretty
interesting I think.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:47.110
And I kind of like it, but
I love the encyclopedias.

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:51.210
The things I could feel in
my hands and turn the pages.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:55.090
I actually believe that
if I read every book,

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:59.220
that I would be the
smartest person in the world.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:03.040
Well, it didn't quite work
that way, but I did try

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.640
to read every book and I
got through most of them.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.460
I didn't understand a
lot of them, but I tried.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:14.230
And they introduced me to things
that were very important later.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:18.470
When I got to college and I
was taking courses on things

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:23.170
that were new to me, I might
have read something about it

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.590
in an encyclopedia and it
made me feel a little more

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:30.830
comfortable that I could
learn more in college.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.130
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN:
Do you get a chance

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.130
to read anything
for pleasure now?

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.430
I know --

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.110
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: Hardly not.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:43.930
I get to a little bit,
so, I was in Canada

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.300
on vacation for a week.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:51.080
And -- some nice
Canadians in here, right?

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:56.480
Anyway, they told me that
the former Chief Justice

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:02.310
of the Canadian Supreme Court
had written a crime thriller.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.610
So, I read that.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:06.960
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: An escape.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.260
Still a story.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.800
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: it was an escape.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.100
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: When you,

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.940
also mentioned reading
about Puerto Rico.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.240
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: I did.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.550
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: But
not seeing people

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.440
that looked like you in books.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.970
I remember when I first
saw myself in a book

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.520
and what it meant to me.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.370
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
When I was little --

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:29.910
first of all, my family had come

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:36.600
from Puerto Rico during World
War II, I was born in 1954,

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.210
many of them, my father
and my grandmother and most

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:45.450
of my aunts included and uncles,
didn't yet speak English.

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.420
So, I didn't have guidance

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.650
on what I should be
reading in English.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:57.190
And because of that there may
have been books on biographies

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:01.510
or biographies, but it wasn't
something I was exposed to.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:06.190
And because of that I didn't
have the opportunity to read

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:09.580
about people who were like me.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:15.780
And I know now, because I
know there are so many books

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:20.060
about people from so many
different backgrounds for kids,

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.280
that they can see
themselves like you did.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:29.290
But we were a new migration
to the United States.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.410
Not new, because we've been
a part of the United States

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:35.990
since 1988, but coming over
in significant numbers,

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:40.130
Puerto Ricans didn't
start until the 1950s.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:44.980
And, so, as a result of that
there weren't a lot of books

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:50.350
about people like me with curly
hair and who spoke Spanish.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.030
Now there are.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.110
And you can meet one of them --

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.410
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: In this book.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:56.710
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: In my translation.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:58.510
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I have it --

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:02.730
[ Applause ]

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:04.570
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: "Pasando Paginas."

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.190
It's very important to me

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:10.510
that everything I write be
translated into Spanish.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:16.320

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.790
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And
published simultaneously.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.090
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR: Yes.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:23.570
Now the middle school book we're
a little behind, but I'm told

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:24.870
in a couple of months
we're going

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:26.170
to have the Spanish version.

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:27.470
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Right, yeah.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:29.970
But to have the picture book
come out in both languages

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:31.270
at the same time is important.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:32.570
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
Very important to me.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.270
I can give you a
secret, for those of you

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.820
who are teaching yourselves

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:39.590
or your kids Spanish,
buy both versions.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.930
They can read them side by side.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.620
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: You're
a librarian in hiding.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:48.920
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: Carla,

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.400
you know that I get very
tired of sitting down.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.700
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Well.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.000
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: Right, I know.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.820
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: We have a treat

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.950
and I had the wonderful
experience of being part

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:04.260
of your first book tour
when I was in Baltimore.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:10.920
And you said, "You know, I
get a little feisty and I want

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.750
to be out with people."

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:19.240
And the -- I guess I could
say, the security people

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:25.710
that accompany you kind of
blanch when she does that.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.680
But that's what she's
going to do.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.980
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
That's what I'm going to do.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.280
[inaudible]

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.580
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Because
we're going to start

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:32.880
with question and answers.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.180
And I forgot to say
that at the beginning,

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.720
because I was kind of excited.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.070
We have questions from the
audience that you have filled

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:45.280
out and I'm going to read them,
and, Justice, you wanted me

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.370
to ask and say the names.

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:53.270
Oh, and the first one is Maria,
who is a 9 year old girl.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.570
And where is Maria?

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:55.870
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR: Oh.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.760
Can I say one thing, Carla?

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.550
I will walk around.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.420
It's not fair to all
those people back there

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.860
that they can't see me.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:10.780
So, I'm going to go
say hello to people.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.890
You will see a lot of people

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:14.230
with little things
in their ears.

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.440
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: A lot.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.400
&gt;&gt; Justice Sonia
Sotomayor: A lot of them.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.830
They are here to
protect me from me.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:27.050
They don't like me doing
this, I do it anyway.

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:28.350
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: She does it.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:29.650
I've seen it.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:30.950
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR: But,

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.660
if you jump up unexpectedly,
they get scared.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:34.960
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN:
No, sudden moves.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.660
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
And if too many of you do it,

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.530
they'll pull me back
onto the stage.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:39.920
I don't want that.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.180
So, stay seated please.

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:46.940
But I'm going to walk and
whoever asks the question,

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.380
would you raise your hand.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.800
And if you're little jump up
and down or come to the middle

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.700
so we can see where
you are, okay?

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.590
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Okay, we're
going to start with Maria.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:02.300
Who's a 9 year old girl and
who wants to be president.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.100

[ Applause ]

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.340
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And Maria wants
to know, what is your advice

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.960
about what I should do now.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.260
Thank you, Maria Tarzere
[assumed spelling].

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.410
At 9 years old.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.070
So, Maria, where are you, Maria.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.430
There she is.

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:26.730
Oh.

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.220
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: Oh, this side.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.970
All right, I'm coming down.

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:32.440
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: I'm
going to stay here

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:36.210
and the Justice is
going to see you.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:40.970
Oh, Maria, you are so
smart to ask this now.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.760
At 9. Because that's --

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.060
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: Hola.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.370
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN:
It's never too early.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:47.670
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
will you give me a hug.

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:48.970
Thank you.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:50.270
Thank you.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.070
Look at those guys.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.670
Well, are you here --
who are you hear with?

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:00.970
&gt;&gt; Maria: My mom and dad.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.270
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:03.570
Can we go back there
so I can meet them?

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.870
All right, let's go take a walk.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:11.570
Now, Maria, I walk and talk.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:16.200
Thank you.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:20.580
I'm so proud of you
for having big dreams.

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:26.930
That is so important, because,
you see, if you don't dream big,

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.880
you can't become something big.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:34.760
You have to dream big to want
to work hard to get there.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.620
And you have to start
by studying,

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.750
because anything you want

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:44.780
to be requires hard
work and a lot of study.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:50.910
Nothing in life that you
do where you're successful,

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:54.290
can you do without hard work.

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:59.620
Even athletes, and a lot of
people think, "Oh, they just get

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.230
up and throw that basketball."

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.600
They don't do that.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.870
They practice and
practice and practice

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.360
until they get really good.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.490
That's their study, practicing.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:16.360
But they also have to
read about basketball,

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.540
they have to know how
to play it, so they have

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.830
to read all these
things that tell them,

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.740
how do I form this
line, how do I protect

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.980
against somebody
getting passed me.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.520
That's what it will
be like in your life.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:34.180
So you have to read a lot
about a lot of things.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:37.510
Especially if you're president,
because you have to know --

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:46.140
[ Applause ]

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:53.810
You tell me where your
mom and dad are, okay?

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:55.110
So, you know the
President not only has

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:57.750
to know American
history, he has to know --

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:01.520
all right, oh, you're here.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.420
Hello. I'm so proud of you.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.720

a pleasure to meet you.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.520
&gt;&gt; Anthony Tarzere:
Anthony Tarzere.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.820
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: Hello.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.850
Anyway, you have to -- he
has to know about the world,

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:20.160
he has to know about
politics, but he also has

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.730
to know about the economy.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.180
What? She.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.480
You're right, thank you.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.480
She has to know about
everything.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.340
But you know something, the
most interesting people I know

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.380
in the whole world
are curious people.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:46.300
&gt;&gt; Anthony Tarzere:
That is so true.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.600
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
People who want to learn

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.690
about things, just
because learning is fun.

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:57.110
Because, you see, the
people that are most anxious

00:30:57.110 --> 00:31:02.300
to learn are the people who
tend to do the most in life.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:07.510
So, that's my answer to
how you become president.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.870

SOTOMAYOR: You're welcome.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:20.720
Now, I'm not supposed to do
this and people are going

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.660
to tell me I'm very
forward for doing it,

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.040
but if you become president,

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.840
will you ask me to
be there, please?

wonderful, because I feel

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:53.670
like a talk show person,
because we have more advice.

The next question.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:56.270

female empowerment.

dad and is the son here?

&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: Which way?

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:47.650
Over here, okay.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:51.530
Gee, you don't have an
older sister, do you?

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:53.170
And if you do, she
didn't beat you

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:55.520
up enough when you were a kid.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.070
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Dad,
you're going to get advice.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:03.370
How can you help?

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:05.670
Does he have a sister?

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:12.460
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN:
There's the sister.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.760

SOTOMAYOR: All right.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.060
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Okay, good.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.870
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
You're the younger sister, huh?

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:23.290
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Maybe you need
to go straight to the Justice.

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:25.760
You can all help.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.070
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR: No,
I was just joking about that.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.270
Not a lot, because I spent
a lot of time beating

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:31.570
up my brother when
he was little.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.490
Daughter: Hi.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:34.790
Dad: My daughter.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:36.090
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: How are you?

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:37.390
Daughter: I'm good.

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:38.690
It's so good to meet you.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:39.990
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:45.230
Now, with my brother I
figured out at a certain point

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:49.780
when we were growing
into our teenage years

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:53.070
that he stayed little only
so long and he was going

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:56.540
to be bigger than me at some
point, that's when I went to him

00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:02.030
and said, "We have
to stop fighting.

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:06.500
We're too big to fight anymore,
we have to argue and we have

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:11.280
to show how our mind
can beat each other."

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.780
He's to this day he still
regrets he was waiting

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.710
to beat me up some day
and I stopped the game.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:24.340
It is hard, isn't
it, because there are

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:28.120
so many cultural influences.

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:33.040
Even when kids are small, about
what toys they should like,

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.930
you know, the boy toys
versus the girl toys.

00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:37.630
All of those things.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:43.580
But I think feminism rightly
defined is respect for women.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.380
And --

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:50.090
[ Applause ]

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:54.930
That requires your insistence.

00:34:54.930 --> 00:35:02.850
It requires making sure that
when women talk or men talk,

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:07.610
your child learns
how not to interrupt.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:15.640
It means, teaching him that
listening to people's ideas,

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:20.460
requiring letting them
talk those ideas out.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:25.610
It requires teaching him
by example and otherwise

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:29.010
that women do powerful things.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:31.510
And you can show him a
Supreme Court with three women.

I'm going to be chided for,

and I'm going to do it anyway,

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.030

It's about my friend
and I'm privileged

to call her my friend,
but she was an advocate

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:10.980
for women's rights.

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:16.420
And I don't know that any other
movie I have ever seen might

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:21.510
teach your son why equality
of women is so important.

now, one of you has to
get the picture to him,

Woops. Baltimore.

Justice, now, this question
is from a 4th grade teacher

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.280
and I think it's something
that all of us would

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.930
like to hear you talk about.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:45.630
When you have felt discouraged,

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:49.310
what has helped you power
through that feeling.

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:50.610
And this is a teacher.

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:55.590
Ms. Dorothy Cokalin [assumed
spelling], who's asking

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:57.060
for a 4th grade student.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:00.440
And teachers are so important
in terms of being able

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.430
to help outside in the home.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:03.730
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
So, who's that teacher?

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:05.030

this is the teacher.

don't you go and see --

Come on down with me

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:12.570
so I can keep walking
into the back.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:13.870
Thank you.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.370

care to ask for your students.

How about we take a
picture for your students.

You know, I think wrongly
now, but what I was thinking

about what i would
be when I grew up,

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:37.040
I didn't think I had the
patience to be a teacher.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:42.110
I still don't know if I
could have that patience.

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:50.590
which is the strength of our
country is in our teachers.

to every teacher whose
patience seems endless

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:17.470
and whose sacrifice on all
our behalves is so great.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:20.000
You're never paid enough

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.510
and you're never admired
enough, so thank you.

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:32.230
[ Applause ]

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:38.770
It took me a very very long time
to figure out that the best way

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:43.770
for me to become less
discouraged was to talk

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:46.810
to people about how I felt.

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:52.960
You know, for a lot of my
life I would have self-doubt,

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.670
I would be afraid,
I would be sort

00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:00.660
of anxiety ridden
about something.

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:06.610
And I would try to power
through it and almost ignore it.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:10.630
And it really eats you up.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:14.710
It's like your stomach's
constantly churning.

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:19.410
And in the end, when
you're discouraged,

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:22.380
you can't find the
good in things,

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.830
because you're discouraged.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:29.540
And, so, it took me a long
time to realize I have

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:33.580
to share what I'm
feeling with other people.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:38.310
Now, that's not so easy,
because sometimes you look

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:42.300
at your parents and they may
be unhappy about something

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:46.050
and you don't want to make
them more unhappy, right?

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.020
So, maybe they're
not the best person

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.980
to share it with at that moment.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.670
Although I learned and it
took me a long, long, long,

00:40:54.670 --> 00:41:00.370
long time in my life that when
I share things with my mom,

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:04.280
she made such a big
difference in helping me deal

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.350
with what I was dealing.

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:11.860
But, if that doesn't
or can't work for you,

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:15.350
there's always a teacher.

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:18.880
Sometimes there's the
parent of a neighbor or one

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:25.380
of your best friends, sometimes
it's someone in your Sunday

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:29.290
or Saturday school
religious experience.

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:32.920
And sometimes it's
just another friend.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.720
And if you're a good
friend and somebody comes

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:39.130
to you who's a friend and
says, "I'm in trouble,

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:42.800
you have to help them find
an adult to help you."

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.490
That's what being a good
friend is when you're little.

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:52.330
But, in the end, I think it's
important for every child

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:56.310
to know that they're not alone.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:42:00.580
That what they feel are things
that other children have felt,

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:05.230
even children like
me when I was little.

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:09.550
And, so, to me, that's
the first lesson.

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:13.130
Learn how to share
what's bothering you.

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:14.430
Good luck to you.

part of that question?

or books have been
important to you?

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:21.760

Well, you're going to have

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.890
to read the children's
book, because everything

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:30.170
in that tells you about a
book that was important to me

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:32.550
in a different stage in my life.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:38.640
And even now I read
book that always --

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.660
every book brings you
a different insight,

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.920
they bring you a different
way of looking at things.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.150
I find virtually,
I can't say all,

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:51.910
but a lot of books
do that for me.

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:53.440
That's why I read.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.300
So, I learned a lot about
the Canadian legal system

00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:00.260
from that thriller, you know.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.220
More than I knew,
because I knew a lot

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:06.000
about their appellate practice,
because that's what I do now,

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.270
but I didn't know that much
about their trial practice

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:12.360
and how similar it was to ours.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:20.490
But, the next children's book is
about kids with life challenges.

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:26.070
And it starts with me as a
little girl being diagnosed --

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:32.530
and is aid, I'm a diabetic,
that's why I took that shot.

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:36.100
You shouldn't assume
bad things about people.

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:42.630
And the working title,

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:47.860
it may have another title before
we finish, is "Just Facts."

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:54.050
I want people to know that
kids who are look different

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:57.660
or may be doing things
in a different way,

00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:05.200
that they're not strange,
they're just like you and me

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:09.860
and they have a condition that
they have to take medicine for

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:14.020
or accommodate for,
but they're just

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:17.220
as important as anybody else.

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:22.360
And that difference
enriches our lives.

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:26.890
So, I have kids who are blind
and I have kids in wheelchairs,

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:30.750
I have kids with attention
deficit and Tourette syndrome

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:35.070
and downs syndrome, and
each of them has a vignette

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:39.220
where they describe their
condition and they describe how

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.260
that condition has
made them stronger.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:48.760
And it's set in a garden, and
in that garden scene I point

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:56.870
out to kids, some trees
need shade, some need life.

00:45:56.870 --> 00:46:04.820
Some plants need water, and
some plants need very little.

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:08.390
And yet together
all of those plants

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:12.250
and trees create a
beautiful garden.

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:17.110
And together all of us who are
different create a better world.

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:18.410
Thank you.

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:24.130

maintain your hopeful outlook

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:53.800
in these challenging times?

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:57.870
You rock.

00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:00.610

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:04.850
who's this three part question?

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:09.180

that and wrote, "You rock."

Nobody's going to own up to it?

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.850

there, this is three parts.

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:14.640
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA
SOTOMAYOR: Oh, okay.

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:22.220
We don't have a choice, do we?

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:31.340
We don't. We have to
make the world better.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:34.440
I started by saying to
you, "We're not bystanders

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.780
in life, we can't be."

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:40.240
We can't let things
happen to us.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.560
Our responsibility is to
be make a better world.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.790
And when the time gets tough,

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:50.390
that's when the tough
have to stand up.

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:55.020
That's when we have to
get up and do something.

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:59.770
And that's the whole mission of
my being a Supreme Court Justice

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:03.930
and why I go speaking to
audiences all the time.

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:07.210
I believe in civic
participation.

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:17.410
And I believe that
that's a job not just

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:20.700
for people interested
in politics.

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:25.970
It's a job for every person
who wants to live in the kind

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:30.170
of world that they think
is a fair and just world.

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:37.340
And, so, for me when it gets
hard, I know I have a job to do.

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:40.500
It's your job and my job.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.190
I can do mine this way,
because I'm a Justice

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:45.640
and I can't get involved
in politics.

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.120
But you can.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.510

Kelly Tansy wants to know,

our last question, and there
are more questions about advice,

00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:20.890
but there's the last
one, Kelly Tansy,

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:24.250
"What is your biggest
piece of advice

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:27.800

would you give to women

We can become anything we want

to through hard work,
getting yourself educated

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:15.590
and as I said before, practice.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:20.150
But there's a lot of naysayers
who will pop up in your world.

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.020
People who will tell you,

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.650
"You're a woman,
you can't do that."

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:28.390
Or you can't do that
because -- are you Latina?

No. You look very
Mediterranean, you do.

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:37.370
But they'll tell you you can't
do it because you're black.

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:41.020
People told me I couldn't
do it because I'm Latina.

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:43.570
You know, there was some writers
who said when I was nominated

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:48.140
for the Supreme Court,
you're not smart enough.

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:50.580
Those things hurt.

When people show a lack
of confidence in you,

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:59.370
it sometimes scares you away
from trying, but you can't.

know how strong you can be,

and you know how
hard you can work.

people who say that to you

and the stories I would
choose from the stacks.

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:21.320
The library was my harbor
and books were little boats

the sadness at home.

00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:35.630
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Yes.

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:36.930
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:

00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:39.910
My library card is
stuck in the boat.

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:42.480
Lulu did research
and found an example

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.250
with the library card
I had as a child.

00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:46.770
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: She
has a library card

00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:50.400
and it's interesting because
in this illustration --

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.820
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
And I assume every child

00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:54.410
in this room has a library card.

00:54:56.770 --> 00:55:02.960
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: In this
illustration the dark colors

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:09.450
represent a time in your life
when you were 9 years old.

00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:17.480
And you felt sad and confused
and you needed to find a place

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.850
where you could find comfort.

00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:24.250
And that was the library
and that was the harbor.

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:27.880
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
And that's still a place.

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:32.540
Not just with quiet, but
with a sense of peace,

00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:39.510
because there you have the key I
found to life, the key of books.

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:57.040
[ Applause ]

00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.640
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And for book
lovers everywhere, you said,

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.420
"Books were my loyal
friends, they made it

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:06.330
so I never felt lonely."

00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:13.700
And, Justice, thank you
for -- for everything.

00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:17.510
For sharing your
journey with us.

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:58.040
[ Applause and Inaudible
Talking ]

00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:01.620
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Well,
I think that we have --

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:09.100
had truly an honor and a living
testament to the power of words

00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:10.400
and books and reading.

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:14.510
Thank all of you for
waiting and being here.

00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:22.440
[ Applause ]

00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.430
Did you want to say
anything at the end?

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:26.820
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
Thank you, everybody.

00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:28.120
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Brava.

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:38.950
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
Thank you, seriously, thank you.

00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:40.250
Thank you.

00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:41.550
Thank you.

00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:42.870
Thank you all, thank you.
