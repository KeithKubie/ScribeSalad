00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.370
We've been doing a
bunch of these videos

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.380
with these convex lenses
where we drew parallel rays

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.430
and rays that go
through the focal point

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.552
to figure out what the
image of an object might be.

00:00:11.552 --> 00:00:13.010
But what I want to
do in this video

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.570
is actually come up with
an algebraic relationship

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.620
between the distance of the
object from the convex lens,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.900
the distance of the image
from the convex lens

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.479
usually on the other side
and the focal length.

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:30.770
So let's see if we can do this.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.500
And just to save you
the pain of having

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.570
to watch me draw straight lines,
I drew this ahead of time.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.690
And so we can imagine this green
thing right here is the object.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.610
This is the object, and
these two little pink points

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.340
right here are the focal points.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.640
They're a focal length away.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.900
And I did what we always drew.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.950
I drew one parallel ray
from the tip of that arrow

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.960
to the actual convex lens,
and then it gets refracted,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.520
so it goes through the focal
point on the right-hand side

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.420
and goes all the way over there.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.210
And then I drew a ray that
goes through the focal point

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.570
on the left-hand side.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.970
And then when it gets
refracted, it becomes parallel.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.610
And then it actually intersects
with that previous ray

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.890
right over here.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.690
And so this gives us a sense of
what the image will look like.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.440
It's inverted.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.150
It's real.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.281
In this case, it is larger
than the actual object.

00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:28.280
What I want to do is come
up with a relationship

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.230
with these values.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.190
So let's see if we
can label them here.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.940
And then, just do a
little bit of geometry

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.860
and a little bit of
algebra to figure out

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.820
if there is an algebraic
relationship right here.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.890
So the first
number, the distance

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.439
of the object-- that's this
distance from here to here,

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.730
or we could just label it here.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.800
Since this is
already drawn for us,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.920
this is the distance
of the object.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.620
This is the way we drew it.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.330
This was the parallel light ray.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.420
But before it got refracted,
it traveled the distance

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.480
from the object to
the actual lens.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.740
Now, the distance from the
image to the lens, that's

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.720
this right over here.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.860
This is how far this parallel
light ray had to travel.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.980
So this is the distance
from the image to the lens.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.860
And then we have the focal
distance, the focal length.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.270
And that's just this
distance right here.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.390
This right here is
our focal length.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.240
Or, we could view it
on this side as well.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.760
This right here is
also our focal length.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.200
So I want to come up
with some relationship.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.220
And to do that, I'm going
to draw some triangles here.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.035
So what we can do is--
and the whole strategy--

00:02:38.035 --> 00:02:40.090
I'm going to keep looking
for similar triangles,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.870
and then try to see if
I can find relationship,

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.230
or ratios, that relate these
three things to each other.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.000
So let me find some
similar triangles.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.120
So the best thing I
could think of to do

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.020
is let me redraw this
triangle over here.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.830
Let me just flip it over.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.290
Let me just draw
the same triangle

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.960
on the right-hand
side of this diagram.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.330
So this.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.140
So if I were to draw
the same triangle,

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.355
it would look like this.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.510
And let me just be clear,
this is this triangle right

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.200
over here.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.440
I just flipped it over.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.270
And so if we want
to make sure we're

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.970
keeping track of the same
sides, if this length right here

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.870
is d sub 0, or d
naught sometimes we

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.290
could call it, or d0,
whatever you want to call it,

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:37.040
then this length up here
is also going to be d0.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.602
And the reason why
I want to do that

00:03:38.602 --> 00:03:40.560
is because now we can do
something interesting.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.010
We can relate this triangle
up here to this triangle

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.830
down here.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.240
And actually, we can see that
they're going to be similar.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.170
And then we can get
some ratios of sides.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.000
And then what we're
going to do is

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.666
try to show that this
triangle over here

00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:53.720
is similar to this
triangle over here,

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.307
get a couple of more ratios.

00:03:55.307 --> 00:03:57.640
And then we might be able to
relate all of these things.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.640
So the first thing we
have to prove to ourselves

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.140
is that those triangles
really are similar.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.000
So the first thing to
realize, this angle right

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.780
here is definitely
the same thing

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.080
as that angle right over there.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.746
They're sometimes
called opposite angles

00:04:09.746 --> 00:04:10.590
or vertical angles.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.310
They're on the opposite side
of lines that are intersecting.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.870
So they're going to be equal.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.329
Now, the next thing-- and
this comes out of the fact

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.920
that both of these lines--
this line is parallel

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.040
to that line right over there.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.502
And I guess you could call
it alternate interior angles,

00:04:27.502 --> 00:04:29.710
if you look at the angles
game, or the parallel lines

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.317
or the transversal of
parallel lines from geometry.

00:04:32.317 --> 00:04:33.900
We know that this
angle, since they're

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.590
alternate interior
angles, this angle

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.572
is going to be the same
value as this angle.

00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:43.030
You could view this
line right here

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.340
as a transversal of
two parallel lines.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.480
These are alternate
interior angles,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.470
so they will be the same.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.090
Now, we can make that
exact same argument

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.720
for this angle and this angle.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.710
And so what we see is
this triangle up here

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.510
has the same three angles
as this triangle down here.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.320
So these two
triangles are similar.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.770
These are both-- Is really
more of a review of geometry

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:11.480
than optics.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.100
These are similar triangles.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.740
Similar-- I don't have
to write triangles.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.110
They're similar.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.330
And because they're similar, the
ratios of corresponding sides

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.150
are going to be the same.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.470
So d0 corresponds to this.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.420
They're both opposite
this pink angle.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.530
They're both opposite
that pink angle.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.250
So the ratio of d0 to d1--
let me write this over here.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.050
So the ratio of d0.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.840
Let me write this a
little bit neater.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.765
The ratio of d0 to d1.

00:05:41.765 --> 00:05:43.640
So this is the ratio of
corresponding sides--

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.250
is going to be the same thing.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.230
And let me make
some labels here.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.370
That's going to be the same
thing as the ratio of this side

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.960
right over here.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.050
This side right
over here, I'll call

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:00.942
that A. It's opposite this
magenta angle right over here.

00:06:00.942 --> 00:06:03.400
That's going to be the same
thing as the ratio of that side

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.095
to this side over
here, to side B.

00:06:06.095 --> 00:06:07.720
And once again, we
can keep track of it

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.770
because side B is
opposite the magenta

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.900
angle on this bottom triangle.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.250
So that's how we know that this
side, it's corresponding side

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.000
in the other similar
triangle is that one.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.050
They're both opposite
the magenta angles.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:27.584
So we know d0 is to d1 as
A is to B. As A is to B.

00:06:27.584 --> 00:06:28.500
So that's interesting.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.180
We've been able to
relate these two

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.550
things to these kind of
two arbitrarily lengths.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.720
But we need to somehow connect
those to the focal length.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.480
And to connect them to
a focal length, what

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.386
we might want to do
is relate A and B.

00:06:42.386 --> 00:06:45.050
A sits on the same triangle
as the focal length

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.750
right over here.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.490
So let's look at this
triangle right over here.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:49.910
Let me put in a better color.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.980
So let's look at this
triangle right over here

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.980
that I'm highlighting in green.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.850
This triangle in green.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.610
And let's look at that in
comparison to this triangle

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.440
that I'm also highlighting.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.695
This triangle that I'm
also highlighting in green.

00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:06.320
Now, the first thing
I want to show you

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.790
is that these are also
similar triangles.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.520
This angle right over
here and this angle

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.470
are going to be the same.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.900
They are opposite angles
of intersecting lines.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.290
And then, we can make
a similar argument--

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.600
alternate interior angles.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.930
Well, there's a couple
arguments we could make.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.480
One, you can see that this is
a right angle right over here.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.910
This is a right angle.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.670
If two angles of two
triangles are the same,

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.390
the third angle also
has to be the same.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.520
So we could also say
that this thing-- let

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.690
me do this in another
color because I don't want

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.630
to be repetitive too
much with the colors.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.350
We can say that
this thing is going

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.467
to be the same
thing as this thing.

00:07:41.467 --> 00:07:43.050
Or another way you
could have said it,

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.610
is you could have said, well,
this line over here, which

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.550
is kind of represented
by the lens,

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.452
or the lens-- the
line that is parallel

00:07:50.452 --> 00:07:51.910
to the lens or
right along the lens

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.170
is parallel to kind of the
object right over there.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.670
And then you could make the
same alternate interior argument

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.110
there.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.560
But the other thing
is just, look.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.540
I have two triangles.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.790
Two of the angles in those
two triangles are the same,

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.020
so the third angle
has to be the same.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.500
Now, since all three
angles are the same,

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.360
these are also both
similar triangles.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.180
So we can do a similar thing.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.260
We can say A is to B.
Remember, both A and B

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.740
are opposite the 90-degree side.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.700
They're both the hypotenuse
of the similar triangle.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:25.255
So A is to B as-- we could say
this base length right here.

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:26.850
And it got overwritten
a little bit.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.310
But this base length
right over here is f.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.730
That's our focal length.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.630
As f in this triangle is
related to this length

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.250
on this triangle.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.470
They are both opposite
that white angle.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.000
So as f is to this
length right over here.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.350
Now, what is this length?

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.877
So this whole distance is
di, all the way over here.

00:08:47.877 --> 00:08:49.460
But this length is
that whole distance

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.220
minus the focal length.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.680
So this is di minus
the focal length.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:01.106
So A is to B as f is to
di minus the focal length.

00:09:01.106 --> 00:09:02.980
And there you have it,
we have a relationship

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.220
between the distance
of the object,

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.280
the distance of the image,
and the focal length.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.670
And now we just have to do
a little bit of algebra.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.795
If this is equal to this
and this is equal to that,

00:09:10.795 --> 00:09:13.774
then this blue thing has to be
equal to this magenta thing.

00:09:13.774 --> 00:09:15.440
And now we just have
to do some algebra.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.540
So let's do that.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:22.290
So we got d naught, or d0
I guess we'd call it, to di

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.990
is equal to the ratio
of the focal length

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.440
to the difference of
the image distance

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.290
to the-- the focal
length to the image

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.220
distance minus the focal length.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.180
And now here, we just
have to do some algebra.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.140
So let's-- just to simplify
this, let's cross multiply it.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:46.460
So if we multiply d0 times this
thing over here, we get d0 di.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:52.110
I'm really just
distributing it, minus d0 f.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.570
I'm just distributing this
d0, just cross multiplying,

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.710
which is really just the
same thing as multiplying

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.862
both sides by both
denominators, or multiplying

00:10:00.862 --> 00:10:01.820
the denominators twice.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.120
Either way, that's all
cross multiplying is.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:10.990
That is going to be
equal to di times f.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.400
And now, we can add this
term right over here

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.860
to both sides of this equation.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.820
I'm just going to switch
to a neutral color.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.830
So we get d0 di is
equal to-- I'm just

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:24.960
adding this to both sides.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.418
When you add it to the left
side, it obviously cancels out.

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:33.477
Is equal to di f, this
thing over here, plus d0 f.

00:10:33.477 --> 00:10:34.310
And then, let's see.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.480
We could factor out
an f, a focal length.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:46.510
So we get d0 di is equal
to f times di plus d0.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:47.970
And then, what can we do?

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.630
We could divide both sides by f.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.740
So this will become over f.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.580
This becomes over f.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.940
Essentially, canceling it out.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.315
And then, I just don't want
to skip too many steps,

00:11:03.315 --> 00:11:05.910
so let me just rewrite
what we have here.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.090
So these cancel out.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:16.140
So we have d0 di over f
is equal to di plus d0.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.320
And now, let's divide
both sides by d0 di.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.190
So 1 over d0 di.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.020
Divide this side by d0 di.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.860
It cancels out over here.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.060
And so we are left with,
on the left-hand side,

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.742
1 over the focal length is
equal to this thing over here.

00:11:33.742 --> 00:11:35.200
And we can separate
this thing out.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.682
This thing over here,
this is the same thing--

00:11:37.682 --> 00:11:39.140
we just separate
out the numerator.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:47.235
Is the same thing as di over
d0 di plus d0 over d0 di.

00:11:47.235 --> 00:11:49.820
But di over d0 di,
the di's cancel out.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.970
We just have a 1.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:52.300
Here, the d0's cancel out.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.460
You just have a 1.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.550
So this is equal to 1 over
the distance of the object.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:02.417
And this is plus 1 over
the distance the image.

00:12:02.417 --> 00:12:05.000
So right from the get-go, this
was a completely valid formula.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.850
We actually had
achieved what we wanted.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.920
But this is a neater formula.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.740
You don't have the di's
repeat and the f repeated.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.000
Right here, we have an
algebraic relationship

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.840
for a convex mirror that
relates the focal length

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:22.410
to the distance of the object
and the distance of the image.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.730
Anyway, I think that's
pretty neat how it came out

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.810
to be at least a
pretty clean formula.
