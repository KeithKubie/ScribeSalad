hierarchy of needs stopped with

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259
hierarchy of needs stopped with
 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.570
hierarchy of needs stopped with
self-actualization and that's not

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580
self-actualization and that's not
 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.380
self-actualization and that's not
actually true he had another piece that

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390
actually true he had another piece that
 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.170
actually true he had another piece that
was on top of self-actualization and

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
was on top of self-actualization and
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.050
was on top of self-actualization and
that was self transcendence he just

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060
that was self transcendence he just
 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.060
that was self transcendence he just
didn't publish it widely before he

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
didn't publish it widely before he
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.429
didn't publish it widely before he
passed away it was something he started

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439
passed away it was something he started
 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.259
passed away it was something he started
working on towards the end and so he

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
working on towards the end and so he
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.959
working on towards the end and so he
published the hierarchy of needs before

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969
published the hierarchy of needs before
 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.940
published the hierarchy of needs before
he finished his work on self

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
he finished his work on self
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.160
he finished his work on self
transcendence he was one of the first

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170
transcendence he was one of the first
 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.250

find the terminology really similar to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850
find the terminology really similar to
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.209
find the terminology really similar to

advanced meditators described and so he

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
advanced meditators described and so he
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.709
advanced meditators described and so he
was working on self transcendence and he

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719
was working on self transcendence and he
 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.060
was working on self transcendence and he
just did it publish it so there's

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070
just did it publish it so there's
 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.490
just did it publish it so there's
actually another level on top of that

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
actually another level on top of that
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.300
actually another level on top of that
hierarchy of needs and so when I think

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
hierarchy of needs and so when I think
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.490
hierarchy of needs and so when I think
of human psychology

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500
of human psychology
 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.550
of human psychology
I really think of human psychology as a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
I really think of human psychology as a
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.690
I really think of human psychology as a
spectrum and it's not a it's not a

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700
spectrum and it's not a it's not a
 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.149
spectrum and it's not a it's not a
series of of islands or unique locations

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159
series of of islands or unique locations
 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.100
series of of islands or unique locations
it's really sort of a spectrum and on

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
it's really sort of a spectrum and on
 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.280
it's really sort of a spectrum and on
one end you have what I call areas that

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290
one end you have what I call areas that
 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.010
one end you have what I call areas that
require human support so these are this

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020
require human support so these are this
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.020
require human support so these are this
is when people are facing you know

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030
is when people are facing you know
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.030
is when people are facing you know
severe stress severe anxiety and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
severe stress severe anxiety and
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.460
severe stress severe anxiety and
depression and then in the middle is

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
depression and then in the middle is
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.850
depression and then in the middle is
what I call the human condition and so

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860
what I call the human condition and so
 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.510
what I call the human condition and so
that is loneliness happiness connection

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520
that is loneliness happiness connection
 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.240
that is loneliness happiness connection
empathy the human condition is where we

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250
empathy the human condition is where we
 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.310
empathy the human condition is where we
learn how to deal with our first

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
learn how to deal with our first
 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.620
learn how to deal with our first
heartbreak and the first time that we

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630
heartbreak and the first time that we
 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.050
heartbreak and the first time that we
fall in love the human condition is

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060
fall in love the human condition is
 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.870
fall in love the human condition is
where we deal with sadness and betrayal

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880
where we deal with sadness and betrayal
 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.990
where we deal with sadness and betrayal
and loss basically all the things that

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000
and loss basically all the things that
 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.300
and loss basically all the things that
happen to you as you grow up through

life the full spectrum of human emotion

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829
life the full spectrum of human emotion
 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.420
life the full spectrum of human emotion
that is the human condition and there's

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430
that is the human condition and there's
 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.610
that is the human condition and there's
a you know there's a

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620
a you know there's a
 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.890
a you know there's a
infinite number of songs on the radio

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900
infinite number of songs on the radio
 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.039
infinite number of songs on the radio
and poems and art that's about the human

and poems and art that's about the human
 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.979
and poems and art that's about the human
condition so that's there and then on

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989
condition so that's there and then on
 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.690
condition so that's there and then on
this other side which I think really

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700
this other side which I think really
 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.530
this other side which I think really
maps to self transcendence and Maslow's

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540
maps to self transcendence and Maslow's
 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.759
maps to self transcendence and Maslow's
later work is the part of the people in

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769
later work is the part of the people in
 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.649
later work is the part of the people in
the world who are really pushing on

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659
the world who are really pushing on
 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.280
the world who are really pushing on
human psychology and what are the limits

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290
human psychology and what are the limits
 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.460
human psychology and what are the limits
where are our boundaries what is the

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470
where are our boundaries what is the
 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.979
where are our boundaries what is the
frontier of human psychology and I think

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989
frontier of human psychology and I think
 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.619
frontier of human psychology and I think
a lot of direction that we get is from

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629
a lot of direction that we get is from
 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.160
a lot of direction that we get is from
the contemplative communities around the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170
the contemplative communities around the
 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.990
the contemplative communities around the
world who really have been exploring and

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000
world who really have been exploring and
 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.539
world who really have been exploring and
pushing on human psychology for as long

pushing on human psychology for as long
as humans have been organized and and in

as humans have been organized and and in
 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.180
as humans have been organized and and in
pushing on what it is what does it mean

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190
pushing on what it is what does it mean
 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.640

you one could say are limited to the few

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359
you one could say are limited to the few
 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.440
you one could say are limited to the few
but with the advent of things like

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450
but with the advent of things like
 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.020
but with the advent of things like
transformative technology there is the

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030
transformative technology there is the
 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.379
transformative technology there is the
ability the possibility the potentiality

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389
ability the possibility the potentiality
 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:50.319
ability the possibility the potentiality
of these extraordinary States abilities

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329
of these extraordinary States abilities
 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.300
of these extraordinary States abilities
and conditions to be available to a much

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310
and conditions to be available to a much
 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.390
and conditions to be available to a much
wider group of people and the reason why

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400
wider group of people and the reason why
 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.569
wider group of people and the reason why
I think it's relevant is you know what

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579
I think it's relevant is you know what
 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.849
I think it's relevant is you know what
would make it significant relevant and

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859
would make it significant relevant and
 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:06.069
would make it significant relevant and
actionable is that is that when I think

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079
actionable is that is that when I think
 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.729
actionable is that is that when I think
about the world today and the challenges

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739
about the world today and the challenges
 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.360
about the world today and the challenges
facing mankind I don't think the

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370
facing mankind I don't think the
 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.729
facing mankind I don't think the
problems are technical I think they're

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739
problems are technical I think they're
 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.240

away with the feeling that the the
 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.210
away with the feeling that the the
problems are technical we always figure

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220
problems are technical we always figure

problems are technical we always figure
it out we got a man on the moon and we

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240
it out we got a man on the moon and we
 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.409
it out we got a man on the moon and we
have alternative energy and there's so

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419
have alternative energy and there's so
 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.360
have alternative energy and there's so
many other things that are happening so

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370
many other things that are happening so
 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.630
