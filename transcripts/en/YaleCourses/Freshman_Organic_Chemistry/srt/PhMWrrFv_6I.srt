1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,590
So you remember this,
a slide from several lectures ago.

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,450
What are they trying to make?

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:10,840
Yeah.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,470
Remember what the point
of this synthesis was?

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,120
This particular reaction,

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,780
the idea was to do a catalytic reaction
with something that was chiral as the

7
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:25,810
catalyst to do an oxidation on sulfur,

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,560
to make a single
enantiomers of a map result.

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,620
And remember the idea
was that the product,

10
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:36,490
after you've gone through these three
steps that we showed you before,

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,580
that the product then comes
back and is the catalyst again,

12
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:43,150
and you can do another cycle.
So in fact,

13
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:45,370
there's this thing
called a catalytic cycle.

14
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:51,130
So that what comes in is
a peroxide and disulfide,

15
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,370
and what comes out is an alk oxide
and the product that you want,

16
00:00:56,891 --> 00:01:01,120
the oxidized product where an oxygen
has been added to that unshared pair,

17
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:02,170
that high homo.

18
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,150
And so the idea of the
chiral oxidizing agent was,

19
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:09,790
so you'd get a single in
anti more of the product.

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,590
But do you remember what happened?
Right. It gave her a simic material.

21
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:17,590
So what did they,
do you remember?

22
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,820
Pardon me?
Yeah.

23
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:27,010
Ethyl [inaudible] mean they added the,
these uh,

24
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,100
researchers I added in 2000 and they found
out that that gave a 94% in anti more

25
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:36,250
excess,
but for no obvious reason.

26
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,810
Now it would be great if we knew
what the reason for this was.

27
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,620
And it turned out that in fact this kind
of oxidative catalytic reaction to be

28
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:52,660
stereo specific to give a singly Nancy
or was the source of the Nobel Prize in

29
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:56,290
2001.
And if we click on this thing here,

30
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,090
we can see,

31
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,123
uh,

32
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,000
should see. Yeah, there we go.

33
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,620
So this is the Nobel website
and you can see that uh,

34
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:14,650
k Barry Sharpless here got the Nobel
prize in 2001 for his work on Kylie

35
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,990
catalyzed oxidation reactions.
So exactly this reaction.

36
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,320
So if anyone can tell us how,
uh,

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,360
how Ethel dice of purple of mean
does its trick, who should it be?

38
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,790
Barry Sharpless.
Right.

39
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,720
Okay, good. We can put this over here.

40
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,400
Y'All need this.
Put this in your pocket.

41
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,570
Clip this on your tie

42
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,070
there. We're all set. Thanks Mike.

43
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,310
I'd do anything for my friend Mike
because he saved me from publishing errors

44
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,630
in Jackson at least once.

45
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:05,740
And I just saved a lot of us who were
willing to listen to him because he's got

46
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:08,070
a genius for seeing flaws in,

47
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:10,910
in the beautiful stories
that people tell us.

48
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,200
And then they realized that
there beautiful stories
are going to be too slick,

49
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:19,090
usually in nature, doesn't like
things to be too slick. I, well,

50
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,600
I'm going to just use in, I think the
next slide you should be, let's see.

51
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,720
We need to go with this
first meeting to do this.

52
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,623
Is that,
is that it?

53
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,280
Oh, you want to get out to go back
through? Oh, you have that? Yeah. Okay.

54
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,750
There we go. Okay, great.

55
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,240
Well this is something which we
are possibly manipulate in utero.

56
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,280
I always,

57
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:47,970
it's interesting because many things
in our body like park can be on left or

58
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:50,660
right and uh,
it beer Emmy,

59
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,050
I assume that means they're mirror images
related then. But this, this is a vein,

60
00:03:55,051 --> 00:04:00,051
two arteries that has the sheets on it
and it's the umbilical cord of a mammal

61
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,360
and it's got an ice screw access.

62
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:06,150
You know how we like to hold our
hand down a screw axis and uh,

63
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,660
and then I have another reasons why
I think that, that I handled it.

64
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:13,920
And then they take it away from you at
birth. They cut it and they take it away,

65
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,510
becomes the narcissistic
leak detected objects.

66
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,030
And that means you're in trouble
because you can't ever heal that wound.

67
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,000
You want to get back, but you can't heal
it. You needed that mirror, that boom,

68
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,150
boom, we're back there
when you were born. Anyway.

69
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:30,720
That's why I went crazy trying
to do asymmetrics synthesis. And

70
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,260
now you're a chemist, you know, you,
you, unless you're in deep space,

71
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,240
I don't know if they have
any carbon atoms out there,

72
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:42,810
but you've gotta be in a very high
vacuum to get them. But that's,

73
00:04:42,811 --> 00:04:45,030
this is the way we make organic compounds,
right?

74
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,930
But we don't really do it this way because
we have to live in and convince phase

75
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:53,100
of the earth. So these are too high, but
you put them together, this is a point,

76
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,340
then you get aligned.
It's probably acetylene really.

77
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,740
But let me give me a poetic license of
just having it be a line and I'll take

78
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:05,310
one unit out.
And now if I add things across that line,

79
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,590
I get into the plane, uh, a and
B or I can add him CIS or trans.

80
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:11,461
In a sense,

81
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:15,330
you can make anything this way almost
if you could do it by just surgically

82
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:16,164
adding things.

83
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:21,350
Now we're in the plane and now the job
in the plane and I've actually drawn a

84
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:27,480
trans,
they substituted to beauty and I,

85
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,290
it has a shape like this, right?

86
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,190
It has a methyl group here, methyl
group here, and then hydrogen.

87
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:37,620
So there's open space in these quadrants.

88
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,980
And if you look at me
coming at you this way,

89
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,570
and if I turn around you
see it's going to be,

90
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,900
well, you'll see it's going to
be a mirror image situation.

91
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:53,070
But I'm flat so I have no
coyote. Uh, as a starting point,

92
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:56,280
I'm in the plane of the flat.

93
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,660
And so then if add hydrogen to it,
I get nothing interesting.

94
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,730
But if I add an Adam like
oxygen to it, like here, then I,

95
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,170
I parameter lies.

96
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,810
And so I can either add the oxygen from
my front and go like that puck side or I

97
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:14,630
can add it from my back.
And I go like that.

98
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,910
And that's the other mirror
image component. That's
a, it's a really cool way.

99
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:22,220
And it works.
You can make epoxides that way.

100
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,510
And we have regions today where you can
recognize the front and the back of a

101
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,750
flat object that has pro
Chi reality like this.

102
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,250
And back in the early and mid,
early seventies,

103
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:43,970
we saw this industrial
reaction that was nice.

104
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:48,710
You could take vanadium and Molybdenum
and you could park today's all the things

105
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:53,450
with these things called, uh, well I
don't have Darren's structure on it,

106
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,440
fortunately, but it's butyl
hydra peroxide. It's the, um,

107
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,900
it's the alcohol. It's the alcohol
group here with a peroxide bond.

108
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:06,980
I think you've already learned that
peroxide bonds, there are weak whys.

109
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:11,980
They have a, uh, a low
lying, a sigma star orbital,

110
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,100
and you're going to attack them on the
backside and transfer Adams to make a

111
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,010
transfer to carbon like Homo Olefin.

112
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,070
So what we noticed,

113
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:26,030
I noticed in one case that a
little like Alcoa halls, we're,

114
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,550
we're very much seem to be special.

115
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:31,250
It was just noticed by an
English chemist in the 30s,

116
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:36,080
that they seem to react better
than just normal alcohols. And so,

117
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,540
but nobody had taken, taken any, uh,

118
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,750
any really action on that.
And we should wait, wait,

119
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,390
you're not as fast as some people
and you're getting to this stuff.

120
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,610
So we should say that the now lily alcohol
is one that has an oxygen next to the,

121
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:56,510
on the carbon next to the
double bond. Oh yeah. Oh, great.

122
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,820
I forget the allelic alcohol
a little like means, uh,

123
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,960
a little your alpha one
Adam away from an orphan.

124
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,330
So what you could have anything,
their nitrogen, oxygen.

125
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,320
So you haven't always like an ethanol.
That's an a little like alcohol.

126
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:17,220
If there's a double, this isn't a look
alcohol. All right, where is it? I go,

127
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,540
I don't see, I don't, I'm sorry.
I don't have the right structures.

128
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:24,890
This is the allelic alcohol. It would
be, if I go back one, I'll show you.

129
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,990
Um, not by going forward. There's
the elbow like, oh yeah, I got one.

130
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,480
Like here,
this is a carbon.

131
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:35,780
That's the carbon that the Garmin
that by putting an o h group there,

132
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,790
that's a little like alcohol. If I have
another carbon, it's home. Although like,

133
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,890
but it has a handle now and that handle
allows it to grab hold of the vanadium.

134
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,350
Vanadium has all these alcohol. These
are esters. Imagine that's phosphorous.

135
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,840
It is like foster sexually
is, but it's the, it's a,

136
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:59,450
a yellow yellowish
liquid and it exchanges,

137
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,840
it's ligans like the wind with
alcohol. So they come in, they go out.

138
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,990
It's a real dance. It's fast. You don't
have to worry about that happening.

139
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:11,190
Phosphates, we all be dead.
That happen. Uh, we melt.

140
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:16,260
But this is one, this is a transition.
Metal goes to here. Now am I,

141
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:16,740
when I,

142
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,740
when I'm the metal and I have oxygen
here and then I say have an arm.

143
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:27,090
You can imagine my arm being double
bond without pie going like this.

144
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,980
And here on my belly,

145
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,040
I'm going to have and to Adam
in this disease and the like,

146
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,920
it should be red, you know, actually
didn't read, but he's going to,

147
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:39,750
he knows why I don't check for blood.

148
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,160
So you come like this and you
grab it and it pops off me.

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,510
I'm the, I'm the activated thing in
the middle and it goes on to there.

150
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:56,340
That's in a park side, three membered
ring. And if I attack it with a backhand,

151
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,520
I would get the opposite
result in terms of attack.

152
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,470
And that's, uh, that doesn't
happen because the geometry,

153
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,770
the transition states in the
projections of the center,

154
00:10:08,771 --> 00:10:12,750
you can't get as close to a center
shot on this thing with the backend.

155
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,420
So that's why we're starting to explain,

156
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:16,530
we're going to explain a little bit more.

157
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:19,520
Mike's going to do some
acting later and you know,

158
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,940
you'll see a little bit more clearly
the topology of the situation.

159
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,490
But here, you know it's cool because
you get these templates like a Mandrel,

160
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,160
you grab hold of this oxygen atom,
which is [inaudible].

161
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,110
The metal Gra has lots of in the
orbitals is the d zero metal.

162
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,510
It activates the thing this way.

163
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,960
And then the orphan lone
pair of the homo attacks,

164
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:47,460
the backside and all this 20 business
goes on. But there's no mechanism.

165
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:48,930
It's a known mechanism transfer.

166
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:53,550
It's one of these like you draw a bunch
of arrows and everything happens sort of

167
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,530
in a smooth way.

168
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:59,970
No ions involved in unlike
sn two chemistry. Okay?

169
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:02,140
Slow step is then uh,

170
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,320
this footstep and then it comes off
and more stuff goes on. It goes around.

171
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,470
So that's the trick we played here.

172
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,320
The first idea was take advantage of,
of fixing the thing.

173
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,370
So once you fixed this,
this flat system that you want to make,

174
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,550
go pop up this way or that way.

175
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:29,130
Now you have a chance of doing it because
the thing you're transferring from can

176
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:33,360
recognize this kind of
situation from that one,

177
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,160
like it's part of the same
molecule temporarily. In fact,

178
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:41,790
this is a covalent bond right
there at this point. Too much.

179
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,760
I always say too much.
Okay. What's he going? Um,

180
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,330
then came great man from Japan.

181
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:53,220
He's now head professor at Kyoto Oshima.
He was fantastic.

182
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,220
Boiler room producer in titanium,
my husband Ian, you name it.

183
00:11:57,221 --> 00:12:01,480
I think that was where all the
work was done for the Nobel prize.

184
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,530
It was done at MIT but
happened at Stanford just
because I was there for a few

185
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,850
years. But you know those early years in
your career when you do your work in the

186
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:11,710
boiler room or what produce you,

187
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,640
like your personality doesn't change
after your four years old, right?

188
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,770
Or three years old here pretty
much locked in. Unfortunately,

189
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,580
in some ways it's the vanadium system and
we put on this Carl machinery here and

190
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:31,960
it gave us 80% [inaudible] that
means an antiemetic access was,

191
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,350
it was a 90% when item or an anthem or
the right hand say and 10% the other,

192
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,750
and this looks good,

193
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:46,290
but it only works for that one substrate
and all the others types with it.

194
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,510
You can have like methyls there are
methyl there and you get nothing.

195
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,840
It's so you have to get everything
customize. This login is,

196
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,170
you've got to get the right leg in there
and that's what you expect with nature.

197
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,310
We're taught by a meal,

198
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:04,900
Fisher and the lock and key
nature is supposed to be very,

199
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:09,280
very touchy about changing
your, her preferences. And
that was what we expected.

200
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,130
Why didn't expect that?
I expected that.

201
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,990
This type of all of and and this type
with something that all of these would

202
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:20,170
need class of catalyst about
six shapes of all ovens.

203
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,370
So that's what my dream was to get maybe
six catalysts cause we didn't have the

204
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:27,010
paraphernalia.
The nature has all around.

205
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,720
Well for years, we tried 10
years, we didn't get anything.

206
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,430
It was always this game of
like almost no reliability.

207
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:41,110
And then when we came to titanium, we've
been working with vanadium molybdenum.

208
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,890
We came over to titanium I and we,

209
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,360
and we put in tartaric acid ester one
day, this was me, it was got Suki,

210
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,620
he should have gotten a Nobel price with
me because this will use half of this.

211
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,160
I pick the right metal at that
time and the right system,

212
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:59,200
but he's the one who
picked the right Ligon.

213
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,720
And let's go onto the next.
You'll see this is tartaric acid.

214
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:08,680
This is so called natural. It comes
from grapes, it's the cream of tartar.

215
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:13,060
When you protonate it becomes third
target acid over here is the unnatural,

216
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,290
but there's a plant in Africa,
but he articulated that has about,

217
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,030
it's a huge area around the Sahara.
So there's maybe more of that nature,

218
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,400
so-called unnatural
than there is a natural,

219
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,410
you know the story about tartaric acid
that goes way back to Louie pastor.

220
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:35,230
His discovery of tetrahedral carbon,
I mean Ben, the precursor to it.

221
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,720
Grapes,
very sexy looking things.

222
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:42,670
We always like humans seem to like to
drink them and eat them and look at,

223
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,890
uh, this is the famous recipe.
So that day, tight cut,

224
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:54,830
Suki took tartrate and
put it together with a,

225
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:01,070
Oh, I'm thinking, I forgot to say
something here. Yeah, just quickly.

226
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,930
Uh, maybe I don't have it. No,
it comes later. Okay. Put the TV.

227
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:10,100
HP was the kind of oxygen we'd always
been using. There's the titanium,

228
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,670
which comes from titanium dioxide
or titanium tetrachloride.

229
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,440
Everything that's white in this world.
All these, that's titanium dioxide.

230
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,970
It's only white pigment anybody ever uses.
Uh,

231
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,940
and so that's the team docs.
It's very insoluble,

232
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,570
but you can make it into this cycle.
The router's if you,

233
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,650
if you do the right chemistry,
and this is the wine acid.

234
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,870
We put it in dicer approval.
Tartrate traders and Esther.

235
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,160
And we kept getting 90% 100% 95.

236
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,290
Every Olson we put in that was in the
little like alcohol that had this handle

237
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:50,210
on. It gave Katsuya about week of this.
And we were just about dying, you know,

238
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,070
he said, I was looking at
him, he's looking at me. He
was, we didn't believe it,

239
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:58,730
you know, so we had to try to
kill this but was right. And uh,

240
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,850
so it meant that here we had
some new principal. We could,

241
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,350
we could actually just take one catalyst
and get them all almost to get them all,

242
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:10,390
but there had to be a little
cow calls. Um, so this is,

243
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,300
this is the famous recipe discovered,
uh,

244
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,330
I think in an October
day in 1980 at Stanford,

245
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,490
I'd already decided to go back to MIT.

246
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,520
I might not have decided to do
that if this had happened sooner.

247
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:25,520
We get depressed when our
researchers and working, I mean,

248
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:29,210
whether we don't show it or not, it's
the only thing that matters. Really.

249
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,230
A real killer research
guy who wants to put, see,

250
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,260
understand what makes nature
tick and whatever else.

251
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,610
If that's weren't going well, life
is good, otherwise nothing's could.

252
00:16:40,611 --> 00:16:43,340
So I was going, I went
back to MIT, which is,

253
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,360
I wouldn't have if I had gotten this
about three months earlier probably.

254
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,920
And here we are,

255
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,920
there's Kazuki Sign Drinking Tarik Tarik
aqueous is about 5% aqueous tartaric

256
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:58,850
acid and wine and champagne. And this
was on the portrait, the Mudd building,

257
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,190
which was where our lab was on the top.

258
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,620
And what I'm going to show here is why
[inaudible] so important in a nutshell,

259
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,930
this is a really nice little substrate.

260
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,390
It has this type of alcohol,
stride substituted,

261
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,000
but you see the oil here,
there's no one, Ooh, over here.

262
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,200
This is a more reactive all of in
for the transfer of the oxygen,

263
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,720
but it doesn't have the handle.
So this is,

264
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,800
it ends up winning by a factor
of 200 in this system where they,

265
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:30,170
if oxidation requires the thing,

266
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:34,850
the bind and going into a molecular
and that's nice in its own right.

267
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:38,090
But to get we got and made
all the time of course,

268
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,890
because we have no face selection.

269
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:45,310
So here we and titanium goes about
10 times faster with tartrate.

270
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,870
When you add it, this does
something to make every other metal.

271
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:54,750
The years before Oshu might taken vanadium
and Molybdenum, which are the best,

272
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,700
uh, for isolated double bonds, but
you put tar trade in, he kills him.

273
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,060
So my instinct think would not
have been titrated. And again,

274
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:08,340
this is the kind of thing, everything in
science, the rules change all the time.

275
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:09,210
You wake up in the morning,

276
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:12,180
you should iterate your
favorite desire every morning.

277
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,870
It's going to look different to you
in the shower and you can never, they,

278
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,730
that was eight atomic bomb was
made by theoretical geniuses,

279
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:24,930
but the guys who did it actually found
they had aluminum foil on the source.

280
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,870
They kept it on there for about a
year or two. Some guy said, man,

281
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:32,040
I think we need this. What about if we
take it off? That was the answer. I mean,

282
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:35,160
these guys are like us. They just
try this, try that in the law, right?

283
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,790
That's what gets really
things done in this world.

284
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,740
The theories are all are important.

285
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:45,020
Nobody would even think about trying
to without the theory. But uh,

286
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:45,961
okay man.

287
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:49,860
In California just when the oil parts
from mixing pain and why that's what they

288
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:53,950
said in the,
in the La Times who sort of true to them.

289
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,030
Dockside tartaric acid and
there's the [inaudible].

290
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:02,390
I like my students to know where the
mother earth is and I like things to be

291
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:05,700
cheap. I don't like to
be far away from, uh,

292
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,510
river that strong or a power
source or in this case,

293
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,540
this is tartaric acid.
It comes in a 100 pound bags.

294
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:16,440
This is Spanish tartar and that's,
this is Victor Martinez,

295
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:19,080
who's one of the heroes in this
chemistry from the Canary Islands.

296
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,380
This comes to Pfizer.
They make things out of it,

297
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:26,820
but it comes in ships and a hundred
pound bags and we still have that in our

298
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:30,530
stock room somewhere.
That's uh,

299
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:35,520
there's my daughter celebrating the
synthesis of the unnatural sugars by this

300
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:39,890
method and uh, I got
the wrong one, didn't I?

301
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,400
I threw out the wrong. Yeah. Anyway,
you're going to have to interpret.

302
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,990
This is the mirror image of
the picture that was taken,

303
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:49,140
I guess because you see the
name over here is backwards,

304
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,650
but she's looking at the El sugars.
These are the ones that we don't make.

305
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:55,560
There's eight of those exos and
these are the ones that, uh,

306
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,050
meal Fisher made in his famous work,

307
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,400
the best chemists who are live except for
event Hoff two was even better because

308
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,700
he did an organic cereal,
chemistry and physical chemistry.

309
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,510
And I think he was the greatest chemist
who ever lived, uh, than half of us.

310
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,840
But anyway, Fisher was better than
me, but he lived in this century.

311
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:17,170
And in terms of understanding
and arguments and rationale of,

312
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,270
of Sin Synthesis, and he made all
the, a lot of these sugars over here,

313
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,460
but this, this, this is Tito assembly at,
she's a photographer. My wife's friend,

314
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,410
it was just taken in 1983 was on the
cover of chemistry in Britain and, uh,

315
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,670
Hannah was seven. And
Anyway, Tito is, uh, uh,

316
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,110
was a friends when she took the picture.
And this book though is a huge book,

317
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:44,590
which was gotten by Nancy Shrock from
WHO's in charge of the MIT archives and

318
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:48,640
there's a book store and Nancy.
So here we've got Nancy Schrock this,

319
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,150
we've got Peter Symbaloo whose husbands,

320
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,150
Dan Mcfadden and won the Nobel
Prize in economics 10 years later.

321
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,403
And uh,

322
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,760
Dick won the Nobel prize a couple of
years ago and I want it in 2001 so the

323
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:04,510
picture is kind of connected and there's
Lewis Carroll of course looking glass

324
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:08,950
milk and Neil Fisher is a heavy
duty picture for me anyway.

325
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,540
Um,
there's Nexium and maybe we're getting,

326
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,890
I went too far into the other stuff and,
but here's the atom,

327
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,690
the Red Adam that's going to end up
being transferred onto the sofa. And,

328
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,340
and, and well,

329
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,520
Mike showed, told you that the dice
bravo mean, what would the role be?

330
00:21:33,521 --> 00:21:36,640
I hope I can go to the board
now and show you a few things,

331
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,500
but this catalyst is exactly the recipe
and it makes billions of dollars a year,

332
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:42,670
this product, right. And,

333
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,530
but the pattern is Stanford
patent is no longer valid. It's,

334
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,470
it's run out, even though it
hadn't run out when they started,

335
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:55,471
but they didn't believe that this was an
infringing that patent actually in the

336
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:59,890
beginning. But nobody knew. University
Sue's companies. I can't afford to.

337
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,850
Sanford couldn't afford to Shirley. Yeah.

338
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,150
I don't think there's anything
else behind that. Is there

339
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,030
some light on the board? Is that

340
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:20,690
uh, yeah, that's, no, that's
funny. Yeah. Yeah. I don't really,

341
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,980
yeah, that's where I lose the structure.
Why don't we just come down a little bit?

342
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,710
Oh, we don't need this
structure, I don't think.

343
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,020
Well, no, I don't think
so. I think they can see,

344
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:41,120
do you remember the vanadium picture of,
I'll make it titanium now,

345
00:22:41,121 --> 00:22:44,630
but there's this alcohol group and Ah,

346
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,593
okay.

347
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,493
And

348
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,740
on this we have this peroxide group
that's bound and it's bound database Lee

349
00:22:58,951 --> 00:23:03,000
there. It's got this tertiary
butyl group here and,

350
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,060
and then the alcohol is bound here

351
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,000
and
oh,

352
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,600
it goes sort of that down.

353
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:18,710
Just try to show some of the steering
chemistry and then underneath it's coming.

354
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,940
Yeah, it's coming folded like
this underneath. So it's,

355
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,480
I can't draw very well,

356
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:32,460
but this is supposed to be coming with
its lone pairs is high bonds on the

357
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:35,910
backside of this bond. So we're
going to do an attack one there and,

358
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:40,740
and we'll break this bond will break.
We'll, we'll bring the lone pair here and,

359
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,880
and we get, we get the
approximate now. But the thing,

360
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,690
this is patent lawyers
can be very creative.

361
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,420
Like every fuel has creative
people and Yale are,

362
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,000
is connected to this fellow
Burt Roland and he was in the,

363
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,280
in Palo Alto at the time and the
company and he had just gotten famous.

364
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:03,770
So almost in famous because he,
that pattern was really aggressive.

365
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:07,220
This boiler Cohen Patent,
he wrote the boiler corn pattern.

366
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:11,210
He's related to Mike because he got
his phd with Bartlett at Harvard,

367
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:14,570
like liked it. So that's a
long time ago. That's a great,

368
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,130
great something relationship.

369
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,940
And then comes Weiberg cause here at Yale,

370
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,350
he was at Seattle then and he took p
postdoc. He decided he liked chemistry.

371
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,790
In principle, you're smart,
physical, organic chemists.
But he didn't like the lap.

372
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,830
He wasn't any good and alive.
And he didn't like to be there.

373
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,880
So he became a patent attorney,
did very well. And he,

374
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,560
he writes great patents. And so when
he, he read our paper, our first paper,

375
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:43,770
we gave him a little communication and in,
and then he got cut Suki and,

376
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,590
and uh,

377
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,330
me over to his office and we
interviewed us for about 10 minutes.

378
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,390
Next day we got a patent.
It never changed a word of it.

379
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,620
And I'll tell you why it's
creative I think on this is the,

380
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:01,760
were getting ready for the next few. But
I could tell you about that. If we don't,

381
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,790
we don't make it, it won't matter
that much. But here's the main, uh,

382
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,100
so this is going to be the oxygen and
they should be red. But we have pink here.

383
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:14,030
It goes this one, but that one doesn't
transfer. This is the one that transfers.

384
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:20,090
So what Roland said is you've got
a metal which can grab things.

385
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,990
Now the things that grabs, you know,
could be x, it could be so for,

386
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:28,040
or a mean group that could grab.
And then he just drew,

387
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,030
I think drew a carbon with no,
it could be any carbon and it didn't,

388
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,320
it didn't have to have just ch two and
then he drew this g and then he drew.

389
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,650
Yeah, I did draw an oxygen atom
here, I guess that was activated.

390
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,360
And so this oxygen, he didn't have
generality there. That was specific.

391
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,880
That was the only thing that was specific.
These two things.

392
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,750
So this could be any kind of own
peer and all often is a lone pair.

393
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,070
So for his own pair of Foster's as a lone
pair of nitrogen as long pier and and

394
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:05,420
sure enough when I read that I
said my God, this gives us idea.

395
00:26:05,421 --> 00:26:09,530
So we started doing amino alcohol.
All these things work, you know.

396
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,710
So this is from Burt role on the
patent attorney. He's a co invent that.

397
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:18,170
He was a co inventor of those
other reactions. We never
brought any more patents.

398
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,570
It's a good thing.
Don't waste your time on patents.

399
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:23,360
They'll just not use them
until they expire. We never,

400
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,410
we made enough to go on a vacation
once a year in a car. Not Too far away.

401
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,030
Got Sued. Got Suki and I, you
know, we got people who got rich,

402
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,870
got most year,
one year we got $20,000 each or something.

403
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:41,310
That was a really sharp maximum from
the bag of bug gypsy moth traps this

404
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:46,230
parlor. But I okay.
Don't show the transfer.

405
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,300
I think maybe it'd be nice for us.

406
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:53,390
Mike and I show are what features
have to be over here in these ligands.

407
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:56,970
He,
you see the tartrate has this feature,

408
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:01,020
it grabs the titanium out front.

409
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:02,520
Let's try to put it out front here.

410
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,940
So the titanium is that here and down in
the back here you have this ester group

411
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,000
and up in the back over here
you have an ester group.

412
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,160
And I can't remember if
that's what we plan to do,

413
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:17,850
but out here on the front is coming
in the alcoholic, this g group,

414
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,930
and there's an oxygen that's hot over
here, the that can be transferred.

415
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:26,940
So Mike's going to put that,
uh, I'm going to put that on.

416
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,140
And you're the, Oh, is that
okay if you're the old,

417
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,400
maybe it's better if I'm the
old. Oh, no. Okay, I'll be,

418
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,580
I'll be the titanium.
So see,

419
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:43,730
I've got this oxygen that wants to go
off because it's a weak bond and uh,

420
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,050
I've got to get it over to him.
He's the low alcohol,

421
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,370
but we're going to pretend
you as not to bind to me.

422
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,250
We're just going to do the
straight out attack here and

423
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:00,420
yes, like that. Right. So I'm blocked
here, but I'm open in these quadrants.

424
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:06,060
Is that right? Boy, you're quick.
I don't. Okay. So I'm natural.

425
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,860
Okay, well wait a minute and also,
but I'm not like this. I'm like that.

426
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:15,420
You see I'm a three dimensional world
cause I'm tartaric acid say I'm sticking

427
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:19,580
out here. So one of the chiral object,
now my mirror image wants superimposed,

428
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,300
but he's, yeah, he's that
way. He's a trans all often

429
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,730
and it looks like an Egyptian
like, know, like anyway.

430
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,700
Yeah, you actually the double,
we don't have this quite right.

431
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:40,500
Can you didn't arm down here cause we
though of one's here and one's going this

432
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:45,300
way. Okay. You got to go
in that way. Okay. So yeah,

433
00:28:45,301 --> 00:28:48,270
the ones who are in that way.
Okay. And yeah, that's good.

434
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,530
Okay. Cause I could go like I may
not. It's like this. I'm sorry. Yeah,

435
00:28:55,531 --> 00:28:59,160
I got to go like that. I could go like
that. That's the mirror image. Okay.

436
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:03,750
Now I'm coming towards them.
Okay. When are you back?

437
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,760
Oh my gosh. I can't do it. Say, but yeah,

438
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,730
that's the other. You need the
other mirror image for that one.

439
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,270
So I come this way and again,

440
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,683
safety.

441
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:25,520
So now it has, you have to, yeah.
If he was a good yoga person,

442
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:30,540
can parameterize a little better
now when you put him that way.

443
00:29:30,961 --> 00:29:33,210
He's one and Auntie Marie,
if you put them on the other way,

444
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,280
that's the other name. Simple. It's
really simple, isn't it? Thanks.

445
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:39,570
Bye.
Yeah,

446
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:44,230
he used to organize that 10 seconds
before we came over that you can see we

447
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:47,650
didn't have any red red ping pong balls.
It's good with velcro.

448
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:51,220
You can do it with velcro.
We did it once with velcro red balls.

449
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,120
Okay.
Now

450
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:02,590
back to the screen. I think
we're, oh no, not, no,

451
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:04,690
not back to the screen. Let's,
let's, let's leave it alone.

452
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:10,120
This is going to be a little
expert. Oh, there's a clean, yeah.

453
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,540
Now if you look at the structure of the

454
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,380
resort, I won't put all the bells
and whistles on it's uh, it's a, uh,

455
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,530
images all structure.
Ben Zimmer dissolve,

456
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,830
which has benzene ring two nitrogens.

457
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,680
It's a five member aromatic hetero cycle.
And uh,

458
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,460
so you have double bond and one h and uh,

459
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,150
I can't remember what's on the software.

460
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:47,410
Is it an aromatic ring or is there a
Benzos and aromatic vinzel thing? I think,

461
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,020
and he might look at this and say,

462
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:54,310
this doesn't look anything
like Burt Rowan's thing there.

463
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,870
Uh, cause he's, where's the word?

464
00:30:57,871 --> 00:31:02,110
We're the anchor points that we needed.
The, the group that binds the metal.

465
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,060
We have the lone pairs.
All right. Two Lone pairs,

466
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,710
rabbit ears. And there, if
you put oxygen on one side,

467
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,040
it's the same story as before.
If it,

468
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,450
this is in flat to start with,
but now we have these pairs.

469
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:22,540
If you put something here, you get one
in anthem or put something in there,

470
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:23,374
you get the other.

471
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:28,300
So the idea was to try to get an argon.
Had done this,

472
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,720
uh, [inaudible] won the Nobel
prize I thought should have,

473
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,380
but he's in France and he,

474
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,510
he had done a lot of great work in
asymmetrically drug chemistry and he,

475
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:44,070
he took the titanium [inaudible] and he
found that he put a little water in it

476
00:31:44,231 --> 00:31:48,340
and you did the right things
and wished I wasn't as general.

477
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:50,560
But you got a very good
asymmetric edition.

478
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,830
So titanium was already known to do this,
but they,

479
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:58,840
the feature that's important
here is the PKA of this.

480
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,340
Ben Zimmer is all is probably it.
I looked it up.

481
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:05,770
I think it's below that of an alcohol.

482
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:11,550
So that means it can go on the titanium
reversibly so you see the titanium has

483
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:17,220
alcohols or ligands like this or in this
can exchange so we can have that come

484
00:32:19,841 --> 00:32:24,730
off in this and go on.
Yeah, for this Hetero Cycle

485
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:31,350
and the benzene rings down here and now
we have something like that and covalent

486
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:36,550
bond and we've got the software here

487
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,480
and we've,
we also have the alcohol.

488
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:44,060
So there's an equilibrium
where you could invoke that,

489
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,620
but this is not as easy to
probably do is then alcohol.

490
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:53,150
It's more encumbered and it's probably
kinetics are slower for this and off of

491
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:56,000
oxygen for the hydrogen
transfers that are needed.

492
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,280
So I hypothesize here that
what the diets of probe,

493
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:05,240
but the humanics pace we call dies
appropriately. [inaudible] mean is doing

494
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,490
this is such a hinder to mean
that it can't react with anything,

495
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:16,010
but it's good for getting protons so
it can't itself get at the oxygen,

496
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,390
which you would worry about it.

497
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:21,250
We'd make an an oxide and it
can't bind the titanium anyway.

498
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,300
Night titanium hates nitrogen. I mean
you can, if you have an oxygen around,

499
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:30,500
it'll spit it out as fast. Make your
head spin. I mean this thing is amazing,

500
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:35,240
the hating Heiter's titanium and it's
talking to but especially titanium,

501
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,290
so it's never going to get involved
with titanium. So what's it going to do?

502
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:44,730
Well remember when you are trying to get
chemistry going in a system like this,

503
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,310
there's a mean,

504
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:51,310
has enough pka power to pull this proton
and usually you can write a concerted

505
00:33:52,341 --> 00:33:55,910
mechanism like let me raise some
of this and have some room here.

506
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:03,400
Well I shouldn't erase that.
I'll go over here. You got

507
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,960
and spins him in his zone
where the soul for here,

508
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,940
and I'm going to put it
the hydrogen up here,

509
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:24,450
whenever you engage compounds
in Riyadh in a reaction,

510
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:28,470
acid base reactions, you look for
the basic sites in the acidic sites,

511
00:34:28,471 --> 00:34:32,850
there's the acidic site. You might
think that's where the titanium goes,

512
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:37,830
but usually the mechanism for these
directions involves simultaneous loss of

513
00:34:37,831 --> 00:34:41,590
this proton and attack here. This is the,
this is the place you're going to tack,

514
00:34:41,591 --> 00:34:46,591
so you'll be attacking the titanium here
and the you got to get some help from

515
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,990
you going to get a lot of help
from this to mean cause you can,

516
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,580
you can put it someplace,

517
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:58,320
just take it right off and you'll have
some of that ammonium soul around to a

518
00:34:58,321 --> 00:35:02,310
little bit transient and this
will help you because you need to,

519
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:08,160
you need to
move things around.

520
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,510
That's why this reaction was not good.
Without that I mean it,

521
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:17,040
you need the scramble was system and
keep it rolling so that the things get on

522
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:17,450
and off.

523
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:22,450
That's ketalysis often has
this like there's six maybe
there's always a loop and

524
00:35:24,001 --> 00:35:25,590
if you look at any catalytic cycle,

525
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:30,150
there'll be usually one step that's
really bad news until you get it fixed.

526
00:35:30,151 --> 00:35:33,030
And that step is where controls the rate.

527
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:37,890
She gets steady state the slowest step.
This is a democracy,

528
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:42,600
get dialysis you, there's no set
that's more important than any other.

529
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,920
The catalyst goes from each step. The
tight team is moving through those cycles.

530
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,360
If there's a slow step,

531
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:53,361
there's 99.9% of the titaniums that you
need stuck before this one mountain that

532
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,840
goes way up. Like Mount Everest.
You got to drop that one down.

533
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,150
If you get that one down,
the rate goes way up.

534
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:05,250
If you get them all the same height, you
really roll. And that's her secret rule.

535
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:09,690
The turnover limiting step is everything
and you could tell us is in a lot of

536
00:36:09,691 --> 00:36:12,150
times the turnover
limiting step is so high,

537
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:15,690
they don't even know there is ketalysis.
If you can break that,

538
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,450
you'll find a world of ketosis.
It didn't exist before,

539
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,090
so that's what I think is
exciting about Catholicism.

540
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,830
It's alive as long as you have some energy
to dissipate your, that's life itself.

541
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:31,170
So here's what, then I've finished
this quickly off without any details.

542
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:32,370
You can see what I'm going to do here.

543
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:37,371
It's just that that I acted that hot
oxygen atom that that's activated,

544
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:42,200
the transfer, this is the handle.
That would be the look alcohol.

545
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,370
So it's dead ringer for, for for the
cuts. Rupee for the Burt Roland Patent.

546
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:52,310
Right. That's, that's what I
think. And, uh, the mean. Yeah,

547
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,550
three me make sense here too.
And uh, I guess it's that,

548
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,770
well, Sanford may love, we,

549
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:05,970
they brought over 10 people from research
and they brought over three lawyers

550
00:37:06,061 --> 00:37:10,950
from Astrazeneca because Stanford thought
maybe should get something out of this.

551
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,330
And I told the story like this and they,
they didn't,

552
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,810
they pretended that didn't make
any sense at all. You know,

553
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,380
and it was pretty unsatisfying.
But Rowan was there,

554
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,530
I don't know if he's still alive. He
had cancer then, but so we didn't,

555
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:30,000
but they'd already made $6 billion
because the catalyst pattern was the only

556
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:34,760
extent patent, but it did have this
feature in it. And so they write in them,

557
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,480
I think they right in the face of the
patent, but they didn't like that. And,

558
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:44,550
and you know, that Stanford
wasn't going to pursue. Uh,

559
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:49,140
and the other thing we talk,
I like to mention is they invited me over.

560
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,850
This was before this
meeting about the patent.

561
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,260
I guess I started to notice the old team
chemistry and Kazuki and I taught and

562
00:37:58,261 --> 00:38:02,280
we agreed that maybe we should
raise our hand. But before that,

563
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:07,260
what happened was I got invited to go to
a hotel in Munich, the fanciest hotel,

564
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,360
and they put me in this
big room up the stairs.

565
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,320
They wanted me to say something about
right and left hand and medicines and I

566
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,700
blow 15 minute spot,

567
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:19,450
1000 or 1200 gastroenterologists from,
from uh,

568
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
Germany won't.

569
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,560
And they were doing the story about how
important drugs had to be optically pure

570
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:29,010
and that,
that story doesn't wash too well here.

571
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,190
And I didn't realize it was going,
but I,

572
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,440
I went and I did my part and I, I, I,

573
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:40,480
it is true that many drugs are toxic in
one form and good in the other and, uh,

574
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:44,920
was able to make those points.
But what happens here is,

575
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:49,710
oh, and I also, they gave me this
suite on the top that had like a,

576
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:54,460
a stare at spiral staircase to the bed
at the very top of Madonna had stayed

577
00:38:54,461 --> 00:38:58,510
there the week before.
That's okay for her.

578
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:02,920
She doesn't have a prostate problem. Hey
Yo, I hated that place. I had become,

579
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:07,480
the h had had a fire pole so I could get
down to the bathroom. Anyway, I, yeah,

580
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:13,060
well what happens is as Mike told you,
you got,

581
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,170
you just look at the facts and that system
and I noticed them just the day I was

582
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:20,460
sitting there in the audience and the
press was interviewing us and I wish we

583
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:24,040
did to the guy next to me. He looked at
me and frown. It was about the weights.

584
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,431
All right.

585
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:29,431
I mean the rest of mate 20 milligrams
and optically pure and I think the uptick

586
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:33,580
impure is substantially more reactive
in this case because he gets in better.

587
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,890
It's of course just the
pro drug for the thing.

588
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,720
But the thing that was missing
from the experiments is the,

589
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,880
is the 40 milligrams of resume,

590
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:46,810
which we'd give them equivalent
against the one in anthem or of the,

591
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:51,250
of the 20 milligrams of pure. And
that was missing. They doubled the,

592
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:56,350
and it was just the sore thumb there
for me. But I didn't say anything.

593
00:39:56,351 --> 00:40:00,380
Nobody asked me. Fortunately prayers, if
they had, I would have said something.

594
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,480
Right. I imagine you, that's
the way we are. Right.

595
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:07,090
And Mike like this and he smiles be,
he gets the,

596
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:12,550
he gets the hard evidence, uh, in the
middle of your talk. Sometimes he does it,

597
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,100
but it's, for me, it's the
best thing you can get.

598
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,600
If you can get killed by a friend,
it's the best way to get killed.

599
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,430
Anyway, I'm finished. That's it. Yeah.

600
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,073
Yeah.
You're welcome.

601
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,730
We maybe have time for
one question or solve.

602
00:40:37,731 --> 00:40:41,780
Where are we getting back to our
normal business? Anybody? Sharpless

603
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,770
no, thanks again. You, yeah, you're
welcome. And I'll have a good trip back.

604
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,700
I'll get that stuff to you through Scott.
Okay. Okay, good. Yeah, that's mine.

605
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:55,890
What's yours here is this, is this unit?
Well, I can give that Scott's, yeah,

606
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:59,200
I'll give it back to Scott.
Okay. Thanks so much. Good luck.

607
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:04,240
[inaudible]

608
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,800
okay.
Back to our routine now.

609
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:16,380
Yeah, I'll be, I'll be back
there. Yeah, I'll bring it to you.

610
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,440
Okay.
A,

611
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,560
Oh,
he forgot to show this picture.

612
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,500
There he is with the royalty of Sweden,
his,

613
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,843
his wife.

614
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,770
And the other Nobel
laureates in chemistry.

615
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,443
Okay.

616
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,870
And he was going to talk about Carbone
too. He wanted you to smell it.

617
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:52,160
I told him you had smelled it, but he
had an idea for a novel based on Carbone,

618
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,200
which he didn't have time to get to.

619
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,010
Okay.
So we were talking about the uh,

620
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,760
con formation of rings and we talked
last time a lot about cyclohexane,

621
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,510
uh, and the, and how it distorted.

622
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:11,630
Remember that it's not really ideal with
the axial bonds parallel to the axis,

623
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:12,770
they spread out a little bit.

624
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:17,390
The ring flattens a little bit to minimize
the energy as calculated by molecular

625
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:22,280
mechanics. Now how about in
a four membered ring instead
of a six membered ring?

626
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:25,310
Well,
if we look at the what molecular mechanic,

627
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,010
he says about the source
of strain in this system,

628
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:33,560
you can see that the big
contributors are bend. That's what,

629
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,750
uh, that's what buyer had already talked
about, about the ring strain, right?

630
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,910
Having 90 degree angles
is not going to be good.

631
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:45,911
So that's caused costing 13 and a half
kilocalories per mole and torsion.

632
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:50,810
Because why is,
why is there such high torsional energy,

633
00:42:50,811 --> 00:42:54,320
15 kilocalories from all almost.
What's the source of that?

634
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,833
Anybody see

635
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:03,140
as you go around the ring,
everything is exactly eclipsed.

636
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,990
Everybody see that every carbon
carbon bond is eclipsed. Right?

637
00:43:08,991 --> 00:43:13,940
So that in molecular mechanics sums up
to almost 15 kilocalories per mole. Now,

638
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:17,030
if you were,
how would you try to minimize the energy?

639
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:23,580
Is this probably the lowest energy form
or can you think of changing it so that

640
00:43:23,581 --> 00:43:24,414
it'll be lower?

641
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,620
Any ideas,
Kevin?

642
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,180
Yeah, if you make it, not exactly eclipse.

643
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:45,770
If you make it a little
bit towards scatter towards
staggered by twisting about

644
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:49,520
the bonds that will lower
that 15 kilocalories per mole.

645
00:43:49,521 --> 00:43:54,521
But can you see what happens if you
begin to twist around the bonds?

646
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,640
It sharpens the angles even more from
90 degrees to a smaller than 90 degrees.

647
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,310
So here's what happens when you do it.

648
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,640
The bending energy goes up by two
and a half kilocalories per mole.

649
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,390
Right?

650
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:16,390
But the tortional energy goes down by
three and a half kilocalories per mole.

651
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:21,620
Right? If you don't bend it too far. Okay.

652
00:44:21,621 --> 00:44:24,230
And the other things stay
pretty much the same.

653
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:29,470
So this is a competition between
torsion energy and bending energy,

654
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:32,970
and the minimum is reached
with a little bit of of uh,

655
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,850
bending in order to relieve
some of that torsion.

656
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,120
Now how about if you had
a five membered ring?

657
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:45,500
Now you notice you have notice the
bending energy isn't bad because as buyer

658
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:50,850
pointed out, a Pentagon or regular
pedigree, John has just the right angles,

659
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:55,290
109 and a half degrees about right?
So there's hardly any bending,

660
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:58,500
but there's still a lot of torsion
from the eclipsing of the carbons.

661
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,920
So what you do if you run the molecular
mechanics program is to increase because

662
00:45:05,641 --> 00:45:10,320
bending energy to incur to occur,
that is sharpen the angles a little bit,

663
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:14,730
right? But you get rid of a lot
of tortional energy by doing that.

664
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:17,100
And this particular conformation,

665
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,770
which you can see how
it's bent down at the car,

666
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,800
the black carbon eight there is
sometimes referred to as the envelope

667
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:30,210
confirmation of cyclopentane.
See how it looks like the fold of the,

668
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,840
of the envelope bent down.
Okay.

669
00:45:33,841 --> 00:45:37,110
So there again is a competition
between bending and torsion.

670
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,580
Now,
like plastic models,

671
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:45,930
molecular mechanics is
satisfying because it says, uh,

672
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,510
not only what the structure should be,
but why,

673
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:51,810
what is it that makes the
energy the way it is? Okay,

674
00:45:51,811 --> 00:45:55,950
so you remember last time we passed around
the cyclohexane and remember how they

675
00:45:55,951 --> 00:46:00,030
clicked to go from one form to another.
So what's happening?

676
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:04,110
The question is what's the source of the
barrier to the cyclohexane ring flip.

677
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,580
So here's the chair cyclohexane
and when the ring starts to flip,

678
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:11,700
I remember first you go toward a boat
by bending one of those carbons up like

679
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:12,534
that.

680
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,280
Now what do you think the source of the
energy is that makes this hard to do?

681
00:46:17,281 --> 00:46:20,040
Why do you go to a maximum
energy as you do this?

682
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:24,150
And then it clicks and it goes down again,
Sherwin,

683
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:30,060
uh, w w torsion. Now that's a good point.

684
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:35,390
There are in fact two bonds to
butanes that become eclipsed,

685
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,230
right? Both of the ones on the
right, this one is eclipsed,

686
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:44,640
but also this one is eclipsed those four,
right?

687
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,260
And indeed that worth about seven
kilocalories per mole of going uphill.

688
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,830
But there's an interesting point.
You did this with the models, right?

689
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:56,400
And you felt that click where?
How does,

690
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:00,270
how do those models,
those plastic models? No,

691
00:47:00,271 --> 00:47:03,540
from tortional energy.
You see what I mean?

692
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:06,840
If you take ethane in
those models and spin it,

693
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,010
it spins completely freely. There's
nothing in the model. You could make it,

694
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:11,891
you could make the,

695
00:47:11,891 --> 00:47:16,680
the thing that goes into the tube and
the tube a little bit triangular so that

696
00:47:16,681 --> 00:47:20,340
as you tried to twist, it would go up
and energy and then down again. Right?

697
00:47:20,341 --> 00:47:22,980
You see how you could do that in a model,
but that's not the way those are made.

698
00:47:22,981 --> 00:47:27,690
Their cylinders, they rotate
freely. So why did the model click?

699
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,913
Pardon me?

700
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,200
Bending up what?

701
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:37,820
Yeah, right. Exactly. Look at this.
Why does the plastic model click?

702
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:41,120
Because when you're halfway across,
it's become,

703
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,330
if it were a heck if it were flat,
if the whole ring, we're flat,

704
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:49,340
what would the carbon carbon, carbon
angles be? If the ring were flat?

705
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:50,863
Sam,

706
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,120
if you're in a regular hexagon,
what's the angle,

707
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:00,143
Dana?

708
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:04,350
Yeah,
you gotta be careful holding your hand up,

709
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,240
even if it's just a scratch your face.

710
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:07,950
Yeah.

711
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:09,000
What's the angle in a,

712
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:14,001
in a regular hexagon hundred 20 degrees
wants to be 109 so it has to stretch out

713
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,020
if it becomes flat and even when
it becomes only partly flat, right?

714
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:22,290
This part of it is flat.
This one's out of the plane.

715
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,380
But that means in order
to have this one in there,

716
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,740
this bond gets compressed,
right?

717
00:48:28,741 --> 00:48:32,760
Because if these angles want to
be 109 instead of 120 everything,

718
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:36,150
these are going to move this one and
this one will move closer together.

719
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,820
So these are in the trans,
in the, in this form,

720
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,960
when it's half planer,
this,

721
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:47,580
these angles are bent out and that angle
has bent in. So it's the angle bending,

722
00:48:47,581 --> 00:48:48,570
which in fact does,

723
00:48:48,571 --> 00:48:53,571
it does stress those plastic
models which causes it to click.

724
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:58,440
So it's interesting to be able to look
at models or at these calculations of

725
00:48:58,441 --> 00:49:03,441
molecules as springs and see
if why various things occur.

726
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:09,540
So our molecular mechanics
programs useful. Yes, definitely.

727
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:11,550
They're useful.
Are they true?

728
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,600
No. Okay, so we'll go
on from there next time.
