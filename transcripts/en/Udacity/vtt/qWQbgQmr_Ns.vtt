00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.140
Let's see the solution for our instruction pipelining quiz.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.850
We have a five-stage pipeline. Each stage takes one

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.854
clock cycle. We have ten instructions. If we do

00:00:09.854 --> 00:00:13.856
instructions one at time with no pipelining, each instruction will

00:00:13.856 --> 00:00:16.850
need to go through all five stages. Takes five

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.934
cycles to do that. And then the next instruction can

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:22.139
go, and takes five cycles to do that, and

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:25.993
so on. So we're going to have five cycles per instruction,

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:28.949
times ten instructions. It will be 50 cycles

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.580
until we are done. With pipelining, remember that

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.505
the first instruction will take five cycles to

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:38.205
go through but the next instruction will be

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:40.577
one cycle behind. So it will take one

00:00:40.577 --> 00:00:43.503
cycle to get the next instruction, one cycle

00:00:43.503 --> 00:00:45.582
to get the one after that, and so

00:00:45.582 --> 00:00:50.670
on. So the remaining nine instructions finish every cycle.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.040
Overall, it takes 14 cycles. As you can see again, we

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.406
have a significant speed-up from using pipelining. And just like with laundry,

00:01:00.406 --> 00:01:03.808
don't forget that it takes some initial number of cycles to fill

00:01:03.808 --> 00:01:08.280
the pipeline. Only then, we can get an instruction leaving every cycle.
