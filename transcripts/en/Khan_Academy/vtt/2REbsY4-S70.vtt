00:00:00.678 --> 00:00:02.327
- [Voiceover] Anna wants
to celebrate her birthday

00:00:02.327 --> 00:00:04.509
by eating pizza with her friends.

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.509
For $42.50 total, they
can buy p boxes of pizza.

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:12.659
Each box of pizza costs $8.50.

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:16.026
Select the equation that
matches this situation.

00:00:16.026 --> 00:00:17.094
So before I even look at these,

00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:19.439
let's see if I can make
sense of the sentence here.

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.653
So for $42.50 total, and
I'll just write 42.5,

00:00:22.653 --> 00:00:24.060
especially because in all these choices

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.521
they didn't write 42.50,
they just wrote 42.5

00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:28.526
which is equivalent.

00:00:28.526 --> 00:00:33.526
So 42.50 that's the total
amount they spent on pizza

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:39.149
and if I wanted to
figure out how many boxes

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.563
of pizza they could buy, I could divide

00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:44.582
the total amount they
spend, I could divide that

00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:47.252
by the price per box.

00:00:47.252 --> 00:00:50.201
That would give me the number of boxes.

00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:54.357
So this is the total, total dollars.

00:00:54.357 --> 00:00:59.047
This right over here is the dollar per box

00:00:59.047 --> 00:01:01.834
and then this would give
me the number of boxes.

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:05.061
# of boxes.

00:01:05.061 --> 00:01:07.220
Now other ways that I
could think about it.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.728
I could say, well what's
the total that they spend?

00:01:09.728 --> 00:01:13.072
So 42.50, but what's another way

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:15.254
of thinking about the total they spend?

00:01:15.254 --> 00:01:17.089
Well you could have the amount they spend

00:01:17.089 --> 00:01:20.270
per box, times the number of boxes.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.802
So this is the total they spend

00:01:21.802 --> 00:01:23.009
and this another way of thinking about

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.842
the total they spend, so these
two things must be equal.

00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:27.862
So let's see, if I can see anything here

00:01:27.862 --> 00:01:30.741
that looks like this, well
actually this first choice,

00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:35.741
this, is exactly, is exactly
what I wrote over here.

00:01:36.546 --> 00:01:38.032
Let's see this choice right over here.

00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:41.677
P is equal to 8.5 x 42.5.

00:01:41.677 --> 00:01:43.906
Well we've already been
able to write an equation

00:01:43.906 --> 00:01:47.320
that has explicitly, that
has just a p on one side

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.270
and so when you solve
for just a p on one side,

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.594
you get this thing over here,

00:01:50.594 --> 00:01:53.287
not this thing, so we could rule that out.

00:01:53.287 --> 00:01:56.259
Over here it looks kind of like this,

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.024
except the p is on the wrong side.

00:01:58.024 --> 00:02:01.112
This has 8.5p is equal to 42.5,

00:02:01.112 --> 00:02:04.525
not 42.5p is equal to 8.5.

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.591
If we try to get the p
on the other side here,

00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:09.331
you could divide both sides by p,

00:02:09.331 --> 00:02:11.653
but then you would get
p divided by p is one.

00:02:11.653 --> 00:02:16.653
You would get 42.5 is equal
to 8.5/p which is not true.

00:02:18.015 --> 00:02:20.778
We have 8.5 times p is equal to 42.5,

00:02:20.778 --> 00:02:23.704
so this is, this is not
going to be the case.

00:02:23.704 --> 00:02:25.933
One thing to realize, no
matter what you come up with,

00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:28.464
if you came up with this
first, or if you came up

00:02:28.464 --> 00:02:30.971
with this first, you
can go between these two

00:02:30.971 --> 00:02:35.128
with some algebraic manipulations.

00:02:35.128 --> 00:02:36.846
So for example, to go from this blue one

00:02:36.846 --> 00:02:38.123
to what I wrote in red up here,

00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:40.863
you just divide both sides by 8.5.

00:02:40.863 --> 00:02:42.883
So you divide by 8.5 on the left,

00:02:42.883 --> 00:02:44.508
you divide 8.5 on the right.

00:02:44.508 --> 00:02:46.551
Obviously to keep the equal sign

00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:48.502
you have to do the same
thing to the left and right,

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:53.502
but now you would have 42.5/8.5

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.303
is equal to, is equal to p.

00:02:56.303 --> 00:02:58.579
Which is exactly what we have over there.

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.320
Let's do one more of these.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.899
Good practice.

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:05.916
Mr. Herman's class is selling
candy for a school fundraiser.

00:03:05.916 --> 00:03:08.818
The class has a goal of raising $500

00:03:08.818 --> 00:03:11.535
by selling c boxes of candy.

00:03:11.535 --> 00:03:15.250
For every box they sell, they make $2.75.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.781
Write an equation that
the students could solve

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:20.033
to figure out how many boxes of candy

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.728
they need to sell.

00:03:21.728 --> 00:03:25.536
How many boxes of candy they need to sell.

00:03:25.536 --> 00:03:27.904
Well there's a couple of ways
you could think about it.

00:03:27.904 --> 00:03:31.271
They have a goal of raising
$500 and so they want

00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:34.963
to get a total of $500,
and if each box is $2.75,

00:03:34.963 --> 00:03:36.635
divide the total by the amount they get

00:03:36.635 --> 00:03:38.771
each per box and then this is going

00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:43.275
to be equal to the number of
boxes that they need to sell.

00:03:43.275 --> 00:03:44.529
So this we've done.

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:46.247
This is an equation that
the students could solve

00:03:46.247 --> 00:03:47.733
to figure out how many boxes of candy

00:03:47.733 --> 00:03:49.359
they need to sell.

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:50.752
Another way you could think about it,

00:03:50.752 --> 00:03:55.752
it's 2.75 per box times c boxes.

00:03:57.927 --> 00:04:00.782
This is the total amount
of money they will raise.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.919
Whoops, this is the amount.

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.426
So this is the amount that they will raise

00:04:05.426 --> 00:04:08.654
and their goal is that,
their goal is to raise $500.

00:04:08.654 --> 00:04:12.229
So they want this to be equal to $500.

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:14.435
So this also could be an equation

00:04:14.435 --> 00:04:16.089
that the students could
solve to figure out

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:19.793
how many boxes of candy they need to sell.
