00:00:00.771 --> 00:00:03.518
- [Voiceover] It is given
that the sine of 58 degrees

00:00:03.518 --> 00:00:05.761
is equal to 0.8480,

00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:09.179
cosine of 58 degrees is 0.5299,

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.248
and actually, they're just giving us

00:00:10.248 --> 00:00:11.394
the first few digits of these,

00:00:11.394 --> 00:00:12.926
they keep going on and on and on,

00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:16.235
and tangent of 58 degrees is 1.600.

00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:20.502
In the figure above, angle VWY,

00:00:20.502 --> 00:00:22.910
V, W, Y,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.673
and WZV, are right angles,

00:00:25.673 --> 00:00:27.995
they've already labelled
them as right angles.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:30.920
What is the length of segment VY

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.661
to the nearest integer?

00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:34.497
So VY,

00:00:34.497 --> 00:00:38.975
VY is the hypotenuse of this big triangle

00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:41.734
right over here,

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:44.300
and what else do we know
about that big triangle?

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.424
We know the angle, 58 degrees,

00:00:46.424 --> 00:00:48.653
and we know the length of VW.

00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:50.580
We could view this as the adjacent side,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.823
to this angle.

00:00:51.823 --> 00:00:53.576
So we know the angle,

00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:55.514
we know the adjacent side.

00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:57.116
We know the adjacent side,

00:00:57.116 --> 00:00:59.763
and we're trying to
figure out the hypotenuse.

00:00:59.763 --> 00:01:03.861
So which trig function deals
with adjacent and hypotenuse?

00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:05.603
Well, we could go to the
soh-cah-toa definition

00:01:05.603 --> 00:01:06.775
of our trig functions.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:10.293
Soh-cah-toa.

00:01:10.293 --> 00:01:12.812
Sine is opposite over hypotenuse,

00:01:12.812 --> 00:01:15.911
cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse,

00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:18.872
and tangent is opposite over adjacent.

00:01:18.872 --> 00:01:20.381
So we're dealing with the adjacent,

00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:21.752
which we know,

00:01:21.752 --> 00:01:24.374
and we need to figure out
what the hypotenuse is.

00:01:24.374 --> 00:01:25.918
So we're gonna deal with the adjacent

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:26.959
and the hypotenuse,

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:29.204
so we should think about using cosine.

00:01:29.204 --> 00:01:33.244
So the cosine of 58 degrees,

00:01:33.244 --> 00:01:35.879
is going to be equal to the
length of the adjacent side,

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:37.063
to that angle,

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:41.428
5.3 divided by the
length of the hypotenuse,

00:01:41.428 --> 00:01:42.682
and that's actually what we care about,

00:01:42.682 --> 00:01:45.538
that's the length of segment VY,

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.639
which we could just write V, Y,

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:48.846
without writing the line above it,

00:01:48.846 --> 00:01:51.725
this means the length of VY.

00:01:51.725 --> 00:01:55.266
So now we could just solve for VY,

00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:56.500
so if you multiply,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.506
or actually why don't I just,

00:01:57.506 --> 00:01:59.762
instead of having to write
VY over and over again,

00:02:01.492 --> 00:02:05.447
let's just call this whole thing H,

00:02:05.447 --> 00:02:07.676
H for hypotenuse.

00:02:07.676 --> 00:02:09.313
So this whole thing,

00:02:09.313 --> 00:02:11.971
right over here, that is equal to H.

00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:13.910
Let's see, if you
multiply both sides by H,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.834
you're gonna get H times
the cosine of 58 degrees,

00:02:17.834 --> 00:02:19.772
is equal to 5.3.

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:20.875
Then you could divide both sides

00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:22.396
by the cosine of 58 degrees,

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:25.693
and you get H is equal to 5.3

00:02:25.693 --> 00:02:29.768
divided by the cosine of 58 degrees,

00:02:29.768 --> 00:02:32.008
and they tell us what the
cosine of 58 degrees is,

00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:34.806
it's 0.5299.

00:02:34.806 --> 00:02:37.488
So this is going to be equal to 5.3

00:02:37.488 --> 00:02:41.992
divided by 0.5299,

00:02:41.992 --> 00:02:43.466
it actually keeps going,

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:44.732
and we need to figure out what this is

00:02:44.732 --> 00:02:46.067
to the nearest integer,

00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:48.992
so definitely wanna get a
calculator out for that.

00:02:48.992 --> 00:02:52.501
And so, we have 5.3

00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:54.031
divided by,

00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:59.749
0.5299.

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:01.472
And I'm just gonna use
the numbers they gave us,

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:03.353
even though my calculator
has a cosine function,

00:03:03.353 --> 00:03:05.187
that probably would have
given us more precision,

00:03:05.187 --> 00:03:07.590
but I'm gonna make sure we're
using the same numbers here,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.331
so this is gonna be equal to,

00:03:09.331 --> 00:03:10.585
well, rounded to the nearest integer,

00:03:10.585 --> 00:03:12.001
well, even to the nearest hundredth,

00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:14.207
this is gonna be equal to 10.

00:03:14.207 --> 00:03:16.726
So this is the length
of this side over here,

00:03:16.726 --> 00:03:18.967
is going to be equal to 10.

00:03:18.967 --> 00:03:20.244
Now if any of this that I just did

00:03:20.244 --> 00:03:21.347
looked like Greek to you,

00:03:21.347 --> 00:03:22.647
and you are not Greek,

00:03:22.647 --> 00:03:24.841
I encourage you to watch the
basic trigonometry videos

00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:26.350
on Khan Academy.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.465
This is an interesting problem,

00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:30.502
because this was a pretty
straightforward application

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:32.747
of the definition of cosine,

00:03:32.747 --> 00:03:34.507
and they just confuse you a little bit,

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:40.499
by drawing this other right triangle here.
