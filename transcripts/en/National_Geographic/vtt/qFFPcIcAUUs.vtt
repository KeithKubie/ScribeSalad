00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.467
NARRATOR: Intersex.

00:00:03.467 --> 00:00:06.400
Even if you've heard the word,
you may not know what it is.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.900
And that's not surprising
because intersex

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.533
doesn't mean just one thing.

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.433
It refers to a variety
of different conditions

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:16.500
in which a child is born with
anatomy that doesn't completely

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.033
conform to what's
traditionally understood

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:21.100
to be male or female.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.667
By one estimate,
one in 1,500 babies

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:27.500
is born intersex, which
would make it about as common

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.500
as being born with red hair.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.800
If that number
is true, then we

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.200
certainly all know
somebody who is intersex,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.700
even if we don't know it.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.467
NARRATOR: And while
intersex isn't exactly

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:41.266
a household word, last summer
it got global attention

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:44.400
at the Rio Olympics.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.233
Caster Semenya, the lightning
fast runner from South Africa.

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:51.266
She took gold in the 800
meter but she almost didn't

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.166
make it to the starting blocks.

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.834
She was nearly banned
from competing at all

00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:59.633
after allegations that she
is intersex, reportedly born

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:02.867
with a condition that causes
her body to produce extremely

00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:06.266
high levels of testosterone,
something critics,

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.533
and the women who have
to compete against her,

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.600
say is an unfair advantage.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.500
High testosterone is the most
important factor that separates

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.734
male and female athletes.

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:22.467
If you allow intersex women
to compete against other women

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:25.600
with their naturally-produced
high testosterone,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.633
it creates a very
un-level playing field.

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:32.533
NARRATOR: Not everyone agrees
that testosterone gives elite

00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.300
athletes the gold medal edge.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.333
Some sports
scientists argue it's

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:39.767
no more of an unfair
advantage than good nutrition

00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:41.367
or good genes.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:45.233
So the task that policymakers
have been given is to basically

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:47.467
prove that testosterone
is jet fuel

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:49.266
that's propelling
them and giving

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:50.700
them male-typical advantage.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.300
And so it's not borne
out by their times,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.734
but it's also not borne
out by the science.

00:01:55.734 --> 00:01:57.967
NARRATOR: But in 2011,
the governing body

00:01:57.967 --> 00:02:01.767
in track and field instituted a
controversial new rule banning

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:04.300
any female runner with
testosterone levels

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.000
higher than 10 nanomoles per
liter, considered by experts

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.700
to be in the male range.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.133
It's not saying you
are a man or a woman.

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:13.400
It's saying you can compete.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.100
It's a matter of
eligibility to participate

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.600
in certain competitions.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.934
So it places a ceiling or
a threshold limit on women's

00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:23.166
natural testosterone.

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:26.266
And if you exceed that,
even though you've

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:28.500
always competed in
the women's category,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.633
you're no longer eligible.

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:33.600
NARRATOR: The ruling meant
Caster Semenya was sidelined

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.433
unless she was willing
to artificially

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:38.400
lower her testosterone
levels with drugs,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.567
which she presumably did.

00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:43.567
And her performance suffered.

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:46.533
But the pressure on her,
demanding public answers

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:49.633
to intimate questions,
never let up.

00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:52.433
Yeah they can make
their own decisions.

00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:57.233
But don't forget, what I can do
I can just help other athletes

00:02:57.233 --> 00:02:58.533
like me, you know?

00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:00.333
NARRATOR: And some
asked, was Semenya

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:03.600
singled out not just because
of her speed on the track?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.266
I think what
happened was really

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:10.367
based on her
appearance that crosses

00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:13.367
some sort of invisible
threshold of femininity.

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:18.633
She didn't fit what people would
expect from a female athlete.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.967
NARRATOR: Caster seemed
destined to miss the Rio games.

00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:28.567
But in 2015, the ban was lifted
when a runner from India, Dutee

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:32.467
Chand, also barred because
of high testosterone levels,

00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:35.734
sued the international track
and field governing authority

00:03:35.734 --> 00:03:39.000
and won after sports
officials failed to produce

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.667
scientific data to
back up their theory

00:03:41.667 --> 00:03:44.367
that testosterone
gives female athletes

00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:47.033
an insurmountable advantage.

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:49.333
The scientific
evidence wasn't there,

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:51.033
which is underlying
the rationale

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:52.600
for the entire policy.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.066
Higher testosterone gives
you male typical advantage.

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:57.367
And that wasn't borne out.

00:03:57.367 --> 00:03:58.867
NARRATOR: With the
ban lifted, Semenya

00:03:58.867 --> 00:04:00.734
went on to win gold in Rio.

00:04:00.734 --> 00:04:03.300
But in at least one
way, Semenya's victory

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.500
was bittersweet,
exposing the raw emotions

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.500
and deep sense of injustice
some of her fellow runners felt.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.934
There's a really sad, I
think, and heartbreaking

00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:15.567
photograph that sticks with me.

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:18.166
So after Caster Semenya
had won her race

00:04:18.166 --> 00:04:20.667
she went over to greet
competitors who had not

00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:23.500
medaled, reaching out
to try to greet them

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.567
and they remain in the embrace.

00:04:25.567 --> 00:04:28.233
What it points to,
really, is a very sad,

00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:30.934
heartbreaking ending
about who's really

00:04:30.934 --> 00:04:32.166
harmed by these policies.

00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:36.467
NARRATOR: And Semenya
may have another hurdle

00:04:36.467 --> 00:04:39.400
to clear before she
crosses the finish line.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.367
The track and field
governing authority

00:04:41.367 --> 00:04:44.467
has until July of
2017 to provide

00:04:44.467 --> 00:04:46.333
scientific evidence
about the role

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:48.266
of testosterone in athletes.

00:04:48.266 --> 00:04:51.533
If they meet the deadline,
the ban could be reinstated

00:04:51.533 --> 00:04:54.333
and Caster Semenya could
be stripped of her medals

00:04:54.333 --> 00:04:56.834
and sidelined forever.
