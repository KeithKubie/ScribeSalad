GOD.

&gt;&gt; Larry: THERE HAS BEEN SOME
GOOD.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:29.896 align:start position:0% line:85%
SOME BAD.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.531 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOW FAR HAVE WE COME?

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:34.267 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WE'RE [BEEP], LARRY.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.135 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:39.305 align:start position:0% line:91%
GIVE ME -- WELL, I KNOW IT
 LOOKS BAD.

00:00:39.338 --> 00:00:41.174 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT HAS TO BE BETTER THAN LAST
YEAR.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:44.210 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW HOW SO FAR WE HAVE
COME, LARRY.

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:46.412 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU TAKE ALL OF THE MEDIA
ATTENTION.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:51.350 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE DOJ REPORTS, THE WHITE
OFFICERS, THE OFFICERS FIRED OR

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:54.854 size:88% position:44% line:91%
CHARGED, FACTOR IN THE OTHER
BLACK LIVES TAKEN THIS YEAR.

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:58.724 line:91%
THE OFFICERS THAT DID GET OFF
AND THE MEDIA FATIGUE AND WE

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:00.159 size:78% position:39% line:85%
HAVE COME ABOUT THIS FAR.

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:03.129 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S IT.

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:05.398 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT'S NOT A VERY BIG
DISTANCE.

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.200 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, IT'S NOT, LARRY.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.368 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOT AT ALL.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:14.540 line:91%
IT'S A DISTANCE THE AIR MOVES
WHEN A BABY BIRD FLAPS IT'S

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:15.674 align:start position:0% line:85%
WINGS.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.777 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: LOOK ON THE BRIGHT
SIDE THE BABY BIRD WILL FLY.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.182 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T LET ME FINISH.
WHEN A BABY BIRD FLAPS ITS WINGS

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:28.855 line:91%
AFTER IT'S TOSSED OUT OF THE
NEST TOO SOON AND PLUMMETS TO

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:29.922 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S DEATH.

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:31.057 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S HOW FAR.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.191 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT'S SAD.

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:38.364 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE PROGRESSED THE SAME
DISTANCE OF A CATERPILLAR.

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:40.833 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: CATERPILLARS TURN INTO
BUTTERFLIES.

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:44.637 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHOSE LEGS WERE CUT OFF BY
A SICK TEENAGER.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.577 line:91%
WE'RE AN ANCIENT GREEK MARATHON
RUNNER INCHES FROM THE FINISH

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.444 align:start position:0% line:85%
LINE.

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:54.847 align:start position:0% line:91%
AT LEAST WE'RE INCH FROM THE
FINISH LINE.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:03.956 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE FINISH LINE IS IN POMPEI
&gt;&gt; BUT IF THEY'RE GREEK, ISN'T 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:06.325 align:start position:0% line:91%
POMPEI IN ITALY?
&gt;&gt; IT'S A MARATHON, LARRY!

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:07.627 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S A LONG RUN.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.761 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I UNDERSTAND.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:12.665 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE TRAVELED THE SAME
DISTANCE AS A CHILD'S WISH WHEN

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:16.669 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE WISH IS TO EAT ICE CREAM FOR
BREAKFAST, LARRY.

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:18.171 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:20.907 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T THINK ANYMORE, LARRY.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.210 line:91%
I HAVE FERGUSON FATIGUE, LARRY
. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE OVER.

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:29.148 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU THINK MY BRAIN CAN KEEP
COMING UP WITH RACIAL INJUSTICE

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:30.583 size:75% position:38% line:85%
METAPHORS FOR YOUR SHOW.

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:33.152 size:78% position:39% line:85%
IT'S EXHAUSTING, BROTHER.

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:35.755 align:start position:0% line:91%
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:38.891 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE CLAPPING
FOR MY STUPID SHOW.

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:43.029 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW EITHER.

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:45.364 align:start position:0% line:91%
Larry: MIKE, I WOULDN'T OF
ASKED YOU TO REPORT ON FERGUSON

00:02:45.397 --> 00:02:48.301 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF I KNEW IT TROUBLED YOU SO
MUCH.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.802 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT'S OKAY.

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:51.170 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:51.871 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M BETTER NOW.

00:02:51.904 --> 00:02:54.240 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU KNOW, LARRY.

00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:58.044 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S THIS SITUATION LIKE A
BUCKET OF RAIN DANCE.

00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:58.578 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:02:58.611 --> 00:02:59.579 align:start position:0% line:85%
MIKE YARD,  EVERYBODY.

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:01.545 line:85%
&gt;&gt; LIKE A DIRTY BOWLING ALLEY
