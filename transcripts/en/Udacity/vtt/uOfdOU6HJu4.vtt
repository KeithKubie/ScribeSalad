In order to interact with our robots moving in the environment, we need to

00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:07.397
capture the input from the user and react to it in proper fashion. For Grids,

00:00:07.397 --> 00:00:11.830
we have two primary forms of input. Number one is keyboard, where we use the w,

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.550
a, s, d keys to actually allow our robot to move around and get into all sorts

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.369
of conky trouble. In order to shoot, we allow mouse input for your player so

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.630
you can actually see that as I move the mouse, the little mouse cursor moves.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.906
We don't actually rotate the upper body of the robot until you actually fire

00:00:27.906 --> 00:00:32.049
though. So you can see that as the mouse moves around, my projectiles are of

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:36.140
course following it in suit. This allows the player to move as well as shoot at

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.362
the same time. Now for those of you out there that do most of your gaming or

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:43.334
programming on a laptop, you probably don't have an external mouse. We've also

00:00:43.334 --> 00:00:46.322
allowed the ability so that you can play Grids as well. And for that, rather

00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:49.312
than actually aiming your robot to shoot at things using the mouse we allow you

00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:53.435
to use the arrow keys. So that pressing in the specific direction will shoot in

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:56.866
that direction as well. And, of course, combinations of keys will allow you to

00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.180
shoot in diagonals.
