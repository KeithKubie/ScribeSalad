WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.510
You are listening to radio lab radio from W N Y.

2
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.523
S. T. E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.983
<v 1>I found out, you know what,</v>

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.670
will you forgive me if I actually leave my phone on vibrate because, uh,

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.340
my wife is pregnant and do literally really any day. Oh my God,

6
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.750
no kidding. If this vibrates, I might ruin your radio program. No, it's fine.

7
00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:31.110
It's all worse. So recently I had a conversation with this Guy Josh for yeah,

8
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.770
he's a journalist science journalist and he told me about something that's been

9
00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:38.200
obsessing him recently. This very odd experiment. Well, okay, so this is,

10
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.950
uh, one of the longest running science experiments of all time.

11
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.480
The Pitch Tropics here and you can actually see it online. How do I get to it?

12
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.190
I just started for pitch drop pitch draft. All right.

13
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.540
So when you go to this website, what you really see is, uh,

14
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.080
this funnel with some black stuff in it and then a descending from the stem of

15
00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:02.070
the funnel is this little tendrils of this black stuff. And at the end of that,

16
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:06.480
tendril is a little pure drop of this black stuff. That's,

17
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:09.660
it doesn't move, do anything.

18
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.470
But according to Josh, sure a pitch drop junkies all over the world.

19
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.080
People who are just have got this open in the background on their,

20
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:20.760
on their web browser and he says they all just sit there watching and waiting.

21
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.980
And that's the thing. Once you understand what's going on here,

22
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.540
you Kinda can't look away. Okay.

23
00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:30.650
So here's what happened in 1927 there is this guy, Thomas Darnell,

24
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.410
who is teaching physics at the University of Queensland and currently in

25
00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:37.760
Australia. And he's trying to show his students that, um,

26
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.830
well I guess that things aren't always what they seem. Okay. Uh,

27
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.460
and so he takes a chunk of this material called pitch. What's pitch? Okay,

28
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.630
so pitch is a natural substance. In fact, this is actually really the question.

29
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.410
What is pitch? Well, what does it look like? It's like, uh, is it gooey? No,

30
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.090
that's the thing. It's like a rock.

31
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.880
You can break it with a hammer and it shatters into a million little pieces,

32
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.470
but it's not a rock.

33
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.120
It's a visco elastic polymer of fisco elastic Palmer,

34
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.960
which means that over many, many, many, many years,

35
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.490
it moves really well.

36
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.860
What he did was he melted a handful of pitch and poured it into a glass funnel,

37
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.320
and once it had properly settled,

38
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.430
he snipped the bottom of the funnel and waited

39
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.420
for what? Well, for it to drip.

40
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.603
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

41
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.720
<v 1>you mean drip like a faucet would drip? Yeah, but much, much more slowly.</v>

42
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.690
So 1930 Goodo is discovered,

43
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.540
Bonnie and Clyde mean phone love going to crimes where you get killed by the

44
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:42.730
police. 31 the empire state building is finished. Okay.

45
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.280
1933 the Nazis build their first concentration camp. Prohibition ends.

46
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:49.160
It still hasn't drifted. E Five Amelia Earhart by solo across the [inaudible].

47
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.750
<v 0>Are you kidding? No. Drip it.</v>

48
00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:56.660
36 5 million barrels of cement turning to the Hoover dam. No,

49
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.890
for eight years. This rock is slowly, slowly,

50
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:04.750
slowly stretching into this dangling drop. And then suddenly one day,

51
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.870
eight years after he poured the damn thing into the funnel and the 10th of a

52
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:11.020
second, the blink of an eye.

53
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.810
<v 3>Oh, treat the pitch breaks. Now,</v>

54
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.530
<v 1>nobody's ever actually seen this happen. I mean it's never,</v>

55
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.690
there's drop has never dripped. No, no.

56
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.980
The drop is dripped eight times and we're all due for the ninth drop to happen

57
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.720
any day now. So wait, why haven't they seen it? So imagine a science experiment,

58
00:03:30.721 --> 00:03:31.260
right?

59
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Where the critical data that you want to gather happens in one 10th of a second

60
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.150
every 10 to 12 years.

61
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.300
It's really hard to be there at that critical moment. Yes.

62
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.010
Yeah. There's a master, this fellow professor John Mainstem,

63
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.050
he's been watching it religiously since January of 1961 for 50 years.

64
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.580
Oh,

65
00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.330
I'm still waiting to see this pitch drop just at a suspense or is there some

66
00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:03.370
question here? Well, first of all, doing well. Okay.

67
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.530
The question is at that moment when you this ever elongating droplet,

68
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.753
keep his way,

69
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.330
what happens if you've got the drop itself who owned by four little fibers,

70
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.450
call them fibers? What breaks first? How does it break?

71
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.620
And there are lots of people who like me waiting to see whether we can capture

72
00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:27.621
that moment and see the way in which from a mechanical point of view,

73
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.900
it becomes imperative that the dropped in fall.

74
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.050
So 1962 mainstay and Mr drop-ins 62 August,

75
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.700
1970 missed that one. April of 1979 one he looked at on a Friday,

76
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.230
knew it was close and sought. Well, something might happen over the weekend.

77
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.310
Came in on a Saturday, Saturday evening, checked to pitch job,

78
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.480
nothing happening. I'm going home.

79
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.870
And by the time I came in very early on the Monday morning,

80
00:04:54.871 --> 00:04:57.200
not having gone in on Sunday, it had fallen.

81
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.040
Then 1988 he standing right there and I decided I need to cover t or something

82
00:05:04.651 --> 00:05:07.830
like that. Walked away, came back, oh no.

83
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.790
And low and behold he thinks he may have missed it by as little as 15 minutes

84
00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:15.840
had dropped. Now you take your tee and throw it against the wall and rage.

85
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.390
Well, yes.

86
00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:22.290
One becomes a bit philosophical about this and I'm just,

87
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.600
oh well let's be patient.

88
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.780
The next time he installed a camera and and then and then 28 November,

89
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.290
2000 is what happened.

90
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.880
Then the time I was over on the other side of the world in London gets an email

91
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.500
saying professor this drop looking as though it might fall any time.

92
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.810
We've been waiting 10 years for this. It's about to happen.

93
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.400
Cause it was like I said, don't worry, we've got it covered. Got a camera on it.

94
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.030
I'll be able to see exactly what happened when I get back to Australia.

95
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.670
The next email said, well it's dropped

96
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.880
later that day. Do you have professor mains? Then I've got bad news.

97
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.830
Unfortunately you will not be able to see this because the system failed.

98
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.560
The camera went out, the camera went out.

99
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.670
We don't have this on record gum on.

100
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.160
That was one of my satisfying moments I might say.

101
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.210
But right now the pitch is getting ready to give birth to another drop and this

102
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:25.610
time there are three cameras,

103
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:29.720
three webcams on there and this is what Josh was showing me on the Internet.

104
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:31.160
This Dang Ling little,

105
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.590
almost that all is people are watching people from China, South America.

106
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.830
You knew what people were helping the north of Canada. Everybody's waiting.

107
00:06:40.831 --> 00:06:43.980
Everybody wants to be the person who sees the pitch fo

108
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.733
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

109
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.280
<v 1>and I've got to admit I've been checking this thing online.</v>

110
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.280
[inaudible] really like were you like watching grass grow? I don't know. It's,

111
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.390
I think it's more than suspense. I think that this is,

112
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.030
it's about timescale is what it's about.

113
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.950
We don't really have that many opportunities to interact with things that happen

114
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.690
on these two very, very different timescales simultaneously.

115
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.780
<v 5>Huh? You see what he means? Yeah. Cause you know you,</v>

116
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.610
you're in this funny situation,

117
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
you wait slower than you know how for something to take place that's faster than

118
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:22.250
you can, you know, catch. Exactly.

119
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.220
So you're playing at the very edges of what you know how to do,

120
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.430
but not if you catch it, then you get this glimpse

121
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.580
<v 1>into this world that's usually unknowable. Exactly.</v>

122
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.260
So for the next hour we're gonna mess around with this idea. Cause you know,

123
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.180
we're humans, we live in a human scale, but we've got a bunch of stories, right?

124
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.050
We're going to ask us to stretch that scale to the breaking point. Yeah,

125
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.280
I'm Jad Abumrad.

126
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.790
I'm Robert Krulwich today on radio lab speed way.

127
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.050
Things keep getting faster and then faster again,

128
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:57.160
and then faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and

129
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:02.170
faster and faster until we get to the fastest thing in the universe and stop it.

130
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:11.880
Okay, so let's set the baselines here. How fast are are we?

131
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.220
You mean like how fast we run? I mean,

132
00:08:14.221 --> 00:08:19.200
how fast do we interact with the world around us? How fast do we taste things?

133
00:08:19.201 --> 00:08:23.220
How fast do we feel something? See something respond. Okay. Hello? Oh, hello.

134
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.520
Hi there. Hey, how do we sound? That sounds better. Much better. Excellent.

135
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.700
That's Carl Zimmer of course, science writer regularly around here.

136
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.660
And he told us that question you just asked. How fast do people,

137
00:08:33.661 --> 00:08:34.980
humans process the world?

138
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.190
That question popped up in a really big way around 1850 with the invention of

139
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:45.440
the telegraph because suddenly you could send a message across the country

140
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:46.580
almost instantly.

141
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.810
If you're in New York and you want to send a message to Chicago,

142
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.890
all the money stopped.

143
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.620
It's going to take about a quarter of a second for that message to get their

144
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.700
rubbish. That's 790 miles in a quarter second.

145
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.020
Now that's really fast. Thank you.

146
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:09.210
If you do the math 790 times,

147
00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:13.560
four times 60 times 60 it's 11 million miles an hour.

148
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.240
That's amazingly fast. So fast.

149
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:17.490
In fact that some people when they first used the telegraph,

150
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:19.290
they just refuse to believe that it was real.

151
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.070
Cause in 1850 you're doing oh 35 40 miles an hour on a horse.

152
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:27.210
60 maybe on a steam engine up to 80 you're not living too fast.

153
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.650
But more importantly for our story, the Telegraph got people thinking about us,

154
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:32.970
about our bodies, right?

155
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.440
Cause you know nerves and telegraph wires are remarkably similar.

156
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.550
Nerves are long and skinny. They carry electricity from one place to another,

157
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.120
just like a telegraph wires. So naturally people wanted to know, well,

158
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:49.800
if telegraph wires can do millions of miles an hour, well what about our nerves?

159
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.720
How fast are they? Exactly.

160
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:56.810
And so one day a German guy biologist named Herman von Helmholtz took a frog

161
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.120
cause their neurons are kind of like ours. And basically what he did was he,

162
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.400
he hooked some wires up to one of the frogs muscles. Now this was,

163
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.840
I should tell you I did frog,

164
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.580
but he sent an electrical jolt through the muscle and then using a very fancy

165
00:10:11.581 --> 00:10:11.911
timer,

166
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:16.080
he was able to determine that the signal was going down the length of the, uh,

167
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.830
frog muscle at a speed of 27 meters per second.

168
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.750
What does that in miles per hour meters per se. Um, let's see. I can,

169
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.980
uh, Google, actually it's, I love Google. Um,

170
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.210
27 meters per second is 60.39, seven, three miles per hour.

171
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:37.380
16.3 miles per hour. We, this is a frog.

172
00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:41.510
Is this the same speed when us, yes. 60 miles an hour. That seems so slow.

173
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.420
Yeah. What's the name of the Jamaican runner? The fastest guy in the world.

174
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.280
Usain bolt. Hussein bolt.

175
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.270
So it was saying bolt is running at half the speed of his nervous system. Okay.

176
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:53.730
But better than bare mind actually. I mean, uh,

177
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.760
there's a big range of speeds of your neurons and actually Hussein bolt is much

178
00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:00.780
faster than some of your neurons.

179
00:11:00.781 --> 00:11:03.360
I mean there's some neurons that only go about a mile an hour.

180
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.370
Which ones are those? Ironically,

181
00:11:05.371 --> 00:11:07.800
some of them are from the reward centers of your brain.

182
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.010
Chocolate travels slowly. Yeah, relatively slowly.

183
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.000
What about the pain that that would be fast. I imagined. Yeah, you'd think so.

184
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:19.410
But pain actually runs kind of slowly. I am surprised to learn.

185
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.980
He says it can be as slow as 1.3 miles and hour. Wait a second.

186
00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:26.970
So if I put my hand near a candle and then I go, ouch.

187
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:32.070
Shouldn't that happen very fast? Look, I mean if you were like 70 miles tall,

188
00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:35.550
this might be a problem. Okay. But still, I mean,

189
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.870
what if we just take a really ordinary example like Robert Looking at the desk

190
00:11:39.871 --> 00:11:44.010
in front of him and grabbing that pen? What's involved? Well,

191
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:47.460
I mean you just essentially need to kind of walk through this brain.

192
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.170
You start at the I, okay. So, uh,

193
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.610
the eye takes the light that's reflected off the pen,

194
00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.640
turns it into a little electrical signal and then sends that deep into the

195
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:04.960
middle of the brain, takes a a couple of hundred 72nd bounces around for a bit,

196
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:08.390
and then within few more, hundreds of a second, the signal has made it

197
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.990
<v 0>all the way back to the rear end of the brain where you start processing</v>

198
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:13.370
[inaudible]

199
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.030
<v 1>envision.</v>

200
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.610
But this is just the beginning right now you've gotta like figure out what

201
00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:18.770
you're seeing. So our joke is off again,

202
00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.460
this time toward the middle of the brain and then down toward the bottom to

203
00:12:22.461 --> 00:12:25.250
these other regions that start to decode the signal,

204
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.820
the first visual regions called V1 next up,

205
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:33.560
v to before four and so on. And they're going to sharpen the image,

206
00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.800
make out contrast edges,

207
00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.010
and then electricity goes back towards the front of the brain

208
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.120
<v 0>after, let's see, another 10th of a second or so,</v>

209
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.180
<v 1>we finally get to a place where we think,</v>

210
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.790
<v 6>oh, that's a pen we haven't gotten yet too.</v>

211
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.740
I want it exactly

212
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.200
<v 1>for that to happen.</v>

213
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.620
Electricity has to jump from one part of the front of the brain to another and

214
00:12:57.621 --> 00:13:01.790
another before you can finally say, that's a nice pen. I could use a pen

215
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:08.000
<v 7>and we're still not done, you know, then then, then</v>

216
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.670
<v 1>little jolt heads, Norris, you start at the top of your brain. So we've,</v>

217
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.510
we've gone from the, your eyes to the back of your brain are around,

218
00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.740
up to the front of your brain again.

219
00:13:15.741 --> 00:13:20.390
And now we're up to the top of your head where you set up motor commands

220
00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:26.480
and then you can grab the pen. Christ.

221
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.180
So I mean you add all this up and what are we talking about here?

222
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.710
About a quarter of a second quarter of a say feels like one month later,

223
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:39.600
rubber town begin slowly to move to the objectives. Design a quarter of a say.

224
00:13:39.601 --> 00:13:41.040
So that's the same amount of time.

225
00:13:41.041 --> 00:13:45.000
It takes a telegraph to send a message from New York to Chicago. Yeah.

226
00:13:45.001 --> 00:13:48.450
So your ID, your hand, New York, Chicago. Oh Man.

227
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.960
<v 0>The sad truth has Carl, is that our neurons,</v>

228
00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:56.200
when it comes to communicating and and sending signals on your answer,

229
00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.060
they're terrible actually. I mean compared to our, you know, broadband networks,

230
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.880
particularly because when one neuron bumps into the next one,

231
00:14:03.881 --> 00:14:07.060
there's actually a little space between them. So the signal to get across,

232
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:07.940
it's got it

233
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:08.773
<v 1>jump</v>

234
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.970
and then jump to the next one and jump and then jumped.

235
00:14:15.971 --> 00:14:18.430
It's kind of like doing hurdles. It's not smooth.

236
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.400
And the spooky part about this slowness says Carl,

237
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.950
the deeper thought here is that if you think about it,

238
00:14:23.951 --> 00:14:28.240
because we have this built in delay in processing the outside world,

239
00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:32.330
<v 7>everything that I'm experiencing already happened.</v>

240
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.250
You know how like you look out at the stars and you think, oh,

241
00:14:38.251 --> 00:14:42.450
that light's been traveling for thousands, millions of years to get to me.

242
00:14:42.451 --> 00:14:45.540
And what's happening on that star to the planet around that star right now does

243
00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.610
even still exist. You can say that about everything around you

244
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:51.973
because

245
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.980
<v 1>I mean by the time that you become aware of something in front of you,</v>

246
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.420
it's been sitting there for awhile, relatively speaking.

247
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.940
I'm stuck in the past, but it's a,

248
00:15:04.941 --> 00:15:07.130
it sounds like if you want to be in the moment,

249
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:12.290
then what you do is you stare up as a sun and you let the light just be light

250
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.080
entering your eyes and you don't think anything about the light.

251
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:16.790
You don't try and comprehend the light.

252
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.780
You just let the light be light and that's as close as you're going to get to

253
00:15:20.781 --> 00:15:25.500
now. Yeah. Well you're looking at old light. Uh, but yeah, that's good.

254
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.840
It's eight minutes old cause I'm a star. Like even if you switch, you know,

255
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:33.050
even if you switch on the light and you're looking at the light bulb across the

256
00:15:33.051 --> 00:15:36.950
room, it's old light because it had to go from your eyes,

257
00:15:36.951 --> 00:15:39.380
through your brain to you to be aware that there was light there.

258
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:44.570
So what I would suggest is that you close your eyes and you stop thinking about,

259
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.080
you know,

260
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:50.080
the chair you're sitting in and just focus on your own thoughts because that's

261
00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:53.570
the fastest stuff you've got. It's, it's right there.

262
00:15:53.571 --> 00:15:55.640
You don't have to wait for it to be delivered into your brain.

263
00:15:55.641 --> 00:15:56.540
It's already in your brain.

264
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.780
So I think your thoughts are the fastest things that you can experience.

265
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:04.480
So my fastest thought that I could ever have is okay, where I'm my key.

266
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.260
You've got to have faster thoughts than that. What's the faster one?

267
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.130
This is an interesting question though. I think it would be non narrative.

268
00:16:11.131 --> 00:16:13.860
I don't think it can be a keys or something. I think it would just be like a,

269
00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:19.020
someone has thought about this. What? It wasn't me cause I'd have no idea.

270
00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:25.020
Don't you think somebody has an answer for us on this? Uh, hello. Hello?

271
00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:29.150
Hello somebody somewhere. I'm here. In fact, we found a guy, oh wait,

272
00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.910
are we recording right now? We are, yeah. His name is Seth Horowitz. I'm the,

273
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.520
uh, he's a neuroscientist, author of universal sense.

274
00:16:35.521 --> 00:16:38.760
How hearing shapes the mind. So we were talking, uh, with,

275
00:16:38.761 --> 00:16:40.860
and we ran set through the question, you know,

276
00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.670
if we're all trapped in the past by the slowness of our nervous system,

277
00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:49.140
what would be the most present the most in the now that we could be if you have

278
00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.480
any actually disagreed with Carl's gas? He said,

279
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.140
even if you think the simplest thought that it is possible to think it's

280
00:16:55.141 --> 00:16:58.980
probably still going to be on the order of a quarter of a second half second.

281
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.400
Oh Man. You have to get away from the conscious brain. No thinking,

282
00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.700
no seeing hearing is the fastest sense because mechanical,

283
00:17:05.701 --> 00:17:09.150
it normally operates on the millisecond range. Thousands of a second, Huh?

284
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:14.240
A sudden loud noise activates a very specialized circuit from your ear to your

285
00:17:14.311 --> 00:17:18.810
spinal neurons. You mean it bypasses the brain? Yeah, it's the startle circuit.

286
00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.800
If you suddenly hear a loud noise within 50 milliseconds,

287
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:26.610
it's 50,007 seconds. So you're talking 20 times faster than cognition,

288
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:31.350
your body jumps, we'll begin the release of adrenaline.

289
00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.160
No consciousness involved. It's five neurons and it takes 50 milliseconds,

290
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.490
50 milliseconds. So you're already getting into a faster,

291
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.440
much faster paradigm by using sound,

292
00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:45.000
so if we're going to jilt ourselves as close to the president as possible,

293
00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:50.670
then we'd have to play a really loud noise. Right? Like

294
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.423
wait for it.

295
00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.040
I know that was annoying. I'm no, I know, but look, thing we do,

296
00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:07.630
we just did together. We were all in the moment, in the present tense together,

297
00:18:07.631 --> 00:18:09.670
not quite, not as we now understand it.

298
00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:14.170
We were just shy just to get itsy bits shy of the moment. No time.

299
00:18:14.171 --> 00:18:16.840
If I spoke fast enough for me to say thank you to crowd Zimmer,

300
00:18:16.841 --> 00:18:18.800
they could've said hardwoods and now I've got be.

301
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.660
There's no way you could even form the theft. Thank you and 50 milliseconds,

302
00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.260
but I tell you what, in this next, in this next segment,

303
00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:30.970
we're going to make 50 milliseconds feel like 50 years. Oh, that's a really,

304
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.680
really nice promo there. That'll make everybody lean in.

305
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.780
That's actually a terrible like there.

306
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:47.290
We will amaze you by slowing down time so that you will find a millisecond

307
00:18:47.291 --> 00:18:51.310
generous Jay. You will be, you'll surprise yourself in all kinds of ways.

308
00:18:51.311 --> 00:18:55.090
If you just stay listening to this program, believe me right in there. We know.

309
00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:55.930
Good Save.
