00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.510
Here's an example of the more
complex FHIR Condition Resource,

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.980
in this case for Marla's diabetes.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.540
Note here the reference to Marla's ID
number from the patient resource.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.060
Note here a reference to
the SNOMED-CT code for

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.600
Type 2 Diabetes,
the adult onset version that Marla has.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.140
This illustrates an important
characteristic of FHIR.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.690
It isn't being build from scratch.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.038
Rather it builds upon the key existing
standards we discussed earlier,

00:00:35.038 --> 00:00:36.624
such as SNOMED-CT.
