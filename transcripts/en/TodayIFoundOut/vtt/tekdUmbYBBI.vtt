00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:12.709
One of the most common questions we’ve been
asked over the years, right up there with

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:18.330
how blind people know they are done wiping
after going #2, is why blind people wear sunglasses.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.869
After almost seven years of being asked this
question, we suppose it’s high time we answered

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:23.869
it.

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.300
It should first be noted that, contrary to
what many seem to think, not all blind people

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.300
are completely blind.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.510
In fact, the vast majority of legally blind
people can see at some level, just very poorly.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.660
For reference, the American Foundation for
the Blind defines blindness as:

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.560
a level of vision loss that has been legally
defined to determine eligibility for benefits.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.720
The clinical diagnosis refers to a central
visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.640
eye with the best possible correction, and/or
a visual field of 20 degrees or less.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.371
Often, people who are diagnosed with legal
blindness still have some usable vision.

00:00:58.371 --> 00:00:59.640
(And if you’re wondering, see: How the 20/20
Vision Scale Works) This “usable vision”

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.190
point is important to note because it means
that these individuals, like their better

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.890
sighted brethren, can also be distracted or
otherwise disoriented by bright light, with

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.420
a pair of sunglasses being an easy solution
to the problem.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.299
That said, while some blind people opt to
wear common store bought sunglasses to filter

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.799
out bright and ultraviolet light, others need
to wear specially made eyeshields that can

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.979
filter specific colors of light their eyes
are sensitive to.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.359
On the UV light note, much like those of the
sighted persuasion, protecting the eyes from

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:32.030
UV radiation is of tantamount importance for
the blind, as it’s exceptionally dangerous

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.560
to the unshielded eye.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.840
For example, overexposure to UV light can
potentially cause everything from cataracts

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.869
to inflammation of the cornea (photokeratitis)
or conjunctiva (photoconjunctivitis).

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.530
These latter two are essentially a sunburn
of the eye and are every bit as painful as

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.009
you might expect from that statement.

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.909
In some cases, excessive UV exposure to the
eye can even eventually result in certain

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.060
forms of ocular cancer.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.590
Because many blind individuals have little,
or in some cases no, natural ability to detect

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.079
whether their eyes are being bombarded with
a bright light source potentially giving off

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.740
a lot of UV radiation, like the Sun, and thus
aren’t able to know when their eyes need

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.370
protecting from said light, they are more
at risk of falling victim to the various afflictions

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.750
associated with it.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.550
Closer to Earth, some blind people opt to
wear sunglasses everywhere they go to protect

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.930
their eyes from physical dangers like low-hanging
branches, small objects blown by the wind,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.930
open cupboard doors, etc.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.720
Another, often overlooked, reason that blind
people choose to wear sunglasses is to signify

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.810
that they’re blind at a distance.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.410
For example, the white cane carried by many
blind people is noted as being as much a signal

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.000
to others as it is a tool for a blind person.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.080
In this sense, sunglasses in some settings,
such as when worn indoors, serve as an easily

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.580
observed, popularly known cue for visual impairment
at a distance.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.470
Similarly some blind people wear sunglasses
for the benefit of others.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.220
As explained by this blind gentleman, sighted
people often find it uncomfortable or awkward

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.700
to converse with a blind person as it’s
potentially difficult or impossible for the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.370
blind individual to maintain proper eye contact.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.290
Wearing dark sunglasses partially gets around
the problem.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.230
In that case, the blind person simply needs
to look in the general direction of the person

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.690
talking to make it seem like they are making
normal eye contact.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.940
A more personal reason some blind people opt
to wear sunglasses is to hide certain deformities.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.150
As discussed by blind author Belo Cipriani,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.480
After being sightless for a few months, I
soon met people whose eyes were scarred, shrunken

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.200
or deformed in some way.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.580
However, they still had some level of vision
— whether it was light or movement perception

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.470
— and prosthetics would eliminate useful
sight.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.430
Still, at social settings, they keep their
eyes from the public.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.670
He goes on to note that some blind people
feel a desire to “look the part”, donning

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.000
glasses to conform to the accepted stereotype
of a blind person wearing sunglasses.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.160
He states of this, “I often found people
in public telling me that I was faking it.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.230
I was not comfortable enough with my blindness
to have some witty reply, and, at that time,

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.930
it was easier to conform.”

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.490
So to sum up, while reasons vary from person
to person, when stepping back a bit from the

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.100
specifics of the answer, in a very general
sense, blind people mostly have historically

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.160
worn sunglasses for the same basic reasons
sighted people do- to protect their eyes and

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.220
for aesthetic reasons.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.230
It’s just that blind people’s eyes often
need a bit more protecting and there are additional

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.230
visual reasons for many blind individuals
to wear sunglasses than just looking cool

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.230
or fashionable.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.230
So that’s historically; what about the emerging
future?

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.580
As technology has advanced recently on the
mobile computing front, blind individuals

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.220
are starting to see new reasons to wear some
form of glasses.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.370
For instance, in 2015 Vision Technologies
began beta testing smart glasses that have

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.960
a camera and headphones built into them.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.300
The device, in conjunction with the individual’s
mobile phone, continually scans the environment

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.849
and updates the wearer audibly on anything
important.

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.659
For instance, the software includes facial
recognition algorithms that tell the wearer

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:39.539
if the camera sees someone the wearer has
stored in its memory as an individual they

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:40.539
know.

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:45.319
It can even be set to remind the wearer how
they know the person, along with other pertinent

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:46.340
details about them.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.889
Just as practically, it also recognizes objects
like a refrigerator or a bus stop, letting

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.550
the individual know if they are standing near
one.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.139
On this latter point, it can even read markers
off an approaching bus so the wearer knows

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.949
if the bus is the one they want to get on.

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.389
Beyond this, it can read any text from a product
label, book, sign or the like, among many

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:04.389
other features.

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.110
Needless to say, as technology and software
continues to rapidly progress, this sort of

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.270
thing is likely to see more and more blind
people wearing some form of smart glasses
