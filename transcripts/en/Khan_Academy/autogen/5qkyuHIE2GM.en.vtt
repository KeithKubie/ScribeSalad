00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.050
 Let's solve a few more problems from systems of linear equations 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.210
 In this lesson, we will decrypt systems that we can 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.860
 have no solution, or may suggest many solutions 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.440
 and we will describe them in words 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.700
 Let's start with one. 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:23.680
 Let's say we have 3x minus 4y equals 13. 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.250
 Let my other equation in the system y be equal to 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.320
 minus 3x minus y. 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.620
 The first thing that makes an impression is 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.100
 this strange form here. 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.940
 That's why I'll have to convert it 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.070
 and I will probably apply an abbreviation for this system. 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.140
 Let's translate the above equation. 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.620
 We have 3x minus 4y equals 13. 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.060
 Let's reorganize the lower equation now. 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.740
 Adding 2y - will shorten y from both 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.840
 sides of the equation 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.820
 With this abbreviation on both sides of the equation, it 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.820
 becomes 0 is equal to minus 3x minus 2y, or 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.860
 minus 3x minus 2y is equal to 0. 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.190
 Let's write it here from above. 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.735
 And now everything looks good, because I have a minus 3x here, 

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:17.070
 and I have plus 3x here. 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.076
 It seems appropriate for an abbreviation. 

00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:26.950
 I have negative 3x minus 2y is equal to 0. 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.440
 Now let's get the left side of this equation 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.270
 with the left side of the yellow equation. 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.200
 And on the right we'll get 0 with the right side 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.850
 of the yellow equation, actually we 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.890
 add 0 to both sides, 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.300
 That is, we add the same amount to both sides 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.210
 and that's what we always do with an equation. 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.350
 and so on the left after we cut 3x 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.410
 we will stay with minus 4 or minus 2. 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.950
 Which makes the minus 6 equals 13. 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.715
 We divide the two sides to minus 6. 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.640
 And we leave with minus y equal to minus 13/6. 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.330
 Now let's solve the equation for x. 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.570
 And we can find x using each of these equations 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.050
 Let's use the above, so for pleasure. 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.210
 We have 3 times x minus 4 times minus 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.540
 13/6 equals 13. 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.800
 Now we have a minus in minus, which 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.420
 gives a positive result. 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.560
 then 4/6, which is the same as 2/3. 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:44.430
 From here we get 3x plus 2 times 13, which makes 26/3, e 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.840
 equal to 13. 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.870
 Instead of 13 because I have to divide 26/3 on both sides 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.520
 let's write 13 as 39/3 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.830
 Is that clear? 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.750
 39 divided by 3 is 13. 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.785
 Let's split the two sides to 26/3. 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.500
 The left side is 3x, which is shortened 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.770
 equals 39 minus 26 is 13/3 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.360
 We will now want to divide the two sides into 3 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.920
 Or you can imagine it as a multiplication of 1/3. 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.240
 The left got up, there we left with x 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.850
 The right side is equal to 13/9. 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.010
 This is how this system has a well-defined solution 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.050
 The solution is x is equal to 13/9 and y is equal to 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.480
 minus 13/6. 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.250
 this has only one solution. 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.810
 if you imagine this solution graphically, these are two lines that are 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.300
 intersect exactly at one point. 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.220
 And in a system like this one just has one solution 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:07.300
 is called definite. 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.740
 Everything we've been doing so far is 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.910
 a certain system of linear equations. Let's get started now 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.120
 something that's a bit different. 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.690
 Let's have the system 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:25.190
 5x minus 4u is equal to 1. 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:32.340
 And minus 10x plus 8u is equal to 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.020
 minus 30. 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.180
 Once again, I'm forced to use the elimination method because 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.010
 I have minus 10x and 5x 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:48.310
 And if I take the above equation and multiply it by 2 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:58.410
 will become 10x minus 8 is equal to 2, right? 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.990
 I simply multiplied both sides by 2. 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:09.940
 If we collect the left side, we will get 0x plus 0e 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.180
 minus 28. 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.360
 So we actually got 0 that is equal to minus 28. 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.080
 This is odd. 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.260
 We know that this is not possible. 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.370
 Not true. 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.430
 That is, we receive an insubstantial opinion. 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.190
 We get the wrong result, and that's because 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.440
 no solution 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.760
 By solving a system of equations, it does not matter 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.550
 how do you do it, whether it's by the substitution method or 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.830
 by the method of elimination, as I did before. 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.620
 When you get a decision where 0 is equal 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.630
 the minus 28 or 5 is equal to 7 or two other things that clearly 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.420
 show that they are not equal to each other when they must be equal 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.020
 to each other because they are part of a system, we say 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.510
 that this is an incompatible system. 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.010
 And it will not have a solution. 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.960
 What does this equation mean, 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.800
 have no solution? 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.040
 Let's introduce them graphically. 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.030
 So I think you can easily imagine what it means 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.840
 no solution. 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.060
 So the first equation is 5x minus 4u is equal to 1. 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.730
 Let me present it in the shape of a sloping cross. 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:25.690
 And if we take 5x on both sides, we get minus 4x 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.870
 equal to minus 5x plus 1. 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.750
 dividing both sides to 4, equals 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:41.450
 to minus 5 / 4x minus 1/4, right? 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.500
 1 divided by minus 4. 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.100
 Here's the first equation, right here 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.690
 in the form of a sloping segment. 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.250
 Now let me write the second equation in 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.870
 the same shape. 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:57.390
 We have minus 10x plus 8u is equal to minus 30. 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.570
 Add 10x to both sides. 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.770
 We will get 8u is equal to 10x minus 30, and let's divide 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.450
 both sides of 8. 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:13.870
 We will get u equal to 10/8, is the same as 5/4. 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.020
 5/4 min 30/8. 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:25.030
 30/8 is actually 15/4. 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.230
 Opa, I actually made a mistake here 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.610
 By dividing the two sides of the equation into minus 4. 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.020
 minus 5 divided by minus 4 is plus 5/4. 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.580
 That is, I did not have to have a negative answer here. 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.650
 For a bit to bang. 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.170
 Here we should not have a negative answer. 

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.280
 Then I split 1 to minus 4, and I got minus 1/4. 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.090
 And let's go back to the two equations, what do you notice? 

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.350
 When we present them in the form of a sloping section, they have 

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.400
 the same slope, 5/4. 

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.210
 but have different y-values. 

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.160
 So how would their graphics look like? 

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.800
 Let me draw them. 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.860
 If this is my order y. 

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.170
 And this is my abscissa x. 

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.260
 according to this equation, the y point at 0 is negative 1.4. 

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.080
 Probably this is the point here. 

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.370
 And this goes to 5 / 4x. 

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.586
 This little more than 1. 

00:08:14.586 --> 00:08:16.110
 That's 1.25x. 

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:20.050
 That is, every time you move to the right with one, you will move with 1.25. 

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.490
 That would be like that. 

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.590
 I will draw it roughly. 

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.930
 I want you to get a simple idea. 

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.150
 This is how this right will look like. 

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:31.800
 Now this line, where y / values ​​are minus 15/4. 

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.980
 what is this 15/4? 

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.299
 3 and 3/4. 

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:41.020
 and assuming that this point is -1/4, the values ​​for y will be 

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.270
 somewhere down here. 

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.590
 I will do it in the same color. 

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.060
 Somewhere down here. 

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.420
 Let me go further down here. 

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.220
 That would be -15 / 4. 

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.400
 its inclination would be the same. 

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.610
 Each time you move the value to one right, you will 

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.200
 increases by 5/4, so the slope remains 

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.800
 same. 

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.700
 And what do you notice about these two lines? 

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.000
 They are parallel. 

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.350
 They have the same slope at different values ​​for y / beginning 

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.690
 so they would never cross. 

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:18.350
 These two lines will not cross. 

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.500
 Which means there is no point on the coordinate system 

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.250
 with coordinates x and y, to satisfy simultaneously 

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.000
 these two equations. 

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.220
 Remember, this right presents all the points you have 

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.910
 will solve this equation 

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.790
 This privilege shows all the points you have 

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.190
 will satisfy that equation. 

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.820
 Note, no point satisfies both. 

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.990
 There is no intersection for these reasons 

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.300
 this is an incompatible system 

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.550
 Let's decide another one, 

00:09:48.420 --> 00:10:00.990
 Let's say, I have 4 x plus 5y is equal to 0, and i have 3 x e 

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.520
 equal to 6y plus 4.5. 

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.725
 Actually, let's make a little different because I want it 

00:10:10.725 --> 00:10:13.460
 to show you all the different kinds that we can 

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.410
 visible in systems of equations. 

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.660
 I will delete this. 

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:30.240
 Let's say the first system is 3x minus 7y is equal to 1. 

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.880
 And the other equation in my system is 

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:44.540
 -6x plus 14y equals -2. 

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.860
 So, let's try to find values ​​for x and y that make it more astonishing 

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:48.570
 equation here. 

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.550
 And just to change the pace, let's make a substitution. 

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.210
 Though it's very tempting to make an acronym here, let's 

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.080
 we use the substitution method. 

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.470
 You take 3x. 

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.490
 Let's solve it for x. 

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.120
 Actually let's just eliminate it because it is 

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.860
 just so brightly prepared for elimination, let's 

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:10.710
 just do it this way. 

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.090
 So, let's multiply this upper equation by 2. 

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.340
 And what do we get? 

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:23.140
 Get 6x minus 14y equals 2, so? 

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.750
 I just multiplied each unit on both sides of 2. 

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.810
 Now, let's collect the left sides. 

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.866
 You get 0 plus 0. 

00:11:31.866 --> 00:11:34.870
 And on the right side, you get is equal to 0. 

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.270
 You get 0 is equal to 0, which is always going to be true. 

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.410
 This type of system is called an undefined system. 

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.550
 So, remember when you get a clear decision, that's it 

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.780
 certain system. 

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.660
 When you get something abnormal like 0 is equal to 1 that 

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:53.730
 incompatible system. 

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.630
 This means that the steps are parallel. 

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.980
 When you get 0 equal to 0 or 1 equals 1 or something like that 

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.210
 that you are dealing with an undefined system. 

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:04.510
 Which really means that they are exactly the same, and even 

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.450
 although they may look slightly different. 

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.730
 And to check this out, we need to convert to 

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.430
 their graphic form. 

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:15.940
 So, this top row, you have 3x minus 7y is equal to 1. 

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.080
 Let it take 3x on both sides. 

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:23.360
 You will get -7y is equal to-3x plus 1. 

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.510
 Now let's divide the two sides with -7. 

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:33.020
 You get y is equal to positive 3/7 x minus 1/7. 

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.930
 That is, the first equation. 

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.510
 Now let's put the second equation in 

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.320
 graphic form. 

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:44.570
 You have -6x plus 14y equals - 2. 

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.550
 Let's add 6x to both sides of the equation. 

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:54.140
 So we get 14y is equal to 6x minus 2. 

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.430
 Then we divide the two sides of the equation by 14. 

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:03.490
 You get y is equal to 6 / 14x minus 2/14. 

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:04.690
 This is the same thing. 

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:10.900
 6/14 is the same as 3 / 7x minus 1/7. 

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.390
 Notice that they are exactly the same equation. 

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.890
 So if you want to find values ​​for x and y's that match for both, 

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.470
 think about it. 

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.750
 We present it graphically. 

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:26.380
 So if this is my coordinate plane, that's ax y, that 

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.580
 is x-axis. 

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.600
 This chart will look like this. 

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.790
 I will draw it roughly. 

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:36.880
 It may look something like where the slope is 3/7. 

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.470
 This right will look similar. 

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:39.970
 This right seems exactly the same. 

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.730
 This is the same right. 

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.010
 You will say, well, what are the values ​​for x and y, 

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.500
 to satisfy both of these equations? 

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.110
 This is every x and y that lie on these lines. 

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.070
 These are these x and y. 

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:50.750
 These coordinates. 

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:51.310
 These coordinates. 

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:52.110
 These coordinates. 

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.260
 There is an endless number of solutions. 

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.140
 And when we use the word dependent, because you can 

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.200
 take one of these equations from one another. 

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.240
 These equations are dependent on one another. 

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.950
 You can change their scale or rearrange them, and 

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:05.930
 they will still be equal to each other. 

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.020
 Here you have endless many solutions. 

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.950
 Everything that is responsible for one right will satisfy the other. 

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.350
 So just choose x. 

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:21.080
 When x is 1, you get 3/7 minus 1/7 this is 2/7. 

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:25.470
 So 1, 2/7 answers for both equations. 

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.910
 If you select x is equal to 0. 

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.490
 0, negative 1/7 meets the two equations. 

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.210
 And you can choose an infinite number of values ​​for x, the solutions 

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:38.400
 for y and these coordinates will satisfy both equations. 

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.040
 Let me review this a little bit. 

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.380
 So we only started with plain vanilla. 

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.120
 When you actually get a decision that is in the definite. 

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.240
 In fact, these lines are intersecting at one point. 

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.650
 Then you have a situation where you can get something abnormal, 

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.070
 when you decide your system of equations. 

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.890
 0 equals -28. 

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.330
 Definitely not true. 

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.180
 This is an incompatible system. 

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.890
 There is no solution, which means that 

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.690
 these lines are parallel. 

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.570
 They never cross. 

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.520
 And then, finally, if you get something that's always true-- 

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.920
 It's just kind of stupid how true it is - it is 

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.910
 undefined system. 

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.700
 The rights overlap. 

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.340
 You can check this by entering both of them in 

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.840
 graphic form.
