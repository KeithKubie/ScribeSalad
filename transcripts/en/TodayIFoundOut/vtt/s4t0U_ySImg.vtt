00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.400
Worryingly described by entomologists and
arachnologists as a “not uncommon” occurrence

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.619
in certain parts of the globe, spider rain
can see anywhere from a few thousand to several

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.619
million spiders tumble from the sky in a given
area, seemingly out of nowhere.

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.390
So what causes it?

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.620
This is thanks to a rather interesting behaviour
exhibited by spiders known as ballooning,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.620
which essentially involves an individual spider
climbing to a high point and then firing strands

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.470
of silk into the air, with the result being
the spider being carried away by the wind,

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.550
sometimes for many hundreds of miles.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.040
Arachnologists are quick to point out that
countless spiders are probably flying around

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.640
over head at any particular time and that
they usually land without much fanfare and

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.739
go about their way.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.380
Sometimes, though, many thousands or millions
of spiders will decide to balloon at the exact

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.470
same time, either because they’re a single
colony or because weather conditions force

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.470
them to.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.250
In regards to the latter, on rare occasions
certain weather patterns can see the millions

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.900
of spiders floating through the air at any
given time being thrown to Earth simultaneously

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.220
at the same location.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.810
Other known causes of spider rain are floods
and wildfires, which can prompt spiders to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.110
flee en masse to escape what would otherwise
be their own demise, concerningly illustrating

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.000
that the age old “kill it with fire” way
of getting rid of spiders isn’t fool-proof.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.720
As an example of the former flood trigger
phenomenon, in Pakistan following devastating

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.590
floods throughout the country in 2010, millions
of spiders noped out of there in a hurry via

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.760
mass ballooning.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.540
While you’d expect the people of Pakistan
to be unhappy about having to deal with both

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.010
millions of spiders raining from the sky and
floods, the spiders were seen as a good thing

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.979
by most citizens because they ate all the
mosquitoes.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.770
On that note, in addition to ensuring the
skies remain free of disease carrying insects,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.830
wandering clouds of spiders also provide ample
food for birds and other creatures- a fact

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.850
that combined with spiders often being amongst
the first creatures to return to land devastated

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.180
by flood and fire (via ballooning and landing
back in the area), means that spider rain

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.299
is generally seen as being an overall beneficial
thing for nature via allowing these staples

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.700
of the food chain to quickly and widely disperse
themselves.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.610
While you can observe individual spiders floating
about in most regions of the Earth, if you’re

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.620
wanting so see the specific phenomenon of
spider rain, where millions of spiders fall

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.910
from above en masse, your best bet is to live
in certain regions of Australia (because,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.400
of course it’s Australia where this is most
common).

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.209
As New South Wales resident Keith Basterfield
states, “They fly through the sky and then

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.540
we see these falls of spiderwebs that look
almost as if it’s snowing.”

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.540
(You can see something of this effect here
in a video shot in Texas.)

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.190
Luckily for arachnophobes, mass ballooning
is a behaviour near exclusively observed in

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.569
smaller species of spider or ones that were
born very recently, as larger spiders are

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.230
simply too heavy to be carried along by typical
winds.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.410
As a result, if you’re currently imagining
endless waves of tarantulas raining from the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.800
sky, you can rest assured that if you ever
witness spider rain firsthand, at least you

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.210
won’t be dealing with big spiders, just
the little ones that can crawl around on you

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.849
without you even noticing they’re there…

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.150
This is also significant because most small
spiders don’t posses the ability to penetrate

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.470
human skin with their bites, even if they
are otherwise highly venomous.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.640
Thus, for the most part, spider rain is harmless
(to humans).

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.170
However, the phenomenon can potentially damage
crops when millions of spiders all land in

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.530
the same location, with their subsequent webs
cutting the plants off from enough sunlight.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.890
But I think the main point we want to drive
home to arachnophobes is that some spiders

00:03:37.890 --> 00:04:01.909
can fly, and at any given time they may just
fall from the sky on top of your head…
