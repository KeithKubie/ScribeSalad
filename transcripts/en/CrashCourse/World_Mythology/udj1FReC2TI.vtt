00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
Hey there. I'm Mike Rugnetta. This is crash course Mythology, and today we're continuing with Tricksters

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.400
We're going to look at the trickster as a culture hero

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.269
Meaning someone whose creativity adds to the culture of the mythological world they inhabit

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.669
We're going to focus on Europe in this episode looking specifically at Hermes the greek version of Thoth here and also

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.910
Loki- who in today's myth actually somehow isn't the worst

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.879
...Sorta- I mean he does disguise himself as a biting fly so he's definitely not like the best

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.699
We haven't talked much about Hermes because there aren't too many myths where he's a main character – usually he's a messenger

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.100
More than a central focus, but hey, fun fact, he has a big presence in statuary

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.150
Hermes was a phallic God and all around Greece

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.349
You could find square pillars topped with a bust of his head and featuring a

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.160
male member

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.100
These are called herms and were frequently placed at crossroads

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.830
Since Hermes was also the God of travelers and rode maybe these herms were meant to

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.500
...Point travelers in the right direction?

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.500
Tricksters like Hermes are often associated with extreme sexual appetites and also with

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.140
Creativity a connection which makes a lot of sense when we think back to our stories about the creation of the world

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.060
But instead of getting into all that

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.060
Let's explore one of the most famous myths about Hermes which begins when he was just a wee little baby trickster

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.830
Okay, so, baby Hermes sneaks out of his cradle and killed a tortoise. I don't know what you were expecting

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.110
We're talking about Tricksters anyway

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:41.249
He turns the tortoise shell into a lyre which he starts to play inventing lyrics to accompany his music; pretty creative for a baby

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:47.369
He probably went to a montessori school. Then Hermes gets hungry, but not for milk: he wants some meat

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.579
So he runs to Pieria where his brother Apollo keeps his sacred cattle –Hermes steals

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.619
50 cows and hides them in a nearby cave. To get them into the cave

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.109
He makes them walk backwards so their footprints would be difficult to follow. He also invents some backwards

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.400
Sandals that hide his own tracks- again, clever baby

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.640
Hermes whips up a fire, kills two of the cows and roasts them

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.779
But doesn't eat them, which is kind of strange since he's supposedly so hungry, instead

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.679
He hides the meat and cowskins in the cave, throws his sandals in the river and covers over the fire. Then he just

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.600
strolls on back to his cradle. Apollo soon learns that some of his cattle are missing and he is furious

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.100
Despite all of Hermes' stealth efforts Apollo figures it all out and threatens to throw him into Tartarus

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.300
Hermes defends himself saying he's only a baby how could he steal 50 cows?

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.400
Apollo doesn't care how old his brother is but he can't punish Hermes without some judgment from their dad

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Zeus listens to Hermes' denials but doesn't believe him

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.400
And orders the baby to bring back all those poor cows

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.700
Afterward Hermes and Apollo make up and they exchange gifts

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.100
Apollo gives Hermes a whip as a symbol of cattle tending and the caduceus as a symbol of heraldry

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.460
Indicating Hermes' position as messenger of the Gods

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.200
Hermes gives Apollo the lyre he had invented and this becomes Apollo's symbol as a god of music

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.600
Although many Tricksters seem more human or more animal than divine

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.169
Hermes is definitely supernatural

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.140
There's obviously something pretty special about this baby

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.100
Who's not only an able thief, but a smooth talker, and a tortoise murderer to boot

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.229
As David Leeming observes in this myth, "Hermes has the trickster qualities of

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.360
deceitfulness, trickery, childishness,

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.500
amorality, humor, extreme inventiveness and great charm."

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.380
It's his inventiveness that makes him a culture hero, though- his creation of the lyre is incredibly important

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.339
It becomes Apollo's main instrument and one of the symbols of his divine attributes

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.880
It's also significant because songs are one of the ways stories like this one were passed down in the ancient Greek world

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.339
And there's also something interesting about Hermes having to kill an animal to create the lyre. Perhaps

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.040
it's a reminder that creation is often the flipside of

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.499
Destruction that the two sometimes require each other; either way in this story, Hermes' mischief is

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.459
Basically harmless unless you're a cow or that poor tortoise

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.849
So I guess not really harmless, just harmless by like normal deity standards.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.600
And it ultimately brings about something positive for all involved

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.879
Again, except the cows and the tortoise

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.089
it also explains the origin of a mythical artifact that defines the character of the God Apollo and the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.000
Greek culture that worshiped him

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.780
For our second story, we have another myth

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.570
where the trickster's mischief impacts a whole culture; as with many Norse myths it begins and ends with

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.429
Loki who is the worst; one morning Thor wakes up next to his beautiful wife Sif and sees that something is missing

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:50.410
Her beautiful blonde hair. Sif is understandably upset, and she begs her husband to fix the problem. Thor has a sneaking suspicion

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.820
And heads off to see Loki- at first Loki denies doing anything

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.699
But when Thor threatens to break every bone in Loki's body, Loki admits that yes, he'd stolen Sif's hair

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.400
He'd been hitting the mead got to thinking wouldn't it be funny. You know

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:06.860
disappearing hair?

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.600
Hilarious.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:14.200
Unsurprisingly, Thor doesn't appreciate the humor and threatens him again with a most Norse undoing

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.549
So Loki offers to fix the problem saying that he can get Sif even better hair

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.020
Thor agrees and lets Loki venture to the land of the dwarves

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.000
What is it with Tricksters and dwarves? After that Anansi story from the last episode

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.260
I have a bad feeling about this- his first stop the sons of Ivaldi, three dwarves known for their ability at the forge

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.849
Loki says that the gods of asgard know of their great ability

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:41.000
But that really they're only the second best craftsmen among the dwarves

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.299
Behind the brothers Brokk and Eitri. The sons of Ivaldi declared that they will not be outdone and

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.479
Promised to make three treasures for the Gods- one of which Loki says must be magical golden hair

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:58.929
Then loki goes off to see Brokk and Eitri- you can probably see where this is headed, he tells them about what the sons

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.779
of Ivaldi are going to do and Brokk the talker says that he and his brother can outdo those Ivaldis, no problem.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:11.600
Loki bets him he can't and Brokk takes the bet but says that if the gods like his and Eitri's treasures best

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:16.100
Brokk gets to take Loki's head; Loki accepts.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.339
Eitri, the master craftsmen amongst the two brothers, tells Brokk to man the bellows and to keep

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:28.179
pumping no matter what, so the temperature of their forge remains constant. Brokk keeps up his pumping for the first two treasures

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.319
despite being bitten on the hand and then the neck by a large

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.100
pesky fly who is, of course, Loki.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.889
By the time Eitri is working on the third project, Loki the fly is

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.000
really beginning to worry that he might lose the bet, so he starts biting Brokk's eyebrows.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.139
At one point Brokk brushes the blood from his eyes and

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:53.709
just for a second breaks his rhythm. When Eitri finishes making the treasure he chastises his brother for the

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.050
imperfections caused by his erratic

00:06:56.719 --> 00:07:01.119
oxygenating, but says that his gift will have to do. Loki brings the Ivaldis

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.370
treasures back to Asgard, Brokk brings his and his brother's- Loki reveals his treasures first

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.400
And we reveal the thought-bubble to see who wins

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.469
The first treasure is Sif's new head of hair made from gold. When she puts the wig it fuses

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:21.770
with her scalp and behaves like real hair. She is ecstatic, the gods are impressed. Next, Loki presents

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:28.159
Odin with a spear- Gugnir- when thrown, it always hits its mark, useful for an old one-eyed

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.679
God with suspect aim; also, any oath sworn on Gugnir is unbreakable.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.649
Odin is pleased but not effusive in his praise –

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:43.969
classic Dad move – the final treasure is for Freyr, brother of Freya we've discussed in the past. This treasure looks like a handkerchief

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:50.690
but when unfolded it becomes Skidbladnir, a magic boat big enough to carry all of the Aesir

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:55.700
and it will always have a fair wind, pretty great for a seagoing people.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:00.589
Loki is pleased but Brokk is still confident that his gifts will be better. First

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:05.540
he unveils a golden Bristle Boar, Gullinbursti. It glows in the dark, pulls

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:11.450
Freyr's chariot, runs over water, and goes faster than any horse; Freyr is pleased

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.770
but Loki says it's nothing compared to a folding ship which is just I mean come on

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.850
It's a glowing chariot boar- the next gift is a Golden armband

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:27.260
called Draupnir which Odin wears. Draupnir multiplies itself- every night eight identical rings drip from it greatly

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.670
enriching its owner. Why gods need gold is a bit beyond me, frankly,

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:38.150
but hey, Odin? Psyched. The last gift is Eitri's third project, the one erratically oxygenated.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:44.060
It's a hammer and even Brokk has to admit that the handle is a little too short,

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:50.390
but that doesn't really matter once Thor gets his hands on it. This is Mjolnir,

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:56.900
an unbreakable hammer- it always hits its mark and always comes back to the hand that throws it and for Thor,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:03.650
it's love at first sight- the rest of the Aesir agree because with Mjolnir, Thor will always be able to protect them from Giants.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.210
The Aesir announced that Brokk and Eitri's gifts are the best and they're all happy,

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.140
except for Loki who totally dumped on himself.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:12.560
Thanks thought bubble!

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:19.520
Now that he's lost the bet, Loki starts sweating and making excuses to Brokk, but Brokk only pulls out his knife and starts talking about

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.609
all the stuff he and his brother are going to make out of Loki's head.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.520
Increasingly desperate, Loki starts looking to the other gods for help

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:31.309
but no one's buying it- a bet's a bet and Loki lost- even after cheating, Loki thinks quick:

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.320
He's got one more trick up his sleeve.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.189
Loki explains that yes, Brokk does have a right to his head,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.410
but that the bet didn't include any part of his neck, so he's welcome to the head,

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:48.859
but only if he can get it without cutting the neck. Brokk calls shenanigans and appeals directly to Odin,

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.210
but in perhaps the earliest example of getting off on a technicality, the one-eyed all-father

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:58.190
agrees with Loki and Brokk has to go home with his own head in his hands

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:02.450
instead of Loki's. Classic Trickster stories like these often involve serious

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:09.739
transgressions against society. In this case it's stealing and not just from humans but from other gods. Neither

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:14.989
Loki nor Hermes has a good reason for their thefts either- in fact their excuses are downright immature:

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:21.859
I was drunk, and I'm a baby. Though to be fair, both do end up presenting important gifts to their fellow

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.510
Gods, ones that become foundations of the stories told about them for millennia.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:32.390
Loki in particular shows us that while tricksters often get away with their tricks, the result is not always a foregone conclusion.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:39.200
Despite his best efforts, Loki is set to pay a stiff price for stealing Sif's hair- first at Thor's hands

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.629
and then at Brokk's- in both cases it's only his wit that saves him. Like Anansi,

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:50.539
Loki can talk his way out of a pickle and in this way provide a model for human behavior that other gods who rely on

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:56.060
their supernatural gifts simply can't. Most of us don't have super strength or magic hammers

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.729
but we all have brains and the ability to solve

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.140
problems even if we're the ones who made those problems for ourselves in the first place.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.660
Just don't go trying to grift any rubes. You might not get lucky like Loki and you could end up losing a little bit

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.870
too much off the top.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:17.179
