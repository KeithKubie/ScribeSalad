00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:03.436
(quirky sound)

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:07.173
- And Mookie walks into
my room, and she goes,

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.943 align:start size:94% position:6%
"I want to sleep here,"
and I'm like, "Oh, ha-ha!"

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.178
(hysterical laughter)

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.180
(audience laughter)

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.183
(techno rock music)

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.041
(audience applause)

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.575
- Here's the show,
it's very simple,

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:43.943
just a bunch of funny people,

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:45.412 align:start size:84% position:16%
who are all telling
true stories.

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:46.946
You guys might know
him from his podcast

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:49.115
"Occasionally Awesome" that
he does with Nick Youssef.

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.484
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr.
Kevin Christy everybody!

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:52.819
Let 'em hear it!

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:55.789
(audience applause)

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.760
- So, I'm a dude and I like
sex like sex like dudes do,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.063
but this one time in my life

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.964
I had to turn down sex.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:06.733
One time.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.001
(audience laughter)

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.235
'Cause like you,
you look like me,

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.504
that's not a thing
we should do. Ever.

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:14.140
(audience laughter)

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.743
I...we shouldn't, we shouldn't.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.379
Look, it's hard
for us to get it,

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.314 align:start size:97% position:3%
so when they offer we're like,
"Yeah this...it happened!"

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:23.049
So, you know, and
you understand,

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.818
we live the same existence.

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:26.586
(audience laughter)

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:27.954
So one time I got a job,

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:29.222
I got an acting job.

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:30.723
Okay I say it was a
job, it was a favor.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.258
A friend of mine asked me
to do a favor, he said,

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.594 align:start size:94% position:6%
"Will you be in this
thing?" And I said, "Yes,"

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.096
because he is black,

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.865
and I do whatever black people
tell me to 100% of the time.

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:40.366
(audience laughter)

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:43.036 align:start size:97% position:3%
'Cause I feel guilty about
slavery like I fucking should.

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:44.838
(audience laughter)

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:47.807
So I said "yes" to
doing this. Now,

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:50.643 align:start size:97% position:3%
when you work as an actor
sometimes, you go out of town,

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:51.945 align:start size:84% position:16%
they put you in a
hotel, it's awesome.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.179
You don't live there,
you didn't pay for it,

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.515 align:start size:88% position:13%
so you just rub your
ass all over everything.

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:58.318 align:start size:97% position:3%
You get naked as soon as you
walk in and rub your butt

00:01:58.318 --> 00:01:59.519
on everything they made.

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:01.454 align:start size:84% position:16%
You just ruin a
Radisson, it's great.

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:02.722
(audience laughter)

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:05.024
So I'm on my way to the
airport and I text him.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.993
I go, "Hey, what's the name of
the hotel we're staying at?"

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:08.528
And I get a text back that goes,

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:11.598
"No player, you're staying in
a condo with the other actors.

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:13.099
Bring your own sheets."

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.934
(audience laughter)

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.170
"Bring your own sheets" is
never a good thing to hear

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.405
in any circumstance, so I'm
like, I'm already going,

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.941 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm like, "Oh God."
So I get there,

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:25.612 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I'm staying in a condo
with four other people,

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:27.947 align:start size:84% position:16%
all of which are
way younger than me,

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:30.884
and are all drug addicts
who were just going to

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.052
bone the living shit
out of each other.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.687
It was like "The Real World,"

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:36.322
but then someone
brought their dad.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:38.558
(audience laughter)

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:40.193 align:start size:84% position:16%
So like I'm, they're
all in their 20s,

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:41.861
I'm angrily in my 30s,

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:45.999 align:start size:97% position:3%
and every night they all
get completely shit hammered

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.168
and bone the crap
out of each other,

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.403
it was like a rugby
scrum all the time.

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:51.871
(audience laughter)

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:53.139
It was crazy.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.541
And so where we were, we
were in a place called

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.143 align:start size:84% position:16%
Ocean City, Maryland,
which is called--

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:58.578
(audience yells)

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:00.013
You're the first
on to "woo" for it.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.247
(audience laughter)

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:04.117
Okay. To be fair it's
like a summer place,

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:06.085
where there's like a boardwalk,

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.687
but this was the winter, okay?

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:10.924
So it was like a fun beach
town with carnival games,

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:12.358
but in the dead of winter.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:13.960 align:start size:84% position:16%
So there would be
just like a weird guy

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.428
trying to sell flip flops

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:17.230 align:start size:97% position:3%
even though it was four
degrees outside. He's like,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.698
"Hey do you want
these flip flops?"

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.533
We're like, "No, why..." It's
like selling a snow shovel

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:22.402
here in Los Angeles, it's like
why are you doing this here?

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:23.803
This doesn't make
any fucking sense.

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:25.205
(audience laughter)

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:28.374 align:start position:0%
So it sucked, and we're
there...I'm there the whole time

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:29.576
with these people,

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:31.244
and every night they
would bone like I said.

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:33.880
Now, I had a side job as
an illustrator at the time.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.016 align:start size:88% position:13%
I had to do some artwork
while I was there,

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.451 align:start size:84% position:16%
but I couldn't
paint in my bedroom,

00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:40.587 align:start size:97% position:3%
I had to paint in the
kitchen because that's where

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:43.590 align:start size:97% position:3%
the table was. So every night,
I would be there painting,

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.524
and there'd be like
two 20 year-olds

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:46.793
fingering each other next to me,

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.861 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I'd be like
quietly painting a tree

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:50.863
for like a men's calendar.

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:52.198
"You guys look like
you're having fun,

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:53.600 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm just working on
this branch over here.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.434
Get off her!"

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:55.401
(audience laughter)

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:56.636
Like you know, it was a lot,

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:59.939 align:start size:88% position:13%
and then there was a
girl in the thing right,

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.541 align:start size:84% position:16%
who I don't remember
her real name,

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.743
but everybody called her
Mookie for some reason.

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:06.012 align:start size:94% position:6%
She was the hottest Latin
woman I've ever seen

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:07.981
in my whole fucking life.

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:11.284
And if you know anything about
Latin women, they're better.

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:12.352
That's just how the world works.

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:13.853
(audience laughter)

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:15.521 align:start size:97% position:3%
And the thing is, when they're
hot, they're nice about it,

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.423
Whereas like white hot
women are just dicks.

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:18.658
(audience laughter)

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:20.159 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like they just think
they're so great,

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.828
whereas like Latin women are
hot, you're like "You're hot!"

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:23.296 align:start size:84% position:16%
They're like
"Really, seriously?"

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:24.797
Like it's something they
don't know, it's fantastic,

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:26.633
whereas like when you tell
a white woman she's hot,

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.334
she's like "Really?
I know." You're like,

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:29.869
"Oh, this is awful."

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:30.837
(audience laughter)

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:32.505
So Mookie was the hottest,

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:34.907 align:start size:84% position:16%
and she was just...
all the best,

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:36.843
like the greatest things
about like Latin women

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:38.111
were everything she was.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.479
All she talked about was
how she loved dancing,

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.680
so everything was like,

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.181
"The thing about
me is I'm just like

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:44.684
dancing dancing dancing, ba
ba ba ba ba, living life,"

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:46.252 align:start size:84% position:16%
like that was her
answer to everything.

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:47.186
(audience laughter)

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:48.421
You're just like,

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:49.922
"Hey what do you think
about the Middle East?"

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:51.991
"Dancing dancing dancing,
ba ba ba, living life."

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:54.827 align:start size:94% position:6%
You're like, "This is
awesome, you're awesome."

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:56.362 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now, every night
she would get wasted

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:57.830
and try to hook
up with somebody.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.133
Boys, girls, didn't matter,
she was going to get it.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.502 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's how much she
loved, you understand?

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:04.871 align:start size:94% position:6%
And it was so nice of her,
'cause she was so hot,

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.973
she was like, "Everyone
should experience this,

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.508
regardless of sex."

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:10.343 align:start size:97% position:3%
And so, every night she
would hook up with somebody.

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.412
Now I wasn't engaging in this

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:14.314
because I was at the
time engaged, okay?

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:18.184
And so one night, I'm in my
room quietly reading a book

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:20.186
like a sad white person,

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:21.888
and all of a sudden

00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:25.191
I hear footsteps just
coming down the hall,

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:29.362 align:start size:97% position:3%
and then I hear my door
quietly open, and it's Mookie.

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:32.365
And Mookie walks into
my room, and she goes,

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:34.701
"I want to sleep here."

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:37.203
(audience laughter)

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:38.371
Okay.

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:41.407 align:start size:84% position:16%
And at that moment,
instant boner.

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:42.408
(audience laughter)

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:45.111
Like just like a
a rocket launch.

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:47.347
My dick was like, "Seriously?!"

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:50.450 align:start size:88% position:13%
Like it just got so
excited, and she's like,

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.051
"I want to sleep here."

00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:53.419
And I'm like, "Oh, ha-ha!"

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.423
(laughing hysterically)

00:05:57.423 --> 00:06:01.260
Just started laughing, and
then it turned into tears,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.329
and I'm like, "Oh
Mookie you can't,

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:04.831
you can't sleep here,

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:06.999
you can't sleep
here, you can't."

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:08.634
And she's like, "No I
want to sleep here."

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:09.469
And I'm like, "You can't,"

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:10.636
she goes, "Why?"

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:11.838 align:start size:84% position:16%
I go, "'Cause
Mookie, I'm engaged,

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:13.606 align:start size:84% position:16%
that's basically
like being married."

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:15.108
And all out of nowhere she goes,

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:17.343
"I'm married to Christos 10
years, I don't love him!"

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:19.645
(audience laughter)

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:21.814
And I'm like, "That's
a lot of info for me."

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:24.250
Who marries a guy named
Christos first of all?

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.619 align:start size:88% position:13%
That's a weird ass name.
Did he have a yacht?

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:28.654 align:start position:0%
If he doesn't that's lame,
'cause if your name is Christos,

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:29.589
you should have a fucking yacht.

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:31.524
(audience laughter)

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:33.025
So then I'm like,

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:35.395
"No I'm sorry about you and
Christos, that's a bummer,

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.030
but you still can't sleep here."

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.900 align:start size:94% position:6%
And then she goes, "I
want to be warm with you."

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.636
(audience laughter)

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:45.304
Which, think about
how good that sounds.

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:50.042
Like that's so vague, like
again, even my dick was like,

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:51.844 align:start size:81% position:19%
"I want to be warm
with you too."

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:52.979
(audience laughter)

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.247
And even my heart was like,

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.448
"I would like to be
warm with her Kevin,

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:57.817 align:start size:84% position:16%
can we get this
done?" And I'm like,

00:06:57.817 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start size:97% position:3%
"I'm sorry you can't be
warm with me, that's not...

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.123
I'm sorry, you can't." And
then she gets mad. She goes,

00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:06.426
"You make me lonely!" Like that.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:07.927
(audience laughter)

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:11.731
And I go, "I'm sorry, I'm
sorry I make you lonely,

00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:14.934 align:start size:97% position:3%
but you still can't." And
she goes, "You're so smart."

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.202
And I go, "Yeah it's
ruined everything.

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:17.036
It's ruined my whole life."

00:07:17.036 --> 00:07:17.870
(audience laughter)

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.805
"I wish I was less,

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.873
we'd be boning right now!"

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:22.809 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I'm like,
"Still you can't--"

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:24.110
And then she goes
to get on the bed,

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.012
and so I have to get
off the bed immediately

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.747 align:start size:84% position:16%
because that's some
real relationship shit

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:29.248
where you're like,
"Nothing happened!"

00:07:29.248 --> 00:07:30.583
And she's like, "Were you on
the bed at the same time?"

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:31.617 align:start size:88% position:13%
And you're like,
"Yeah," and she's like,

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:32.585
"Well then we're over!"

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:34.120
It's some real white lady crap.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.388
(audience laughter)

00:07:35.388 --> 00:07:38.157
And so, she gets on the
bed, I get off the bed,

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:40.493
and then she keeps going, "I
want to be warm with you."

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:44.230 align:start position:0%
And she puts her perfect
caramel-colored butt in the air,

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.533 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I look at it,
and it's everything.

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:50.536
(audience laughter)

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:54.941
And so she starts kind
of crawling towards me,

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:56.375
like an 80s metal video.

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:58.277
(audience laughter)

00:07:58.277 --> 00:08:02.215
And I'm like, "This is the
best! I'm in "Whitesnake.""

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:04.650
And she's crawling towards me,

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.119
and at that point
I go, "Mookie no!"

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:10.122
(audience laughter)

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:13.759
Like she was a dog, and
it felt real racist.

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:16.596 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'll be honest with you, it
didn't feel good to do or say,

00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:19.298
and the sad thing was
it worked perfectly.

00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:20.867
She just, you know.

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:23.436
And she gets up and she's like,

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:26.138
"Fine!"

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:30.209
Like that. But then, she
takes her underpants off,

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:33.980 align:start size:88% position:13%
and shows it to me.
She's like 'look at it.'

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.582
Basically she stood there like,

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:38.417
with it out, you know.

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:39.919
(audience laughter)

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.889
And it was like looking at
the Sun, but it didn't hurt.

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:43.723
(audience laughter)

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:45.224
And I mean it's like

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:46.893
you can finally just stare
at the Sun for a long time,

00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:48.928
and you're like, "Look
the center of everything,

00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:49.996
the reason there's anything."

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:52.999
(audience laughter)

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:56.435
And then again, I have to go,
"Mookie no, get out of here!"

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:57.970
(audience laughter)

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.406
And she leaves, she leaves,
I hear her go back upstairs.

00:09:00.406 --> 00:09:03.709
And so what I do
as a guilty person,

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:05.244
I call my fiancee,

00:09:05.244 --> 00:09:06.779
even though nothing happened,

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:08.447
I call her 'cause I'm like I
gotta tell her what happened

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:10.983 align:start size:88% position:13%
so I don't get in
trouble. So I call her.

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:13.085 align:start size:88% position:13%
She's...I start telling
her...she's having

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:14.420
a girls' night at our house,

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.089
so she puts me on speaker phone,

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:19.458
makes me tell the whole story,

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:21.661 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then her friends
just laugh at me.

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:23.029
(audience laughter)

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:24.463 align:start size:84% position:16%
And they're like,
"You're such a pussy.

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:27.300 align:start size:97% position:3%
Anyone else in the world
would've nailed this perfect,

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.501
'cause they looked her up.

00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:29.735
I'm like, "This is
what she looks like."

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:31.237
They looked her
up, they're like,

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:32.505
"Anyone else would've nailed
her, you should've nailed her.

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:34.340
This is the hottest
woman you've ever."

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.776
But, this is the hottest
woman to ever offer me sex

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:39.412
in my entire life, and
the rest of my life.

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:42.281 align:start size:97% position:3%
Whoever, I'm single now, I'm
sorry to whoever I marry,

00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:44.216
you lost already.
She was the best.

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:45.918
(audience laughter)

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:49.322
They laughed at me,
and it just felt like

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:52.525 align:start position:0%
having a winning lottery ticket
and then just burning it.

00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:54.126
(audience laughter)

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:55.528
And you're like, "No no no,

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:57.964 align:start size:97% position:3%
I don't need that $20 million
on that lottery ticket

00:09:57.964 --> 00:10:00.766 align:start size:84% position:16%
because I got $11
in checking at home,

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:04.003
and I'm good with that, you
can take your 20 million.

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:05.338
I'm burning it, I don't need it!

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:07.506
I don't care, I got $11
in checking at home."

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:11.210
And I'm not saying my
fiancee was worth $11,

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.881
but we're divorced now so
actually cost me thousands.

00:10:15.881 --> 00:10:17.116
(laughing)

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:18.651
(audience laughter)

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:20.620
And the moral of the story is
this: What should I have done?

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.088 align:start size:88% position:13%
(audience member yells,
"Slept with her!")

00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:23.489 align:start size:94% position:6%
(audience member, "Fucked
the shit out of her!"

00:10:23.489 --> 00:10:26.125
(audience laughter)

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:26.959
Exactly sir.

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:29.061
(audience laughter)

00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:30.997
There should've been
no sleeping ma'am.

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:32.264
(laughing)

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:33.799
Thank you so much, my
name is Kevin Christy.

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:34.967
(audience applause)
