00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:03.599
Asexuality is an extremely misunderstood sexual identity.

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:06.839
Sexual intimacy is important for many of us.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.320
Because most of society deems sexual attraction important, asexuals are often ostracized and even

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.239
pitied for their sexual orientation.

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:23.339
Asexual people often feel out of place because of the lack of knowledge concerning asexuality. Well, we've got some news for you.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.910
Asexual people don't need your pity. They need your understanding.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.349
Confused about what it means to be asexual?  Psych2Go has a list of the basics that the ace community would like you to know.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.020
What is asexuality?

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.709
Asexuality is broadly defined as a lack of sexual attraction.

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.589
People who identify as asexual or ace are not typically sexually attracted to anyone.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.510
According to current statistics,

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.510
1% of the North American population

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.850
identifies as asexual, though many sexual psychology experts believe this number is higher.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.600
Asexuality is a sexual orientation.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.890
Asexuality is a sexual orientation that falls in line with heterosexuality, or bisexuality, or homosexuality.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.049
Asexuality can sometimes work in tandem with another orientation.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.419
An individual can identify as asexual but can be romantically attracted to other people

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.758
Some asexuals don't date.  Some asexual people are a romantic.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.460
They do not feel romantic attraction to people and so they don't feel the need to seek dates or relationships.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.700
Some asexuals do date.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:41.610
Asexuality is not a fear of intimacy. Many asexual people do have romantic attractions to other people and actively seek relationships.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.529
Asexual people can seek connections with other people of the opposite sex: heteroromantic, or people of the same or either sex:

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.990
homoromantic and biromantic,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.240
respectively.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.280
Asexuality is not celibacy.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.439
Celibacy is a decision that an individual makes. It is the choice to refrain from sexual conduct.

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.449
Asexuality is an orientation, an attitude and feeling towards sexuality.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.270
Asexuality is not a disorder. There is nothing wrong with being asexual.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.219
Asexuality is not something that needs to be fixed. Many people confuse

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:24.959
asexuality with disorders like sexual aversion disorder or SAD, which is a persistent and fear-based avoidance of sexual contact.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.519
People with SAD often experience distress or panic during sex.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.130
SAD is a mental condition.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.209
Asexual people may feel anxious about societal pressure to be sexually active but, sex itself is not an anxiety.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.750
An asexual person just doesn't view sex as an interest.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.559
Asexuals can enjoy sexual intimacy.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.420
Asexuality is a spectrum and not everyone lies on the same notch on the scale.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.110
There are in fact asexuals who enjoy sexual experiences.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.289
While many don't feel the need to, some asexual people do masturbate and explore sexuality on their own.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.239
Others can enjoy sexual intimacy with others while not being sexually attracted to anyone.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.940
Just as with other sexualities,

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.609
asexuality is different for every individual.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.170
