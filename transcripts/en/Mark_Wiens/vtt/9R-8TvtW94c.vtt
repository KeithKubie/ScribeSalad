00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:02.128
- That is unbelievably good,

00:00:02.128 --> 00:00:03.808
just the combination of everything,

00:00:03.808 --> 00:00:06.808
the little patties, the fluffy loaf.

00:00:09.264 --> 00:00:12.097
(energetic music)

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:16.276
Good morning everyone.

00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:17.523
It's Mark Wiens with migrationology.com.

00:00:17.523 --> 00:00:20.870
We just boarded our
Turkish Airlines flight,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.669
and we are flying to
Istanbul this morning.

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.169
It's about 1:30AM.

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.006
I am getting really sleepy,

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.110
so I'm probably gonna sleep right now

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.682
until we take off, and
I will hopefully wake up

00:00:31.682 --> 00:00:32.765
for the food.

00:00:35.793 --> 00:00:37.683
One of the things that is very important

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:40.564
and very famous is Turkish breakfast,

00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:43.573
and I am having my first
ever Turkish breakfast

00:00:43.573 --> 00:00:45.507
on Turkish Airlines.

00:00:45.507 --> 00:00:47.541
Got an assortment of
cheese and vegetables,

00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:49.900
some fruit, some olives.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.133
I'm not sure what this is.

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:55.447
I think some sweets and some
bread and some chocolate.

00:00:55.447 --> 00:00:56.993
I'm gonna go.

00:00:56.993 --> 00:00:58.504
And this is the piece of bread I chose,

00:00:58.504 --> 00:01:00.171
a nutty little loaf.

00:01:06.254 --> 00:01:08.587
Oh that is some good cheese.

00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:12.315
And olive.

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:19.480
I just read on the menu, this
is sun-dried tomato spread.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.469
I think I will add that to my bread

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.802
and maybe go in for some cheese as well.

00:01:32.304 --> 00:01:36.991
Those are like sour, tart
tomatoes in jam form.

00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:38.198
Oh yeah.

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:40.757
It's like a little mini
pizza I just created.

00:01:40.757 --> 00:01:43.090
And then this is honey comb.

00:01:47.654 --> 00:01:51.154
Oh I've never seen honey like that before.

00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:56.726
That is some good honey.

00:01:56.726 --> 00:01:58.363
Sweet and very fragrant.

00:01:58.363 --> 00:01:59.496
Now this is the main course.

00:01:59.496 --> 00:02:02.725
I got the omelet with spinach
and potatoes on the bottom.

00:02:02.725 --> 00:02:04.932
Check out this little pepper bottle.

00:02:04.932 --> 00:02:08.349
Omelets and pepper is always a good idea.

00:02:15.024 --> 00:02:16.691
Dig into the omelet.

00:02:20.947 --> 00:02:25.850
Oh that has a very nice
kinda spongy texture to it.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.350
(upbeat electronic music)

00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:46.898
(flight attendant speaking
in foreign language)

00:02:57.111 --> 00:02:58.934
Okay, welcome to Istanbul.

00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:01.026
I think it's sometime around five AM,

00:03:01.026 --> 00:03:04.215
and we are exiting to take
a bus to the terminal.

00:03:04.215 --> 00:03:07.213
I was hoping since we
arrived just after five AM

00:03:07.213 --> 00:03:09.866
that immigration was gonna be pretty easy,

00:03:09.866 --> 00:03:11.609
but it was packed.

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.457
We waited in line for at least an hour,

00:03:13.457 --> 00:03:15.021
but we got through.

00:03:15.021 --> 00:03:18.227
Now gonna grab our bag and
then head into the city.

00:03:18.227 --> 00:03:20.412
That being said, I am extremely excited

00:03:20.412 --> 00:03:22.040
to be in Istanbul.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.041
Because we're not in a rush,

00:03:23.041 --> 00:03:25.786
we're gonna try to look for a bus

00:03:25.786 --> 00:03:28.073
that's going to take us to Taksim,

00:03:28.073 --> 00:03:29.830
which I think is straight up ahead.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.747
That morning sunshine is wonderful.

00:03:33.942 --> 00:03:34.775
Taksim.

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:38.357
- Two person?

00:03:38.357 --> 00:03:40.019
- Two person.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.611
We found the bus right
outside the terminal

00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:43.824
on the second lane, and
it's called Havabus.

00:03:43.824 --> 00:03:47.656
It goes directly to Taksim,
and the price for the ticket

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:48.573
is 11 lira.

00:03:50.142 --> 00:03:52.725
(upbeat music)

00:04:12.613 --> 00:04:14.112
The bus took only 30 minutes.

00:04:14.112 --> 00:04:16.275
Maybe that's because there
was no traffic this morning,

00:04:16.275 --> 00:04:19.727
and we are going to walk
to our hotel from here.

00:04:19.727 --> 00:04:21.156
Ying was feeling a little bit hungry,

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:23.817
so she wanted to stop into this bakery,

00:04:23.817 --> 00:04:25.784
which is like right across the street

00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:27.363
from where we got off the bus,

00:04:27.363 --> 00:04:31.530
and we ordered a simit, which
is the very typical bread.

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:36.384
It is a circular shaped
bread with lots and lots

00:04:36.384 --> 00:04:37.717
of sesame seeds.

00:04:42.277 --> 00:04:43.110
Oh yeah.

00:04:44.841 --> 00:04:48.978
Crusty on the outside,
fluffy in the middle,

00:04:48.978 --> 00:04:51.193
and then the sesame seeds.

00:04:51.193 --> 00:04:52.770
It's all about the sesame seeds.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.353
(upbeat music)

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:00.584
For the rest of this round
the world trip for food,

00:05:00.584 --> 00:05:04.592
the Marriott and all of the
sub-brands, Marriott sub-brands,

00:05:04.592 --> 00:05:07.754
are gonna be sponsoring the
accommodation for Ying and I,

00:05:07.754 --> 00:05:11.478
so in Istanbul, we are
staying at the Ritz Carlton,

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:13.596
and we are walking there now.

00:05:13.596 --> 00:05:15.705
Actually it's coming up very soon,

00:05:15.705 --> 00:05:19.050
and yeah this is gonna be a real treat.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.613
It's gonna be a nice place to stay.

00:05:20.613 --> 00:05:23.001
It's only, it's a little before eight AM,

00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:24.657
so I'm not sure if we'll
be able to check in,

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:25.737
but we're gonna show up there,

00:05:25.737 --> 00:05:27.100
see if we can get an early check in,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.267
or at least drop our bags.

00:05:32.972 --> 00:05:34.606
Hello, good morning.

00:05:34.606 --> 00:05:37.484
I have a reservation for Marc Wiens.

00:05:37.484 --> 00:05:39.469
- Sure, welcome to Ritz Carlton Istanbul.

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.302
- Thank you very much.

00:05:44.412 --> 00:05:46.575
Okay, they allowed us to check in early,

00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:50.742
so we got into our room,
and wow this room is insane.

00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:55.901
Not only the room, but
check out this view!

00:06:00.638 --> 00:06:03.769
I'm gonna give you a little
quick tour of this room.

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:05.917
And I haven't even seen
the whole room yet.

00:06:05.917 --> 00:06:10.313
Here's a sofa seat, bed is
right here in the middle,

00:06:10.313 --> 00:06:15.149
and there is a desk and
have no idea what that is,

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:17.618
so is that a, maybe
some kind of shoe rack.

00:06:17.618 --> 00:06:19.725
And this is the whole entrance area.

00:06:19.725 --> 00:06:21.933
Oh yes, the little coffee station.

00:06:21.933 --> 00:06:25.342
Oh, I'm gonna be using this immediately.

00:06:25.342 --> 00:06:29.313
And then over to the
left hand side here is,

00:06:29.313 --> 00:06:32.646
where's the light, shower, toilet, sink,

00:06:34.857 --> 00:06:36.240
tub on the side.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.624
This is a really nice room, and the view

00:06:38.624 --> 00:06:42.791
of the Bosphorus, oh I'm
excited to be here in Istanbul.

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:50.711
I think for right now, we're
gonna hang out in the room

00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:52.584
for a little while, maybe take a nap,

00:06:52.584 --> 00:06:54.561
we didn't really sleep much last night,

00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:58.002
and then after that, we
will go do something.

00:06:58.002 --> 00:06:59.533
If it hadn't have been for the bellboy

00:06:59.533 --> 00:07:02.059
who rang the bell, I think Ying and I

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:04.839
would've just kept on
sleeping the entire day.

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:06.922
That bed is like a cloud.

00:07:07.892 --> 00:07:09.498
Yeah we were definitely very tired.

00:07:09.498 --> 00:07:13.920
It's already noon now, so we
slept for two and a half hours,

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.811
but that was a very much needed sleep.

00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:19.841
Yesterday when we were in Oman,

00:07:19.841 --> 00:07:22.595
it reached up to 48 degrees.

00:07:22.595 --> 00:07:26.002
It was burning hot, but today in Istanbul,

00:07:26.002 --> 00:07:28.118
I just checked the temperature,

00:07:28.118 --> 00:07:30.363
and it says it's 25 degrees.

00:07:30.363 --> 00:07:32.695
I'm almost shivering, but this is like

00:07:32.695 --> 00:07:35.217
perfect weather right now.

00:07:35.217 --> 00:07:38.357
Oh and that breeze off of the sea.

00:07:38.357 --> 00:07:42.182
Oh man, even the air feels so fresh here.

00:07:42.182 --> 00:07:44.765
(upbeat music)

00:07:49.408 --> 00:07:50.948
I didn't know where to eat our first meal,

00:07:50.948 --> 00:07:52.460
but I was just doing some searching,

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.861
and I found there's a street food stall

00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:55.789
which is very close to our hotel

00:07:55.789 --> 00:07:59.465
located right across the intersection,

00:07:59.465 --> 00:08:01.537
right behind those garbage cans,

00:08:01.537 --> 00:08:04.070
and luckily, they are open right now,

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.320
so let's go check them out.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.720
Oh yeah, you can smell that grilling meat.

00:08:12.357 --> 00:08:13.190
Hello.

00:08:14.168 --> 00:08:16.001
One chicken, one beef.

00:08:19.193 --> 00:08:21.593
Is it called kofte?

00:08:21.593 --> 00:08:22.426
Okay.

00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:28.843
This is an amazing stall,
and he grilled up the fresh,

00:08:28.843 --> 00:08:32.624
kofte is like little
little ground meat patties.

00:08:32.624 --> 00:08:36.275
Quite a significant, thick loaf of bread,

00:08:36.275 --> 00:08:40.680
and he cut it in half, he
grilled it on the same grill

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.312
where the meat is grilling, so the bread

00:08:42.312 --> 00:08:44.060
probably soaked up a little meat juice

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.193
and a little smoke.

00:08:45.193 --> 00:08:48.755
He added in some chili,
he added some peppers,

00:08:48.755 --> 00:08:52.006
some tomatoes, handful of onions,

00:08:52.006 --> 00:08:53.998
and some other herbs, and then seasoned it

00:08:53.998 --> 00:08:57.415
with some more salt, and with some chili.

00:08:59.411 --> 00:09:00.244
Thank you.

00:09:01.536 --> 00:09:03.453
Want anything to drink?

00:09:06.614 --> 00:09:07.531
Just water.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.686
Just water is okay.

00:09:10.686 --> 00:09:12.179
Yes, one.

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:13.012
Thank you.

00:09:14.102 --> 00:09:17.092
The aroma of this is
absolutely irresistible.

00:09:17.092 --> 00:09:19.675
I'm gonna just give you guys a,

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:24.907
or let's all get a close up
look at what's all inside.

00:09:26.395 --> 00:09:28.134
Ooh, look at that.

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:31.553
It is just smashed within a fluffy loaf.

00:09:31.553 --> 00:09:33.293
Oh those tomatoes look wonderful.

00:09:33.293 --> 00:09:35.034
I'm gonna scoot a tomato forward,

00:09:35.034 --> 00:09:37.001
so I get that on my first bite.

00:09:37.001 --> 00:09:38.501
Okay, there we go.

00:09:40.314 --> 00:09:43.397
Oh, kinda smash it down a little bit.

00:09:51.699 --> 00:09:53.170
Oh yeah.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.670
That is as good as it smells and it looks.

00:09:58.021 --> 00:10:01.807
The little patties of
meat are nice and salty

00:10:01.807 --> 00:10:05.245
with a little bit of
a spice blend to them.

00:10:05.245 --> 00:10:06.900
That is unbelievably good,

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.351
and just the combination of everything,

00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:12.351
the little patties, the fluffy loaf.

00:10:17.208 --> 00:10:19.019
The tomatoes are wonderful.

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:23.338
The tomatoes are like
smoky, but really juicy,

00:10:23.338 --> 00:10:25.005
really really juicy.

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:31.131
We're standing for a little while,

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.895
but now we've managed to grab some seats

00:10:32.895 --> 00:10:36.485
in the back of the stall,
so not only am I eating,

00:10:36.485 --> 00:10:39.742
but I have the whole
aromatherapy of the smoke

00:10:39.742 --> 00:10:42.992
from the grilling meat right behind me.

00:10:49.395 --> 00:10:51.161
That is so wonderful.

00:10:51.161 --> 00:10:54.096
It's so nice and salty,
and then what I really like

00:10:54.096 --> 00:10:58.263
is how the tomato, like
the slightly cooked tomato

00:10:59.809 --> 00:11:03.101
and the grilled pepper just
sort of melt into the meat

00:11:03.101 --> 00:11:04.614
and the bread.

00:11:04.614 --> 00:11:05.810
That is superb.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.019
Ying also loved it.

00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:09.060
Ying had the chicken.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.679
Oh that was so good, and
the combination of a drink

00:11:12.679 --> 00:11:15.012
and a sandwich cost 10 lira.

00:11:16.472 --> 00:11:20.341
Oh that is given me just
a complete positive,

00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:23.462
wonderful, grilled meat experience

00:11:23.462 --> 00:11:25.740
for my first meal in Istanbul,

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.259
and where we just ate, it
seems to be a very popular spot

00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:30.075
with taxi drivers.

00:11:30.075 --> 00:11:33.492
Taxi drivers know where the good food is.

00:11:34.738 --> 00:11:36.920
We are walking around
now, stumbled into this

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.468
nice little green park

00:11:39.468 --> 00:11:42.968
and trying to get across the park somehow.

00:11:46.743 --> 00:11:49.326
So now we found ourselves
in this beautifully shaded

00:11:49.326 --> 00:11:51.545
little neighborhood park.

00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:53.497
This is fantastic.

00:11:53.497 --> 00:11:56.290
The air is so fresh and so cool,

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.705
and I'm loving this shade.

00:11:58.705 --> 00:12:02.413
Even this is just a
normal neighborhood park,

00:12:02.413 --> 00:12:03.873
and it is wonderful.

00:12:03.873 --> 00:12:07.971
Ying and I are just sitting
here soaking up the shade,

00:12:07.971 --> 00:12:11.888
the breeze, and the
enjoyment after that lunch.

00:12:13.156 --> 00:12:15.739
(upbeat music)

00:12:20.375 --> 00:12:23.227
And we have arrived at Taksim Square.

00:12:23.227 --> 00:12:25.810
(upbeat music)

00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:37.504
But this is just a huge open square area,

00:12:37.504 --> 00:12:39.704
and it is not open to traffic,

00:12:39.704 --> 00:12:42.828
but it's only foot
traffic, so it has this,

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:46.161
it has just a gigantic plaza feel to it.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.133
(upbeat music)

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.930
Walking through Taksim Square,

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.230
it's such a gigantic open public space,

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.187
and there's always so much going on.

00:13:01.187 --> 00:13:03.323
It's a great place to people watch.

00:13:03.323 --> 00:13:05.680
There are some street food snack vendors,

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.172
there are lots of restaurants
and cafes and parks

00:13:08.172 --> 00:13:09.255
in this area.

00:13:10.935 --> 00:13:13.470
What I really like is that
the street is open air,

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.222
and it's like a giant
open air shopping mall,

00:13:16.222 --> 00:13:18.398
but there are buildings
on both sides of the road,

00:13:18.398 --> 00:13:21.298
there's an antique tramway
that runs down the middle,

00:13:21.298 --> 00:13:25.197
and you'll find all sorts of modern shops

00:13:25.197 --> 00:13:26.934
and boutique shops, but at the same time,

00:13:26.934 --> 00:13:28.428
some of the buildings are old

00:13:28.428 --> 00:13:31.178
and historical antique buildings.

00:13:32.998 --> 00:13:34.915
Oh there goes the tram.

00:13:37.174 --> 00:13:39.022
There is a cafe along this street

00:13:39.022 --> 00:13:42.053
that is supposed to serve some
of the best Turkish coffee,

00:13:42.053 --> 00:13:44.482
and so that's where I'm
going to try to find next.

00:13:44.482 --> 00:13:47.065
(upbeat music)

00:13:52.212 --> 00:13:54.840
Mandabatmaz Cafe, and this is an amazing

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.478
little hideaway down a quiet alley

00:13:57.478 --> 00:13:59.822
right off the main street, but it just has

00:13:59.822 --> 00:14:02.378
a completely quiet, relaxed feel to it.

00:14:02.378 --> 00:14:04.924
We got a table outside,
and I just ordered a cup

00:14:04.924 --> 00:14:06.842
of Turkish coffee.

00:14:06.842 --> 00:14:08.258
This is the type of ambiance I think of

00:14:08.258 --> 00:14:11.814
when I think of Istanbul,
just an old alley like this

00:14:11.814 --> 00:14:15.897
sandwiched between two
buildings drinking coffee.

00:14:18.615 --> 00:14:19.829
Thank you.

00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:21.623
I've had Turkish coffee in other places,

00:14:21.623 --> 00:14:23.497
but I've never had
Turkish coffee in Turkey,

00:14:23.497 --> 00:14:27.596
so this will be my very first
Turkish coffee in Turkey.

00:14:27.596 --> 00:14:29.133
And this is a beautiful little cup.

00:14:29.133 --> 00:14:31.466
You can see how thick it is.

00:14:37.594 --> 00:14:40.177
Wow, that's, that is marvelous.

00:14:41.752 --> 00:14:42.993
Oh yeah.

00:14:42.993 --> 00:14:47.485
It's thick and has a little
bit of a graininess to it

00:14:47.485 --> 00:14:50.743
because of the ground
coffee, but at the same time,

00:14:50.743 --> 00:14:54.028
it's smooth, well sort of smooth,

00:14:54.028 --> 00:14:56.205
but it's not bitter at all.

00:14:56.205 --> 00:15:00.397
It is strong, a little
bit sweet, and it has a,

00:15:00.397 --> 00:15:01.627
I think it's cardamom, a little bit

00:15:01.627 --> 00:15:04.198
of a cardamom spice to it.

00:15:04.198 --> 00:15:07.031
Wow that is just liquid delicious.

00:15:12.098 --> 00:15:14.226
That is an amazing cup of coffee.

00:15:14.226 --> 00:15:15.393
Oh, I love it.

00:15:20.226 --> 00:15:21.641
And it does have a little bit

00:15:21.641 --> 00:15:24.374
of a roasted smoky flavor to it,

00:15:24.374 --> 00:15:26.957
it's really strong, but really,

00:15:28.195 --> 00:15:31.327
and even though it's like
thick and kind of murky,

00:15:31.327 --> 00:15:33.780
it is actually remarkably smooth

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.863
but just bursting with coffee flavor.

00:15:41.369 --> 00:15:43.322
That was an amazing cup of coffee

00:15:43.322 --> 00:15:45.609
and an amazing location as well.

00:15:45.609 --> 00:15:48.726
Now back out onto the busy walking street.

00:15:48.726 --> 00:15:51.309
(upbeat music)

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.999
We've just made it to the other
end of the shopping street.

00:16:00.999 --> 00:16:04.437
That was very enjoyable,
especially the coffee.

00:16:04.437 --> 00:16:05.602
That was the highlight.

00:16:05.602 --> 00:16:08.185
(upbeat music)

00:16:18.734 --> 00:16:22.415
We just stopped by at a
small little grocery store

00:16:22.415 --> 00:16:24.118
on the side of the road here

00:16:24.118 --> 00:16:27.822
and bought some bananas and
some apples and some water.

00:16:27.822 --> 00:16:29.448
Right down the road there behind me

00:16:29.448 --> 00:16:33.287
is the Galata Tower, which
is a historical landmark

00:16:33.287 --> 00:16:35.958
in Istanbul, but we're
not going to visit today,

00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.018
we'll probably come back
another day to visit,

00:16:38.018 --> 00:16:39.714
but now we're just walking
around these amazing

00:16:39.714 --> 00:16:41.192
little alley streets.

00:16:41.192 --> 00:16:43.775
(upbeat music)

00:16:51.954 --> 00:16:53.481
Walking around these old streets,

00:16:53.481 --> 00:16:55.673
you will see lots and lots of cats.

00:16:55.673 --> 00:16:58.256
(upbeat music)

00:17:05.986 --> 00:17:07.447
We walked around for a while,

00:17:07.447 --> 00:17:09.850
and now Ying and I have
just stopped for dinner

00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:12.334
at a place called the Fish and Meat House,

00:17:12.334 --> 00:17:14.264
which is just a really little restaurant.

00:17:14.264 --> 00:17:17.089
They have a couple tables
set out on a sidewalk,

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:20.724
and so we sat down, but
it's in a nice neighborhood,

00:17:20.724 --> 00:17:23.599
the cobblestone street behind me,

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:26.864
and it's also worth
mentioning that we're here

00:17:26.864 --> 00:17:28.227
very early for dinner.

00:17:28.227 --> 00:17:29.573
I think it's about six PM,

00:17:29.573 --> 00:17:32.048
so I think most people would
not eat dinner this early,

00:17:32.048 --> 00:17:34.468
but Ying and I are, we're actually both

00:17:34.468 --> 00:17:36.785
really sleepy still, so
we wanted to have dinner,

00:17:36.785 --> 00:17:38.293
then we're going to
head back to the hotel,

00:17:38.293 --> 00:17:41.438
and then we're going to
plan more for tomorrow.

00:17:41.438 --> 00:17:42.445
Got two different salads.

00:17:42.445 --> 00:17:44.265
This one is mixed green salad,

00:17:44.265 --> 00:17:47.681
and just look at the beautiful
greenliness of this salad.

00:17:47.681 --> 00:17:49.347
There's tomatoes in here, there's parsley,

00:17:49.347 --> 00:17:50.967
there's I don't know what that is,

00:17:50.967 --> 00:17:54.453
I think that's dill, there's
lettuce, and cucumbers in here.

00:17:54.453 --> 00:17:56.367
And then the other salad is a roka salad,

00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:58.191
and I think it's arugula.

00:17:58.191 --> 00:18:01.072
There are cucumbers and
tomatoes and cheese on top,

00:18:01.072 --> 00:18:03.540
and I think it's just a lemon,

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.071
you just squeeze a lemon over it.

00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:09.009
Oh wow, that's a very juicy juicy lemon.

00:18:09.009 --> 00:18:11.009
It just squeezes nicely.

00:18:14.068 --> 00:18:17.318
Oh that's, yeah that's extremely juicy.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:22.387
Oh yes, fresh black pepper
is one of the spices of life.

00:18:26.688 --> 00:18:29.355
We'll go with the other one too.

00:18:35.829 --> 00:18:39.955
I will try to get a little bit
of everything in this bite.

00:18:39.955 --> 00:18:42.372
Oh, and definitely that dill.

00:18:49.742 --> 00:18:52.810
It's the dill that
gives it so much flavor.

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.138
I haven't had too many green vegetables

00:18:54.138 --> 00:18:56.406
in a couple days, so
this feels really good

00:18:56.406 --> 00:18:58.132
to eat some vegetables.

00:18:58.132 --> 00:19:00.209
They're all just very fresh and crisp.

00:19:00.209 --> 00:19:01.792
- [Ying] Thank you.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:03.660
- Thank you.

00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:11.623
Some olive oil will be
good on the salad as well.

00:19:11.623 --> 00:19:12.913
Alright.

00:19:12.913 --> 00:19:15.450
Oh yeah and also the tomatoes
in that last bite of salad,

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:18.403
of salad I had, the tomatoes were vibrant

00:19:18.403 --> 00:19:22.070
and just really nice
and tart and flavorful.

00:19:26.914 --> 00:19:29.997
The arugula has that wonderful little

00:19:31.121 --> 00:19:35.155
like very very faint hint of horseradish,

00:19:35.155 --> 00:19:36.893
just simply with the lemon juice

00:19:36.893 --> 00:19:41.402
and a little bit of olive oil,
that's a perfect dressing.

00:19:41.402 --> 00:19:43.538
For my main dish, I got
the grilled sea bream,

00:19:43.538 --> 00:19:46.180
and this is a wonderful
little personal sized fish.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.811
It looks just oily and juicy,

00:19:48.811 --> 00:19:52.292
and you can smell the slight fish aroma,

00:19:52.292 --> 00:19:54.413
and I have to be honest

00:19:54.413 --> 00:19:55.816
and say that it has been a long time

00:19:55.816 --> 00:19:58.330
since I've eaten with a fork.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.694
Let's see if I remember.

00:20:00.694 --> 00:20:02.777
Oh yes, oh, grilled fish.

00:20:04.331 --> 00:20:05.565
Oh I better squeeze some lemon on it,

00:20:05.565 --> 00:20:09.732
but let me just taste it pure
with nothing on it first.

00:20:13.467 --> 00:20:14.300
Oh yeah.

00:20:15.825 --> 00:20:18.908
That is actually just like pure fish.

00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:20.834
Nothing else.

00:20:20.834 --> 00:20:22.848
I don't even know if it's
salted, but it's cooked,

00:20:22.848 --> 00:20:25.113
so it's not overcooked,
it's juicy and oily.

00:20:25.113 --> 00:20:26.863
It's amazingly fresh.

00:20:27.716 --> 00:20:30.878
It's so simple I think
it's just basically grilled

00:20:30.878 --> 00:20:33.611
with no, I don't know
if there's salt on it,

00:20:33.611 --> 00:20:36.297
but just very simple, very fresh fish.

00:20:36.297 --> 00:20:38.388
The only thing that could enhance

00:20:38.388 --> 00:20:41.138
a perfectly fresh fish like this.

00:20:43.195 --> 00:20:47.362
Maybe I'll just give it a
very light sprinkle of salt.

00:20:50.656 --> 00:20:52.570
And that's about good.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.688
I don't want to overdo the saltiness.

00:20:55.688 --> 00:20:59.271
Oh, it feels so good
just to eat pure fish.

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:04.412
That skin is so good,
and then also eating it

00:21:04.412 --> 00:21:06.412
with some bread as well.

00:21:10.252 --> 00:21:13.447
And then I'm gonna eat it
with some of this red onion.

00:21:13.447 --> 00:21:16.280
Let me take a circle of red onion.

00:21:29.645 --> 00:21:32.228
Oh, the red onion is wonderful.

00:21:36.312 --> 00:21:39.395
Nice and pungent, a little bit spicy,

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.729
and then crisp and juicy.

00:21:41.729 --> 00:21:44.057
Sitting here eating, we have attracted

00:21:44.057 --> 00:21:47.000
an entire, is it called a pride?

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.833
A pride of house cats?

00:21:51.218 --> 00:21:53.283
Oh and there's one on
the table next to us.

00:21:53.283 --> 00:21:54.763
Oh it must be the smell of my fish

00:21:54.763 --> 00:21:56.426
that I'm eating right now.

00:21:56.426 --> 00:21:58.926
(cat meowing)

00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:05.146
I'm a big fan of grilled
fish, and this was,

00:22:05.146 --> 00:22:07.629
whoa cat fight over there,

00:22:07.629 --> 00:22:08.984
but what I really liked about this meal

00:22:08.984 --> 00:22:11.375
is everything was so
simple but really fresh,

00:22:11.375 --> 00:22:13.375
really good ingredients.

00:22:15.941 --> 00:22:19.858
I think this is a hand
towel to clean my hands.

00:22:20.709 --> 00:22:24.709
Oh yeah, I need this after
licking that fish clean.

00:22:24.709 --> 00:22:25.698
What's up man?

00:22:25.698 --> 00:22:30.579
What I like is that you can
eat such a high quality meal.

00:22:30.579 --> 00:22:32.027
That fish was really good quality,

00:22:32.027 --> 00:22:35.358
the salad was really
nice, but you can still

00:22:35.358 --> 00:22:38.431
eat on the sidewalk on
the side of the road,

00:22:38.431 --> 00:22:41.450
so that was not a street food cheap meal,

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.057
but it was definitely very good quality,

00:22:44.057 --> 00:22:46.668
and I really enjoyed it.

00:22:46.668 --> 00:22:50.075
I eat a lot of spicy food,
and I eat a lot of food

00:22:50.075 --> 00:22:53.831
that's very flavorful,
but sometimes just relying

00:22:53.831 --> 00:22:56.528
on the natural ingredients
and not even using

00:22:56.528 --> 00:22:58.969
much seasoning is really good,

00:22:58.969 --> 00:23:00.640
and it's a different
change from the spicy food

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.057
that I often eat.

00:23:07.072 --> 00:23:08.837
Ying and I just walked
back to our hotel room,

00:23:08.837 --> 00:23:12.228
and I was actually just planning
to end the video right now,

00:23:12.228 --> 00:23:15.263
but look what the Ritz
Carlton has hooked us up with

00:23:15.263 --> 00:23:16.559
in our room.

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:19.559
Check out this gigantic glass cover.

00:23:21.637 --> 00:23:23.029
Oh wow.

00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:25.919
Oh I'm kinda scared to take this off.

00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:29.746
And then, are these
entire pieces of cheese?

00:23:29.746 --> 00:23:31.631
At first I thought it
was little sandwiches,

00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:33.712
but I guess they are all,

00:23:33.712 --> 00:23:35.796
I guess they're just solid cheese,

00:23:35.796 --> 00:23:38.764
and then little, they
look like dried apricots

00:23:38.764 --> 00:23:39.851
with walnuts in them.

00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:41.675
Did these cheeses fall over?

00:23:41.675 --> 00:23:42.508
I don't know.

00:23:42.508 --> 00:23:44.309
I'm gonna go in for that apricot.

00:23:44.309 --> 00:23:47.252
Little apricot sandwich,
I think, with a walnut

00:23:47.252 --> 00:23:48.419
in the middle.

00:23:52.519 --> 00:23:55.635
Yeah, I think that's exactly right.

00:23:55.635 --> 00:23:58.762
An apricot, dried apricot, oh and that is

00:23:58.762 --> 00:24:00.453
a wonderful little combination.

00:24:00.453 --> 00:24:03.026
I'm not sure what this is, a little disc,

00:24:03.026 --> 00:24:04.962
but this should go good with cheese.

00:24:04.962 --> 00:24:07.199
At least I'm hoping so.

00:24:07.199 --> 00:24:09.616
I'll try some of this cheese.

00:24:16.369 --> 00:24:19.871
That taste like very salty cream cheese.

00:24:19.871 --> 00:24:21.397
It's kind of like a particle bread.

00:24:21.397 --> 00:24:23.980
(upbeat music)

00:24:25.757 --> 00:24:26.590
Oh yeah.

00:24:30.226 --> 00:24:32.827
And you just have to see
the sunset view right now

00:24:32.827 --> 00:24:33.907
over the Bosphorus.

00:24:33.907 --> 00:24:34.904
It's amazing.

00:24:34.904 --> 00:24:37.924
The boats, the sun shining on the hill,

00:24:37.924 --> 00:24:39.424
this is fantastic.

00:24:44.773 --> 00:24:47.513
And on that note, I think
I'm gonna end the video

00:24:47.513 --> 00:24:49.320
for today right now.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.433
Istanbul has been a city
that I've wanted to visit

00:24:52.433 --> 00:24:55.779
my entire life, and so I am
extremely happy to be here,

00:24:55.779 --> 00:24:57.377
and today, we just sorta walked around

00:24:57.377 --> 00:25:00.337
and just kind of got a feel for Istanbul.

00:25:00.337 --> 00:25:04.394
We didn't really see much,
but it was already amazing.

00:25:04.394 --> 00:25:06.114
Please remember to give
this video a thumbs up

00:25:06.114 --> 00:25:07.756

00:25:21.324 --> 00:25:22.157
Cheers.

00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:28.972
There are mirrors all over this bathroom.

00:25:28.972 --> 00:25:30.722
Make up mirror, whoa.

00:25:32.009 --> 00:25:33.264
That sandwich is so big for Ying,

00:25:33.264 --> 00:25:35.602
you have to hold it like a baby.

00:25:35.602 --> 00:25:38.185
(upbeat music)
