As you start writing apps,
especially data driven apps,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.680
working with p lists in
JSON is an everyday task.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.980
You'll use these formats to load data on
devices and communicate over a network.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.290
So they're extremely valuable to know.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.360
See you in the next session.
