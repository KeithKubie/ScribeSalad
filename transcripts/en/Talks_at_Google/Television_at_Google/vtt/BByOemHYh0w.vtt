AMBER STEVENS WEST: Look at us.

00:00:04.257 --> 00:00:06.565
Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.565 --> 00:00:07.800
You made it out.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.456
We made it out.

00:00:10.456 --> 00:00:11.344
DARA WILSON: Hello.

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:12.450
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.880
Wow, that was so weak, you guys.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.209
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.868
Sorry.

00:00:14.868 --> 00:00:16.011
DARA WILSON: Hello!

00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:16.844
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:18.350
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
No, no, honestly.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.340
The first one was better.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.000
It was so genuine.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.400
It was like, yeah, hello.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.329
You haven't done anything yet.

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.120
It was a response of
like, yeah, all right.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.680
DARA WILSON: In anticipation
of this amazing panel

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.310
that's about to happen.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.340
JERROD CARMICHAEL: I don't clap
until the artist has performed.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.790
I don't care who comes up.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.040
I'd be the only one at Michael
Jackson show just like,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.030
yeah, but dance first.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:45.045
I'm sorry.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.550
DARA WILSON: OK, I think
we're all warmed up now.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.400
I am Dara Wilson.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.770
I am a Googler here in
sunny Mountain View.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.825
We're here with some folks
from "Carmichael Show."

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:06.220
We have Jerrod Carmichael,
Amber Stevens West, Ravi Nandan,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.690
and Ari Katcher.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.940
ARI KATCHER: Hi.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.760
DARA WILSON: Yay!

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.093
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Hi, you guys.

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.460
DARA WILSON: Really grateful
that you guys are here with us

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.090
today.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.920
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
Thanks for having us.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.180
DARA WILSON: Yeah.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.510
So I guess I just
want to get started

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.372
with how did the show become?

00:01:23.372 --> 00:01:24.330
How did it get created?

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.140
What was that process like?

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.450
AMBER STEVENS WEST: I had
nothing to do with it.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.866
DARA WILSON: Start with the
little questions first, right?

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.000
JERROD CARMICHAEL: What's
the fastest way of saying it?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.330
I met NBC in like 2011.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.830
Ari and co-created the
show, and Ravi just

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.150
really jumped on
board pretty much

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.885
since the onset of the idea.

00:01:50.885 --> 00:01:52.090
He helped us develop it.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.650
And we did a pilot
presentation that didn't go.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.876
And then we did a pilot,
and then that worked.

00:01:59.876 --> 00:02:01.000
DARA WILSON: And that's it?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.810
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Yeah.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.300
ARI KATCHER: And
now we're at Google.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.300
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Yeah.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.900
And then there's like two
years missing in that story.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.430
It was a lot.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.840
DARA WILSON: Cool.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.300
So your background, Jerrod,
is in stand-up, and comedy,

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.846
obviously.

00:02:16.846 --> 00:02:19.620
What is the biggest difference
going from that world

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.300
to television?

00:02:23.165 --> 00:02:28.370
JERROD CARMICHAEL: It's
acceptance of a team effort.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.670
I mean, as a stand-up,
you're alone,

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.880
and you write, and
perform, and direct,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.130
and do all of the things.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.010
And then, this is a team effort.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.980
And so really surrounding
yourself with people

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.020
that you trust to move
toward one vision.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.360
So I think, for me, that was
the thing-- accepting the moving

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.892
pieces.

00:02:50.892 --> 00:02:52.350
DARA WILSON: And
how is that going?

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.475
JERROD CARMICHAEL: It's OK.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.460
I trust everybody
right on this panel.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.650
That ain't I nothing.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.045
That's really strong.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.750
Then it starts
getting real thin.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.550
No, we have some
really wonderful people

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.780
that work with us.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.550
And it's good.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.870
I think we all learn what
the vision is, and then move

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.490
toward it.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.875
DARA WILSON: So how is your
guys' working style together?

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:25.250
RAVI NANDAN: I mean, I think
it's all slightly different.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.420
Obviously, Jerrod and
Ari created the show,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.320
so they work, I think,
hand-in-hand pretty much

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.590
through every episode.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.080
There's a writers room, and
they'll write everything,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.910
but then-- yeah, exactly.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.142
Lots of sleepovers-

00:03:39.142 --> 00:03:41.600
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Like almost
a disgusting amount of time.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.950
And yeah, so I
mean, Ravi produces,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.830
and me and Ari write a lot of
the most-- how do we word this?

00:03:57.812 --> 00:03:59.270
ARI KATCHER: I
mean, we spend a lot

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.970
of time in the writer's room.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.140
Everybody pitches
ideas, and we talk

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.709
about what we want
the topics to be,

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.750
what we want to talk about
throughout the season.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.430
And then we'll go
off, and we'll write,

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.930
and then we spend
a lot of weekends.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.290
We do a lot of writing over
not sleeping on the weekend.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.670
Because, yes, I mean he's
performing in the show too.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.360
So I mean, he's
wearing a lot of hats.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.810
So throughout the week,
he's memorizing the lines.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.760
So on the weekend, that's
really the time for him

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.290
to put his voice, I
think, into the show.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.254
So I'll come over to
his place, and we just

00:04:34.254 --> 00:04:35.670
won't sleep for
an entire weekend,

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.100
and we'll just find
a way to make sure

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.199
that it sounds like
Jerrod's voice,

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.490
and make sure that the dialogue
sounds like it's coming

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.402
from him, from an honest place.

00:04:46.402 --> 00:04:48.327
And that's our process, I think.

00:04:48.327 --> 00:04:50.410
RAVI NANDAN: We tape this
show on Thursday nights.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.826
And then the next
day, on Fridays,

00:04:51.826 --> 00:04:54.590
we'll do a table read for
the next week's episode.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.940
And from that, you guys will
rewrite over the weekend.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.650
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
Yeah, exactly.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.920
Two tapings Thursdays,
4:00 and 7:00.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.570
I mean, it's really nonstop.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.980
Because I mean, in the
middle of the season,

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.000
we may be simultaneously
working on like three episodes--

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.110
the one we're currently
going, and then trying

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.540
to be ahead for the
next one, and then

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.900
an idea for the next one.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.840
So it's really a
grueling, nonstop process

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.460
of just incessant
thought and work.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.150
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Yeah,
it's very unmotivating.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.680
Thursday night,
you finish a show,

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.480
and then you're like,
hey, we did it-- oh, fuck.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.854
We've gotta be up
in the morning.

00:05:31.854 --> 00:05:37.490
We have to be up to read
the next episode tomorrow.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.812
DARA WILSON: And, Amber,
I want to hear from you.

00:05:39.812 --> 00:05:42.332
AMBER STEVENS WEST:
Yep, thank you.

00:05:42.332 --> 00:05:44.290
Yeah, I didn't create
anything, so I don't have

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.191
much to contribute on that end.

00:05:46.191 --> 00:05:47.940
DARA WILSON: But so
what's your experience

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.600
been like on the show, versus
some of the other places you've

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.650
been?

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.300
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
I should, right?

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.633
AMBER STEVENS WEST: Yeah, right?

00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:57.570
Well, I'm sitting with all the
people in charge of my job.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.500
It's the best work
experience I've ever had.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.170
I've always wanted
to work in multicam.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.620
It's such a different animal
than any single camera

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.230
drama, movie, any other thing
you could do as an actor.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.690
So I'm having the best time.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.692
I'm working with
the smartest people.

00:06:12.692 --> 00:06:17.580
And it's a really
supportive environment.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.910
We just have a lot of fun.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.993
And so it's great to work
on something that's fun,

00:06:20.993 --> 00:06:24.810
but also I'm proud of the
work that we are doing.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.780
What we're making, I think,
is smart, and important,

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.460
and interesting,
and all of that.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.090
So I love it.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.506
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Well, the
reason, I said I should leave

00:06:34.506 --> 00:06:37.870
is because she also has the
burden of we tape on Thursdays,

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.090
and there are some Thursday
mornings where it's essentially

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.638
a new script.

00:06:41.638 --> 00:06:43.012
AMBER STEVENS
WEST: That happens.

00:06:43.012 --> 00:06:47.620
That happens, where we learn
an entire show in, like, six

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.220
hours.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.450
That's happened.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.690
But the thing is, is I
ever complain about it,

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.520
because it always gets better.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.700
Every time there's a
change to the script,

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.270
it's a better version of what
we've been rehearsing all week.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.490
So it's exciting.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.870
It's nice like, OK, now
it's finally flowing better,

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.440
and it's making more
sense, and as a whole,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.880
it's just going to
be a better product.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.060
DARA WILSON: So
you guys do record

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.330
in front of a live audience?

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.746
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Yeah, it's
important. we're performers.

00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:14.190
We all have somewhat of a
background in live performance.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.210
The whole cast-- David
Alan Grier, Loretta Devine,

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.300
and Amber, and Rel, and
Tiffany all, our performance,

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.655
it works for us.

00:07:21.655 --> 00:07:23.712
It plays toward
our instinct to be

00:07:23.712 --> 00:07:25.920
able to perform in front of
the live studio audience,

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.480
and you get to immediately
gauge whether or not

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.670
the material's working.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.450
You can feel when a story lags.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.290
You can feel it,
and it allows us

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.619
to even-- we rewrite not
only up until tape night,

00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:39.535
but in between shows,
we do a 4:00 and a 7:00,

00:07:39.535 --> 00:07:43.010
and we'll rewrite based off of
audience response, based off

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.960
of feeling, based off
of a lot of things.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.010
So just always trying
to go toward whatever

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.277
the truth of that episode is.

00:07:48.277 --> 00:07:50.360
RAVI NANDAN: And doing the
double taping, the 4:00

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.020
and the 7:00, hasn't been done
since "Cheers" or something

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.520
like that.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.550
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
Yeah, it's been a while.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.053
RAVI NANDAN: It
is that reason, so

00:07:57.053 --> 00:07:58.910
that you can fine
tune it and perform it

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.400
in front of one audience.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.890
Do it straight through once,
and see what works and what

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.720
doesn't, and then have about two
hours to do a rewrite of it .

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.790
AMBER STEVENS WEST: It's genius.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.480
I don't know why all
multicams don't do it.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.090
RAVI NANDAN: Yeah.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.290
It makes a big difference.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.430
Especially from the
performing side, too.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.162
It's fun that we
get the jitters out.

00:08:14.162 --> 00:08:16.620
We test it out first with an
audience, and then by the time

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.745
we get to the second show,
we can relax, and do it,

00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:20.100
and have a lot of fun.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.090
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
But you're right.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.355
Because it's a lot more work.

00:08:22.355 --> 00:08:26.040
Another thing that you learn is
that people are fucking lazy.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.610
That's why a lot of
things don't get done.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.409
People are just terrified
of an extra step.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.225
And that's why we're
so excited about.

00:08:35.225 --> 00:08:37.799
A lot of the staff and
everyone who works on the show,

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:41.289
we're excited about really
trying to give 100%,

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:42.419
as cliche as that sounds.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:44.972
But it really is just trying
to put a lot of effort,

00:08:44.972 --> 00:08:46.180
and a lot of thought into it.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.270
ARI KATCHER: I
would say even 110.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.695
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.420
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
I gave 110 once.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.045
ARI KATCHER: Yeah,
don't do that again.

00:08:58.358 --> 00:09:00.483
DARA WILSON: You look like
you threw out your back.

00:09:00.483 --> 00:09:00.966
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:00.966 --> 00:09:01.932
Oh, I did.

00:09:01.932 --> 00:09:03.317
I did.

00:09:03.317 --> 00:09:05.900
DARA WILSON: So you're getting
that feedback from the audience

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:06.400
live.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.880
You guys also really
interact with the audience

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.914
through digital means,
through social media.

00:09:10.914 --> 00:09:12.330
So how much of an
impact does that

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.970
have on the things that you
decide to talk about, what you

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.000
don't, and how the show goes?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.190
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Amber
engages more than--

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.398
AMBER STEVENS WEST: I just
like everything on Twitter

00:09:21.398 --> 00:09:22.421
that I see.

00:09:22.421 --> 00:09:24.920
I go through, and anything with
the hashtag Carmichael Show,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.292
I like, like, like.

00:09:26.292 --> 00:09:27.750
I don't know from
your end, though.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.250
I don't know if
they have any input.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.166
JERROD CARMICHAEL: No.

00:09:30.166 --> 00:09:30.890
No, not at all.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.300
But I do think--
if it's more rooted

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.600
in conversation, like where
the shows and the episodes

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.891
and stuff comes from, it's
more rooted in conversations

00:09:39.891 --> 00:09:43.940
that I've had or that we've
had, or very interesting topics

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.790
or whatever just won't go away,
whatever we found interesting,

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:54.130
whatever source of contention
in our lives becomes an episode.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.000
DARA WILSON: So then
how much of what

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.040
you are saying in the
show, what you feel,

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.400
and then what's
happening around you,

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.410
like conversations
you've actually had?

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:07.267
Or are you sometimes putting
on the hat of somebody else?

00:10:07.267 --> 00:10:08.600
JERROD CARMICHAEL: I don't know.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.780
A lot about my stand-up
and perspective

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.820
is in me and other characters.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:20.140
It's sometimes like David
gets a lot of my stand-up

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.130
and perspective and
stuff like that.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.240
And some scenes
have been arguments

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.850
that I've have with myself,
just seeing both sides of it.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:28.660
So I don't know.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.160
ARI KATCHER: I mean,
you'll do that.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.480
I mean, even stand up, you'll
sometimes take something,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.090
and then you'll
be like, you know,

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.950
and on the other
hand, sometimes this.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.940
JERROD CARMICHAEL: I'll just
immediately contradict myself.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.606
ARI KATCHER: You'll
argue the other end.

00:10:40.606 --> 00:10:44.360
So it's almost easy to do that,
because I've heard you argue.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.660
And even in conversations,
we'll just be arguing something,

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.400
and then you'll be like, but
also totally the opposite too.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.690
We're never too precious
about the point that we make.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.510
It's always more about
the fun of arguing.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.635
JERROD CARMICHAEL: You guys
should hear my thoughts

00:10:57.635 --> 00:10:59.185
on global warming.

00:10:59.185 --> 00:11:01.931
ARI KATCHER: Great place for it.

00:11:01.931 --> 00:11:04.555
DARA WILSON: You're just really
rigorous and scientific, right?

00:11:04.555 --> 00:11:06.820
That's what your
thoughts are like.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.945
ARI KATCHER: But I mean,
just looking at everything

00:11:08.945 --> 00:11:11.650
from every point of view,
and being able to assign that

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:12.820
to different characters.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.028
RAVI NANDAN: Have you had
a point of view in the show

00:11:15.028 --> 00:11:16.720
that you fully don't believe?

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.870
JERROD CARMICHAEL: No.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.770
that's a lot of times
what I'd rewrite if I

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.290
don't feel a connection to it.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.070
Then it just doesn't
stand a lot of times.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.350
Because I not need to
be able to genuinely

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:30.257
argue it, and be able to feel
passionate about whatever

00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:31.090
we're talking about.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:36.110
So a lot of the
rewrites have just

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.810
been trying to find prospective.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.740
Either I've given out
too much of my own

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.380
amongst other
characters, and then I

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.200
have to refind what it is.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.070
But for the most part,
I feel pretty strongly

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.702
about most of the
things I've said.

00:11:50.702 --> 00:11:52.160
DARA WILSON: What
about you, Amber?

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.534
How much are you like Maxine?

00:11:54.534 --> 00:11:55.950
Are you the Maxine
of your family?

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.320
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
That's a good question.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.361
AMBER STEVENS WEST: Am I
the Maxine of my family?

00:11:59.361 --> 00:12:02.410
No, I come from a very open
minded, liberal family.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.460
So everything that I
get to say on the show,

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.584
I pretty much agree with,
with the exception, I think,

00:12:07.584 --> 00:12:08.750
of probably a couple things.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:14.190
But I relate in point
of view with Maxine.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.520
And my family does too.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.130
So it's really easy.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.930
There's actually
been times where,

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:20.870
you know how you
believe in something,

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.411
but you've never really asked
yourself why you believe in it?

00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:25.720
You've never questioned
your beliefs?

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.690
DARA WILSON: It's just
what Mom and Dad said.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:27.585
AMBER STEVENS WEST: It's just
something that you think,

00:12:27.585 --> 00:12:30.085
and you've never really had
much of a discussion with anyone

00:12:30.085 --> 00:12:30.720
about why.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.610
There's a lot of times where
this show, my character says

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.330
why she believes something, and
then I myself, in real life,

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.978
go, oh, that's why
I believe that.

00:12:38.978 --> 00:12:42.530
So I'm learning about myself.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.907
through their writing.

00:12:44.907 --> 00:12:45.990
DARA WILSON: That's great.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.150
I mean, can that
be tense, though?

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.749
Because the characters
disagree a lot.

00:12:50.749 --> 00:12:52.540
AMBER STEVENS WEST:
That's the whole point.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.540
DARA WILSON: They're at very
opposite ends of the issues.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.900
So does that tension cross over?

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.470
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Oh, so
then we just hate each other?

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:02.974
AMBER STEVENS WEST:
Like real life?

00:13:02.974 --> 00:13:04.140
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Fuck you.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.056
You know what you did.

00:13:06.602 --> 00:13:08.560
DARA WILSON: Well, it's
like, you see somebody,

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.598
they play a role a little bit
too well, and it's like, oh,

00:13:10.598 --> 00:13:11.472
you're a slavemaster.

00:13:11.472 --> 00:13:13.199
You just like--

00:13:13.199 --> 00:13:15.490
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Everyone
was terrified of Fassbender

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:19.686
of the set of the "12."

00:13:19.686 --> 00:13:20.900
No, I don't think so.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:21.940
Yeah, I don't think so.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.820
But I think that I also
my family really likes

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.890
to argue for sport as well.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.740
We're those types of people.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.350
The night before
out last taping,

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.010
I was really, really
tired, and I was exhausted.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:41.110
And my sister called me,
and brought up "Lemonade."

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.700
Right?

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.460
Because whose sister didn't?

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.340
And she was talking about it.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.910
And I said, oh, did
my niece see it?

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:54.380
My niece is about turn nine, and
loves Beyonce, and plays piano.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.120
And I was like, did she see it?

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.340
She should experience it as
part of a cultural thing.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.880
And I'm arguing with my sister.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.970
And it was like, no
it's too adult for her.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.180
And I argued with my sister
for legitimately an hour

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.924
and a half.

00:14:06.924 --> 00:14:08.590
Exhausted, an hour
and a half, I argued.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.372
And then yesterday,
she called me.

00:14:10.372 --> 00:14:11.830
And she was just
like, oh yeah, no.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:16.217
She had already seen it by
the time I talked to her.

00:14:16.217 --> 00:14:17.800
But it shows that I
needed to know why

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.410
you thought I should show her.

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.090
Why did you think?

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.250
And I'm just all passionate.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:24.980
She's an artist!

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.440
I'm screaming.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.070
She's making me defend
Beyonce's album for her.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.035
DARA WILSON:
Opposition research.

00:14:32.035 --> 00:14:33.660
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
Just in normal life.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.447
She was just like, but I needed
to know why you thought that.

00:14:36.447 --> 00:14:38.280
DARA WILSON: There has
to be an undercurrent

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.940
of a lot of love there.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.930
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
Yeah, there has to be.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.860
Because I fucking
hated her after that.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.670
But it's fun, though.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.934
It's fun.

00:14:48.934 --> 00:14:51.100
You want to know why-- I
mean, like you were saying,

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.997
why you feel a certain way,
and get to your own truth.

00:14:54.997 --> 00:14:56.580
AMBER STEVENS WEST:
I was just saying,

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:00.547
I think what's unique about our
show is that we are a family

00:15:00.547 --> 00:15:01.380
dynamic on the show.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.260
It's not just a group of friends
with difference of opinion.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.590
So I think that's
the safest place.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:07.560
You can be yourself.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.390
And like you were saying, you
can fight with your sister,

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.264
but at the end of the
day, she's your sister.

00:15:11.264 --> 00:15:13.620
And you can be as bluntly
honest as you want to.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.250
And I think that's why you
get such honest perspective

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.530
within our show.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.340
Because at the end
of the day, they're

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.006
all going to come back together,
and they're going to be family,

00:15:22.006 --> 00:15:26.260
but they can argue to the death.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.655
To the pain, maybe, yeah.

00:15:27.655 --> 00:15:31.150
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Also I'm
realizing, as I'm talking,

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.220
my apologies.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.390
You have to explicitly tell
me no cursing in order for me

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.902
not to say curse words, as
much as I've been saying.

00:15:37.902 --> 00:15:39.318
But I don't think
I've heard that.

00:15:39.318 --> 00:15:41.526
RAVI NANDAN: I feel like
you may say more after that.

00:15:41.526 --> 00:15:43.590
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
I listen for it.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.020
As a comic, if you don't
say "no cursing," if someone

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.289
doesn't, walking in a church,
you've got to tell me.

00:15:50.289 --> 00:15:51.580
DARA WILSON: I I think it's OK.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.490
We're all adults here.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.310
JERROD CARMICHAEL: OK, good.

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.410
DARA WILSON: Are
anyone's ears hurting?

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.502
Y'all are good.

00:15:55.502 --> 00:15:56.747
JERROD CARMICHAEL: OK.

00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:58.330
I got really
self-conscience about it.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.942
DARA WILSON: So the
show is breaking

00:16:03.942 --> 00:16:05.650
new ground, not just
because of the stuff

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.090
that you're talking about, but
because you are a black family

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.820
having these conversations.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.200
How important is it to you,
whatever responsibility there

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.530
is to be representing a
black family on television?

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.190
JERROD CARMICHAEL: I
have a responsibility

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.310
to do an honest
portrayal of a family,

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.879
and to be true to
my experiences,

00:16:27.879 --> 00:16:29.420
and true to the
people that I've met,

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.520
and the people that I know.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:37.770
And so finding the
beauty in that honesty

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.740
is where my obligation lies.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.860
Because a lot of times
when representing

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.850
any group of people,
a creator can

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.220
tend to go so
aspirational that they get

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.300
further away from the truth.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.700
After "The Cosby Show,"
like it's like, OK,

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.975
there's not that
many black lawyers.

00:16:55.975 --> 00:16:57.330
There's black doctors.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.300
You know what I mean?

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.195
It's not representing
a truth anymore.

00:17:03.195 --> 00:17:05.010
As with the Hillman
shirt right there.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.736
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:06.736 --> 00:17:08.569
DARA WILSON: That's my
attorney mother, so--

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.193
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
No, but, no, but I'm

00:17:10.193 --> 00:17:12.470
saying it has to be bent.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:14.170
A lot of times, it
goes so aspirational

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.930
that it stops being--

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:16.770
DARA WILSON: Yeah, you have
"The Cosby Show," and then--

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:17.304
JERROD CARMICHAEL: You
need "The Cosby Show,"

00:17:17.304 --> 00:17:19.930
and you also need that balance.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:26.365
And so a lot of times, I didn't
see the very honest portrayal

00:17:26.365 --> 00:17:29.870
of the full spectrum of what a
black family is on television.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.302
So that was really fun to do.

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:33.260
DARA WILSON: All right.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.334
I think that's an
acceptable answer.

00:17:36.334 --> 00:17:38.000
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
We could debate more.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.450
I'm real happy to.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:40.950
Oh yeah.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:41.949
DARA WILSON: No, no, no.

00:17:41.949 --> 00:17:44.220
That was great.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.600
Are there any things that
you haven't covered yet

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.540
that you want to?

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.890
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
There are always

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:57.890
questions and these
hypothetical type

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:00.400
questions that'll
come up that you

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.892
can build an episode around.

00:18:03.892 --> 00:18:07.880
So like my stand-up,
a lot of times

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:12.180
a topical thing will lead
to a deeper question.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.132
So I mean, we did
episode on Bill Cosby,

00:18:16.132 --> 00:18:17.715
but it really wasn't
about Bill Cosby.

00:18:17.715 --> 00:18:22.250
It was really about
talent versus morals.

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:26.680
And so finding those
pockets of question

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.940
is where we find things.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.242
So that happens every day.

00:18:30.242 --> 00:18:31.700
And it happens a
lot where you just

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.436
have an interesting question
that you want to see answered.

00:18:34.436 --> 00:18:35.560
DARA WILSON: Anything else?

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.210
You guys looking
forward to covering

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:38.730
any things in particular?

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.480
AMBER STEVENS WEST:
I'm excited for people

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.769
to see episodes that
have not aired yet.

00:18:42.769 --> 00:18:44.310
I mean, I'm not in
the writer's room.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.018
I don't know what
they're coming up with,

00:18:46.018 --> 00:18:50.545
but there's one that we just
shot that was hysterical.

00:18:50.545 --> 00:18:52.087
Am I allowed to say
what we're doing?

00:18:52.087 --> 00:18:53.086
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Yeah.

00:18:53.086 --> 00:18:55.480
AMBER STEVENS WEST: There's
one that we did about porn.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.740
And our table read
was so hilarious,

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.790
and everyone was
bright red in the room.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.550
And we had to stop
for long pauses

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.240
of uncomfortable laughter.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.530
It was the most fun.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.420
And it's just a subject
that you don't really

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.797
talk about, especially
with your family,

00:19:13.797 --> 00:19:16.130
but it's something that you
don't even really talk about

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.680
with your friends,
especially women.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.830
So I'm excited to
even see it myself.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:22.000
I haven't seen it.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.010
ARI KATCHER: Yeah, I
mean, just anything.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:28.180
Anything where you can
ask yourself a question,

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.080
and say, I don't know the
answer to that question

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.430
is good territory.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.360
Because we don't like
to end episodes on,

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.560
well, here's the actual
answer, or here's the thing.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.850
So any time it's literally
impossible to know the answer,

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.950
it's just difference of
opinion, is a good territory.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.750
So in that porn episode, I
was so excited to do that porn

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:50.250
episode.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.410
Because there is that
question that I don't know.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:54.210
Is it OK?

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.297
I Is it fine that we
are watching porn?

00:19:56.297 --> 00:19:57.880
Is it not OK that
we're watching porn?

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.922
Does it affect you badly?

00:19:58.922 --> 00:20:00.088
There's all these questions.

00:20:00.088 --> 00:20:02.480
I've had these conversations
with you and other friends

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.090
and stuff like
that, but any time

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.962
you can find a
subject like that,

00:20:06.962 --> 00:20:08.170
it's really, really exciting.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.640
When you yourself
don't know the answer,

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.580
you know it's going
to be a good, to me.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.180
DARA WILSON: Was there
any particular episode

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.510
that you were nervous
about when it came out?

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.700
Or were you just like,
this is what I have to say.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.700
You're going to hear it.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.866
I don't care what you think.

00:20:22.866 --> 00:20:26.590
JERROD CARMICHAEL: No, that's
the benefit of being stand-up.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:30.170
There's nothing we can do an
episode about that I haven't

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:35.990
completely alienated a group
of people in a dark room with.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.920
So it's nothing.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.810
I mean, what else can we?

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:41.726
ARI KATCHER: Yeah, no.

00:20:41.726 --> 00:20:44.050
Everything seems-- there
have definitely been topics

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.172
that other people
were nervous about,

00:20:46.172 --> 00:20:48.130
but I don't know if I've
ever felt that myself.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.005
RAVI NANDAN: There's
also been points of view

00:20:50.005 --> 00:20:52.397
that are interesting, that
maybe are unexpected in a way,

00:20:52.397 --> 00:20:54.730
that you're like, how are
people going to react to this?

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:57.000
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Yeah.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.230
ARI KATCHER: I've been I've been
excited to see how, especially

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.320
David Alan Grier in the
protest episode and stuff

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.820
like that, I was excited to see
what people's reactions were

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.600
going to be.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.450
And I don't know.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.980
There's something
exciting about maybe

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.270
somebody doesn't like
that you said a thing

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:16.410
or something like that.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:17.360
I think that's always positive.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.880
RAVI NANDAN: I think that's one
of the most interesting things

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.680
about the show, the
different points of view,

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.388
and that you're not
always going to agree

00:21:22.388 --> 00:21:24.370
with everybody's point of view.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:27.090
DARA WILSON: Probably impossible
to agree with everybody's point

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:27.940
of view on the show.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:28.700
ARI KATCHER: Yeah, it should be.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.783
RAVI NANDAN: It should be.

00:21:29.783 --> 00:21:30.510
Yeah, exactly.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:34.010
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Yeah, I think
finding that balanced argument

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.050
is where it's fun.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:40.950
Because the content you
receive shouldn't be mindless.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:43.620
And that's what
the sitcom became.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.465
It became mindless.

00:21:44.465 --> 00:21:46.090
You just receive it,
and it's mindless.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:48.310
You don't have to think
about what's being said,

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.770
or what the story is.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:53.000
You could just watch
it, and you go to sleep.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.330
But to make people agree, or
disagree, or feel anything

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:00.675
is important and
really exciting.

00:22:00.675 --> 00:22:02.050
DARA WILSON: So
is that something

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.340
you think about, even
on a character basis?

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.450
Like when somebody is about
to say something that may not

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.000
be palatable to
other people, how

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.010
do you maintain the
humanity of that character

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:15.437
while having them say
some outlandish things?

00:22:17.304 --> 00:22:18.720
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
I mean, I think

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.200
that's where knowing how
much they love each other,

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.085
and knowing who they
are as a person,

00:22:27.085 --> 00:22:30.510
and trying to establish that
first, before views are laid

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.040
out, allows you to
go, all right, well,

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.520
we know that this guy
loves his girlfriend.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.170
This guy love his
wife or vice versa.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.810
And so even if they're
saying the most absurd thing,

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:44.140
we know that there is
love and respect there.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.764
ARI KATCHER: Knowing
that there's love,

00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:48.472
and knowing that it's
honest, knowing that

00:22:48.472 --> 00:22:50.930
what you like to see, or at
least what I like to see on TV,

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:55.644
is people saying things that
you would relate to, but be

00:22:55.644 --> 00:22:57.060
a thought that you
would have had,

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.920
but were maybe too scared
to say in a certain moment.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.050
And you get to watch these
people actually say the thing

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.250
that you were thinking.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:10.790
The time when it's offensive
is when there's no thought,

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:12.720
and it's just stupid.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.080
That's why just random
stereotype jokes or something

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.670
like that feel more offensive.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:17.800
Because they're not smart.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.300
As long as something
comes from a thought,

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.050
I don't feel like
it's as offensive.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.670
So when you can be
like, oh, I understand

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:28.740
how that person could think that
way, or could feel that way,

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.162
maybe I disagree with
it, but I understand

00:23:31.162 --> 00:23:32.120
where it's coming from.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.370
As long as you understand
where someone's coming from,

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:37.980
as long as you can have some
sort of empathy for them,

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.707
I think that you're not going
to hate them for saying it.

00:23:40.707 --> 00:23:42.290
RAVI NANDAN: I also
think s much of it

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.110
is owed to the performances too.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.984
ARI KATCHER: Oh yeah.

00:23:44.984 --> 00:23:46.810
RAVI NANDAN: Our actors
do such a good job

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.310
of really taking it on and
believing those points of view,

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:52.220
too, so that they come off
from a very sincere and honest

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.250
place.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:56.470
DARA WILSON: I know
that all of the episodes

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.386
are personally relevant
to you because they're

00:23:58.386 --> 00:24:01.230
coming from you,
but for any of you,

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:04.570
was there any one particular
episode that really hit home

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:09.780
with you, that felt
especially important?

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.100
AMBER STEVENS WEST: You'd have
to list all the episodes to me.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.170
We've done so many, and
they're all so great,

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.600
and they've got their own
special moments in each of them

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.070
that I identify with and
sparked something in me.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.420
I literally can't even
remember what we've done now.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.060
RAVI NANDAN: Yeah.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.560
I mean, I feel like
almost every one,

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.910
there's a piece
that rings for me.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:30.370
AMBER STEVENS WEST:
Yeah, there's always

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:31.790
something in each episode.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.289
RAVI NANDAN: People in my family
have battled depression, so

00:24:34.289 --> 00:24:35.390
that one.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.160
Gun control's always such a big
thing, no matter where you are,

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.870
I feel.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:41.540
Obviously, Cosby,
grew up with Cosby,

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.940
and the whole
conversation is one

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.219
that I feel I have every
day around other things.

00:24:47.219 --> 00:24:49.510
AMBER STEVENS WEST: I liked
our Islamophobia one a lot.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.910
I thought that one was
a pretty poignant thing

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.970
that we don't
discuss enough that's

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.730
going on a lot in our
country right now.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:02.930
That one I thought was
great, well handled.

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:03.860
Yeah.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:04.510
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Thank you.

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:05.968
AMBER STEVENS WEST:
You're welcome.

00:25:05.968 --> 00:25:07.956
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:09.780
DARA WILSON: Cool.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:15.700
And then I guess on
a more general level,

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:19.190
what is the one thing that
you are most excited about,

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:24.060
about having this opportunity
to work with these people?

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.120
JERROD CARMICHAEL: I
mean, just the day to day

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.120
is really fun, the
process and the fact

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:34.750
that it is this Rubik's cube,
where it's always a piece

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.840
that you have to figure out.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.010
I always need to be challenged,
and so, in a general sense,

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:44.380
just having something
to figure out every day

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.710
was really exciting.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:51.140
And being around people
that are just like-minded,

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:56.970
trying to help you
solve it is really fun.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:59.030
AMBER STEVENS WEST:
What was the question?

00:25:59.030 --> 00:25:59.900
Why is it so fun?

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.185
I'm It's just so fun.

00:26:02.185 --> 00:26:03.010
It's so fun.

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.880
JERROD CARMICHAEL: But word
it in such a more articulate--

00:26:07.545 --> 00:26:08.920
AMBER STEVENS
WEST: No, we really

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.711
work with a really
special group of people.

00:26:10.711 --> 00:26:13.360
Everyone is so talented,
and so much fun,

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.080
and excited about what
they do every single day.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.000
I mean, I don't ever
want to go home.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.330
When we have hiatus week,
I'm like, it's too long.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:21.050
I want to go back to work.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:22.591
Because we have so
much fun together.

00:26:22.591 --> 00:26:24.650
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Oh,
you're [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.525
AMBER STEVENS WEST: We
just had a great time,

00:26:26.525 --> 00:26:27.740
and there's not one bad seed.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.670
I mean, literally,
from every crew member,

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.310
to writer, to actor,
it's like we all

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:33.580
are one big happy family.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:37.120
And so it's a blast getting
to get together and make

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:41.440
these interesting shows.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.540
JERROD CARMICHAEL: I
bet that now next week,

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.204
they headline-- Loretta
Devine stabs David Alan Grier.

00:26:46.204 --> 00:26:49.440
I thought things were
sweet and delightful there.

00:26:51.919 --> 00:26:53.710
ARI KATCHER: Favorite
thing about the show?

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:55.730
I hate sleeping.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:58.440
So it's been great that
I don't have to do it.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.190
AMBER STEVENS WEST:
No sleeping this year.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:01.690
RAVI NANDAN: It's
for your insomnia?

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.720
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Again,
90 minutes is effective.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.788
You hit REM, you get
in there, you get out.

00:27:08.788 --> 00:27:11.750
Get a cup of coffee, and
hit the ground running.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.140
I'm on 90 minutes right now.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.377
I'm really excited.

00:27:14.377 --> 00:27:14.960
Not even that.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.340
I'm on, like, 35, and I'm
really happy right now.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.914
DARA WILSON: Well, you're
delirious, but that's OK.

00:27:20.914 --> 00:27:22.330
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
Potato, patata.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.034
RAVI NANDAN: He won't
remember any of this.

00:27:25.034 --> 00:27:26.950
JERROD CARMICHAEL: I
will remember that, dude.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:33.196
It will be a nightmarish
dream that I wake up from.

00:27:33.196 --> 00:27:37.430
Actually, I want
to redo "Being John

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.510
Malkovich" based on that dude.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:44.266
Go inside of his head,
experience what he has.

00:27:44.266 --> 00:27:48.000
ARI KATCHER: No, that you get
to work really hard on a thing

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.190
that you like.

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:51.260
I don't know.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:55.710
Because if you had to work
that hard on something

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:58.990
that you didn't like,
it would b so brutal.

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:01.780
Because I mean, it's long
hours, and it's hard.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.800
But then you get to see the
thing that you worked hard on,

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.400
and you're excited about
it, and you enjoy it.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.000
And yeah, that's
really, really great.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.616
Yeah, it makes it worth it.

00:28:12.616 --> 00:28:14.990
RAVI NANDAN: I think it's
great to be part of a show that

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.660
can be part of the conversation,
that talks about issues

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.754
in a way that's
funny, and sincere,

00:28:20.754 --> 00:28:22.420
and is hopefully
getting a point across.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.760
And I think that's a
rare thing in TV today.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.510
DARA WILSON: Cool.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:29.899
Well, I think we have time
for some audience questions.

00:28:29.899 --> 00:28:30.815
AUDIENCE: Hi, Camille.

00:28:30.815 --> 00:28:31.500
Super fan.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.230
I have to admit,
though, I started

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:36.570
DVRing because of Loretta
Devine and David Alan Grier.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.182
It's the childhood dream team

00:28:38.182 --> 00:28:39.390
JERROD CARMICHAEL: We get it.

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:39.889
We get it.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:48.940
AUDIENCE: So I'm married, and
I'm married to a Sicilian man.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:53.910
And your show and shows like
it help the conversations.

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:57.120
Because somehow I
represent all of America,

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.860
all of black America, all of
California, all of Georgia.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:01.750
I'm Southern.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:02.750
So I have to represent
a lot of things.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:03.990
JERROD CARMICHAEL: That's a
lot of weight on your shoulders

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.722
right there.

00:29:04.722 --> 00:29:06.420
AUDIENCE: So I thank
you for bringing

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.100
the Southern, the
black perspective,

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.010
having characters
like my parents,

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:14.100
like things I really relate
to that make our conversations

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:14.795
just easier.

00:29:14.795 --> 00:29:15.920
So I want to say thank you.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:16.250
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Thank you.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:17.803
AUDIENCE: And I have a request.

00:29:17.803 --> 00:29:19.740
I don't know who this goes to.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.570
It has happened twice, but the
funeral episode specifically,

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:27.095
Loretta Devine, I was
waiting for her to sing.

00:29:29.674 --> 00:29:31.420
I mean, she can sing.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.720
And I was OK she
didn't know the words.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.740
But just let her--

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.010
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Let her go.

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.610
Let me tell you something.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:38.616
You say of that.

00:29:38.616 --> 00:29:40.490
ARI KATCHER: Loretta'll
bring the house down.

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.640
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
How can I say this?

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.920
You gotta reel Loretta in.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:47.565
Loretta will just sing, and
then everybody's all emotional.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:51.190
It's hard.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.120
You know, it's funny.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.650
I used to watch shows that would
have a musical performance.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.300
It's hard to realistically
squeeze that in.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.301
Do you know what I mean?

00:29:59.301 --> 00:30:00.383
ARI KATCHER: A whole song.

00:30:00.383 --> 00:30:01.920
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
I would love to.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.461
We get these snippets,
but it's hard.

00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:04.880
It was always like,
I would shows,

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.225
and it always gets too corny.

00:30:06.225 --> 00:30:08.100
In that moment, it's
just like, and now we're

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.481
going to do a four minute
just a song right now.

00:30:11.481 --> 00:30:13.693
ARI KATCHER: It could
be an amazing throwback.

00:30:13.693 --> 00:30:14.693
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Yeah.

00:30:14.693 --> 00:30:15.192
All right.

00:30:15.192 --> 00:30:18.130
I guess we'll do a song.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.047
It's really difficult.

00:30:19.047 --> 00:30:21.130
RAVI NANDAN: The moment
where she sings in protest

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.290
is pretty incredible.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:23.440
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Yeah.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.148
AMBER STEVENS WEST:
I'm never sick of it.

00:30:25.148 --> 00:30:26.970
We play "Protest"
before a lot of our tape

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:28.720
nights for the audience
when they come in.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.950
And so we can always
hear it backstage,

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:30.810
hear Loretta singing.

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.851
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Because
we like getting people

00:30:32.851 --> 00:30:34.384
in the mood for a comedy.

00:30:34.384 --> 00:30:36.800
Hey, you want to play the one
where a black kid gets shots

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.970
by a cop.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:39.970
Right before the comedy?

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:41.176
I think that's a good idea.

00:30:41.176 --> 00:30:41.870
Let me do that.

00:30:45.385 --> 00:30:46.260
More Loretta singing?

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:51.415
If you think that
Loretta doesn't

00:30:51.415 --> 00:30:53.821
pitch us doing
musicals, she pitches

00:30:53.821 --> 00:30:55.820
us doing a musical episode
at least once a week.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:56.610
AMBER STEVENS WEST:
At least once a week.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:57.530
That's not a joke.

00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:58.330
That's not a joke.

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:00.746
JERROD CARMICHAEL: So when we
gonna do this musical thing?

00:31:00.746 --> 00:31:02.610
Reprise songs from "Dreamgirls."

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:03.810
All right.

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:07.160
I'm like, relax.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.880
AUDIENCE: Hey, I'm Greg.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.530
Thanks so much for coming out.

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.992
I'm just now embarking
upon my acting career

00:31:12.992 --> 00:31:14.200
here in the Bay Area as well.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.741
And so I just wanted
to know if there

00:31:15.741 --> 00:31:18.610
are any specific techniques,
such as the Meisner technique

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:23.383
or what have you, that are
really useful for television.

00:31:23.383 --> 00:31:24.495
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Ooh.

00:31:24.495 --> 00:31:25.870
AMBER STEVENS
WEST: OK, well, I'm

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:29.460
not a classically
trained actor, but I

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.300
can say, the best thing that
you can ever learn to do

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.930
is learn on camera technique.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:37.025
Know that you have
to catch light.

00:31:37.025 --> 00:31:38.150
This stuff's all important.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:38.790
They don't tell you this.

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.190
Look, when you get
on a set, there's

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.480
a light you have to stand near.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.180
Because you're going to
get shadowed by something.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.165
So you have to learn about that.

00:31:44.165 --> 00:31:44.440
ARI KATCHER: I didn't
even know that.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.200
AMBER STEVENS WEST: You have
to learn how to get to a mark

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.570
without looking at a mark.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:50.470
And you also have to learn how
to learn lines really fast.

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:52.520
I think those are the
most important things

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.610
that you need as an everyday
skill as a working actor.

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:59.749
So there are on camera
classes that you can take.

00:31:59.749 --> 00:32:01.665
Cold reading class, I
think is really helpful.

00:32:01.665 --> 00:32:03.810
It just works your brain.

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.470
It gets you used to memorizing
something really quickly.

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:08.030
You even learn your own tricks.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:10.386
But that's as deep
as I go as an actor.

00:32:10.386 --> 00:32:12.510
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Learning
your tricks is probably

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:14.260
the most important.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:17.650
I don't really like classes,
and I have my questions

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:19.350
about formal
education in general.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.690
But we don't have time.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:30.440
It more so addles your brain
than fosters creativity.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.540
It makes us all sheep.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.540
Yadda-yadda-yadda-yadda.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.165
AMBER STEVENS WEST:
Makes us all sheep.

00:32:34.165 --> 00:32:36.556
DARA WILSON: It's an audience
full of addled brains.

00:32:36.556 --> 00:32:37.150
JERROD CARMICHAEL: No,
but I'm just saying,

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:38.220
you have to be cautious.

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.650
You have to guard
your own creativity

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:44.120
in any type of class,
any type of technique.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.330
If you look at a
lot of the stories

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:48.470
from your favorite
actors, you actually

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:54.170
will learn that they dropped out
of class, like De Niro, Pacino,

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:57.180
Denzel Washington-- people
that did class, got what they

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.070
needed, and then just split.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:05.900
Because wherever the voids
are, you fill those voids in,

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.560
and you be really
honest with yourself

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.960
with your own strengths
and weaknesses.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.500
And if all else fails, hire
somebody like David Alan Grier

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:17.230
to just do the lion's share
of the acting work for you.

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:17.730
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:23.960
But yeah, I don't
know if there's

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.840
anything in particular
for sitcom acting,

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:32.980
but in general, Meisner's
method, or is that Strasberg?

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.230
RAVI NANDAN: That's Strasberg.

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:36.770
JERROD CARMICHAEL: Strasberg's
method, I would say that.

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:38.686
If you're going to play
a heroine addict, man,

00:33:38.686 --> 00:33:41.500
do some heroine, man.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.020
Go in there.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:42.598
Live life.

00:33:42.598 --> 00:33:43.098
Go for it.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:50.760
DARA WILSON: We can't undersign
any of this as Google, but--

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.740
JERROD CARMICHAEL: If
you think that people

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.440
who have the idea
to create Google

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.470
hadn't dabbled in
a couple drugs--

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:00.587
DARA WILSON: We just
saw the guy outside.

00:34:00.587 --> 00:34:03.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.190
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for the show.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.462
We found it maybe
about four months ago,

00:34:09.462 --> 00:34:10.920
and we watched
every single episode

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.270
we could get our hands on.

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:13.659
So that was pretty awesome.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:15.290
My question is,
where do you guys see

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:16.699
the show going in the future?

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.909
And I do have one request,
and the request is,

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:20.676
I'd like to see more
of the brother's--

00:34:20.676 --> 00:34:22.134
JERROD CARMICHAEL:
Loretta singing.

00:34:22.134 --> 00:34:23.068
AUDIENCE: No.

00:34:23.068 --> 00:34:23.506
JERROD CARMICHAEL: We get it!

00:34:23.506 --> 00:34:24.820
You want a [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.300
AUDIENCE: That's not my request.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:26.420
JERROD CARMICHAEL: I'm sorry.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.552
I'm sorry.

00:34:27.552 --> 00:34:30.010
AUDIENCE: I'd like to see more
of your brother's baby mama.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:31.270
I think she's funny.

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.880
AMBER STEVENS WEST: Tiffany.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.305
AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:34:32.305 --> 00:34:32.860
She's hilarious.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.610
AMBER STEVENS WEST:
Tiffany's hilarious.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:34.818
AUDIENCE: That's my question.

00:34:34.818 --> 00:34:37.139
JERROD CARMICHAEL: All right.

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:38.586
Where do we see the show?

00:34:38.586 --> 00:34:40.710
I mean, just again, just
staying honest to whatever

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:44.710
conversations we're
having and whatever topics

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:45.800
seem interesting.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.970
It's no specific thing.

00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:49.670
We're always trying to grow
and get better, and make

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.380
sure the chemistry,
and the rhythm,

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.260
and all those
things are stronger

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.699
in a more general sense,
but specifically just

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:58.670
staying close to the truth,
and staying close to things

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.960
that we feel passionate about.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.340
And yes, more Tiffany.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:04.130
More Tiffany.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:04.840
She's great.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.980
She's really fun to write for.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.590
She just bursts in.

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.055
ARI KATCHER: She
is really funny.

00:35:11.055 --> 00:35:14.290
DARA WILSON: Well, thank you all
so much for being here with us.

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:15.160
AMBER STEVENS WEST:
Thanks for having us.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.060
RAVI NANDAN: Thanks
for having us.

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:16.360
AMBER STEVENS WEST:
Thanks for coming.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.910
[APPLAUSE]
