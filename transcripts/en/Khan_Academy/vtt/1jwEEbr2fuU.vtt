00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.410
Where are we?

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.460
So we're on page 669, and we're
going to start on test

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.460
number five, section seven.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.600
Problem number one-- if k is a
positive integer divisible by

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.570
3, and if k is less than 60,
what is the greatest possible

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.140
value of k?

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.450
So it's a positive integer
greater than-- it's positive,

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.160
so it's greater than 0.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.090
It's divisible by 3, and
it's less than 60.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.700
k is less than 60.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.410
60 is divisible by 3, right?

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.460
3 times 20 is 60.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.790
So if I subtract 3 from
60, that will also be

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.070
divisible by 60.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.670
So k is equal to 57.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.280
Right? k can't be 60 because
it's less than 60.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.460
And then the next
one down is 57.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.720
And if you don't believe that
3 is divisible into 57-- 3

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.070
goes into 57-- 1, 1 times 3,
27-- goes into it 19 times.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.590
There you go.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.616
So the choice is C, 57.

00:01:00.616 --> 00:01:02.610
And if you haven't learned this
already, the easiest way

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.680
to figure out if the
number's divisible

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.080
by 57, add the digits.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.510
So 5 plus 7 is 12,
1 plus 2 is 3.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.690
So if when you add the digits,
the sum you get is divisible

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.210
by 3, then the original number
is also divisible by 3.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.790
So you could actually have gone
down the choices, but you

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.460
don't want to waste too much
time on the first problem.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.880
Problem two-- the letter H is
symmetric with respect to two

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.380
different lines, as shown
in the dotted line

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.540
in the figure above.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.530
Which of the following is
symmetric with respect to at

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.050
least two different lines?

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.610
So when they talk about H,
they're saying-- if I draw an

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.120
H, they draw this line
of symmetry here.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.410
And that means if I were to flip
H over this way, I get

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.150
the same thing.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.920
If I were to flip it over this
line, I get the same thing.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.420
It's like a mirror image
on either side.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.340
Right?

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.720
This green line is a mirror
image of this purple line.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.850
And the other way is true too.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:02.160
If I have H, this mauve part
is the mirror image of this

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.090
brown part along the
horizontal axis.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.759
If I were to draw a--
if this was the axis

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.850
of the mirror image.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.750
So which of the other
letters has it?

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.990
So it should be a letter that
looks the same-- that could be

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.130
kind of folded in half either
vertically or horizontally.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.220
And if we look at all
the choices, X is

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.180
definitely the answer.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.230
Because if you have an X, and if
you have a vertical line of

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.700
symmetry, notice that the
left-hand side is the mirror

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.670
image of the right-hand side.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.050
Or you could flip
it over, right?

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.080
They look the same.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.580
It almost looks like a
reflection of the other side.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.330
Similarly, if you took
it the other way.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.020
Also you could flip it up and
down, and they also have the

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.840
mirror image.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.000
None of the other letters
have that property.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.250
Next problem.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.070
Problem number three.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.110
Bobby receives $2.00 for each
chore he does during the week,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.030
plus a weekly allowance
of $10.00.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.270
If Bobby receives no other
money, which of the following

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.620
expressions represents the
total dollar amount Bobby

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.930
receives per week in which
he does n chores?

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.990
So if he does n chores, how much
money is he going to get

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.850
just from doing chores?

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.550
He does n chores, and how much
does he get per chore?

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.060
Well, he gets $2.00.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.080
Times 2.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.500
So this is how much he gets
just from doing chores,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.410
2n, or n times 2.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.540
And then how much is he
going to get even

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.910
if he does 0 chores?

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.270
He gets a $10.00 allowance no
matter what, far more than I

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.780
ever got as a child.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.770
So what is the formula?

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.630
It's 2n plus 10, is the amount
of money he gets.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.430
And that is choice D.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.950
Right?

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.330
n is the number of chores, he
gets $2.00 per chore, and he

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.660
gets $10.00 no matter what,
even if n is 0, even if he

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.980
does no chores.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.460
Next problem, four.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.480
The smallest squares in figure
A and figure B are

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.120
all equal in size.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.100
If the area in A is 26 square
centimeters, what is the area

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.900
of figure B?

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.350
So let's see if I can
draw these figures.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.150
So I'll use the line tool, so a
looks like-- let's see, you

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.950
have a line there.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.279
So let me draw a rectangle.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.980
So the rectangle looks
like that.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.210
Close enough.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.580
And then there's another
rectangle that's like this.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.830
Another rectangle like this--
the drawing is the hardest

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.500
part, my shaky hands.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.750
OK, almost there.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.615
I think you get the point,
I try my best.

00:04:52.615 --> 00:04:53.620
Have to give me credit.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.120
OK, so that's figure A, and then
figure B looks like this.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.550
Horizontal line, and then a
vertical line like that.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.810
And then, let's see,
it has that.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.660
Connect these two.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.960
And then-- oh boy,
this is tiring.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.100
I have a line like that.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.690
And then it gets split roughly
in half over there.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.350
And then this connects
like that.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.890
That connects like that.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.460
And then I have a
line like that.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.450
So what they're telling us is in
figure A-- whoops, I don't

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.710
want to do that, edit undo--
what they're saying is figure

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.390
A, each of these squares are the
same size as each of these

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.170
squares in figure B.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.890
And they also tell us that
figure A is 26 square

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:49.800
centimeters.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.870
So the area is 26 centimeters
squared.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.090
So we want to figure
out the area of B.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.480
We have to just figure out,
how big is each of these

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.570
little tiles?

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.090
Right?

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.360
So how many tiles are in a?

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.920
Let's count them.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:10.740
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.040
13 tiles.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.490
And they're 26 centimeters
cubed total, right?

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.070
So if 13 times the area of
a tile is equal to 26

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.310
centimeters, a tile-- divide
both sides by 13-- is 2

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.800
centimeters squared, right?

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.950
Each tile is 2 centimeters
squared.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.000
And how many tiles
does B have?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.380
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.220
It has 8.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.610
So its area is 8 times the
number of tiles-- or the area

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.110
of the tiles.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.290
And we know what the area of
the tiles are-- it's 2,

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.790
because it's the same as A.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.090
So area is equal to 8 times
2, which is equal to 16

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.230
centimeters squared,
which is choice C.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.120
Next problem.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.940
More drawing for Sal.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.740
Oh boy, it's the drawing
that really tires me.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.880
OK.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.970
And I have to draw it pretty
accurately, because

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.975
otherwise-- this is all
about reading a graph.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.500
All right, so let me draw.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:20.431
Let me make the first one-- so
Albert goes to like 300.

00:07:20.431 --> 00:07:23.110
This is 300.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.800
And then it's 150, which is
roughly half of that.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.980
And then the next guy is
like a little over 200,

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.340
so it's like 2/3.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.856
I'm just trying my best,
trying my best.

00:07:38.856 --> 00:07:45.280
Then the next guy, I guess
at like 250, here.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.360
And then the last guy-- I'm
drawing the white boxes, this

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.970
is pretty much the
same number.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.000
Like that.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.440
And then let me draw the other
one in here, so the

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.630
other guy is 150.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.970
This guy gets to 250.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:05.830
Which I said was roughly
the same amount as

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.120
these guys over here.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.040
Next guy looks about the same.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.300
250, that's about that.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.100
And this guy is like that.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.340
All the work I'm doing now is
just to redraw what you

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:29.820
already have. Then this guy is
like 350, 300 or something.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.890
If I were to draw-- let
me mark it off.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:40.350
So this is 300, this is 150--
see those guys that are a

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.796
little bit under 200.

00:08:42.796 --> 00:08:47.550
So this is like 200,
this is 250.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.530
They're asking us, according
to the graph above, which

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.830
salesperson had the greatest
increase in the number of

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.360
units sold from 1988 to 1999?

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.860
So the 1988 ones are
the blue ones, and

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.310
1999 are the red ones.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.750
So you're essentially saying,
who had the greatest increase

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.160
going from the blue
to the red, right?

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.400
And this is Albert, this is
Goldberg, Patel-- that's nice,

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.070
they included an Indian guy.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.170
Smith, Wang.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.876
I look forward to when
they have a Khan on

00:09:18.876 --> 00:09:20.920
the SAT, but anyway.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.120
So who increased the most going
from the blue year,

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.170
1998, to 1999.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.190
This guy clearly decreased,
right?

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.450
He went from 300 to 150,
so it's not him.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.000
This guy decreased, he went
from something larger to

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.980
something smaller,
so it's not him.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.410
So who had the largest
increase?

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.150
Well, you could eyeball
it, right?

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.980
Where are the increases?

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:47.240
This guy increased this much,
compared to a small increase

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.500
here, and a small
increase here.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:56.290
So the answer is G, or Goldberg,
which is choice B.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.150
See you in the next video.
