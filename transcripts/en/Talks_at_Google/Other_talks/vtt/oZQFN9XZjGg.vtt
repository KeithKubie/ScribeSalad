ANDY: Hey, Austin.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.670
Today we have an
author, magician,

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.710
host of "Scam School,"
the only show dedicated

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.990
to social engineering at
the bar and on the street,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.730
and now "Hacking the System"
on the National Geographic

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.230
Channel.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.771
Let's give a big,
warm Google awesome

00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:21.010
welcome to Brian Brushwood.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.760
[AUDIENCE  CHEERS]

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.850
BRIAN BUSHWOOD: All right!

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.414
Wow!

00:00:24.414 --> 00:00:25.080
What a response!

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.840
Howdy guys, my name
is Brian Brushwood.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.590
Real quick, hands in
the air if any of you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.930
guys have seen any of the
projects that I've done.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.430
OK, great.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.750
This is great.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.045
Five years ago when somebody
asked who I was and what I did,

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:43.230
it was very, very simple.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.710
My job is I am a
touring full-time stage

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.270
performer who dabbles on
the internet here and there.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.450
Things have changed over
the last half decade.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.260
Nowadays I host a show
on National Geographic.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.120
You know, "Scam Schools," one
of the top 1,000 most subscribed

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.490
channels on all of YouTube.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.110
But I wanted to talk about
where everything began.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.880
And where it began
was right here.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.800
This is a photo of me
and the Magician Teller

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.220
from Penn and Teller, standing
on the exact spot where

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.080
20 years before I originally
started street performing.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.500
At the age of 19,
20 years old, I

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.400
had a vague sense that I wanted
to be like Penn and Teller.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.220
I wanted to be like
Harry Anderson.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.990
I wanted to be a travelling,
touring stage performer.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.750
But no sense of
how to get there.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.019
And so instead I
met Penn and Teller

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:31.060
after one of their shows.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.302
They're very approachable.

00:01:32.302 --> 00:01:33.760
I encourage you to
watch their show

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.790
and go up and meet
with them afterwards.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.261
And I made the joke
to Teller, I said hey,

00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:40.260
you know sign this card.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.791
Make it out to my bastard son.

00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:43.290
And he thought that
was funny enough

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.399
that we struck up a
brief conversation,

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.940
and I found out
later that I had been

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.640
added on to his email list.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.390
And so I said, oh my gosh I
have Teller's email address.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.010
Of course, this is the mid
'90s and the very novelty

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.230
of the e-mail was exciting.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.390
And four times I started to
write a letter to my hero,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.180
and I couldn't figure
out how to begin.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.222
I didn't want to sound
like just another fan.

00:02:04.222 --> 00:02:06.430
I assumed that he gets emails
like this all the time.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.346
I wanted to stand out.

00:02:07.346 --> 00:02:10.520
I wanted to get real
advice from him.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.160
And then one day, in
a fit of random rage,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.200
I wrote this, with the
subject heading of "Fury."

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.500
And I wrote a letter
to Teller talking

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.260
about how angry I was at him.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.740
Not for being brilliant.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.140
Not for being original.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.030
Not for being extraordinary.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.129
But because he got there first.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.670
And I realized that because he
got there first, I could never

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.660
be the kind of
magician I wanted to be

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.300
without looking like a shabby
Penn and Teller knockoff.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.890
One of the bits of advice that
I'd read from them in a article

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.690
in I want to say "Genii
Magazinee," they say

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.460
don't, when you are
writing your material,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.880
don't be inspired by
something you love.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.260
If you are inspired by
something that you love,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.170
the best you will be is
a pale, shabby imitation

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.580
of whatever that thing is.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.690
So instead, be inspired
by what you hate.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.190
Go see a bunch of
crappy magic shows.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.860
Figure out exactly what
you hate about all of them

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.860
and then be the exact opposite.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.320
Now you are something truly
original and extraordinary,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.200
and you made your own
space in the universe.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.760
So I wrote him, I don't know
just to give him a hard time.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.880
And writing the
email was cathartic.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.942
I felt this weight off.

00:03:19.942 --> 00:03:21.150
I was like, whoa, look at me.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.460
I feel like I
expressed by my rage.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.430
I'm 19.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.360
And the next morning,
to my utter surprise,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.280
Teller wrote a four and
half page essay in response

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.650
on the nature of creativity.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.420
By the way, just look at
Brian Brushwood Teller letter

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.440
if you want to read
the entire thing.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.882
And in it he talks about--
there's one line that

00:03:42.882 --> 00:03:44.090
really sticks out in my mind.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.260
He says, take your best
stab and keep on stabbing.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.100
If it's in you it's
going to come out.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.590
And what I took
away from that is

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.440
that I needed to put
myself in a position

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.250
to discover what was inside me.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.250
And what I discovered is
that street performing seemed

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.000
like a good place to begin.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.205
It's something that
nobody could tell you no.

00:04:03.205 --> 00:04:04.580
The worst case
scenario is people

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.752
turn around and walk away.

00:04:05.752 --> 00:04:07.960
And if you're really lucky,
you get $50 of beer money

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.190
by the end of the night.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.110
Unfortunately,
here in Austin they

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.540
don't have an established
hierarchy or permitting

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.010
system for street performing,
or they didn't at the time.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.029
And so I actually noticed
that this souvenir

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.985
shop on Sixth street has
a two foot wide strip.

00:04:23.985 --> 00:04:25.360
It used to be a
jewelry shop that

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.700
would close in the evenings.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.550
And I figured out that if I
was on the public sidewalk,

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.990
I was illegally performing
without a permit.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.370
But if I was on this two foot
strip, I was only trespassing.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.042
And if I was only
trespassing, then

00:04:39.042 --> 00:04:41.500
they could only chase me off
if it was the private property

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.416
owners, or at least
that's what I told myself.

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:47.770
And over this time, I
learned a bit about-- eh--

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.330
when you put yourself
out there, when

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.620
you try to share what's in
your heart, when you try

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.599
to have some kind
of art out there,

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.140
turns out you're going to deal
with people who don't like it.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.140
And if there's one thing
I want you to take away

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.260
from the opening
remarks here is that you

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.620
should love your trolls.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.280
I started off not
loving my trolls.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.090
I learned when I was
street performing

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.100
that the way you get
someone to shut the hell up

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.500
is shine just enough
spotlight on them that they

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.350
feel a fraction of the fear
that I feel on stage performing.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.790
I realized that if
I wanted to keep

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.650
going with my narrative,
what I needed to do

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.250
was turn the entire rest of
the audience against that one

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.530
person.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.720
And you learn zingers.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.880
In many ways, doing any
kind of variety performer

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.570
is like living the life
of "Groundhog Day."

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:36.870
You do the same show.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.190
It doesn't matter where you
are, what situation you're in,

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.700
for that one hour, it's
always the same strict stage.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.200
It's always the same audience.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.760
It's always the same situations.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.100
Whenever you see a seasoned
variety performer have

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.730
a quick zinger, it
is not because they

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.180
are very quick on their feet.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.670
The reason was, three years
ago someone heckled him

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.290
with the exact same line,
and four days afterwards, he

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.550
was like, son of a bitch!

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.760
That's what I should've said!

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.830
And he filed it away, right?

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.090
And it's very comforting.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.630
It's very soothing
to have this idea

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.890
that no matter how
bad one show goes,

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.290
you know that down the
road you can try again.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.840
So after performing on the
street for a little bit,

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.087
I moved indoors, and
I started performing

00:06:20.087 --> 00:06:22.170
at a little venue called
the Electric Lounge where

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.500
I would do the same 15 minute
set and then pass the hat.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.320
And I started touring
to colleges nationwide.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.100
And I had a moment-- some
lessons come to you early on.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.510
You have an idea for what
kind of outrageous stunt

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.500
you want to pull.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.240
And then other things
take longer to realize.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.680
And in this case, I
was at Davis and Elkins

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.260
college in West
Virginia, and I did not

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.900
connect with that audience.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.610
My show was meant to be a
sarcastic, almost middle finger

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.770
parody of, what at the
time was the bedazzled,

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.620
sequined-wearing, fans blowing
your David Copperfield hair

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.920
kind of magic show.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.590
And it turns out that the
exact thing I was mocking

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.810
was what that crowd
really wanted to see.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.120
And at the end of the show, I
walked off stage and somebody

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.520
threw fruit at my stage.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.620
I did not know that
this was a real thing.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.840
I walk off, and all of a
sudden there's just a slam,

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.690
and I turn around
just in time to see

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.320
orange juice you know sliming
down over one of my props.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.560
And it occurred to
me, I was like, why

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.190
is it that I'm not connecting
with this audience?

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.140
And then this happened.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.210
This is a statement that I never
thought I was going to make.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:43.140
Later, the next year, I toured
with Brooks and Dunn, Rascal

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.830
Flatts, and Brad Paisley is a
thing that actually happened.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.750
And they set up something
called the Neon Circus Stage.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.080
It was like a midway, and I
would do my punk rock magic.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.430
I would shove tubes up my
nose, pull it out my mouth,

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.570
I would hammer a 4 and
1/2 inch nail in my nose

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.340
and have blood and
guts everywhere.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.710
But one of the best things
that came out of all this

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.410
was a-- we had our own tour bus.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:04.700
It was amazing.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.470
That's me giving the
middle finger, sorry.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.800
Straight jacket escape.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.330
This guy right here.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.280
His name is Dennis Rogers.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.770
And he, at the time I
thought was so, so, so wrong.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.960
Dennis Rogers is a
former world champion arm

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.270
wrestler who has
a supreme gift, he

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.930
has unbelievably
dense muscle tissue.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:27.690
If you touch his forearm,
it is like touching a brick.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.190
His act consists of stuff
like taking a frying pan

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.250
and rolling it up like
he's rolling a newspaper.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.370
He'll take a wrench,
you know, that you'll

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.809
do your best to
even make a dent in,

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.520
and he just bends it
like it's nothing.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.059
He bends iron spikes.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:45.210
He is legitimately,
phenomenally gifted in strength.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.134
And yet I saw him
in this environment,

00:08:48.134 --> 00:08:49.800
where you get a bunch
of people-- that's

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.690
the nice thing about street
performing or midway performing

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.019
is that it's the most
artistically pure venue I

00:08:55.019 --> 00:08:55.560
can think of.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.947
Because nobody's
there to see you.

00:08:57.947 --> 00:08:59.530
Nobody showed up
because you're there.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:04.170
You have to earn the respect to
get people to stop and watch.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.060
And there was one show
that it drove me nuts,

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.000
because I'm watching
Dennis Rogers, who

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.460
again is legitimately the best
in breed with what he does.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.460
And I watch him
responding, giving power

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.990
to these trolls, these hecklers.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.720
There's three or four of these
frat boy douchebags sitting

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.860
there with their red Solo cups
shouting out that this is fake,

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.010
or that's rigged, or whatever.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:34.090
And to me, as the jaded, bitter
street performer, I'm like,

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.660
look you mock them, turn
the audience against them,

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.560
look them in the
eye, say shut up,

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.260
and then you get
on with your show.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.220
And instead, what
I watched Dennis

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.370
do was give them all the power.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.450
He came up afterward-- he did
his whole show twice, once

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.280
on stage and again
one-on-one for them, handing

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.940
over the individual wrenches.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.940
Well, here go ahead and
check out the wrench.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.680
Try to bend it.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.875
And then [SOUND EFFECT].

00:09:55.875 --> 00:09:58.270
Oh, sure, yeah, I'll be
happy to arm wrestle you.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:01.170
By the way, I'm genuinely a
world champion arm wrestler.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.160
And at the time, I
was so disappointed

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.240
because I felt like, ah,
Dennis don't you get it?

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.900
They're cattle.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.030
They need to be moved
to the slaughter chutes.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.450
You need to own
this performance.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.400
You're better than that.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.070
And it turns out that
I was completely wrong,

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.420
and Dennis is 100% right.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.810
Because, after touring for
15 years with the stage show,

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.920
and getting pretty
good at it, it

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.270
turns out that all
the rules changed once

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.480
we launched "Scam School."

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.630
We launched "Scam
School" back in 2008.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.620
And I thought, at the
time, that "Scam School"

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.450
would be a good first practice
round before I got a real TV

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:41.810
show, whatever that means.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:46.290
I thought that a simple show
about bar tricks and scams

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.530
would be popular enough.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.420
And this will fold, like all
startups are going to fold,

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.470
and who cares?

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.960
And it turns out that here we
are seven, eight years later

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.210
And one and a quarter
million subscribers.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.760
Specifically, when "Scam School"
launched, for the first time

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.780
I got a new kind of heckler.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.690
I encountered the troll.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.841
This was, by the way,
all of the comments

00:11:07.841 --> 00:11:10.090
I grabbed-- I don't know if
you can read any of these,

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.420
but I grabbed all of
these this morning.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.260
And they're all taking a dump
on my hairstyle at the time.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.010
Whatever.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.870
All of a sudden I
realized the rules

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.680
that worked in a live
stage performance

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.740
don't work for trolls.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.500
You can't shine a
spotlight on them

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.680
because that's all
they want in the world.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.010
You can't turn the
audience against them

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.590
because they don't care
what everyone else says.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.680
They are doing it
for the sheer joy of,

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.610
in their mind speaking
truth to power, or whatever.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.820
And I went through a number of
phases in dealing with trolls.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.880
There was times I was
defensive, I was argumentative.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.210
For a good year my
reply to everyone

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:54.340
was just to respond with
a link to the Big Lebowski

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.180
with The Dude
saying, "Yeah, well,

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.250
that's just your opinion, man."

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.000
But ultimately, I found
myself in the position

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.210
that nowadays, when I respond,
if there's a pat answer,

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:12.290
it's with an emoticon,
an Emoji saying, "Hugs.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.030
Come on over.

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.080
Hey, check this out.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.080
You'll find out I'm an OK guy."

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.730
And that seems to be the
most successful thing.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.110
Specifically, and
again, I don't know why,

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:24.250
but it seems like taking
that Dennis Rogers'

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:30.140
approach of respecting the
troll somehow pivots them.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.359
It flips them over.

00:12:31.359 --> 00:12:32.900
And I think about
it in terms-- there

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.310
was a speaker in
the college market,

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.300
and I wish I could
remember his name.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.640
But he told me Bruce
Lee never, ever

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.320
tried to match force with force.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.430
When a punch was coming,
he never grabbed it.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.610
He would always divert
it off to the side.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.470
And that's what you
get with trolls.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:51.240
You don't worry about
when the wind is blowing

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.060
the wrong direction,
if you're trying

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.720
to get across the Atlantic.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.340
You worry when there is no wind.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.860
And the same energy that makes
trolls passionate to just

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:06.000
scream, "I hate your hair!"
is the exact same thing that

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.020
by being recognised and
listen to it can be pivoted

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.600
into making them one
of your biggest fans.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.170
And that is exactly what
happened with Dennis Rogers

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.610
and those fraternity boys.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.290
And specifically-- so
one of the things that

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.334
happened when I started
street performing is--

00:13:23.334 --> 00:13:24.750
the whole reason
I got started was

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.840
because I knew that I
did not have the ability,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.960
I did not have the experience
to be clever on the fly,

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.290
to wrap people in,
to build a crowd,

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:35.830
to establish a connection.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.590
And so I needed a safe place
to be bad for me to be good.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.130
And the street was
perfect for that.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.090
I realized that when
"Scam School" launched,

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.120
I didn't have the tools.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.450
I don't know how to deal
with this new type of trolls.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:50.837
And I wanted a passionate
fun-run community.

00:13:50.837 --> 00:13:53.420
And there was no way I was going
to get that five minutes once

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.730
a week in a one
way conversation.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.992
So I turned on a
web camera, and I

00:13:57.992 --> 00:13:59.450
did something I
called the "BB Live

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:00.890
Show," for Brian Brushwood.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.780
B.B. That's my initials.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.720
And it was genuinely awful.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.020
I go back, and I look at
it now, and it's miserable.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:08.630
It's awkward.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.600
I cringe.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.522
I'm fidgety.

00:14:11.522 --> 00:14:12.730
I don't have anything to say.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.100
It goes nowhere.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.320
And yet it was a
safe place to be bad.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.870
Because I could be bad
for 80 people at a time.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.620
That's the great thing
about the internet.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.820
One of two things happens.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.890
If you're spectacularly bad,
and you get famous for it,

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.030
in which case, win.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.960
Or you're boring, in
which case nobody watches.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.002
In which case, win.

00:14:30.002 --> 00:14:31.460
Because you've got
that experience.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.330
You've got that training.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.660
Nowadays, that
community has become

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.785
this fully self-sustained
community at diamondclub.tv.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.090
We've got five different
channels that are running.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.540
People are providing their
own gameplay content.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.710
There is a living chat room
that's alive at all times.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:53.390
And all of this began because
I found a safe place to be bad.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.330
So whatever your
artistic endeavor,

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.349
I would say find a safe place
to be bad so you can be good.

00:14:59.349 --> 00:15:01.640
But also realize that you're
going to have difficulties

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.240
along the way.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.560
And in this case, my biggest
difficulty, my biggest,

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:10.210
loudest heckler, the most
miserable day of my life

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.519
was on, I believe,
March 2, 2013.

00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:15.810
How many of you guys are
familiar with the online forum

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:16.512
4chan?

00:15:16.512 --> 00:15:17.220
Hands in the air?

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.160
OK They have a bit of a
reputation, those guys.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:29.280
One day 4chan says, hey,
let's roll some dice

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.730
and whoever they
roll up on, let's all

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:35.700
rush that person's
YouTube channel

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.230
and accuse that person
of being a pedophile.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.560
Which, I'm not going to
lie, it's kind of brilliant.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.622
Because it's, literally,
it's the perfect box.

00:15:44.622 --> 00:15:46.580
You rush in, and you call
somebody a pedophile,

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.704
what are they going to say?

00:15:47.704 --> 00:15:49.900
No, I love children!

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.400
I have children!

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.350
Why would you say that?

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.550
One of the many sayings
associated with 4chan

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.020
is that they do stuff
for the lulz, meaning,

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.110
it's not personal.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.250
We don't actually hate you.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:02.190
We could care less.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.050
We just want to get a
chuckle out of this.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.240
So we'll ruin your life.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.235
And so, sure enough,
that day-- luckily, they

00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:11.860
had grabbed screen shots of it.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.986
But apparently they
were like, hey,

00:16:13.986 --> 00:16:16.360
whose life should we ruin with
accusations of pedophilia?

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.600
Somebody was like, how
about Justin Bieber?

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.930
Well, let's roll the dice.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:21.640
No, it's not going
to be Justin Bieber.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.260
What about this guy?

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.660
He does science
demos on YouTube.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.810
Well, let's roll the dice.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:25.730
No, it won't be him.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.730
And then somebody was
like, what about this guy?

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.310
He does magic on the internet.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:33.230
[SOUND EFFECT] We have a winner!

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:39.840
And I got a-- yeah, we'll do
this-- I got a tweet saying,

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.210
heads up, 4chan raid incoming.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.600
And I went and checked
out our most recent video,

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.010
and there was a bit of
a traffic spike on it.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.882
And all of it being nothing but
everything you would imagine.

00:16:50.882 --> 00:16:52.340
Like, oh my gosh,
you can't believe

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.670
what this guy did to that girl.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:54.545
I can't believe this.

00:16:54.545 --> 00:16:56.290
Oh, I used to respect this guy!

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:57.910
I hope he rots in hell!

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:01.420
And you could see that it
was very clearly coordinated,

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.140
and it was rolling outward.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.230
Because first it was
just the one video.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.680
Then it was the next
video next door.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.000
Then it was my Wikipedia
page getting vandalized.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.050
And luckily, I happen to be
in the middle of a recording

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.770
session with my co-host,
Justin Robert Young.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.380
We were recording
a comedy album.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.169
And I was like, what do you do?

00:17:21.169 --> 00:17:22.210
This is the perfect play.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:23.400
This is the perfect troll.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.130
There is no response.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.920
And Justin nailed it.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.860
He says, you have to take
the wind out of their sails.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.130
Understand they
hold all the power.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.540
You hold none of it.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.170
The only thing you can
do is make it not fun

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:40.860
for them to continue
going forward.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.560
And so we poked
around a little bit.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.980
We knew that, what does
the internet respond to?

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.080
They respond to effort.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.180
They respond to honesty.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.510
They responded directness.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:51.770
They respond to respect.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.957
And what we ended up
doing-- I hope I'm still

00:17:53.957 --> 00:17:55.040
connected to the internet.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.390
I was going to-- let me see
if I can throw this on here.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.590
You guys can not
see that apparently.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:03.700
There we go.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.520
So, this is an
advertisement that I'm going

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.970
to talk over the entire time.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.750
You know what, we did not think
about audio side of things.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.250
I'm going to turn this up, and
hopefully you can pick it up.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.970
And actually, what I'll do is
I'll set this down over here.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.960
So here's what we ended
up putting together.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.670
It was something that
was out of nowhere

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:29.460
with virtually no
preparation, and I

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.700
wanted to show respect
and make it not fun.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.730
So this is what we did.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:39.630
And I will click refresh,
and we will watch another ad.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.750
Oh, oh, oh oh!

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.440
And let me back this up.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.312
I don't know if we
can-- do we have audio?

00:18:50.312 --> 00:18:51.020
Or you know what?

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:51.890
I'll just lay this.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:53.130
How about that.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.755
There we go.

00:18:54.755 --> 00:18:56.150
Boom.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.010
And.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.756
Look at me.

00:18:59.422 --> 00:19:00.940
-Oh, hello internet.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.790
Today is a momentous occasion
because after five years

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:07.000
and nearly 300 episodes of
"Scam School" we finally gotten

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.910
big enough to attract
the attention of 4chan!

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.230
That's right 4chan!

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.860
That loveable group of
rapscallions who stir up

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.000
trouble on the internet.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.660
And today I was the lucky
lottery winner of a honest

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.110
to goodness /b pedo-bomb, that's
where everyone gets together--

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.860
Give me my reward.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.429
I won it fair and square.

00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:23.970
There you go.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:24.810
Boom.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.595
That's a /b champion,
right there.

00:19:26.595 --> 00:19:28.970
So they come in, and then
everyone calls you a pedophile.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.386
But here's the important thing,
and I mean this sincerely,

00:19:31.386 --> 00:19:33.690
thank you, because we need
to views very, very badly.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:34.440
Big, big fan.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.370
The views, great.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.090
Pedophiles comments
not so great.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.230
But the views I'm OK with.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.020
I want to thank 4chan
for considering me.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.337
I want to chat realm for marking
all those comments as spam.

00:19:45.337 --> 00:19:46.670
Feel free to keep on doing that.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:49.310
But most importantly, and
I mean this to you, 4chan,

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.780
I need to know, sincerely.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.380
Like, were you able to figure
out the puzzle challenge?

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.580
Because I thought
it was pretty good.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.750
Like the first one
was pretty easy.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:57.791
It was in "The Simpsons."

00:19:57.791 --> 00:19:59.579
But the second one,
I thought that one

00:19:59.579 --> 00:20:00.870
would have gotten you for sure.

00:20:03.972 --> 00:20:04.555
Oh, subscribe.

00:20:04.555 --> 00:20:05.150

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:07.970
BRIAN BUSHWOOD: All
right so, I don't

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:12.000
know if you could see the
doe-eyed terror in my face.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.840
But that was definitely
absolutely terrifying.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.960
Here's what I did not expect
to have come out of that.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.600
The main things I
wanted to do were

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.020
to let our fans know that there
was a thing happening, to tell

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.600
the truth about what
it is, but most of all

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.980
to love, honestly
love and show respect,

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.110
for the people as
they're shouting

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.394
these horrible things at me.

00:20:34.394 --> 00:20:35.310
And it seemed to work.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.030
And again, that's not
an invitation for anyone

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.860
to start another one of these.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:44.890
But I guess that's all
I really wanted to say.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.629
So let's pull
everything out and see

00:20:47.629 --> 00:20:48.920
if you guys have any questions.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.350
I know we're about,
what, 30 minutes in here?

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.950
Yeah.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.600
You guys, let's open everything
up for Q&amp;A. Love your trolls,

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.657
is all I'm trying to say.

00:20:57.657 --> 00:20:58.490
Who's got questions?

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.200
AUDIENCE: So this is
what you do full time?

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.575
BRIAN BUSHWOOD: Yeah, well,
I mean that's the funny part.

00:21:07.575 --> 00:21:08.920
What is full time?

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.700
You know, is it the
stage performing?

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:14.270
At some point touring, doing
a 150 college shows a year

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.340
became a day job for me.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.620
And doing internet
stuff in the evening

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:23.360
became the side project for fun.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.590
And then all of a sudden,
you pick up a TV show,

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.850
and all of the sudden that
becomes your new day job.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.340
But I guess the
short answer is yes.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.750
AUDIENCE: So how many YouTube
videos per week or per month

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:37.302
do you have to
create in order to--?

00:21:37.302 --> 00:21:38.760
BRIAN BUSHWOOD:
Keep the lights on?

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.945
BRIAN BUSHWOOD: Yeah.

00:21:39.945 --> 00:21:40.920
Well, it depends.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.628
The nice thing about
YouTube is that it's

00:21:42.628 --> 00:21:46.160
a platform that allows
you to very, very cheaply

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.440
create content.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.830
And if you're splitting
the paycheck one way,

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:51.670
there's not a whole lot
that you need to do.

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.280
You just press record,
and you talk into mic.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.190
"Scam School" is fairly
elaborately produced.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.230
So we need a sound guy.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.650
We need a couple of editors.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:01.450
Shooters.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:03.530
So it becomes more expensive.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.280
Right now we've settled
in with "Scam School"

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.370
being regular
content once a week,

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.020
and we have two spin off
shows behind the Scam

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.660
and "Scam School" remix
that along with partnerships

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:19.160
for promotions, we're able to
get enough to keep like a three

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.460
man team sustained.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.669
Where it's worth it to
invest the time to do it.

00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:25.460
I don't know if that
answers your question.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.100
But we're finally
to a point where

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.474
the pie is big
enough that we can

00:22:28.474 --> 00:22:30.600
support three people full time.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.980
And that ended up being
three videos per week,

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:38.130
and we're hoping to expand
even more from there.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.810
Any other questions?

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:45.360
AUDIENCE: How about what--
are there any new platforms,

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:51.580
after YouTube Launch, that you
think are good places to be bad

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.150
so that you can become good?

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:54.025
BRIAN BUSHWOOD: Yeah.

00:22:54.025 --> 00:22:57.020
Nowadays, I would say Periscope
is a fantastic-- or Meerkat.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.740
Basically, in many ways,
what we're seeing right now

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.570
is a reboot of what we saw
in the live stream space

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.930
exactly six years ago.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.140
It used to be that
Ustream and Justin.tv were

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:09.980
the big, easy ways to jump in.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.520
And nowadays, that's
kind of come full circle,

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.160
and nowadays you have
it on your phone.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.260
And so it's amazing
what happens-- like,

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.885
right now, I'm
looking at you guys.

00:23:18.885 --> 00:23:19.760
You're looking at me.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.980
This is a very real moment.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.630
I'm 100% dialed in and present.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.410
It's amazing what
happens when you

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.460
watch that viewer count
rise up in front of you

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.942
because you can
picture the room.

00:23:29.942 --> 00:23:31.400
And it's like, I
know what it looks

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.770
like to perform for 30 to 40
people at a time in a room.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:38.020
And when whenever I see
currently watching 30 to 40,

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.810
I picture exactly that room.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:43.160
And I picture trying to hold
everybody's interest exactly

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.880
that hard.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.900
Puts you in a totally
different head space.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.560
So I would say, definitely,
a safe place to be bad.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.390
Especially because
Meerkat, Periscope only

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.270
gets saved if you
want to be saved.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.990
And that's a precious and
rare commodity nowadays.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.950
Yeah.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.940
AUDIENCE: After the four
and half page response

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.040
from Teller, did you
ever have an opportunity

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.259
to get into another
conversation with him?

00:24:03.259 --> 00:24:04.425
Like what was that response?

00:24:04.425 --> 00:24:05.300
BRIAN BUSHWOOD: Yeah.

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.350
As a matter of fact, was
astonishing because, like I

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.360
said, just writing the
letter meant a lot to me.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.610
But instead, you get this
extraordinary journey

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:18.000
about how-- one of
the things he says

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.194
in there is at the heart of
all great magic is surprise.

00:24:21.194 --> 00:24:22.860
And the way he phrased
it was beautiful.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.990
He said, put two and
two in front of me,

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:28.500
convince me it's five, then
reveal the truth, four,

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.490
and blow me away.

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:33.500
It ended up kicking
off a correspondence.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.470
Every time I had a new routine,
I would record VHS tapes,

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.314
back in the day,
and mail them over.

00:24:38.314 --> 00:24:40.980
And I was always astonished that
he took the time to watch them,

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.110
and he gave
thoughtful responses.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:47.830
As a matter of fact, I recently
was on Penn and Teller's show,

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.960
"Fool Us" and a bunch of
people were a little bit

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.610
dis-- I would say, some
fans were disappointed

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:58.940
because they wanted me to try
harder to fool Penn and Teller.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:02.130
And what I couldn't
really say to most of them

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:05.570
was that-- Fool Us
Brian Brushwood.

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:06.070
Here we go.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.750
What I couldn't
say is that I don't

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:13.590
think there's a single
stage act in my entire show

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:16.350
that Teller hasn't had a
personal hand in helping

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:17.160
me write.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.820
Whether it's giving
feedback or giving

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:25.700
an interpretation or an
unusual theatrical spin on.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.814
So it occurred to
me that if I was not

00:25:27.814 --> 00:25:30.230
going to fool Penn and Teller--
because you can't fool dad

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:33.450
when he taught you everything
you know-- what I was going

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.780
to do was play to the audience
and instead figure out

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:41.200
how to find moments of-- to step
outside the rules for any given

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:41.720
performance.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.670
So in this case, what I did
was we took a bill from the guy

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:45.420
from the audience.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.179
We chopped it up.

00:25:47.179 --> 00:25:48.720
And again, this is
not rocket science

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.910
from a magic perspective.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.780
But what I love
about this routine

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:56.360
is that I actually make an
individual from the audience

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.550
eat the burnt ashes of his
own selected signed bill.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:01.830
And there is no trick.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:05.234
It is all designed to take
advantage of social pressure.

00:26:05.234 --> 00:26:06.900
The first thing I say
is, I need someone

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.240
from the audience who's willing
to do absolutely anything.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.830
And whoever stands up and goes,
whoop, then it's like you,

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:14.810
get on up here.

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:17.050
And then, we have
him select the bill.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:18.350
We burn it up.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.870
And then I chop
it up and I mix it

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.950
with his choice, either
applesauce or pudding.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.020
So he now has a
small investment.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.980
And as I'm mixing,
there's this great moment

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.460
that I say, hey, do me a favor.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.090
Just taste it.

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:28.700
Just taste it.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.658
Again, I'm not asking
him to do anything crazy.

00:26:30.658 --> 00:26:31.790
I say, just taste this.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.150
So now he's tasted
it, and he's on stage

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:36.970
and all of a sudden, that's
when it's like checkmate.

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:38.840
Then I'm like, do me a favor.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:39.870
Just polish this off.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:41.780
Something amazing
is going to happen.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.800
The faster you eat, the
louder they're going to clap.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.630
Watch.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.960
And then all of a sudden,
the audience is cheering,

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.270
and he realizes that there's
no getting out of this.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:51.410
And he actually does it.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:54.520
And then we go on
to pull them apart.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.520
But again, the
whole reason that I

00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.490
wanted to do this particular
routine was not to fool.

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:04.380
People think that the power
in magic is in the mystery

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:09.850
or in the gap of me knowing
how it's done and you not.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:12.350
That could not be farther
from the truth, in my opinion.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:15.590
There is no mystery when
we watch a concert pianist.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:17.300
We know exactly
what's happening.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:21.920
They press the key a hammer
strikes a wire that's

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.270
tuned to a frequency.

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.900
And he just does all of it in
an exquisitely beautiful, heart

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.180
wrenching, tear
inducing symphony.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.410
Right?

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:32.790
Magic is the same thing.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:36.290
If anybody loved magic
as much as I love magic,

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:38.580
and they knew just
as much as I did,

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.340
then all that
means is that magic

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.850
would become the number
one art on the planet

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:46.120
and the most popular
thing for everyone to do.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.810
I think I may have
talked a little bit

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.050
around your question.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:51.500
But I hope I got--
the answer is yes.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.682
Teller and I have had
an exquisite journey

00:27:54.682 --> 00:27:55.390
over these years.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:56.931
This correspondence
has been amazing,

00:27:56.931 --> 00:28:00.580
and I hope to get to
share more of that stuff.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.210
Any other questions?

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.470
AUDIENCE: I'll do
one on "Scam School."

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:10.410
Which episode would you say was
the one you're most proud of?

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:13.010
And which one would you say
was the most fun to make?

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:14.580
Maybe that's the same one.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.020
BRIAN BUSHWOOD: No, they're
definitely not the same one.

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.750
In fact, the one I'm most
proud of was in every way

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:22.710
the most miserable one to make.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.530
But I'm most proud
of it because it

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:27.590
got performed on the
International Space Station

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:30.430
by video game legend
Richard Garriott, a.k.a.

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.360
Lord British.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.920
Turns out Richard Garriott
lives here in Austin.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.590
As a kid, I was a tremendous
fan of his Ultima series.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.340
You know, "Ultima III:
Exodus," playing it

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.990
when I was in third grade.

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:44.960
And I had an idea
for a magic routine

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:49.270
that you could use YouTube
as a method for the trick.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:54.650
So what we did was we recorded
104 different versions

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:57.710
of a fake interview on YouTube.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.110
And you guys can
still look this up.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:02.430
In fact, we should probably
do a re-mix episode on it.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.410
But what happens is you
say to someone like,

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:08.150
hey, I don't know if you
believe in mind control,

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.731
not like this crazy
like voodoo stuff.

00:29:10.731 --> 00:29:11.980
In fact, we'll do it with you.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.229
What's your name?

00:29:13.229 --> 00:29:13.770
Suzie, Suzie.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:14.810
OK.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:17.160
I don't believe in ESP or
mind-reading and stuff,

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.100
but I do believe
that there's ways

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.442
to kind of psychologically nudge
people in the right direction.

00:29:22.442 --> 00:29:23.650
And I was watching this show.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.150
There was this interview.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:28.840
There is this crazy
life coach doctor expert

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.790
who said that he
could cause someone

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:35.030
to think of a playing
card by reciting

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:36.980
a couple of lines of poetry.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:39.070
Let me give this a try.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:42.360
The poetry was, "The woods
are lovely, dark, and deep,

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:48.370
but I have promises to keep and
miles to go before I sleep."

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:52.620
What playing card are you
thinking of right now?

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.471
AUDIENCE: Eight of clubs.

00:29:54.471 --> 00:29:55.470
BRIAN BUSHWOOD: Shut up.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:58.300
Did you see the interview?

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.350
Pinky promise?

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:03.010
OK, because that's
exactly what the guy says!

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:04.310
Here, I don't want to touch it.

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.920
I don't want to do it.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.490
Walk over that computer-- you
don't have to actually do it.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:12.860
This guy's name was--
he was a life coach.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:17.080
If you search for Coach
Charles Doubleday.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:22.889
Here, so you search you go
Coach Charles Doubleday.

00:30:22.889 --> 00:30:24.930
And let's see if we can
find the-- oh good, yeah,

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.010
no here he is.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:26.510
Here.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:27.010
Look.

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:29.584
This is the exact interview
I was talking about.

00:30:29.584 --> 00:30:30.250
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:46.242
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:46.242 --> 00:30:47.450
-Welcome back to Scam School.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:49.840
We are here at the Nomad
Bar in Austin, Texas.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.910
And today we are talking
to Coach Charles Doubleday.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:54.847
Now before I went to
break, you said something

00:30:54.847 --> 00:30:55.930
that kind of blew my mind.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:58.080
It sounded like you were
describing like-- I mean,

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.910
it sound like mind control.

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:01.530
-Actually it is.

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:03.280
Our studies of
neurolinguistic programming

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.480
have discovered deep
structures in the human brain

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.710
that can be accessed
with linguistic triggers.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:11.970
We can actually put a
thought into someone's mind.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.810
-Like against their will, yeah?

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.290
Do you any examples?

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:18.260
-We would read a
poem by Robert Frost.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.040
"The woods are lovely,
dark, and deep,

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.030
and I have promises to keep and
miles to go before I sleep."

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:25.210
Then we would have
them think of a card,

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:28.532
and every time they would
think of the eight of clubs.

00:31:28.532 --> 00:31:29.365
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:29.365 --> 00:31:32.920
BRIAN BUSHWOOD: [LAUGHING] So,
one of the beautiful things

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.280
was it turns out that Richard
Garriott was a fan of the show,

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.080
and he found himself in a
quarantine in I want to say,

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.620
Baikonur, Kazahstan.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:47.530
And he decided like, wow, this
would be the perfect thing

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:50.899
to do from a very
remote connection,

00:31:50.899 --> 00:31:52.440
from the International
Space Station,

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.480
and he performed it on his dad.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.670
And we have that on there.

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:57.540
Unfortunately, because it
was such a pain in the ass

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.465
to edit together 104 versions
because we wanted to make sure

00:32:00.465 --> 00:32:02.340
there was a long version
and a short version.

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:05.940
We also had to open up
52 different accounts

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.046
for all of the variations
of the expert's name.

00:32:09.046 --> 00:32:11.670
But the beautiful thing is that
it's a gift that just lives out

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:13.140
there, all on its own.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.530
So the answer to your
question is the one

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:20.690
I'm most proud of was not at all
the most fun to do, in any way.

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:22.410
Any other questions?

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:25.679
I know that we're a
little bit tight today.

00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:26.980
Dude.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.870
Well, if that's it.

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.620
ANDY: Well, thanks,
Brian, for coming out.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.571
We really appreciate it.

00:32:32.571 --> 00:32:34.320
Yeah, it was great
hearing from you today.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:34.920
BRIAN BUSHWOOD:
You got it, Andy.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.753
Thanks so much guys.

00:32:35.753 --> 00:32:37.540
Appreciate it.
