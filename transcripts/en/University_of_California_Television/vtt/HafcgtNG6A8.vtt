00:00:05.473 --> 00:00:08.723
(gentle chamber music)

00:00:09.653 --> 00:00:12.555
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape,

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:16.222
bipedal, naked, large
brain, long the master

00:00:18.558 --> 00:00:20.975
of fire, tools, and language,

00:00:21.826 --> 00:00:26.043
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.043 --> 00:00:29.401
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:31.484
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:34.216
We grow up slowly.

00:00:35.062 --> 00:00:37.670
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.753
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:42.355
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:45.105
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.536 --> 00:00:48.596
Carta brings together experts

00:00:48.596 --> 00:00:51.922
from diverse disciplines
to exchange insights

00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:54.839
on who we are, and how we got here.

00:00:56.445 --> 00:00:58.165
An exploration made possible

00:00:58.165 --> 00:01:01.248
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:23.994 --> 00:01:26.911
(electronic music)

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:47.728
- Well, as you've heard, Carta
is a remarkable institution.

00:01:47.728 --> 00:01:49.553
It's professed goal is to explore

00:01:49.553 --> 00:01:53.606
and explain the origins
of the human phenomenon.

00:01:53.606 --> 00:01:55.497
Now, over the years, this has meant

00:01:55.497 --> 00:01:58.624
looking at human evolution
from many points of view.

00:01:58.624 --> 00:02:00.503
Previous symposia have explored the role

00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:04.503
of language, bipedalism,
domestication, disease,

00:02:05.693 --> 00:02:08.053
but I think today's meeting is the first

00:02:08.053 --> 00:02:12.740
to be concerned with the role
in human evolution of an idea.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.689
The idea is a dreadfully simple one.

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.399
It's that each one of us is going to die,

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:21.701
and when we're dead, we're dead.

00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:24.451
(crowd laughing)

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.865
Like this parrot in the
famous Monty Python sketch,

00:02:29.865 --> 00:02:32.032
we humans will be no more.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.574
We cease to be.

00:02:34.574 --> 00:02:37.716
We've run down the curtain,
and joined the choir invisible.

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:39.633
We are ex-human beings.

00:02:41.073 --> 00:02:42.822
Well, we can laugh at the parrot,

00:02:42.822 --> 00:02:44.507
but of course, it's no laughing matter

00:02:44.507 --> 00:02:47.235
when it comes to human death.

00:02:47.235 --> 00:02:49.658
The German photographer, Walter Schels,

00:02:49.658 --> 00:02:51.349
who's taken photos of people

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.566
in the terminal stages of illness,

00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:58.275
shortly before they died,
and then a day later.

00:02:58.275 --> 00:03:00.931
On the left, is a living human being.

00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:03.653
On the right, an ex-human.

00:03:03.653 --> 00:03:06.422
The living humans understood all too well

00:03:06.422 --> 00:03:08.008
what was soon to happen.

00:03:08.008 --> 00:03:11.479
Some were sad, some were
angry, some were at peace,

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.455
some believed, with Peter Pan, that to die

00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:17.812
would be an awfully big adventure,

00:03:17.812 --> 00:03:20.921
but all understood that as persons,

00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:24.442
they were soon to be annihilated.

00:03:24.442 --> 00:03:27.905
So, when did the idea
of personal mortality

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:31.504
first become current among our ancestors,

00:03:31.504 --> 00:03:33.025
and what were the consequences

00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:36.169
for human's evolutionary trajectory?

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.341
Is it true, as it's been claimed,

00:03:38.341 --> 00:03:41.586
that once humans became
aware of their own mortality

00:03:41.586 --> 00:03:43.523
everything changed?

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:46.082
Is it true that the idea of death

00:03:46.082 --> 00:03:49.675
became the well-spring of human activity?

00:03:49.675 --> 00:03:50.845
Well, we'll shortly be hearing

00:03:50.845 --> 00:03:52.332
from our distinguished speakers

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:54.700
about the psychological, practical,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.906
even magical, techniques
that humans have devised

00:03:57.906 --> 00:04:02.073
to deny that death is indeed
the final destiny of man.

00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:05.032
But, this is an evolutionary symposium,

00:04:05.032 --> 00:04:07.054
so we're going to start with questions

00:04:07.054 --> 00:04:09.964
about the development of death awareness,

00:04:09.964 --> 00:04:12.780
how it evolved in the
history of our species,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.875
and how it still evolves in each one of us

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:17.625
as individuals today.

00:04:18.568 --> 00:04:22.400
Voltaire wrote in his
philosophical dictionary,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.096
"The human race is the only one that knows

00:04:25.096 --> 00:04:27.277
that it must die, and it knows this

00:04:27.277 --> 00:04:29.296
only through its experience.

00:04:29.296 --> 00:04:31.520
A child brought up alone and transported

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.860
to a desert island would
have no more idea of death

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.777
than a cat or a plant."

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:41.280
Well, he's making two
important claims here.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.190
First, that humans alone among animals

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.564
do understand about death.

00:04:46.564 --> 00:04:50.311
And second, that this
understanding is not innate.

00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:53.829
Each of us has to acquire
it by watching and listening

00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:55.996
to what goes on around us.

00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:01.982
Little Elmira here was just 17 months-old.

00:05:01.982 --> 00:05:03.603
It seems safe to assume that she

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:06.353
didn't know she was about to die.

00:05:08.052 --> 00:05:09.693
But, what about Janique?

00:05:09.693 --> 00:05:11.443
He was six years-old.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.479
Paul Harris, the leading
developmental psychologist

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.961
from Harvard, will be
telling us about research

00:05:17.961 --> 00:05:21.037
on just when, and how, children do in fact

00:05:21.037 --> 00:05:23.440
find out about death, and what kind

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.101
of interpretations they put on it.

00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:28.297
How much do children
work out for themselves?

00:05:28.297 --> 00:05:31.911
How much do they rely
on what they're taught?

00:05:31.911 --> 00:05:35.499
And later, Rita Astuti, a
brilliant social anthropologist

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:39.246
will discuss the influence of
the local culture of belief,

00:05:39.246 --> 00:05:43.201
how children can be taught to
turn the facts on their head,

00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:47.679
and to see death not as
an end, but a beginning.

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:50.639
But, do we really have
to be taught about death?

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.600
Could someone, man or animal,
learn the biological facts

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.479
about death, and their own
mortality just by looking?

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.363
That's to say, by observing others die,

00:06:01.363 --> 00:06:04.014
by recognizing their own likeness in them,

00:06:04.014 --> 00:06:07.468
and then simply putting
two and two together.

00:06:07.468 --> 00:06:09.667
Well, if this kind of
learning is possible,

00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:12.986
why should it be
restricted to human beings?

00:06:12.986 --> 00:06:15.647
The answer is that it may not be.

00:06:15.647 --> 00:06:17.086
We'll hear from Dora Biro,

00:06:17.086 --> 00:06:19.887
Royal Society Research Fellow at Oxford,

00:06:19.887 --> 00:06:23.180
about evidence for some
sort of death awareness

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.014
in chimpanzees.

00:06:25.014 --> 00:06:26.515
And then Jack Marzluff,

00:06:26.515 --> 00:06:30.282
Professor of Wildlife Science
at Washington University,

00:06:30.282 --> 00:06:32.575
will tell us about how crows, too,

00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:35.153
try to puzzle out the meaning of the death

00:06:35.153 --> 00:06:36.986
of their conspecifics.

00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:40.055
Now, no one has yet tried teaching

00:06:40.055 --> 00:06:42.626
the meaning of death to a chimpanzee,

00:06:42.626 --> 00:06:44.142
but back in the days when scientists

00:06:44.142 --> 00:06:46.971
rated the linguistic abilities of chimps

00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:49.503
rather more highly than most of us do now,

00:06:49.503 --> 00:06:53.813
David Premack did discuss the possibility.

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:57.044
He wrote, "Can I tell
the ape that it will die?

00:06:57.044 --> 00:06:59.556
If we succeeded in
communicating this information

00:06:59.556 --> 00:07:03.521
to even one animal, saw
its hair stand on end,

00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:06.456
heard it moan, we would know we'd provided

00:07:06.456 --> 00:07:09.289
the necessary conceptual elements.

00:07:10.323 --> 00:07:14.473
But, what if, like man,
the ape dreads death

00:07:14.473 --> 00:07:15.798
and will deal with this knowledge

00:07:15.798 --> 00:07:18.494
as bizarrely as we have
- with the invention

00:07:18.494 --> 00:07:20.860
of ritual, myth, and religion?

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.280
Until I can suggest concrete steps

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.638
in teaching the concept
of death without fear,

00:07:26.638 --> 00:07:28.948
I have no intention of
imparting the knowledge

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:31.542
of mortality to an ape."

00:07:31.542 --> 00:07:34.002
Well, Premack was getting
ahead of the facts here,

00:07:34.002 --> 00:07:35.693
as he often did.

00:07:35.693 --> 00:07:39.219
Still, this passage does
raise interesting questions,

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:40.969
or rather, begs them.

00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:43.236
First, Premack assumes that humans

00:07:43.236 --> 00:07:46.903
do in fact fear death
in a hair-raising way.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.283
And, second, he assumes that
ritual, myth, and religion

00:07:51.283 --> 00:07:54.963
have enabled human beings
to conquer that fear.

00:07:54.963 --> 00:07:56.659
Well, we have the world's expert

00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:59.864
on the psychology and
neuroscience of fear, Joe LeDoux,

00:07:59.864 --> 00:08:01.933
to discuss what kind of fear

00:08:01.933 --> 00:08:06.834
fear of death actually
is, if it's a fear at all.

00:08:06.834 --> 00:08:08.714
But whether it's a fear, or more properly,

00:08:08.714 --> 00:08:10.776
an anxiety, there's no question

00:08:10.776 --> 00:08:14.619
that it leaves its mark on
us, and long has done so.

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:17.665
We're privileged to have Lord
Colin Renfrew from Cambridge

00:08:17.665 --> 00:08:19.642
to review the archeological evidence

00:08:19.642 --> 00:08:22.816
for when death-defying
practices first arose

00:08:22.816 --> 00:08:24.233
in human history.

00:08:25.072 --> 00:08:27.090
So, here's the big question,

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.673
how have such bizarre practices

00:08:33.702 --> 00:08:38.197
actually been essential to
the survival of our species?

00:08:38.197 --> 00:08:40.771
Without them, would
death-aware human beings

00:08:40.771 --> 00:08:43.271
have become paralyzed by fear?

00:08:44.128 --> 00:08:45.920
Sheldon Solomon, one of the architects

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.825
of Terror Management
Theory will tell us, "Yes."

00:08:49.825 --> 00:08:52.729
But, the Co-Director of Carta, Ajit Varki,

00:08:52.729 --> 00:08:54.981
has his own ideas about this.

00:08:54.981 --> 00:08:58.360
Ajit thinks that what saved our species

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.354
was not so much the invention
of cultural defenses,

00:09:01.354 --> 00:09:04.730
as an evolutionary change
in the human brain.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.897
Mind over reality, denial.

00:09:07.894 --> 00:09:09.029
And then finally, my own role

00:09:09.029 --> 00:09:10.847
in the afternoon's proceedings,

00:09:10.847 --> 00:09:13.761
will be to discuss the
unexpected phenomenon

00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:15.178
of human suicide.

00:09:16.207 --> 00:09:18.354
So, we have a rich afternoon ahead of us

00:09:18.354 --> 00:09:20.345
of science, and philosophy,

00:09:20.345 --> 00:09:24.571
and despite the dark material,
I hope you'll find it fun.

00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:26.821
(applause)

00:09:28.003 --> 00:09:31.003
(electronic music)
