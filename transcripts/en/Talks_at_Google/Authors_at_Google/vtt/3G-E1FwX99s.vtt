[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.676 --> 00:00:07.095
BEN MALCOLMSON: Thank you.

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:08.750
Thanks, Phil.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.250
Thank you all so much
for being here today.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.530
I know this is precious
time for everyone.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.430
So I really cherish this
opportunity to be with you all.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.760
I'm excited to share a
story with you guys today

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.927
that's hopefully going to
inspire you, and encourage

00:00:21.927 --> 00:00:25.040
you, and really leave
you in awe that you

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.600
do have an amazing purpose
wherever you're at,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.398
that you have an incredible
purpose right where you're at.

00:00:30.398 --> 00:00:31.940
And so I'm going to
share this story.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.125
And there's something
unique about a story.

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:36.500
When someone says that there's
a story out there for you,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.500
it kind of resonates with
you in a different way

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.912
than when you hear truth,
or facts, or a date,

00:00:40.912 --> 00:00:41.870
or something like that.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.810
When you hear a story,
stories stick with you

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.353
in a very unique way.

00:00:46.353 --> 00:00:48.770
And so this story, I hope,
will kind of echo in your heart

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.240
as you leave from here today.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.130
And make you think
and really consider

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.860
that you truly do have
an incredible purpose

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.845
right where you're at.

00:00:55.845 --> 00:00:57.470
I'm going to take
you back a few years.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.600
I was a student at USC,
University of Southern

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.640
California down in Los Angeles.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.140
Don't worry, my parents
didn't help me get in.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.390
My parents aren't celebrities.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.750
So I think I got
in on my own merit.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.180
But I was a student there
just trying to find my way

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.570
and trying to figure out what
I was going to do in my career

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.880
after I graduated, and I
stumbled into journalism.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.500
I wanted to be a sportswriter
and write about sports.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.952
I had loved watching
ESPN as a kid

00:01:21.952 --> 00:01:24.410
and reading the sports section
of the newspaper and "Sports

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.952
Illustrated."

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:27.350
So I figured, why don't I
go be a sports reporter?

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.240
Kind of combine my
passions and do something

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.960
I'm really excited about.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.290
So my first assignment in
being a journalism major

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.173
was to write for the school
newspaper, "The Daily Trojan."

00:01:36.173 --> 00:01:37.590
And so I go to
"The Daily Trojan",

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.590
and they assigned me to
cover women's volleyball

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.688
my first assignment.

00:01:40.688 --> 00:01:42.980
I had never seen a women's
volleyball match in my life,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.810
so here I am on Wikipedia trying
to learn the scoring system.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.300
And I mean, I was struggling.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.207
I was really fighting to keep
my head above water here.

00:01:50.207 --> 00:01:51.665
It was a fish out
of water totally.

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:55.370
And a couple weeks into
this volleyball assignment

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.240
for the school newspaper
the editor says,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.210
hey, we have an opening
on the football beat.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.152
Would you like to cover
the football team?

00:02:01.152 --> 00:02:03.110
Before he could even
finish asking the question

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.318
I was like, yes, count me in.

00:02:04.318 --> 00:02:05.270
Let's go.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.047
Because I actually
knew what football was.

00:02:07.047 --> 00:02:09.380
I had actually watched a
football game before in my life

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.600
and actually knew how to
keep track of football

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.188
scores and all that.

00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:13.730
So here I am.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.830
I go and start covering
the football team at USC.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.743
And this is right at
the start of their run.

00:02:17.743 --> 00:02:19.160
For the next three
years they went

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.440
to three straight national
championship games.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.940
They won 34 consecutive games.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.300
They went on this unprecedented
run in college football

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.930
in the mid 2000s.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.090
And I got to cover the
team for those three years.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.060
I got to go to all three of
those national championship

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.560
games.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.940
I got to go to two
Heisman Trophy ceremonies.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.430
I got to go to every single
home and away football game

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.140
as my job in college.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.810
Now, many of you who
went to college you

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.360
had some pretty crazy
jobs in college.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.772
A lot of my friends had
some pretty funky jobs,

00:02:46.772 --> 00:02:48.980
like janitor in the middle
of the night in the dorms,

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.560
or working in the IT department
in the middle of the night,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.120
keeping stuff running.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.180
I got to have an
incredible job of covering

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.760
a football team, the number
one team in the country.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.370
Every home and away game,
travel, all that stuff.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.870
And this was what
I was getting paid

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.425
to do as a college student.

00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:05.300
I was living a dream.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.230
This was unbelievable.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.500
And so I was gearing up to
graduate three years later,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.848
and I lived this
amazing journey.

00:03:11.848 --> 00:03:14.390
And I wanted to write one final
good story about the football

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.130
team before I left.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.650
And so I'm searching
around, digging around,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.830
trying to find one final
good story for this student

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.460
newspaper.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.950
And I see a little alert
that comes up that says,

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.730
walk-on tryouts for the
football team are coming up.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.402
And so walk-ons are the
end of the bench guys.

00:03:30.402 --> 00:03:32.360
They don't get scholarships
to play in college,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.352
so they're paying their
own way to be there.

00:03:34.352 --> 00:03:36.560
They don't get newspaper
articles written about them.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.940
They're never on "SportsCenter."

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.070
They're kind of the
unheralded guys.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.570
And so I was like,
why don't I write

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.190
an article about these guys?

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.810
Do something that hadn't
really been done before.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.780
And so I start
interviewing some guys that

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.313
can go through this
tryout, and it's

00:03:49.313 --> 00:03:50.750
kind of an open casting call.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.115
Any student at USC can
try out for the team.

00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:54.740
And so here I am
interviewing some guys

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.990
that are going to go through
this, and in this process

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.490
it hits me.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.623
Well, why don't I go
through the tryout myself?

00:03:59.623 --> 00:04:01.040
Really bring people
on the inside.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.870
Show people a
first-person perspective

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.930
how hard this is to go through
the tryout for the number one

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.630
college football
team in the country.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.130
Now before I go any further, I
do have to be honest with you

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.948
guys.

00:04:10.948 --> 00:04:13.490
Not only, as I mentioned, was
I a student newspaper reporter,

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.323
I was really skinny.

00:04:14.323 --> 00:04:15.290
I was 165 pounds.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.970
But on top of
that, the last time

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.190
I played football
was in fifth grade.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.860
So it had been more than 10
years since I played football,

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.070
and here I was going through
the tryout for the number one

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.678
college football
team in the country.

00:04:26.678 --> 00:04:28.220
So this was going
to be a total joke.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.333
I mean, here I was,
student newspaper reporter

00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:32.750
going through the tryout for
the best team in the country,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.120
having not played football
since fifth grade.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.670
I could go through this
tryout, show how hard it is,

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.110
and really just
make fun of myself.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.600
It would just be a total
joke of an article.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.990
So I go through the tryout,
and I'm really just soaking it

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.490
all up.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.365
This was going to be
the story of a lifetime.

00:04:48.365 --> 00:04:51.260
I get home that night, and
I mean, I hit a goldmine.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.520
This was the coolest story
I could have ever imagined.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.680
I got to try out for
this football team.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.490
There's Pete Carroll, who is
head coach of USC at the time,

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.040
yelling at me during
in the tryout.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.420
I'm running 40-yard dash for
the first time in my life.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.640
I mean, this was so
cool, and I'm bringing

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.910
all the readers on the inside.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.320
This is such an
amazing opportunity.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.280
And so I go home.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.960
I start writing my
story, and I was so

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.170
excited to put this together.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.940
And the next morning I get
a phone call saying, hey,

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.898
is this Ben Malcolmson?

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:16.720
And I was like,
yeah, this is Ben.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.460
And the lady on the
other end of the line

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.010
goes, well, you made
the football team.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.670
Now, I laughed at first, too,
because this had to be a joke.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:26.890
There's no way.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.300
There were 40 guys
at the tryout.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.645
39 of them were trying
their hearts out

00:05:31.645 --> 00:05:32.770
to make this football team.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.990
There was one guy there, me,
not trying to make the team.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.320
I had no intention of
ever making this team

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.420
because my sole
intention in being there

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.400
was to write a
really cool article.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.170
And I achieved
that at this point.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.650
I was happy.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.650
So I get this phone call,
and I'm just in shock.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.192
I laugh at the lady, and she's
like, no, no, no, I'm serious.

00:05:50.192 --> 00:05:51.430
You're on the team.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.828
And I'm like, there's no way.

00:05:52.828 --> 00:05:53.620
This can't be true.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.700
She's like, your
name's on the list.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.500
You've got to come
in and check in.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.490
So I hop on my bike.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.740
I start pedaling as fast as
I can over to the football

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.480
building just to make
sure this is legit

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.055
and actually check into
this football team.

00:06:04.055 --> 00:06:05.680
And I walk up to the
football building,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.352
and it hits me there in that
moment that Coach Carroll--

00:06:08.352 --> 00:06:10.060
he was the head coach
of USC at the time.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.130
He's renowned for
pulling pranks.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.860
You can go on YouTube right now
and type in Pete Carroll prank.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.300
I mean, don't do it right
now, because we're talking.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.150
But after this type in Pete
Carroll prank on YouTube,

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.107
and you'll get a dozen
pranks that'll show up.

00:06:21.107 --> 00:06:21.940
He's a kid at heart.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.230
He's a jokester.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.990
So it hits me that I'm going to
be the butt end of his latest

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.650
prank.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.380
I mean, what better target
than the 21-year-old student

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.682
newspaper reporter who had
just gone through a tryout?

00:06:32.682 --> 00:06:35.140
Of course I'm going to be the
butt end of his latest prank.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.187
So now here I am,
talking myself into, OK,

00:06:38.187 --> 00:06:40.270
I'm about to get the rug
pulled out from under me.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.800
I'm going to walk out
to the football office.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.080
There's going to be Pete
Carroll, Will Ferrell,

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.820
and Snoop Dogg, and they're
all going to point laugh at me.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.530
And here I am.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.440
Oh man, I'm fully ready
for this to happen.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.570
I walk up to the office,
the football office there,

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:53.800
and there's Pete Carroll.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.500
Big old grin on his face,
and he's like, hey, Ben.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.270
And I was like, hey
coach, joke's over.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.470
Nice one, nice prank.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.360
And he's like, no,
no, no, I'm serious.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.710
You can catch the ball.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.490
You can run fast.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.990
We want you on the team.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.820
Are you in?

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.420
There in that moment,
I was like, OK,

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.120
maybe this isn't a joke.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.083
Maybe this is serious,
but here, this

00:07:12.083 --> 00:07:14.500
is the best college football
coach at the time telling me,

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.570
who hadn't played
football in 10 years,

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.250
that I could maybe
play football.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.005
This is crazy.

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:20.958
And he's like, are you in?

00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.750
And I was like, of
course I'm in, let's go.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.710
So there in that moment, I go
from a student's paper reporter

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.420
to all of a sudden being a
wide receiver on the number one

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.350
college football
team in the country.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.190
This is crazy.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.770
I could have never dreamed
of something like this.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.070
So here in this moment my
life takes a total turn.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.528
And they go and
hand me a playbook.

00:07:37.528 --> 00:07:40.570
And I've played video games,
Madden football and stuff

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.880
like that, but this playbook
was nothing like that at all.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.970
This playbook was like
learning a new language.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.070
I go get handed my
helmet and my pads.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.230
I didn't know which was
front and back on my pads.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.530
I was so embarrassed.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.150
This is the biggest joke.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.200
I'm just losing myself here.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.050
I don't know what was going on.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.510
So then I'm out at practice.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:59.967
I'm getting my head beat.

00:07:59.967 --> 00:08:00.800
I'm getting crushed.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.380
I'm like a tackling
dummy out there.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.880
I'm like fresh meat
for these guys.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.110
Here I am, a small little
kid out there basically,

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.735
and hadn't played
football in 10 years,

00:08:07.735 --> 00:08:10.222
and I'm just getting
leveled left and right.

00:08:10.222 --> 00:08:11.680
I'm starting to
get the hang of it.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.690
It took a couple weeks.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:13.690
I was starting to
gain some weight.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.357
I went to Taco Bell
a lot late at night.

00:08:15.357 --> 00:08:17.822
Started to gain some
weight and was lifting

00:08:17.822 --> 00:08:19.030
a lot of weight and all that.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.710
And starting to
learn the playbook,

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.710
and I'm starting to actually
feel and look a little bit more

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.710
like a football player, little
by little, day after day.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.270
About a month into
spring practice

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.400
I'm out blocking on
a play, and I get

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.919
my arm caught in a guy's pad.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:34.892
And we roll over in
this freak injury.

00:08:34.892 --> 00:08:36.100
I'm lying there on the field.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.950
My shoulder's dislocated.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.010
And the doctors rush out.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.468
They sent me to the hospital
there on campus, and they say,

00:08:41.468 --> 00:08:43.299
you need emergency
reconstructive surgery

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.480
on your shoulder because your
shoulder is just destroyed.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.968
So there in the
span of a month I

00:08:47.968 --> 00:08:49.510
go from a student
newspaper reporter,

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.360
who had been typing, to all of
a sudden being on the football

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.730
field, getting beaten
left and right.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:55.667
And now here I am.

00:08:55.667 --> 00:08:57.250
I have to get emergency
reconstructive

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.930
surgery on my shoulder.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.030
So my dream that I'd
started to live into

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.700
and started to take hold
of, this newfound, new life,

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.290
that I had, this new dream
that was all exciting,

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.380
it all of a sudden gets
ripped from my hands.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.320
I was crushed.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.020
I was so discouraged
and devastated.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.520
And maybe you've
been in a situation

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.530
like that, too, where
you feel like, man, I'm

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.850
onto something here.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.200
I'm onto something really
cool and really exciting.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.770
And then all of a sudden
it gets taken from you.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.290
So I just decided I
was going devote myself

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.220
to the rehab process.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.470
The doctor said I was going
to be out for nine months,

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.240
but maybe I could
get back quicker.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.198
Maybe I could get back
just a little bit faster

00:09:30.198 --> 00:09:31.090
than nine months.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.470
I just poured myself
into this rehab process

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.700
and just tried to get
back a little bit faster.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.842
Four and a half months later I'm
with the doctors, and they say,

00:09:38.842 --> 00:09:40.300
we can't believe
this is happening,

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.000
but you're actually
100% healthy.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.010
You're able to return
to the football field.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.540
Half the time the
doctor said, there

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.410
I was all of a sudden
back to practicing.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.237
This was a miracle.

00:09:52.237 --> 00:09:54.820
There's no way this could have
happened other than it was just

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:55.780
a miracle healing.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.430
I was so amazed.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.770
So there I am back to
practicing that fall,

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:00.815
suiting up for practice.

00:10:00.815 --> 00:10:03.190
And then for home games I get
to dress out in the uniform

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.820
and run out of the tunnel at
the LA Coliseum, 92,000 people.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.500
This was incredible.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.080
It was just literally
living a dream.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.890
And I was content
just doing that.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:14.890
But I was alone in that
thought because there

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.747
was a group of
students that wanted

00:10:16.747 --> 00:10:17.830
to see me get into a game.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.980
So they started a campaign
called Get Ben In.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.410
And they wanted to see just
the guy who represented

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:24.410
the average student.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.570
Not the huge muscled
up football player,

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:30.070
but just the normal student get
into a game for this number one

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.083
team.

00:10:31.083 --> 00:10:32.500
And so they started
this campaign.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.400
They made T-shirts.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.750
They made posters.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.512
They started chants in the
student section, Get Ben In.

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:39.595
And we make it for the
last home game of the year.

00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:41.140
I hadn't played yet.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.900
And it's number six Notre
Dame versus number three

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.230
USC at the LA Colosseum,
92,000 people.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.670
So that story, in and of itself,
we could walk out of here

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.670
and be like, oh wow, that
was really cool story.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.545
That's really cute, and
I'm kind of inspired.

00:10:53.545 --> 00:10:55.210
It was a unique
little football story.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.370
But the best part
about that story

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.460
is what God was doing
behind the scenes.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.877
What I mentioned
at the beginning,

00:11:00.877 --> 00:11:03.160
that this sense of
purpose that we all have,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.940
and when I made that team I had
this deep, overwhelming sense

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.640
that God had put me on
that team for a reason.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.807
That I was there for a purpose.

00:11:11.807 --> 00:11:13.640
And so I was pressed
into that from day one.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.840
And I couldn't wait to see
why I was on that team.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.968
Because if there needed
to be another football

00:11:18.968 --> 00:11:20.510
player on that team,
there were a lot

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:24.280
of other stronger, faster,
bigger guys than me.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.410
But I was picked
for that team, and I

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.047
felt like I had a divine
reason on that team.

00:11:29.047 --> 00:11:30.130
So I was pressing into it.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.630
I couldn't wait to see
why I was on that team.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.760
And a month or so
into being on the team

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.135
I get this nudge on my heart
that I need to start a Bible

00:11:37.135 --> 00:11:38.310
study for the team.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.570
Like many of you in
here are probably

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.890
involved in some kind of
fellowship here at Google,

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.840
and someone at some point felt
this nudge to start it here.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.270
And that's the nudge I felt.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.630
And I was like, OK,
there's no Bible study.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.190
I'm going to start
this Bible study.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.250
And made flyers, passed them
out to all my teammates.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.770
Told all the guys on the
team and got a Bible study

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:57.370
lesson ready.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.340
And the room got ready, and
time comes for our first Bible

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.220
study, and I'm sitting
there all alone.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.530
No one showed up.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.390
So I'm discouraged.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.290
I'm defeated.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.110
I'm sitting here questioning,
why am I on this team?

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.270
What is my purpose
in being here?

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.900
Because if I had a
purpose then you'd

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.220
think at least one other
person would show up.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.850
So then I'm wrestling with this
discouragement and this doubt.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.820
And about a month or so later I
get another nudge in my heart.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.740
Let me start a prayer
group for the team.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:27.657
We'll gather together.

00:12:27.657 --> 00:12:30.370
We'll pray together as a bunch
of believers on the team,

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.837
and the time will come,
and it'll be awesome.

00:12:32.837 --> 00:12:33.670
We'll pray together.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.033
We'll encourage one another,
and this'll be great.

00:12:36.033 --> 00:12:36.741
So I made flyers.

00:12:36.741 --> 00:12:39.215
I passed them out
to all my teammates.

00:12:39.215 --> 00:12:41.590
Got a room ready, and the time
comes for our first prayer

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:46.180
meeting as a team, and you
guessed it, no one showed up.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.080
So now here I am, twice as
defeated, twice as discouraged,

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.840
and questioning my
purpose even more.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.740
Why am I here?

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.775
Why am I on this team?

00:12:56.775 --> 00:12:58.150
And maybe you
resonate with that.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.358
Maybe you're wrestling with
something like that right

00:13:00.358 --> 00:13:03.770
now in your workplace, at home
with some friends that you

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:04.270
have.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.603
Maybe you're wrestling with
this discouragement of, man,

00:13:06.603 --> 00:13:08.770
I feel like I have a
purpose, but sometimes

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.120
I just don't see it.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.170
I was in that spot,
and it's hard.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.630
As many of you, if not most
of you, if not all of you,

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.210
can relate with,
it's really hard.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.080
So I'm wrestling with
this discouragement,

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.205
and it takes me a little
while to get through that,

00:13:24.205 --> 00:13:26.650
and a month or two later, I
get another idea in my heart.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.080
I just read in the book
of Matthew Chapter 5,

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.960
and it says, "let your
light shine before men."

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.292
And it hits me in that moment
that lights just shine.

00:13:35.292 --> 00:13:37.000
Before they go create
events, before they

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.340
go do anything, lights
first and foremost,

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.530
just shine where they're at.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.010
And so I just needed
to be a light.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.830
I was so focused on creating
something, doing something,

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.570
that I lost track of
the fact that I just

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:48.470
needed to be a light.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.920
Just be a positive, uplifting,
loving person to the people

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.880
around me.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.260
So I devoted myself to that.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.040
I'm going to be a light.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.207
This is going to be awesome.

00:13:56.207 --> 00:13:59.180
And now I'm going to see the
fruit of my labor in this way.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.540
So I pour myself into this, and
weeks and weeks, maybe a month

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.830
or two go by, and once again,
I'm not seeing any results.

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:10.970
Once again, I'm discouraged,
defeated, and questioning what

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.170
is my purpose on this team.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.750
Because if I had a purpose,
you'd think I would see it.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.815
And I'm just not seeing it.

00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:19.940
So at this point we're
almost at the end of season.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.815
We get chosen to play
in the Rose Bowl, which

00:14:21.815 --> 00:14:22.690
is on New Year's Day.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.273
And a few weeks
before the Rose Bowl I

00:14:24.273 --> 00:14:26.300
was reading in the book
of Isaiah, Chapter 55.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.840
It says, "if His word goes
out, it will not return empty."

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.470
And so I knew that God is
always faithful to His promise.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.240
I knew that He is
always true to His word,

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.080
and that if I put
His word out there,

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.080
if I put His literal word out
there it will not return empty.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.080
And so I got this idea--

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.848
I'm going to get a Bible for
every one of my teammates.

00:14:45.848 --> 00:14:48.140
I'm going to pass one out to
every one of my teammates,

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.330
and God's going to be
faithful to His word.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.160
That if I put his
word out there it's

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.347
not going to return empty,
that it will achieve a purpose.

00:14:55.347 --> 00:14:56.180
So I was so excited.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.180
I called my grandfather.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.540
He works for this organization
called the Gideons.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.790
They're the ones that pass
out free Bibles in hotels,

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.980
and you open up the
drawer in the hotel room,

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.880
and there's a Gideon
Bible right there.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.853
And so I called him
up, shared my idea,

00:15:07.853 --> 00:15:09.270
and I was like,
what do you think?

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:10.970
He's like, I'll
send you 100 bibles.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.730
So a week or two
later, I get 100 bibles

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.670
delivered to my doorstep.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:18.170
And I wanted to make it kind
of an anonymous Christmas gift.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.670
It was right before
Christmas, and I

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.730
figured I was tired of being the
guy that was out there trying

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.680
to make an impact, trying
to find my purpose,

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.090
and everything failing.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.570
So this one I'm going to do
completely under the radar.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.743
I'm going to be totally
anonymous on this one.

00:15:30.743 --> 00:15:32.660
And so I typed up a
little red note that said,

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.310
a Christmas gift for you.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:37.370
The greatest present you will
ever receive, Jesus Christ.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.857
Merry Christmas.

00:15:38.857 --> 00:15:40.940
And I stuck one of these
red notes in every Bible,

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.400
and at 11 o'clock at
night on Christmas Eve

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.550
I went into the locker
room, and I placed one Bible

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.818
in every locker.

00:15:47.818 --> 00:15:50.110
I didn't want anyone to know
that it was me doing this,

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.401
so I waited till it was
late at night as possible.

00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:53.984
I didn't even want
the janitor to know

00:15:53.984 --> 00:15:55.830
that it was me doing this.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.680
And so I'm placing one in every
locker, and in this process

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:03.045
I had this overwhelming sense
that this was my purpose.

00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:05.045
Sure, I thought the prayer
group was my purpose.

00:16:05.045 --> 00:16:06.620
Sure, I thought the Bible
study was my purpose.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.787
Sure, I thought trying to
be a light was my purpose.

00:16:08.787 --> 00:16:12.080
But all those things
had failed, and this

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.720
is why I was there, placing
a Bible in every one

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.370
of my teammates' locker.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.320
So we had Christmas Day
off, and we get back

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.000
on the 26th of December for our
first day back of our last week

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.940
together before the
game on January 1,

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.200
our last game of the season.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:27.800
I was senior.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.330
This was my last chance.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.137
And so I knew that this was my
purpose of being on this team.

00:16:32.137 --> 00:16:33.220
I was running out of time.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.380
This had to be it.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.380
And so I'm walking over
to the football building

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.950
that morning on the 26th, fully
expecting just the greatest

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.030
of things to happen.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.530
I was a zealous 21-year-old.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:46.370
I was so excited to see what God
was going to do through this.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.010
And I'm walking
up just expecting,

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:50.510
like, the Hallelujah chorus to
be sung from the locker room,

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:53.510
gold light to be emanating
from the locker room doors.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:57.842
I was fully expecting just the
craziest of things to happen.

00:16:57.842 --> 00:16:59.550
And I pulled the door
to the locker room,

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.530
and I pull it open.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.670
There were Bibles just
thrown all over the floor,

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.839
shredded everywhere.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:11.067
All you could see were just
shredded pages of Bible

00:17:11.067 --> 00:17:11.859
all over the floor.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:14.770
You couldn't even
see the carpet.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.390
I was absolutely crushed.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.280
My discouragement
went to a new low.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.380
I was completely devastated.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.283
Here I tried to find my purpose
through the Bible study,

00:17:25.283 --> 00:17:27.450
through the prayer group,
through being a light, now

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.030
through these Bibles,
and I had failed.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:34.248
Not just again, but I had
failed miserably this time.

00:17:34.248 --> 00:17:35.790
So you can imagine
my disappointment,

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.540
my discouragement.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.810
We go through that week
leading up to the Rose Bowl,

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.310
and I just had this
hole in my heart

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.770
that I had missed my purpose
of being on that team.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:44.940
We play in the Rose Bowl.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.440
I go home after
the game, and I get

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.960
a phone call a few days after
the game saying, hey, did you

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.540
about Mario?

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.505
Now, Mario was our kicker on
the team, record-setting kicker.

00:17:53.505 --> 00:17:54.880
He just finished
his junior year.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.040
He had one more year
left in college.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.190
And I was like, no,
what happened to Mario?

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.620
And my friend, my teammate
on the other end of the line

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.020
goes, oh no, you didn't hear.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.230
Mario died last night.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.140
21 years old, he
had mysteriously

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:13.310
passed away just a few days
after our last game together.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.730
So now not only was I dealing
with this discouragement

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.540
of trying and failing
to find my purpose,

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.780
but now I'm dealing
with this grief.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.600
At 21 years old, losing a
friend, one of my closest

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.850
friends, one of my teammates.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.080
Same age as me, 21.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.070
This is heartbreaking.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.660
I didn't even know
how to fathom it.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.808
I didn't even know
how to process this.

00:18:31.808 --> 00:18:33.850
We go to this funeral as
a team a few days later,

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:35.210
and I'm sitting
right on the aisle,

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:37.210
and they carry his casket
down the center aisle.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:40.790
And I look up right as
the casket passes by.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:45.160
And on top of the
casket was this Bible

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.450
with a red note sticking out of
it, just resting right on top

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:49.997
of the casket.

00:18:49.997 --> 00:18:51.830
And I had no idea what
it meant at the time,

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.580
but it just felt like it was
God's personal comforting touch

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.840
for me.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.580
Just to say like, I see
you, I saw you all along.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.390
And it gave me immense comfort.

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.610
It was just such an
incredible moment

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.140
that I had with
God in that moment.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.300
So then a few months
later after working

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.100
through that grief
and all that stuff,

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.510
I ended up starting to work
at USC for Coach Pete Carroll

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.010
there.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.427
He was the head
coach at the time.

00:19:14.427 --> 00:19:16.790
And three years
later, he took the job

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.680
with the Seattle
Seahawks in 2010.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.720
Asked me to follow
him up here, and I'd

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.470
moved up not knowing anyone.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.830
And for those of
you that have moved,

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.280
either for jobs or
whatnot, and you move

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.907
and you don't know anyone
there, and it's so hard.

00:19:29.907 --> 00:19:30.740
It's so challenging.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.978
And how do you make friends?

00:19:31.978 --> 00:19:34.020
It's just, like, the most
challenging thing ever.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.800
So I was desperate
to make friends.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.720
I'd say hi to someone
in the grocery store,

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.150
and I was like, oh, maybe
they'll be my friend.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.513
Maybe the person behind
me in Starbucks, maybe

00:19:43.513 --> 00:19:44.430
they'll buy my coffee.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.430
Maybe we can have a
conversation today.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.310
I was just so desperate,
so lonely to make friends.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.990
So I come across this one guy
who's a really outgoing guy,

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.530
and he starts telling me about
this group called Young Life.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.570
Young Life is a high
school mentorship program.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.653
It's got a big footprint
here in the Seattle area.

00:19:58.653 --> 00:20:00.112
And he starts
telling me about this

00:20:00.112 --> 00:20:01.732
and that they need
volunteer leaders.

00:20:01.732 --> 00:20:04.190
I was like, whatever it is,
I'm in because I need something

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:05.640
to do with my time.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.575
So I show up at this Young Life
informational leader meeting,

00:20:08.575 --> 00:20:09.950
and I'm just trying
to learn what

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.080
this whole organization is.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.480
And as I'm sitting there
a former teammate of mine

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.830
walks through the door.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:16.700
His name was Taylor.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.710
He was our punter on the team.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.552
Now, I hadn't seen
him in four years.

00:20:21.552 --> 00:20:23.510
The last time I saw him
was at Mario's funeral,

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.260
four years earlier,
1,000 miles from where

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.555
we were at this point.

00:20:26.555 --> 00:20:27.960
And we're outside Seattle.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.120
This is crazy.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.772
What are we both
doing in this spot?

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:32.480
So we remove ourselves
from this meeting.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.450
We're catching up, and he's
like, dude, my life has totally

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:37.370
turned around the
last few years.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:38.837
I was like, well, what happened?

00:20:38.837 --> 00:20:41.170
He's like, do remember the
last week we were on the team

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.310
together there were Bibles
in all of our lockers?

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.952
Now, I hadn't thought about
these Bibles in years.

00:20:47.952 --> 00:20:50.410
Because these Bibles with the
red notes sticking out of it,

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:51.750
they symbolized discouragement.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.640
They symbolized defeat.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.340
And ultimately, they symbolized
the death of a friend

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.840
and a teammate of mine.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.960
So when he said that my initial
reaction was just play dumb.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.490
So I go, yeah, I don't know.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:03.960
I kind of remember those.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.920
I don't really know.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.400
I don't really know.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.403
What about those Bibles?

00:21:08.403 --> 00:21:11.070
And so he starts to tell me that
he grew up in a Christian home.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.863
He grew up going to church.

00:21:12.863 --> 00:21:14.280
When he went to
college he decided

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.850
to leave the faith and kind
of live life on his own terms

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.720
and do things the way
he wanted to do it.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.995
And so he's going about
his daily life in college,

00:21:22.995 --> 00:21:26.040
and for four years
does his own thing.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.190
So when he sees a Bible in
his locker that morning,

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:32.640
his last week on the team,
he's kind of confused,

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.110
and he's also a little annoyed.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.972
Like, what is this
Bible doing here?

00:21:35.972 --> 00:21:37.430
I don't really need
this right now.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.813
He throws it in the
back of his locker.

00:21:39.813 --> 00:21:41.980
He's going to go out to the
practice field that day,

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.100
and he's thinking he's the last
one to leave the locker room.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.410
And he's pushing the door
to go out to the field,

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.618
and he hears a voice in the
back corner of the locker

00:21:49.618 --> 00:21:51.070
room going, what is this?

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:52.330
And so he was confused
because he thought

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:53.538
he was the last one in there.

00:21:53.538 --> 00:21:57.425
And he turns around, and
there's Mario our kicker,

00:21:57.425 --> 00:21:59.800
sitting in his locker, thumbing
through the Bible, going,

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.310
what is this?

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:05.445
And so Taylor tells me
that he turns around,

00:22:05.445 --> 00:22:07.320
and he screams across
the locker room, Mario,

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.820
have you never seen
a Bible before?

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.655
Mario is like, what am I
supposed to do with this thing.

00:22:12.655 --> 00:22:14.530
Taylor and Mario-- they
were best of friends.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:15.890
They were the punter
and the kicker.

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:17.348
They spent all
their time together.

00:22:17.348 --> 00:22:20.260
And so Taylor for some
reason sets down his helmet

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.540
and his pads there
at the doorstep,

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.950
turns around, walks back,
and sits down next to Mario.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:30.320
And for 45 minutes takes
him through the Bible.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.940
Every word in red are the
words of Jesus Christ,

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.710
the Son of God, the
Savior of the world,

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:36.830
the one who came to die,
to take on your sins,

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.300
to make you right with God.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.770
They missed half of
practice that day.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.870
Taylor said for the
rest of that week Mario

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.952
couldn't put the Bible down.

00:22:45.952 --> 00:22:46.910
He couldn't get enough.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:47.690
He was asking questions.

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.820
He was just constantly
reading every spare moment

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.660
he had, every bus ride, every
few minutes between meetings.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.230
Mario couldn't put
the Bible down.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:59.230
Taylor said just a few days
before the game, he and Mario

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:02.050
had a conversation where
Mario had started walking

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.020
with God in a brand new way.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:09.130
Sort of walking towards God,
and just the final few days

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:10.533
before the game.

00:23:10.533 --> 00:23:11.950
So then Taylor
gets the same phone

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:15.400
call I did just a few days
later, that his teammate,

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.560
his friend had died.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.410
And in that moment he was
obviously overcome with grief,

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:25.440
but he was also overcome with
the power and the love of God,

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.700
that God would reach Mario
in his final few days

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.860
through this random Bible.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.460
And there in that moment Taylor
saw the power, and the grace,

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.190
and the love of God.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:38.990
And in that spot recommitted
his life to Christ, and said,

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.630
God, You're real, You're good.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.780
I'm going to follow You.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.380
And so Taylor's telling me
this story four years later,

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.950
and he's like, yeah, my life
hasn't been the same since.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.670
I'm on the verge of
tears at this point,

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.045
and I'm like, man,
Taylor, that's

00:23:53.045 --> 00:23:55.240
the craziest story
I've ever heard.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.550
And it's even crazier
because I was the one that

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:59.670
put the bibles in the locker.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:02.830
And I thought I was
a total failure.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.030
Gave each other a big hug.

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:06.763
And this is our God.

00:24:06.763 --> 00:24:08.680
This is the way God wants
to work through each

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.520
and every one of us.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.340
God does have an amazing
purpose for you no matter

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.280
where you're at in life, No
matter what your past looks

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.240
like, no matter what failures or
mistakes you think you've made,

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.868
God has an incredible
purpose for you.

00:24:22.868 --> 00:24:24.910
There's a verse in the
back of the Old Testament,

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:26.303
in the book of Habakkuk.

00:24:26.303 --> 00:24:28.720
Chapter one, verse five, and
it says, "Look at the nations

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.170
and watch and be utterly amazed.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:33.850
For I am doing
something in your days

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:38.210
that you would not believe,
even if you were told."

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.440
This is how God wants to
work through each one of us.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.430
He wants to do things in our
days that we would not believe,

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.900
even if He told
us ahead of time.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.400
That's true for
me in this story.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.950
You can see, obviously, that
if God would have told me

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.922
ahead of time that I would
try out for the team,

00:24:52.922 --> 00:24:54.630
I would make it, I
would overcome injury.

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:56.520
I would get back and
try to find my purpose.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.100
Everything would look like a
failure, a teammate would die.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.500
Then four years later,
1,000 miles away,

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.350
I'd reconnect with a
teammate and find out

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.380
that God's purposes were at
work, that God was at work,

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.838
that God did have
a purpose for me.

00:25:08.838 --> 00:25:10.922
If you would've told me
all of this ahead of time,

00:25:10.922 --> 00:25:12.390
I wouldn't believed Him.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:14.280
Even sharing this story
today with you guys,

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.520
you probably are like, wow,
this is unbelievable this story.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.490
I have to remind myself every
day that this is how good,

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:22.800
how great our God
is, that He truly

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.650
does want to do things
in all of our days

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:29.680
that we would not believe
even if we were told.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.920
This is a story, I
think, about purpose,

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.080
but it's also a
story about nudges.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:39.025
I felt those nudges along the
way to start a Bible study,

00:25:39.025 --> 00:25:41.140
to start prayer
group, to be a light,

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.430
to put bibles in my
teammates locker.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:47.610
Mario, that morning,
felt a nudge

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.250
to pick up a Bible for the
first time in his life,

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.460
and thumb through it
and ask, what is this?

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.590
Taylor felt a nudge as
he's pushing the door

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.770
to go out to the field
to set down his pads,

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.460
turn around, and walk back
towards this incredible purpose

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.990
that was laid out for him.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.295
And maybe you're feeling
a nudge right now.

00:26:07.295 --> 00:26:09.670
Wherever you're at in your
faith journey, wherever you're

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.070
at in life, I have a
feeling that you're

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.200
feeling a nudge right now.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.090
That God is knocking on the
door of your heart, to say,

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:18.420
I love you.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:19.745
I'm delighted in you.

00:26:19.745 --> 00:26:23.270
I have amazing purpose for you.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.610
And so look at the
nations and watch.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:27.410
Be utterly amazed.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.540
For God is doing
something in your days

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.950
that you would not believe
even if you were told.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:37.578
Listen to those nudges, and
just take the next step,

00:26:37.578 --> 00:26:39.370
because God is doing
something in your days

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:42.730
that you would not believe,
even if you were told.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:43.700
Thank you all so much.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:44.610
God bless you.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.560
- Yeah, that's really,
really powerful.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.580
Thanks for coming, Ben.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.710
What do you see the
Lord doing through you,

00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:59.730
where you are today?

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:02.670
You're still next to Pete
and all these guys who

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.560
are so far in their career.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.740
And how do you see him
nudging you and using you

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.130
where you are today?

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:10.300
BEN MALCOLMSON: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.630
And I think what
this story has taught

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.930
me all along is
that we often don't

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.350
see the fruit of our
labor in the moment.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.240
Like that story, it
took me four years later

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.460
to see what God was
doing all along.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:25.800
And so I feel that today.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.290
I still feel discouraged today.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:30.270
Man, like, do I have a purpose
in the spot that I'm in?

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.700
And so I'm just trusting and
knowing and just hopefully

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.558
following the nudge every day
that God is placing me there

00:27:35.558 --> 00:27:36.100
for a reason.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.490
And I might not see the results.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.260
Just like many of you
in here, maybe you

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.690
don't see the results
right now to why

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:44.740
God has you where you're at.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.010
But just to know, and to
trust that God is working.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.130
And so I feel that every day.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:50.310
I wrestle every day.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.620
Like, do I listen
to discouragement,

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.380
or do I listen to
the truth of God

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.550
that he does have a purpose?

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.640
And maybe someday down
the road, or when we all

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.500
get to heaven some
day, we'll get

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.720
to see what God was
doing all along.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.720
So thanks for that question.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.280
- So when you're
the butt of a prank,

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.630
like I can so see
that happening.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:14.050
Because from what
little I know, I

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:15.970
know there's a lot of pranking.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:19.240
And so what do you suggest
is the best mindset going

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.460
into a prank?

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.580
- To not take yourself
too seriously.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.890
I think a lot of times, we can
take ourselves way too serious.

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:30.280
But that's the great
thing about Coach Carroll

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.730
is that he's always keeping
things light and fun.

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:36.350
And I think that's
what it's all about.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.237
So that's a great
question though.

00:28:38.237 --> 00:28:40.070
And hopefully, the
prank's not coming to me.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:41.740
I hope he doesn't tell
me 12 years later that it

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.620
was all a joke.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:48.380
So thank you for that question.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:48.880
Awesome.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.020
Well, thank you all so much.

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:50.978
I appreciate your time.

00:28:50.978 --> 00:28:55.540
And if that story impacted
you, the book just

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.360
came out a few months ago,
and it captures that story

00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.590
plus many other things.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.900
And whether you have a
friend who's into sports,

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.280
or a young person
who's searching

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.890
for their purpose, or maybe even
a friend or a family member,

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.780
I think and I know that
this book will reach them

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.070
in a really special way.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.820
So I hope you get a
chance to pick one up.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.918
Thank you.

00:29:13.918 --> 00:29:14.460
Thanks, Phil.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.043
Thank you all.

00:29:15.043 --> 00:29:17.920
