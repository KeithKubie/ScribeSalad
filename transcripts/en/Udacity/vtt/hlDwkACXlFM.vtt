00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.340
The first step to finding Udacity forums
is to know the right links on the site.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.140
When you first sign in
to your Udacity account,

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.370
you're directed to your home page.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.530
Here's where you find your path for
your specific nanodegree program.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.200
Here we're using the Tech Entrepreneur
Nanodegree program as reference, but

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.990
all programs will have
a similar home page.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.700
Up at the top,
you'll see a Resources tab.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.690
Among other things, we see that there
is a link to the discussion forums.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.320
This will bring you to
your program's forum.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.300
Another way to access the forums
is through your classroom.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.410
You can be redirected to the forums by
clicking on the chat bubbles to the left

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.750
here or underneath the Get Help

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.080
on the right hand of the screen where
it says Rejoin the class discussion.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.950
When you are directed to the forums,
there are several categories, and

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.460
each has a purpose.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.500
The first category is your program's
broadcast or announcement thread.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.495
Here there will be announcements for

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:06.950
webcasts and other additional resources
that your coach wants you to know about.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.650
The cafe or community category is
a place where students are welcome

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.390
to network with classmates,
ask general questions or

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.310
have fun conversations
about just about anything.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.530
Then below these two,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.660
you will find specific categories for
each of your program's projects.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.540
Questions related to project content or

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.130
questions about project
requirements may be posted here.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.070
Now let's get some practice
posting on the forums.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.570
I'll go ahead and
click into the Community here.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.090
Now, let's say I want to create a whole
new topic to ask my question or

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.210
start a new conversation.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.970
To do that,

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.690
I can click on the + New Topic button
at the top right corner of the screen.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.380
This will direct me to a screen
where I can start typing.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.760
Be sure to have a useful title for
your post to help others find it.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.260
Let's say I want to post about
favorite places to study.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.780
So, I'll title this Where are your
favorite places to study?

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.930
Then, we can go down below and
start entering text.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.860
As you can see,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.150
to the right of the text box, there
is a preview of what you are typing.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.960
This can help you see
what the postal look like

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.180
before you hit the Submit button.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.110
When I'm done entering my text I can go
down to the lower left hand corner and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.010
click the Create Topic button, or, if I
decide not to want to post after all,

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.070
I can click the Cancel button.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.670
There are three important icons at
the top right hand corner of the forms.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.280
The magnifying glass allows
you to search the forums for

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.500
specific content created
by other students.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.670
To the right of the magnifying
glass is the hamburger menu,

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.640
which kind of looks like
a stack of pancakes.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.470
Here, we can find links to
specific categories in the forum.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.030
In this menu,

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.710
you will also find a link to a page
with frequently asked questions.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.840
Lastly we see my profile image.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.920
Clicking on this will direct me
to my forum account information.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.110
That's a quick introduction to
Udacity's forums, and the where and

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.295
how to post a comment.

00:03:17.295 --> 00:03:20.495
That's a quick introduction
to Udacity's forums and

00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:23.195
instructions on how to post a comment.

00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:26.706
Be sure to utilize the forums
throughout your nanodegree journey.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.382
Happy learning.
