[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.102 --> 00:00:03.060
ROMAIN MARDOT: Hi guys.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.980
My name is Romain
and I'm working

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.670
as a partner development manager
for the Google Play team.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.140
I am taking care
of partners that

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.450
are based in central
Europe and Russia,

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.090
and I'm based in Moscow.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.190
Today I will be talking
about the importance

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.690
of live operations in the
lifecycle of a mobile product.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.680
Also later on, I will
be joined by Stefan,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.210
who will be talking about one
of the examples that were kindly

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.390
shared with us by his company.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.670
So let's start.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.850
First of all, a quick
round about what's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.370
today's last presentation
is going to be about.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.720
Well first of all, I'll try
to define live operations

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.670
and explain why
they are important.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.880
Then I will go through four
examples that were kindly

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.750
shared with us by our partners.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.930
There are some people
present in the room.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.700
Thank you very much guys.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.590
And I will wrap up by giving
some recommendations and best

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.750
practices.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.150
Actually, live operations
is a pretty large field

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.420
of operations.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.760
And it's like
marketing, it touches

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.350
of lot of domains inside of
the video game publisher.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.040
And there were a
lot of cool examples

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.050
and best practices
that were already

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.810
shared before so I hope
that you will enjoy

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.960
the middle part of the
presentation that actually

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.090
brings more examples and data to
illustrate what we are saying.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.170
So this is, sorry,
skip the menu part.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.800
Now, what are liveops?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.680
Probably many of you have
heard this definition already,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.870
[? right, in ?] video
gaming, especially nowadays.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.910
We are talking about
running a game as a service.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.410
We are not at the point where
we were developing a product

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.450
and then launching
it on the market

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.400
and leaving it sitting there.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.360
Now most of the most
successful products

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.100
that are available
in the mobile sphere

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.160
or as a video
gaming platforms are

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.650
being operated by companies.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.410
So in this very
context I'm going

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.760
to talk about strategy
distribution, or interactions

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.050
that you might have
with the players that

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.160
aim to increase
their engagement,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.470
in some cases monetization.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.390
Overall, it's to bring more fun.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.350
Sometimes they will help
you to reduce your churn

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.200
because English players are
staying longer, obviously,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.530
or even bring some of them back.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.321
So what are the main
components of live operations?

00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:38.820
When we are talking
about operations

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.380
we're talking about
customer relations.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.840
Customer relations includes news
posting, interaction on forums,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.420
interaction on social networks.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.670
Previously we had
some great examples.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.150
It also includes sales
and promotions, bundles,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.060
rare items, activation
or distribution, contests

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.130
and tournaments.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.450
Business intelligence.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.420
Business intelligence, in
terms of live operation

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.400
is a very important factor.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.860
When talking about
mobile gaming publishing

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.580
we all know this
[INAUDIBLE] KPIs

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.520
like monthly, daily active
users, retention, conversion

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.480
to players.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.060
But business intelligence, when
it comes to live operations,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.130
is your capacity of measuring
the impact of the actions

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.670
that you are creating,
these operations

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.370
that you are creating
for your player's base.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.860
And here you have to be
always in front of the curve.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.750
If your product is
growing you need

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.920
to be proactive and create
activities that will actually

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.069
even increase this trend.

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.610
If you think that
you are, obviously,

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.900
[INAUDIBLE] in revenue or
[INAUDIBLE] your active users

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.550
is going down, here
again, you actually

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.460
have to be twice more
productive in terms of creating

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.160
different activities.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.550
Types of LiveOps.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.680
So there are liveops
that can be bound

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.270
to the coded updates, generally
called patches in the industry.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.920
And they come to hide the
importance of their new modes

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.140
or story that you
introduce to the game.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.790
They can also emphasize
the importance

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.450
of new characters, story, or
skills, or new game mechanics

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.680
that you have.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.520
Targeted?

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.720
They are more bound
to player groups.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.510
They depend on
seasons, on regions.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.090
They also depend on
the progress sometimes

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.930
the players have
made in the game.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.730
We actually had a very good
example half an hour ago.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.030
[INAUDIBLE] to the
moments when you think

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.500
that the players will churn.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.150
This is just a small reminder.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.330
When you are tailoring your live
operations for local markets

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.360
you need to make sure that you
think globally because even

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.080
the most famous events that
we are all used to celebrate

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.530
might occur at different
times of the year

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.580
in different countries.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.160
If we take the example
of Easter, or like when

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.430
the Christmas is
celebrated in Russia,

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.070
and they might not be
celebrated in the same way.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.820
So here you have
to be quite smart

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.450
and, again, think globally.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.550
This [? slide ?] is
actually pretty famous,

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.010
especially for those that
are doing game development.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.480
You know that you have to tailor
your live operations depending

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.850
on a player's objectives.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.880
We all know that
competition between players

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.550
is one of the
strongest drivers when

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.760
it comes to increased
players engagement revenue

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.560
because it's competition.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.370
But not everyone likes
direct confrontation.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.510
Some people like
playing a product

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.020
but discovering it
under a different way.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.970
Some people, as we
know, are achievers,

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.180
some people get there just
for the social component

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.720
because they want to stay
connected with other users.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.050
Some people like tourism,
they're exploring content.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.810
So when creating
a new opportunity

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.257
you have to think about
these types of players.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:18.241
As mentioned several times
today, it's all about business,

00:06:18.241 --> 00:06:18.740
right?

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.750
So when you are
creating live operations

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.410
you also have to take your
own goals into consideration.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.900
Here again, we are talking
retention and engagement.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.460
We need to make
sure that the events

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.647
that you create,
they do not burn,

00:06:30.647 --> 00:06:32.480
for instance, your
players' base because you

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.560
are, for instance,
delivering too much

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.000
content at the same time.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.200
That you monetize
these players properly.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.770
Later on we will actually
have a really cool example

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.270
of such a case.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.260
That you drive your players
to content properly because

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.950
technically and normally, when
your product is being released

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.060
you are the ones who know
your product in the best way.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.460
So you teach people,
you educate them

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.290
on how to go
through it properly.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.280
And marketing.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.500
Marketing here is,
obviously, when

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.630
you are collecting or gathering
resources inside your company

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.732
to raise the hype
around an event that

00:07:09.732 --> 00:07:10.940
is happening in your product.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.270
It's also a good opportunity
to acquire new users.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.780
So this scenario should be used.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.340
It's also a nice moment to
cross-promote your product.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.096
Obviously, you have more
than one in your portfolio.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.490
And the final step, when
tailoring your live operations

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.080
you have to tailor them for the
entire base of your players.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.260
And by entire we
mean the players

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:44.130
that are still to join your
project, those that left,

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:49.070
and different players that
are at a different level

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.090
of the progress of your game.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.540
Obviously you have not to
forget about the core players

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.880
because those are
usually the ones that

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.310
influence the community
in the best way

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.800
and promote your product often.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:07.610
So why it is important to
run live operations nowadays?

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.470
Because the content
is king and we

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.550
know that players are consuming
it at a different level.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.460
So you need to make sure that,
through your interactions

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.110
or the game mechanics, you
are present for the players

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.750
whenever they want to
interact with your product.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.960
It's very important and its one
of the best ways to keep them

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.650
engaged because time is money.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.250
We all know that, right?

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.730
And sometimes, when
your development team

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.059
and the artists are working
on creating new code

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:41.960
and new patch you can
come up with an event that

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.380
will have the same impact,
or sometimes even better,

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.900
to keep your users
engaged, to show

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.030
them the best out of the game.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.350
One example might be like going
through levels of your game,

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.150
or creating different
tournaments based

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.840
on achievements or
photo-sharing contests.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.680
Those are pretty, let's say,
cheap and efficient solutions

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.480
to bring something additional
and new about the game.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.980
Again, because
engagement is essential,

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.000
here featuring [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.290
And people get used
to talking to you.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:23.120
And the more efficient
you are the more likely

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.040
you are to reach
your users when you

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.150
try to share some important
information about the upcoming

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.840
event and the upcoming patch.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.990
People will just
stay engaged longer.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.407
Because we all know that
acquisition costs are high

00:09:38.407 --> 00:09:40.490
and the products that are
currently on the market,

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.980
the top grossing
ones, are mature,

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.220
so its one of the best ways to
optimize your lifetime value.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.810
It makes your traffic
acquisition more efficient.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.280
Players stay longer,
probably paying more.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.390
So it's helping to
save some money.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.780
And because we all do
products for people

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.370
we are creating apps.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:06.530
And even if you are interfacing
with a game through a device

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:11.510
you still like feeling
a human presence behind.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.160
This is why liveops
is important.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.750
In fact, it's not about
short-term spikes in revenue,

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.190
or daily active users.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:26.119
It's really about building
long-term, lifetime relations

00:10:26.119 --> 00:10:27.285
and value with your players.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.770
So now I will be going through
some examples that were

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.860
shared with us by our partners.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:44.910
Here we are featuring Wargaming,
studio from Belarus, Zeptolab,

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:50.490
UK, Madfinger Games, from Czech
Republic, and Creative Mobile.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.450
So Stefan Ruhle,
from Creative Mobile

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.400
will be talking about the
initiative on his own.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.210
So first example, Wargaming.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.110
Pretty interesting case.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:06.900
It was a live operation that was
created for the entire player's

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.690
base without creating any code.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.640
So what the guys
did is that they

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.890
use their web-based website
to pull the statistical data

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.900
from the service and organize a
competition among all players,

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.630
where every region
was represented

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.350
by different characters.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.700
So here you can see a cowboy
representing the North America,

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.360
and a Russian night
with a Russian tank.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.850
And players were
obviously fighting

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.310
for different objectives.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.340
The news about this
contest was just

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.430
pushed through Wargaming
normal networks.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.580
And actually what happened is
that just once the news were

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.430
released, the number
of daily active users

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.720
has instantly increased by 4%.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.960
This is without any additional
user acquisition, which was

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.040
actually quite a smart move.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.390
But besides that, by
introducing some smart goals

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.960
for the community what
Wargaming managed to reach

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.800
is to increase its
battle intensity by 22%,

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.820
to increase its in-game
purchases by almost twice,

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.300
and to increase their
hard currency, which

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.730
is gold in this game, by 117%.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.570
And this is just by
creating an event

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:30.180
and advertising it through the
web page and the community.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.550
There is another thing
that pops up to the game,

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.100
and is quite interesting
for analysis.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.470
It's a tank.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.800
As I was saying at the
beginning, if you remember,

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.950
I mentioned rare
items activation.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:47.760
So this tank was initially
coded and added to the game

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.330
but pops up only
on rare occasions.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.270
Once [? you ?] request
people can get it for free.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.760
Or, just before
Christmas in December,

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.010
it appears in a special bundle.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.680
So whenever this
tank appears it just

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.590
does massive results
in terms of sales

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.810
because people know how
this tank is legendary.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:11.040
And sometimes they are
waiting for it purposely.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.170
So as you can see
here, the number

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.570
of tanks that are sold
within the first three days

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.370
is increasing by 40%.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.580
It is the best selling
tank of all times.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.760
It drives 30% of
revenue for months

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.430
and it creates a lot
of new paying users.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.630
5.7% of people who bought
the bundle with this tank

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.230
paid within the ecosystem
for the first time.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.320
So it's quite a smart move.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.390
This is a chart
showing the number

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.930
of sales of this
legendary tank, Type 59,

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.170
comparing to other tanks.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:50.520
And the E 25 is one of the
most popular and available

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.730
in the game the whole time.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.390
This is actually quite cool.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.880
So next example
is from Zeptolab.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:02.430
Thank you Lana for
giving us the info.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.360
Those cases are actually pretty
interesting because not only

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.870
do they show the results of
some actions that were performed

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.210
by the partner but
they were actually

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.120
done in the context
of A/B testing.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:22.200
So now you will be seeing how
different changes of variables

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.640
bring different results.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.870
So in this case is
when additional content

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:31.700
was added to a premium chess.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.620
Group A the control
group, so the content

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.870
that was usually
available in the game.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:41.370
Then you have Groups B, C,
and D. And what you can see

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.470
is that it's not the
group that received

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.380
the most of the premium
content that added the most

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.080
value to the player's lifetime.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.790
So this is actually
one of the cases

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.340
where you have to balance
the content that you

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.200
deliver properly.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:01.310
Another example is
personalized offers.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.130
Before, the [INAUDIBLE]
had an offer that

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.620
was universal for all players.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.800
But then they decided
to include the content

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.310
based on the progress that
the players have already

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.540
made to the game.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:22.560
And here again, we can
see that the [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.733
has increased by 45%.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.090
Another example.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.360
This is the cross-promotion
factor, which I mentioned.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:37.450
This is the installs that are
being driven by Cut the Rope,

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:41.790
we all probably know this
game, to King of Chiefs.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.400
So here again,
amazing results were

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.430
reached in terms of
conversion to installs.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.910
And on the right part,
or actually, it's

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.480
still the right
part for you, you

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.050
can see different
examples of icons

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.420
that were used for reaching
those objectives and the impact

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.970
it has.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:04.240
The very last one,
which I personally like.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.840
So if you can see, it actually
features a special Android

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.980
[? king, ?] that was actually
added to the game and featured

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:16.510
on the store through a
[? banner. ?] So here again,

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:20.050
a good moment, good
initiative, and good idea.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.380
The costume has become
four times more popular

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.180
than other costumes in the game.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.270
So you have 1% of
players reported using it

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:32.798
at least once and 10% of players
are wearing it on daily basis.

00:16:32.798 --> 00:16:36.316
[ROMAIN LAUGHING]
Pretty cooL, right?

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.630
Last example on my
side before Stefan

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.030
comes to the stage, Madfinger.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.810
Thank you for providing the
example guys, Mark, [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.080
but thank you.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.580
On the left part of the slide,
it's not a live operation but

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.390
as I managed a very
cool example on how

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:06.400
the introduction of a PDP
mode changes games KPIs.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.280
So the game was
released one year ago.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.550
It has already 15 million
of installs worldwide.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:16.644
But when these guys introduced
the PDP mode back in May,

00:17:16.644 --> 00:17:19.599
it actually increased
the number of players

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.790
that converted to them by 100%.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.460
And their [? pool ?]
also went up.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.250
And then, we came up with a
team with the first purchase

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.305
offer that was adding additional
content to the players who

00:17:30.305 --> 00:17:31.840
were playing PDP.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.930
And here, as you
can see, the results

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.300
were also amazing in
terms of conversion

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.120
to paying users and
the increase of ARPU.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.250
And the project is
actually doing very well.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.890
And it's a very cool game.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.774
So now, it's Stefan's turn
to talk about the initiative.

00:17:48.774 --> 00:17:49.690
Please welcome Stefan.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.620
You hear me?

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.110
OK.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.634
Yeah.

00:17:59.634 --> 00:18:02.050
Thank you Romain and thank you
Google for actually hosting

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:03.670
a very, very pleasant event.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:07.720
I actually had the opportunity
to visit the Playtime event

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.600
in Berlin but I must say London
is like four times bigger here,

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.640
definitely.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.076
It is even an honor to
be mentioned among all

00:18:15.076 --> 00:18:16.325
those great, great developers.

00:18:16.325 --> 00:18:18.980
I love King of Thieves, I
even have that on my phone.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.370
So if you're looking for a
good game for lots of fun,

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.960
definitely download that.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.770
Let's start with a question.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:28.210
Who knows Fetty Wap?

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:29.200
That's like two.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.320
That's actually, usually
the answer I get in Europe.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.800
Well, let's quickly
look who is Fetty Wap.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.640
Fetty Wap is an
American hip hop artist

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:44.440
who rose to actually lots
of publicity in 2015.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:49.000
He has one billion
YouTube channel

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.240
with like 1 billion views.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:56.080
He has songs like
"Trap Queen," "679."

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.490
He works with
David [? Guetta, ?]

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:01.480
with SIA, with Blake, so
definitely, lots of big guys.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.440
And he is among the top 10 most
listened artists on Pandora,

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.910
Spotify, and Apple music.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.510
He's even been
nominated many times

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.550
for two Grammy
nominations already,

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.740
multiple VMA and
Billboard Awards.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.190
And what actually rose
some interest for us,

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.900
he shares a big passion for
cars, ATVs, and motorcycles,

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.800
actually anything
that has wheels.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.390
And so, he got in touch
with us with his management

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.870
and we started talking about
actually doing something

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.220
together based on
one of our games.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.250
We quickly realized
that he's actually

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.530
interested in doing
more than just

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.960
being the icon of the
game, actually doing

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.030
more and providing lots
of, lots of support.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:44.140
And that actually resulted in
one very nice game trailer,

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.908
which I wanted to show now.

Yeah, that was

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.420
so it's like a sister
game of Nitro Nation

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:31.360
And we work with the concept
of real rewards there.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.440
So we rewrote the
storyline to focus

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.860
on Fetty Wap and
his crew, that's

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.980
Monty and lots of other people.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.420
We added new soundtracks.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.660
There's music added
to the game, which

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.220
will be first
released to the game

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.790
and then later to this
audience, actually.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.250
We have lots of merchandise
from [? them, ?] from T-shirts,

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:54.510
to caps, to hoodies, to
later even, a meet and greet,

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:57.450
which will be result
in a tournament.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:01.850
And that actually resulted in
very, very impressive numbers.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.500
Now we had a launch event
in New York together

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.130
was with Fetty Wap, and
lots of his influences,

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:08.280
lots of his friends.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.780
That actually resulted that
we were among top two searched

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.370
game, actually
trending searches,

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.930
for the Fetty Wap game.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.280
Our retention went high.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.980
We got 50% retention
in the first months.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.680
Skyrocket with a
rating on Google Play,

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.540
as well for the review score.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.490
And we doubled our revenue.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.730
So that's definitely,
I would say, a liveop

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.040
which worked out for us.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:36.510
And here is just a little bit to
see the update before Fetty Wap

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.370
and after Fetty Wap.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:42.090
But now many of you will agree
that the pool of celebrities

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.840
is limited and you don't
want to use, I don't know,

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.730
George Clooney for the next
skydiving app, or something

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:50.230
like this.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.350
So it needs to stay authentic.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.930
And there's another way of
working, not with celebrities

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.810
but working with
brands, what we did,

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:58.260
and that is with
our-- that's why

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.650
I said sister game, that's
like the flagship title Nitro

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:01.149
Nation.

00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:02.610
That's like one big family.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.610
And there we started to
introduce more and more brands

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:06.750
for live operations.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:09.480
And we started to work with
Tec Speed Wheels, that's

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.800
a German rim manufacturer,
BBS [? Barbette, ?] many, many

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.295
we reached out.

00:22:15.295 --> 00:22:17.070
And rim manufacturers,
they actually

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.150
do tournaments, which are
already written in the game.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.440
But on quarterly
results we can actually

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.900
draw out a set of real rims.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.020
So if anyone is actually in
need of real rims for his car,

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.210
definitely play a little
bit of Nitro Nation.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.820
And something else, what we did
there, what I'm really, really

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.480
proud about is we won Hankook.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.424
I don't know who knows Hankook
but it's a tire sponsor, not

00:22:39.424 --> 00:22:41.340
tire sponsor, it's a
it's a tire manufacturer.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:47.650
But we won them as an official
tire sponsor four Nitro Nation.

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:49.680
I think are currently
number seven or number six

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:54.000
in the world, just quickly
behind guys like Continental,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.200
Dunlop, Michelin.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.400
So definitely big names.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.300
And what we did with them
is event collaboration.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:06.690
So these guys are regularly
going to car exhibitions.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:09.430
And quickly before
we go into that,

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:11.430
I think most of the
mobile game developers

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.340
can agree with me that
exhibitions for mobile game

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.550
developers, for
example, the gamescom,

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.360
to be present in the
entertainment area

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.910
is not really the best
deal because you need

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:25.260
to compete with Battlefield
1, Watch Dogs 2,

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.990
like people running
into the halls

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.300
to see that not to see
the next mobile game.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.730
And that's why we realize
it's actually a good time

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:36.450
to do liveops together with some
big brands on car exhibitions.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.240
So we went to Essen
Motor Show last year

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.550
together with Hankook.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:44.820
And these are typical
South Korean Hancook girls,

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.080
which are always using.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.630
And so we work
together with them.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.340
We invited some YouTubers.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.500
We had a big show there.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.200
We were part of their
booth and we actually

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.740
created video content on YouTube
with the YouTubers and Hankook

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.120
together, which reached
over a million views

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.430
in a couple of days.

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:04.290
So many of you said,
the Essen Motor Show

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:06.390
contacted us afterwards
and told like next time

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:10.140
you come you please tell us,
So that definitely worked out.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.710
And yeah, actually, I need to
rush through because Romain

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:14.507
wanted to go next.

00:24:14.507 --> 00:24:15.840
ROMAIN MARDOT: Thank you Stefan.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:16.881
STEFAN RUHLE: No problem.

00:24:16.881 --> 00:24:22.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.370
ROMAIN MARDOT: So the day
was quite [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:27.060
I'm not going to repeat
everything again.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.150
Its just a small stress
on the fact that Google

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.260
is actually amazing at
offering different services.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.650
And a lot of good stuff
was mentioned today.

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:37.270
Just a reminder,
when we were talking

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:42.240
about getting additional
events into your game,

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.770
you know that you can create
them through our services,

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:45.420
right?

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.820
And we have really
strong analytics tools

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.460
that are included in the
Google Play Developer Console.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.490
And as mentioned
earlier, its actually

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.100
in the very heart of Firebase.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:01.480
So we just hope that those
tools will help you guys

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.490
developing better
products, understanding

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.640
your audience better,
and using them for free.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.390
It's a nice solution.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.140
Then the points that you
have to consider it's,

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.460
again, just a kind of wrap up.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.250
What is important when
it comes to liveops?

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:21.085
It's obviously knowing
what kind of tools

00:25:21.085 --> 00:25:25.670
that you have to run
liveops inside your game.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.150
If you are in the process
of developing a new product

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:31.300
you should certainly make
sure that you have one.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.110
That you have the
possibility to create events

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.480
based on different players
needs on different seasons

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.520
or on different regions.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.910
That you have the possibility
to grant [? or activate ?] items

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:46.510
inside your product
without patching it.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:50.780
That you can know
what offers are

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.956
relevant to different
regions and you

00:25:52.956 --> 00:25:56.020
know what are the best price
points for the people who

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.610
are likely to buy
something in your game.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:03.430
And that you have
also team members

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:07.840
that understand the product and
can work with the community.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:12.874
So if there are like four--
forget about one slide.

00:26:12.874 --> 00:26:14.790
This is actually how to
increase your chances.

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.206
You know that from
time to time we

00:26:16.206 --> 00:26:19.450
are contacting you
about some initiatives

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:22.790
that we are launching, like
Game Fest or summer deals.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.460
Its actually one
of the best ways

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.680
to get into it
because we actually

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.980
check if you guys can adjust
your prices accordingly,

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.180
or according to the theme
of the deal, for instance.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.650
Or if the content
that is in your game

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.650
is relevant to the kind of
[INAUDIBLE] network rating.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:44.150
So it's just another idea on how
to promote your product better.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.540
And as I said,
here's four points

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.380
that are very important
for this presentation.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:54.390
Please invest into liveops
backend tools and team.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:57.460
And it also applies to
the Players Stats API.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.590
Invest in talented
people who do really

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:03.340
care and know how to work
and promote your project.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.080
Invest into business analytics.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.891
This is not a luxury solution,
this is very helpful.

00:27:07.891 --> 00:27:09.640
And through the examples
you've just seen,

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.980
we know that it works.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:16.030
And in your daily work
you also know that works.

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:17.620
And two important
factors, as I said,

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.630
it's also about
human interactions.

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:21.800
Show to your players that
they are important to you.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.800
And don't forget about
those that haven't joined

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.640
the project or those who left.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.330
They might be people, as shown
with other examples, that

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:29.230
might come back.

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:32.580
