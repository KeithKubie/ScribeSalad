00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.410
On August 21, people across the United States
will be able to witness a total solar eclipse.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.610
As the moon passes in front of the sun and
casts a shadow over the Earth. Although total

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.369
solar eclipses occur regularly across the
planet, they very rarely recur in the same

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.180
location. As the path of the moon's shadow,
or umbra, only covers a narrow portion of

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.520
the Earth. Nevertheless, scientists throughout
history have used these celestial events to

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.570
help us understand more about our planet,
the solar system and the universe beyond.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.840
The total eclipse of the moon back in the
16th century was used to make the first measurement

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.329
of the width of the Atlantic ocean. Settlers
from Britain had landed in Virginia in the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.160
United States and the question was, where
were they? It was possible to work out the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.820
latitude because you can work out from the
height of the sun at midday exactly how far

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.030
north of the equator you are. But how far
across the globe they've gone? How far their

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.331
longitude was? How do you do that? Well a
total eclipse of the moon, or any eclipse

00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:08.820
of the moon, is visible over the whole of
the night time side of the Earth. So in London

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.820
they measured the time when the eclipse started
or finished according to our clocks and then

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.330
in Virginia they did likewise with their clocks.
And then they came back and told the people

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.659
in London what time it happened according
to them from which they worked out that it

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.440
was a five hours time difference.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.440
Using this, they could then use their knowledge
of longitude and time to calculate the distance.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.470
But scientists have also used these events
to better understand the dynamics of our solar

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.290
system. In particular Edmond Halley.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.460
Who back calculated the dates of the eclipses
in the past. Because eclipses have been recorded

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.610
throughout history whenever they happened.
And he found that according to his calculations,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.009
the further he went back there was a mismatch
between the date when they were recorded and

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.430
the date when his calculations said they should
have happened. His calculations just assumed

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.651
that the moon was going around the Earth in
a regular trajectory that never changes. And

00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:11.250
he deduced that this regular change throughout
history, going back in history, was because

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.910
the moon's orbit is changing. Technically,
the moon is gradually getting further away

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.380
from the Earth. I think it's at about the
rate that your nails grow. So that is a remarkable

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.090
example of science making use of this natural
phenomenon.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.849
It also means that after a certain point total
solar eclipses will no longer exist as the

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.580
moon will be too far away to completely block
out the sun's light.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.690
But in 1919, a solar eclipse provided the
opportunity to test out a revolutionary new

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.860
theory - the test of general relativity. Where
according to Einstein's theory light is bent

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.690
by gravitational forces and the sun, which
is the biggest source of gravity in the solar

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.910
system, should therefore bend the trajectory
of light rays.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.270
The theory suggested that the sun's gravity
could bend the light of nearby stars around

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.450
its mass. So that stars behind the sun would
be visible to us on Earth. Although Newton's

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.019
established theory also allowed for this,
Einstein's modified theory of gravity suggested

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.480
that it would occur at twice the amount. The
only problems was that the intensity of the

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.310
sun's light, would outshine any starlight
travelling close by, making it impossible

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.410
to test under normal conditions. It was only
in the brief period of a total solar eclipse,

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.709
about seven minutes, that gravitationally
shifted stars might be detected. No pressure

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:32.709
then.

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.379
But British astronomer Arthur Eddington took
up this challenge and sailed to West Africa

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.500
where he could get the best view of the eclipse.
Eddington took photographs of the total eclipse

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.400
of the stars in the background because you
can see the stars during totality. And indeed

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.580
the measurements confirmed Einstein's theory.
And this what he photographed. Including in

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.049
his paper that: "a deflection of light takes
place in the neighbourhood of the sun and

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.519
that it is of the amount demanded by Einstein's
generalised theory of relativity".

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:12.349
And it's all down to some measurements made
in the seven minute window.

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.400
Scientists are still using total solar eclipses
today to learn about how the sun works. In

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.960
particular to study its corona. A very tenuous,
very hot gas, which only about one millionth

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.930
of the intensity in light terms of the glowing
ball of the sun. The shapes and the lines

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.830
of the corona are showing what the nature
of the sun's magnetic field is at that time.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.770
During a total eclipse, when the central sun
is obscured, then this tenuous corona is visible.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.580
And so, on August 21, NASA will be flying
two jets to chase the path of totality across

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.110
North America. Providing seven minutes to
capture infrared measurements of the sun's

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:01.189
corona. As well as taking opportunity to generate
the first ever thermal map of mercury.

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:05.819
And so after centuries of eclipse events,
it seems kind of humbling that scientists

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:21.319
are still using them to inform our understanding
of the solar system.
