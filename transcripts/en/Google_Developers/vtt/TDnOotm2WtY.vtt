[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.942 --> 00:00:07.150
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to "Coffee with a Googler,"

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.077
all the way from rainy
Sydney, Australia.

00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:10.660
But it's great to
be here, because I'm

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.190
meeting with Fontaine Foxworth.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.860
And Fontaine, you may know,
is famous for her time

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.060
with Firebase Analytics
and all the great content

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.250
she put together for that.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.800
But now you're here in Australia
working on something else.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.091
Tell us all about it, Fontaine.

00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:25.660
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Yes, so I not
only moved complete hemisphere,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.780
so moving from California
down here to Sydney,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.540
but also totally changed the
product that I was working on.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.830
I'm now in the Maps and
Geo org, and specifically

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.980
focusing on the Places API.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.720
So mapping technology
is totally new to me,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.580
which has been really
fun to understand

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.900
how we actually build and
create our world digitally.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.990
And then specifically
working on API development

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.770
is also new to me.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.200
I've certainly
consumed a lot of APIs

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.350
while building mobile
apps, but building APIs

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.250
has been really
interesting and really fun.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.112
So I'm working on Places API.

00:00:59.112 --> 00:01:00.820
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
having been building

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.340
apps that are all about
consuming APIs, now you really

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.340
know how to build one
for people to consume.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.340
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Yeah,
yeah, I definitely feel

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.790
like I've sat on the other
side of the table quite

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.140
a bit while consuming APIs.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.640
So I've got a lot
of strong opinions

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.000
about what types of things
we should be offering.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.910
LAURENCE MORONEY: Well, Places
API is already in great shape,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.080
so I'm looking forward
to seeing how it evolves.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.630
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Good, good.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.050
LAURENCE MORONEY: So tell me.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.499
Places API, I'm
familiar with it,

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:24.040
but for the viewers who aren't,
tell us what is it all about.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.940
FONTAINE FOXWORTH:
Yeah, so first of all,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.350
I'll start with the word place.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.210
Google has this
notion of places,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.700
which is basically
how we semantically

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.120
understand the world around us.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.120
So for example,
if you're talking

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.340
about going to the
Google Headquarters,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.770
instead of typing
in 1600 Amphitheater

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.780
Parkway in California,
you can just

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.300
type in Google into Google
Maps, and it will understand

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.562
what you actually mean.

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:46.520
So as humans, we actually
understand the world,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.750
not just in addresses, or
latitudes and longitudes,

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.920
but actually categorizations,
like cafe, or gym,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.100
or trying to put
these human qualifiers

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.094
on top of places in the world.

00:01:59.094 --> 00:02:00.760
And so then if you
look at the word API,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.490
that's really how we are
distributing those places

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.530
to all of our developers
around the world

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.285
so that they can be using
and consuming all that place

00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:09.699
data in their apps.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.960
For an example, if you look
at a local rides app or a taxi

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.000
sharing app, that
type of thing, instead

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.860
of them having to
keep track of all

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.480
of the different
places in the world,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.870
they can just use our API, so
that when their user ends up

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.146
typing in Sydney Opera
House I want to go there,

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.105
their driver actually
knows where to take them.

00:02:28.105 --> 00:02:30.229
LAURENCE MORONEY: Also,
something like Sydney Opera

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:32.710
House, like a navigation system
requires that, most likely

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.210
to be as a latitude
and longitude,

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.600
and then you can decode the
place into the lat/long.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.058
FONTAINE FOXWORTH:
Yeah, so a place

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:40.804
is so much more than maybe
just what a user could input.

00:02:40.804 --> 00:02:42.970
But it actually filters
into all these different use

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.220
cases that our developers
could have, like navigating.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.094
LAURENCE MORONEY: You
know, I didn't actually

00:02:47.094 --> 00:02:49.250
know Google's address
until you just told me.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.680
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Really?

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.920
I feel like
everybody knows that.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's 1600--

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.810
FONTAINE FOXWORTH:
Amphitheater Parkway.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.530
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Amphitheater Parkway, OK.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.880
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Yeah,
I feel like-- yeah.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.950
There's a couple addresses
that if you say them,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:57.690
some people know.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.460
That's, I feel,
like one of them.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.200
LAURENCE MORONEY: But that's
the classic use of a Places API.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.570
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Yeah.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.580
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
that sometimes you

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.121
think in terms of
my house, you don't

00:03:05.121 --> 00:03:06.205
think in terms of address.

00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:07.329
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Exactly.

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.710
Home or work, for
example, I just

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.500
want to type in my
sister's name whenever

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.200
I'm navigating in Google
Maps, instead of actually

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.059
typing in her address, because
that's how I think of it.

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.850
LAURENCE MORONEY: Is
she here in Australia,

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.360
or do you have to
drive across the ocean?

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.046
FONTAINE FOXWORTH:
She's not, just when

00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:21.004
I'm back in California.

00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:22.390
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.025
I'd like to see how it would
navigate you over there.

00:03:24.025 --> 00:03:26.483
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Yeah, maybe
like swim across the Pacific

00:03:26.483 --> 00:03:27.670
Ocean, something like that.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.450
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now I hear you're

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.408
a swimmer, that since
you've come to Australia,

00:03:30.408 --> 00:03:31.408
you've done some diving.

00:03:31.408 --> 00:03:32.491
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: I have.

00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:33.900
I've done some scuba diving.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.640
I went up to the Great Barrier
Reef a couple weekends ago

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.954
and did a live aboard there.

00:03:38.954 --> 00:03:40.120
Did a whole bunch of diving.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.347
It was super fun,
incredible sea life.

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:44.930
LAURENCE MORONEY: So how has the
relocation to Australia been?

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:45.790
FONTAINE FOXWORTH:
It's been really fun.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.650
There's been a
little rain recently,

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.810
which is actually kind of
like California of late.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.002
And yeah, so it's
a very lively city.

00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:54.460
It's nice that
people speak English

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.082
so I can slip in pretty easily--

00:03:56.082 --> 00:03:57.290
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice, nice.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.910
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: --but
a very friendly office

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.670
and great to-- you
know, we're building

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.375
products about the world.

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:04.750
So it's really nice to be able
to see all different parts

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.416
of the world, so you
start to understand

00:04:06.416 --> 00:04:10.030
different cultural nuances as
to how people actually address

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.905
and approach Maps.

00:04:10.905 --> 00:04:12.030
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, cool.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.510
How have you adjusted
to being upside down?

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.070
FONTAINE FOXWORTH:
Yes, it's pretty weird.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.486
I get headaches a lot from
being upside down all the time.

00:04:17.486 --> 00:04:19.233
But I'm getting used to it.

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:20.899
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
back on Places API.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.440
So you were talking
about an example,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.295
if somebody was building
a ride sharing app,

00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:26.830
and you wanted to be picked
up at a specific place

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.110
like the Sydney Opera House.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.140
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Yeah.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.806
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's a great example

00:04:30.806 --> 00:04:33.670
of how the places and
the database of places

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.006
is available to developers.

00:04:35.006 --> 00:04:37.130
But how would somebody get
started with doing that?

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.588
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: So we've
got pretty robust documentation

00:04:39.588 --> 00:04:42.130
on our developers site, where
you can actually first start

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.450
to understand what are
some of the use cases,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.977
how do you actually
use it, and then

00:04:45.977 --> 00:04:48.310
what are some of the services
and the different products

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.240
that are available.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.781
Are you looking for
mapping software?

00:04:50.781 --> 00:04:52.930
Are you looking for
place stuff specifically?

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.780
What types of metadata about
a place are you interested in?

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.610
So a lot of that is
available, including

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.495
code snippets and examples,
all on our developers site.

00:05:01.495 --> 00:05:05.060
And then we've actually got
some good content at I/O,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.070
so you can look at
some of the stuff that

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.510
shows up at I/O this year.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.050
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Cool, and we'll

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.841
have links to the videos
in the description

00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:12.590
below for anybody who
wants to see them.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.900
I'm looking forward
to the sessions.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:14.630
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Yeah, me too.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.370
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now in
order to be able to do this,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.650
like to have this great
big database of places,

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.170
there must be some way of
identifying individual places

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.800
on the planet.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.260
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Yes.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.090
LAURENCE MORONEY: How do
you go about doing that?

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.540
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Exactly.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.570
So we've got something called
a place ID, which is basically

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.150
just an identifier for
a place on the planet,

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.890
for a location on the planet.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.625
And if you think about it,
the word place, I think,

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.000
is really interesting,
because it

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.800
can mean a lot of different
things to different people.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.160
So for some people, if
you're sharing a location,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.020
you really just want to share
a latitude and a longitude.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.060
But somebody else who's maybe
doing a real estate website,

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.560
they might want an address.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.130
And then a photo tagging app
wants more of a semantic place,

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.890
like a university that's nearby.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.290
Or a weather app might
just want a city.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.850
And so you can continue to
think about more developers

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.420
might want more and more
robust or sophisticated data.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.250
So the great thing
about the Places API

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.340
is it's really flexible in
terms of the types of data

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.470
that we can actually
provide to you.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.110
So whether you just need a
latitude and a longitude,

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.160
or an address, all the way to
really rich, robust information

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.320
about all the
details of a place,

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.450
we continue to
serve the developers

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.710
and all their different needs.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.170
LAURENCE MORONEY: That one
identifier, the place ID,

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.000
can effectively be
like a primary key--

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.540
FONTAINE FOXWORTH:
Exactly, that's

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.980
a great characterization.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.340
LAURENCE MORONEY: --to all
of these different data sets.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.840
Cool.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.430
So if I want to
build something that

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.139
spans latitude and longitude,
or addresses, or places,

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:39.680
and those kind of
things, that if I'm

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.270
working in terms
of that identifier,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.740
that's giving me the
key to everything.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.700
FONTAINE FOXWORTH:
That's exactly right.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.491
And the nice thing
about that is, of course

00:06:45.491 --> 00:06:48.450
our world is growing
and changing every day.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.234
So if you consider, like, a cafe
over there that might be there.

00:06:52.234 --> 00:06:54.650
Maybe in a couple of years it
might not be a cafe anymore.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.930
It might be a gym
or a laundromat.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.800
Well, the great thing about
having Google maintain

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.380
the responsibility for
the freshness of the data,

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.470
the developer just really
needs to remember and store

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.430
the place IDs, and then
rely on us in the API

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.252
to actually be returning the
most up to date information.

00:07:13.252 --> 00:07:15.710
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right, so
the address will stay the same,

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.640
and the latitude and
longitude will stay the same.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.290
But what's there.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.070
It's no longer a cafe.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.280
It's a laundromat.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.770
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Exactly.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.220
We are responsible for
keeping that up to date.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.330
LAURENCE MORONEY: Which is
a really valuable service

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.490
if you're building something
that needs to find laundromats,

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.910
for example.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:26.570
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Exactly.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.810
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.695
Or if it's no longer a cafe,
you don't want to direct people

00:07:29.695 --> 00:07:31.070
there who are
looking for coffee.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.195
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Exactly.

00:07:32.195 --> 00:07:34.826
And it helps us really think
in terms of longer horizons.

00:07:34.826 --> 00:07:36.950
So thinking about if your
app is going to be around

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.710
for many years, you want to make
sure you're serving the most up

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.310
to date data.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.710
And relying on Google is
a good way to do that.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:43.650
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now one of the things

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.380
was, that you were
talking about then,

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.180
being able to pick a place.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.480
you had the scenario of
picking the Sydney Opera House.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.830
But what about detecting
if you're at a place?

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.250
How do the APIs work for that?

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.220
FONTAINE FOXWORTH:
So It really depends

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.420
on what your use case is.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.560
So you can totally ask a user,
here are some nearby places,

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.300
which one are you actually at?

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.340
But then in other
use cases, you might

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.590
want to actually
detect where they are

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.000
if you have enough information.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.010
For example, if you
have a ride sharing app,

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.090
and you know where they are, and
their latitude and longitude,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.100
you can interpret
where they are.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.190
Now there is a method called
to get current place currently

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:23.870
in our SDKs, which takes into
effect a lot of Google smarts.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.240
So what I mean by
this is we're not just

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.220
interpreting the
latitude and longitude

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.430
and turning that into
an address necessarily,

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.020
but we might actually
try to factor

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.610
in a lot of other variables,
like opening hours,

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.690
for example.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.500
So an example I like to use
is if there's this two story

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.049
building, and on the bottom
floor there's a restaurant,

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:44.210
and on the top
floor there's a gym,

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.820
they might have very
different popular times.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.172
So if I see a user who is in
a place at maybe 7:00 or 8:00

00:08:51.172 --> 00:08:52.880
AM In the morning,
and I know that people

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.160
tend to be at the gym at
7:00 or 8:00 in the morning,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.260
and the restaurant
isn't even open,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.480
I'm going to tell our
developer that that user is

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.500
at that place.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.890
Whereas if it's in the evening,
maybe around 7:00 PM at night,

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.560
I can infer that
the user is probably

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.657
at that cafe or that restaurant.

00:09:08.657 --> 00:09:10.490
So we're able to bake
in a lot of our smarts

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.440
and remove some of the heavy
lifting from our developers.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.330
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Right, and because it's

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.950
multiple floors in
the same building,

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.840
the latitude and longitude
is going to be the same.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.140
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Exactly.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:18.680
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So we just use that.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.620
There's no intelligence.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.150
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Right.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.400
LAURENCE MORONEY: The address
is going to be the same,

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.597
but by integrating with the
metadata from the Places API,

00:09:25.597 --> 00:09:28.180
like popular times, and opening
hours, and that kind of thing,

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.960
you can get a lot smarter
about the [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.220
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Exactly.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.761
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's really cool.

00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:35.120
So if I'm a developer, and
I want to start building,

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.995
and I want to start
using this kind of stuff,

00:09:36.995 --> 00:09:38.900
what advice would
you give to me?

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.600
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: I think
it's important to first start

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.810
to articulate what it
is you're trying to do.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.240
So certainly there's
lots of cool stuff

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.670
available in our API, but
think about what problem

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.460
you're trying to solve and
clearly articulate that.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.970
And then go and match that with
what we have in our services.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.430
So if you really just
care about addresses,

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.682
and you don't care as much about
the different semantic places,

00:10:01.682 --> 00:10:03.140
then maybe you just
start with some

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.280
of the basics like Geocoding.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.140
Alternatively, if
you need really rich,

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.370
detailed information, then you
might find some of our services

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.820
like the Places Details
Service would meet your needs.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.180
So definitely
articulate clearly what

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.360
it is you're looking
to do, and then explore

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.580
some of our services and
how they meet those needs.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.829
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sounds good.

00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:26.790
So I think I'm going to
get started right away.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.620
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Cool,
there's a lot there.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.270
LAURENCE MORONEY: I've already
built a Places based game,

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.170
but there's just so much
that can be done with Google,

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:31.650
and I'm looking forward to it.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.540
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: I look
forward to playing with it.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.740
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, so
thank you so much, Fontaine.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:36.570
FONTAINE FOXWORTH:
Yeah, thank you.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:37.530
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's
been really, really fun.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.540
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Thanks
for making it down here

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.170
for this lovely
coffee in the rain.

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.100
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah, I
get to come to Australia.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.660
FONTAINE FOXWORTH: Not too bad.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.260
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I'm not complaining.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.634
And my coffee
hasn't spilled out,

00:10:44.634 --> 00:10:47.430
despite the cup
being upside down.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:48.870
So thanks, everybody.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.870
And thanks again to Fontaine
for being a guest on the show.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.580
If you've got any
questions for Fontaine

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.800
or any questions for me,
