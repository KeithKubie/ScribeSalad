00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.616
Now, I want you to help me think about all the abstractions that sit between

00:00:06.616 --> 00:00:11.124
these two extremes, Google Earth application that makes

00:00:11.124 --> 00:00:14.804
magic happen on the screen and the solid-state

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:18.208
physics the electrons and holes enshrine in

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:21.545
your computer system. What are all the abstractions

00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:25.853
that sit between these two extremes? What I want you to do in this quiz is

00:00:25.853 --> 00:00:30.858
to name as many abstractions as you can between these two extremes

00:00:30.858 --> 00:00:35.732
that I am showing you. To make room for you, let me clear

00:00:35.732 --> 00:00:40.750
some space. I put a box now for your answer. To give you

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.210
an idea of what is expected in this question,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.480
as an answer, let me start you off with naming the abstraction

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.400
that sits right on top of the electrons and holes. This is of course your solid

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.840
state physics. And you rain in all the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.920
randomness in the movement of the electrons and holes

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.519
in the solid-state physics, with this abstraction called

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.500
transistor. The transistor is akin to an on-off

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.810
switch. Now, what I want you to do is fill the rest of the box with all

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.530
the other abstractions that sits above transistors,

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.570
all the way up to the application.
