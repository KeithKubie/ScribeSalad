00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:05.772
JASON SILVA: I still
like to believe

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:07.248
that that's actually a myth.

00:00:07.248 --> 00:00:08.039
JAMIE WHEAL: Which?

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.949
JASON SILVA: That people
don't actually die.

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:10.448
[LAUGHS]

00:00:10.448 --> 00:00:12.762
That we actually won't.

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.910
It's something that
happens to other people.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.841
You know what I mean?

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:18.215
JAMIE WHEAL: I think that is
the great mellowing of life,

00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:19.744
isn't it?

00:00:19.744 --> 00:00:21.910
JASON SILVA: So on "Shots
of Awe," one of the things

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.880
that we try to do is
summarise these kind

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.810
of ecstatic realizations.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.840
I stumble upon
something fascinating,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.020
and I want to explain it, and
share it, and kind of hold it

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.860
in stasis.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.390
And this guy right here,
my friend Jamie Wheal,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.260
is the co-founder the
Flow Genome Project.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.350
And Jamie, you did a TEDx talk
called "From Altered States

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.550
to Altered Traits." and it's all
about hacking the flow state.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.390
You are also
creating a flow Dojo,

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.200
which is helping people reverse
engineer their flow states,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.200
and create these ecstatic states
of mind in which people perform

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.380
their best and feel their best.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.740
So tell us about some of
these tools and techniques

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.400
that you're implementing in the
flow Dojo with Steven Kotler.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.790
What are you guys doing?

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.319
JAMIE WHEAL: Sure, well,
what we're teeing up

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.520
is the world's first
research and training

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.645
facility dedicated to
ultimate human performance,

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:13.510
or flow states.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.610
And the premise is
what would happen

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.230
if we took the hands-on science
museum like the Exploratorium

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.420
here in San Francisco, with all
the sort of kinetic exhibits

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.090
the kids get to monkey with
and learn about bigger forces,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.120
and apply it to,
basically, kinetics--

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.980
our bodies-- and
sort of this notion

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.680
that as we train our bodies
and brains to work really well

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.760
together, then our
waking cells get

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.360
to experience more accurate
information processing, greater

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.880
resourcefulness and
emotional resilience,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.880
and generally amplify pattern
recognition, perspective

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.270
holding, and, therefore, more
increasingly sophisticated

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.690
and accurate decision making.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.320
JASON SILVA: Flow states--
you feel your best

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.403
and you perform your best.

00:01:57.403 --> 00:02:00.570
Elite athletes when they're in
the zone, jazz musicians when

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.870
they just literally go crazy
and they're just improvising,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.030
channeling almost.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.940
Now, these states
are associated with

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.199
these brief,
transitory instances

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.330
that we get to peek at Nirvana.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.280
But what you're saying is
that now, through advances

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.860
in technology,
psychology, neurobiology,

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.440
and pharmacology--
drugs, right-- we now

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.260
have the capacity to back-door
access these flow states,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.770
so that they're not haphazard,
fleeting, ephemeral states,

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.770
bu that they become part
of the human experience

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.674
on a daily basis.

00:02:35.674 --> 00:02:36.840
JAMIE WHEAL: Yeah, for sure.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.506
And so that's the
reverse engineer part.

00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:39.180
JASON SILVA: OK

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.480
JAMIE WHEAL: So in
the past, how we

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.720
would experience it would
be I seeking a flow state.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.974
I might be lucky, have one
by dumb luck or design.

00:02:47.974 --> 00:02:49.140
But either way, I'd have it.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.000
And it would come and go.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.300
And then I'd come back to me.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.640
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.180
JAMIE WHEAL: Right.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.205
JASON SILVA: Easier than ever
to get high, as hard as it's

00:02:54.205 --> 00:02:55.413
always been to stay that way.

00:02:55.413 --> 00:02:58.800
JAMIE WHEAL: Yeah,
the perennial ennui.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.330
Curses, back here again.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.550
JASON SILVA: Brief dopamine
hit, back here again.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.190
I've orgasmed and now it's over.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.190
JAMIE WHEAL: What a moment
of clarity and regret

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.880
that is for so many.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.502
JASON SILVA: Clarity,
regret and despair.

00:03:09.502 --> 00:03:11.460
JAMIE WHEAL: But like
the evolutionary impulses

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.840
cease to intoxicate me and
hijack my motor skills.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.940
JASON SILVA: I cannot
stabilize ecstasy.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.210
The goosebumps are gone
as quickly as they can.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.027
But you're talking
about literally

00:03:24.027 --> 00:03:25.860
creating the conditions
where you could just

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.320
keep surfing that wave.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.460
Aren't we acting
almost Promethean?

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.580
I mean your own work
with Steven Kotler talks

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.670
about stealing fire.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.220
Like, are human beings prepared?

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.870
Should they be allowed to
know the secret songs that

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.810
orchestrate the universe
of the neurochemistry

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.660
of lived experience?

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.580
Do we get to tweak and
upgrade subjectivity?

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.369
Because that's what you're
talking about, right?

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:52.410
JAMIE WHEAL: Tweaking and
upgrading subjectivity,

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.600
yeah, I would say, and
add a multi perspectival

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.100
in front of that
subjectivity, and I

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.490
think you're off to the races.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.990
JASON SILVA: And
so how do we do it?

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.802
Flow Dojo-- you design
spaces that design us back.

00:04:02.802 --> 00:04:04.510
I mean, we're talking
ontological design.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.720
We're talking harnessing
feedback loops to change

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.270
behavior and change patterns.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.478
JAMIE WHEAL: Yeah, I mean,
basically just think of it

00:04:10.478 --> 00:04:13.090
sort of the training center
for creating, like, Iron Man.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.560
Like imagine if a future
sort of Tony Stark was like,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.269
OK, I'm going to put together
the best technologies

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.450
to hyper train or
hyper condition

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.419
my physical capacities,
cognitive skills,

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:24.210
visionary tracking.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.626
You just take
physical fitness out

00:04:25.626 --> 00:04:28.520
of the kind of beach muscles,
cosmetic and aesthetic,

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.420
and you turn it into
athletic and neurokinetic.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.974
So you've just completely just
rebooted physical culture.

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:36.140
And actually, is more of a
throwback to 19th century

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.791
Germany and the
Gymnasium effect, which

00:04:37.791 --> 00:04:39.790
is a throwback to Plato
and the original Academy

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.570
and Pythagoras, and
that whole crew.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.361
So there's this beautiful
Western tradition

00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:46.710
of radically embodied cognition,
philosophy, celebration,

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.190
the symposium,
drinking together,

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.510
all of it-- celebration,
wine, women, and song.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.330
It became the Aquarian, sex,
drugs, and rock and roll.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.680
And so we go along.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.682
And here we are.

00:04:56.682 --> 00:04:57.890
JASON SILVA: And so we go on.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.450
We may contribute a
verse and all that jazz.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.200
JAMIE WHEAL: Sure.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.230
JASON SILVA: Yes, this
gets me really excited.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.980
Now one of the things he
talked about in your TEDx talk

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.540
was how technology
is allowing us

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.370
to pump dual awareness
through satellite dishes

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.049
into iPhones, beaming brains.

00:05:13.049 --> 00:05:14.590
And you talked about
that trajectory.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.460
You talked about
Bob Dylan playing

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.360
a small, little concert,
and then plugging

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.250
in his Stratocaster
and beaming electrified

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.990
musical expression
into 100,000 minds.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.600
I'm paraphrasing, but talk
about the role of technology

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.350
in allowing us to literally
radically extend these insights

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.050
and transformations, to
mediate and tweet consciousness

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.080
with tools and technologies.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.538
JAMIE WHEAL: Well, I think I
think you pretty well said it.

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:40.820
I mean, it's that sense
that we are able to shape

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.662
and prime our environments and
our psychosomatic experiences.

00:05:45.662 --> 00:05:46.370
JASON SILVA: Yes.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.994
JAMIE WHEAL: So with
music-- with deep,

00:05:47.994 --> 00:05:50.700
thumping bass and incredibly
high image amplified,

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.800
so different directional
sound, projection mapping

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.809
of incredible high definition,
resolution and ridiculous--

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:01.850
especially when synchronized
with music and beat.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.080
You start dislocating all of
our geospatial or proprioceptive

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.160
reference points.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.430
So I'm not even sure
what I'm looking at.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.630
Where did the horizon line go?

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.440
What's happening here?

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.940
JASON SILVA: And it doesn't
even matter, because you're just

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.710
rolling with bliss.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.620
JAMIE WHEAL: Well, those things,
and then you do the syncopation

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.890
and the different
beats per minute, which

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.330
also entrain bodily features.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.250
It's that old-- it
wasn't Johannes Kepler.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.810
It was one of those early
watch makers who, remember,

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.360
discovered that
the pendulums all

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.560
would synchronize in his
clock shop, his watch shop.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.530
And what he realized is
they all synchronized

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.550
to the rate of the
largest pendulum.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.560
So there's this coherence
effect around waveforms.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.020
JASON SILVA: OK, and
we're harnessing that.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.090
We're exploiting that for our
own gain, for our own bliss.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.210
JAMIE WHEAL: Yeah.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.560
JASON SILVA: I like that.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.560
I mean, we've always used
tools and technologies

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.280
to create bliss.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.320
I mean, we use language
to write poetry.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.050
We use musical instruments
to create melodies

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.520
that act as wallpapers
for our minds,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.660
to use your term
from last night.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.670
But what new forms of human
beauty and human subjectivity

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.280
will become possible as
we create a new generation

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.450
of mind-melding technologies?

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.360
New drugs-- I mean, now we're
seeing a renaissance in America

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.440
with the use of psychedelics
being more widely

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.000
acceptable as psychotherapeutic
tools for people with PTSD.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.620
But the article in
"The New Yorker,"

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.870
written by Michael Pollan,
talked about the idea

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.590
of making well people better.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.590
So we can actually create a
new generation of smart drugs

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.120
and mind-altering chemicals,
both internal ones

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.410
and external ones that we can
use to make well people better.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.440
That it's not just about
fixing an affliction,

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.745
but it's about expanding what
it means to be, and perceive,

00:07:41.745 --> 00:07:42.840
and be human.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.900
You know, I keep coming
back to this idea

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.180
that human beings-- you
know, we're getting better.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.940
We're looking up
the skirt of Nature,

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.310
looking under the hood
of our own brains.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.990
And we're getting
increasingly better

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.744
at mapping these ecstatic
states, these flow states.

00:08:03.744 --> 00:08:05.285
And we're getting
increasingly better

00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:09.410
at mediating these
ecstatic states, right?

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:14.110
So I want you to talk
to me about the poetry

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.050
of these ecstatic states,
in the sense that, like,

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.990
of course we want
to mediate ecstasy,

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.200
because ecstasy is the most
beautiful thing in the world.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.450
It's standing at the
playa of Burning Man,

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.750
or going into an iMax
theater and listening

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.620
to some beautiful Hans Zimmer
score that moves you to tears,

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.330
or the Grateful Dead concert you
were talking about yesterday.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:33.659
[LAUGHS]

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:34.950
Remember when you were
talking about that,

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.491
the band is going
to play with Phish?

00:08:36.491 --> 00:08:39.760
Talk to me about that
place, why we go there,

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.690
and why it's good
to want to go there,

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:46.880
the nobility of what
Flow Genome is doing.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.610
JAMIE WHEAL: Well,
I mean, I would

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.460
say what we are hoping to do
is to start a conversation,

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.560
and build a community
of people of like minds

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.600
that are passionate as
well about the upper limits

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.020
of human possibility.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.630
JASON SILVA: The upper limits
of human possibility-- I mean,

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.620
one of the things that you guys
are going to talk about, you

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.078
and Steven Kotler
in your new book,

00:09:06.078 --> 00:09:07.694
is the altered states economy.

00:09:07.694 --> 00:09:08.610
JAMIE WHEAL: For sure.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.640
JASON SILVA: OK, the fact
that people spend upwards

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.970
of billions, trillions
of dollars to alter

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.730
their consciousness,
to feel good, $20,

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.260
gimme an Indiana
Jones thrill ride.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.710
Here's $100.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.890
Send me to a dream within
a dream in "Inception."

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.550
Here is $100.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.590
Take me to "The
Never-Ending Story."

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:32.830
There's something we're willing
to pay for and labor for.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.760
And so you're saying we barely
have glimpsed what's possible.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.300
You're probing the contours
of the upper limits

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.010
of human experience.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.670
I just want you to tell
me about that dance.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.030
I love what you guys are doing.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.100
I want to turn my
colander into a chalice.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.660
I want to mediate my ecstasy.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.530
I want-- I want everybody to
be able to experience that.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:55.910
So what we need to do?

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:56.630
What's missing?

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.530
Where are we on that
trajectory right now?

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:03.650
JAMIE WHEAL: Yeah, I think we're
right there with all the parts

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:04.540
and puzzle pieces.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.740
And as far as
literally and reliably

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:13.730
being able to put people into
as expansive and interesting

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:18.047
states of awareness as they can
manage, and at the same time,

00:10:18.047 --> 00:10:19.130
that's not the fail point.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.870
The fail point is
what it's always been,

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.590
which is you human discipline.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.037
And so we get distracted.

00:10:25.037 --> 00:10:26.370
And we get knocked off the path.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.080
And we get bored.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:27.996
And we get frustrated.

00:10:27.996 --> 00:10:30.550
And we dabble, and we hack,
and we obsess, and we crash.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.770
And that notion of we think
it should be endless peak

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:37.049
moments instead of the
plateaus of mastery practice

00:10:37.049 --> 00:10:37.840
until the next one.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.180
And you'll get an
integration, which often

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.610
happens in that theta state.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.530
And in fact, theta,
depending on who's

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.360
research you're
following, gamma bursts,

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.430
those integrative Gestalt
ahas, the Eurekas,

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.660
can only occur in a
substrate of theta waves.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.240
Right, so that's
one of the things.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.406
JASON SILVA: Say that again.

00:10:54.406 --> 00:10:56.680
Eureka moments can only what?

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.140
JAMIE WHEAL: So the
burst of gamma waves,

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:07.370
of neurologic activity, is
correlated with the Gestalt

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:08.520
integrative experience.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.760
JASON SILVA: Seeing
the whole pattern.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.780
JAMIE WHEAL: The
Eureka aha, I got it.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.450
JASON SILVA: Aerial view,
big picture, Gestalt.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:12.980
JAMIE WHEAL: Shazam.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:13.813
JASON SILVA: Shazam.

00:11:13.813 --> 00:11:16.070
JAMIE WHEAL: Right,
and that occurs only

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.169
on a substrate of
theta wave activity.

00:11:18.169 --> 00:11:20.460
So that's where that particular
bolt of lightning goes.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.270
So putting yourself into
a theta state on purpose

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.440
through respiratory regulation,
through any kind of neuro bio

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.490
feedback, through cardiac
controls and practices,

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:34.220
through any of those components,
you're then putting yourself--

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:38.880
you're like Ben Franklin
flying the kite with the key

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.710
in a storm.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.720
You're right there
waiting for it to hit.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.980
JASON SILVA: How often do
you get it in your own life?

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.710
JAMIE WHEAL: Goodness
gracious, I mean,

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:55.780
I feel like I am blessed with
getting to experience it as

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.634
often as I pay attention to it.

00:11:59.634 --> 00:12:00.300
JASON SILVA: OK.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.200
JAMIE WHEAL: Which varies.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.430
JASON SILVA: That requires
a kind of priming, too.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.592
You've got to be there.

00:12:04.592 --> 00:12:05.550
You've got to be there.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.490
You got to be present.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.390
You've got to have the
cognitive resources to witness

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:10.917
and trigger those states.

00:12:10.917 --> 00:12:12.500
JAMIE WHEAL: I mean,
yeah, and I think

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.495
ultimately, I think
my experience of it--

00:12:14.495 --> 00:12:16.120
and maybe this is
just me, maybe I just

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.665
had this coming
in spades-- but I

00:12:17.665 --> 00:12:20.650
have found that the
more time you spend

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.360
in those kind of effortless
effort conditions, the more

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.340
important is to have
your house in order.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.610
So you sort of-- and
I don't-- I mean,

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:32.220
I have no presumptions whether
this is a universal truth

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.330
or just my experience.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:38.120
But it seems like there's a
price for experiencing it.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.070
And the price for
experiencing it

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.940
is acting on the information,
acting on the goodness, truth,

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.670
and beauty that you
apprehend while there,

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.300
and then trying to
live up your damnedest

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.490
to that example and inspiration
when we're back here.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.170
And if you skip that step,
it's on your mortal soul

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.210
the next time you go
back to the wishing well.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.760
[LAUGHS]
