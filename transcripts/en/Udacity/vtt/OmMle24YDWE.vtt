00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.910
Finding long lost relatives can be really tricky, especially if you don't

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.720
have a good place to start. But it's a lot easier if you

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.500
have the help from someone like a genetic genealogist. And today we're lucky

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.990
enough to be joined remotely with CeCe Moore, a genetic genealogist. Hi CeCe.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.920
&gt;&gt; Hi Matt, how are you?

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.140
&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.900
&gt;&gt; you know we're pretty excited to be learning all about this

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.520
ancestry and human evolution and we're really curious at this point, you know,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.700
what is it that a Genetic Genealogist does?

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.220
&gt;&gt; A Genetic Genealogist uses DNA testing in conjunction with

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.750
traditional genealogy research in order to learn more about our roots.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.090
&gt;&gt; How far out do you go in a family structure as a

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.030
Genetic Genealogist? Are you interested in, you

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.040
know, up to grandparents and maybe second

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.250
cousins, or do you, do you, do you build out farther than that? Do

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.620
you connect whole families? Kind of just give us some idea of how far

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.250
out you go.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.830
&gt;&gt; Well, we're interested in our family trees as

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.350
far back as we can go. So with Y-DNA

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.660
testing, which has been used in genetic genealogy much

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.980
longer than autosomal DNA tests like 23 and Me.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.560
We're looking way back, we could be looking back

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.750
into the 1400's even, because as you know, the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.410
Y chromosome changes very slowly therefore a father and

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.410
son will probably have an identical Y chromosome, and

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.370
maybe a grandparent and a great grandparent, a

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.700
second great grandfather on that direct paternal line. So

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.310
we've used these surname studies to go many, many

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.380
generations back, centuries back. With Autosomal DNA we're not

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.810
looking quite so far back, because of the recombination.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.580
However, when we first started using Autosomal DNA for

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.800
genetic genealogy, we were told that it was only

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.870
going to work maybe five generations, six generations back.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.840
And especially with our adoption DNA research,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.450
we have proven that it works much further

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.240
back. We're able to identify ancestral couples

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.410
a couple centuries ago, actually in these trees.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.030
And the way we do that is for instance, if an adoptee knows nothing about their

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.120
biological heritage we would take all of their family trees of their DNA matches

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.342
so, everyone who's willing to share at 23 and

00:02:10.342 --> 00:02:13.430
Me or family tree DNA, of ancestry DNA. We would

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.310
start comparing those trees looking for commonalities and intersections among

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.210
their matches trees, since they don't know anything about their

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.740
family tree, and if we see a certain ancestry

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.820
tree couple over and over and over and over, we

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.490
can be pretty sure that, that's probably one of their

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.220
ancestors as well. And if not their ancestor, certainly in

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.090
an ancestral line, one of their branches of

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.930
their family tree would have that ancestral line in

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.880
it. And we've used couples very far back, like

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.880
late 1600's, 1700's and been able to build down

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.040
to the present time. That takes a lot of

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.840
work, believe me, and we wouldn't just do it

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.030
with one couple. We would do it with various

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.060
couples, build their descendants down to the present and

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.950
try to see where there's intersections between the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.140
descendants from those ancestral couples and if we can

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.430
do that, which we sometimes can, we can

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.590
sometimes solve these adoption search cases without a close

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.390
relative match. If we get second cousin or

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.310
closer, we can almost always solve it. if we're

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.750
only working with third cousins, fourth cousins, fifth

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.110
cousins, and more distant, it takes a lot more

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.530
work, but it has been done.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.360
&gt;&gt; Great, CeCe, it's been a pleasure chatting with you. I hope

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.120
you'll join us again, in maybe the discussion forums for our course.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.160
&gt;&gt; That would be great, I'd love to.
