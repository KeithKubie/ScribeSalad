 shot right over there

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:15.548 align:start position:0%
  and Roast Battle's getting
  shot right over here.

00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:16.849
- Already looks like Jake Cutler

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:18.451
 yelling at one of his linemen.

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:20.586 size:84% position:42%
  (audience laughs)

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.521
 - It's gonna be a bloodbath.

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:26.092 size:84% position:42%
  - The only the reason why
  I feel bad beating you

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:28.628 align:start position:0%
 cause I'm a Southern white
 male and it frankly is cliche.

 - You've got the Sklar
 Brothers, we love those guys.

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.504 align:start size:88% position:13%
We call them everybody's
favorite nobodys.

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:39.872
Because they're known
in the comedy community

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:41.174 size:84% position:42%
  but nowhere else.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:42.675 size:84% position:42%

  were born, was it

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:45.445 size:84% position:42%
  vaginal, cesarean, or you
  just eat your way out?

 he's a funny dude from Chicago

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:55.922 align:start position:0%
  and it's good to have
  that kind of flavor here,

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:56.756
 a local guy.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:57.723
 (gun shoots)

00:00:57.756 --> 00:00:59.025
- I'm just happy to be roasting

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:00.460

 lot of shit personal

  of personal shit.

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:08.101 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I know it's tough
being a woman in comedy.

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:09.202 align:start size:88% position:13%
 You have to go through
 a lot of stuff.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.471 size:84% position:42%
  Luckily, you never had to
  worry about being raped

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:14.073
by Bill Cosby cause they
can't deep fry a rufi.

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:15.608
(audience gasps)

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.210 size:88% position:44%
  - Deep fried rufi?

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:20.146
 - Depp fried rufi joke, I
 thought that was hysterical.

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:21.280 size:88% position:44%

- John likes to compare
himself to George Carlin

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:28.488 align:start size:88% position:13%
because of his
storytelling abilities.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:31.090 align:start position:0%
I like to compare him to Carlin
because of his alcoholism

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:33.126 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and because I wish
 he were fucking dead.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.262 size:88% position:44%
  (audience screams)

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:37.730 align:start size:88% position:13%

 Colin to win just so

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:40.032

(laughs)

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.703
 - You gotta really be
 able to take a joke

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:45.004
 to live in this town.

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:48.170

Battle Chicago tonight.
