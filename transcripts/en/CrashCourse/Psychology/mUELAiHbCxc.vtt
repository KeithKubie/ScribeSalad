00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.360
What do you see in this image?

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.300
A scary face?

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.700
A couple of squirrels fighting?

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.420
Or this one?

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.320
A squashed frog?

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.180
Or tumbling poodles?

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.140
A bleeding bat?

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.880
Hermann Rorschach wants to know.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.620
Eh, he wanted to know–he's dead now

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.500
He believed that your answers, what you saw in the ink, said something about your personality.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.360
Rorschach was a Swiss psychoanalyst who, in his youth, was fascinated

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.080
by the childhood game of making pictures out of inkblots called klecksography

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.260
As an adult, Rorschach was intrigued with Carl Jung's use of word association

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.460
in attempts to access patients' unconscious minds.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.840
Jung would ask patients to say the first thing that came to mind

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.840
when they saw words like

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.380
"dead"

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.980
or "window"

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.740
or "abuse"

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.660
and Rorschach thought,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.100
"Why not do the same thing with amorphous blobs?"

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.320
So he'd show a patient a series of ink blots and record what they saw

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.280
to determine how people "projected" their personal associations onto random shapes.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.160
Assuming there are important differences between those who saw

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.460
dancing bunnies versus those who saw severed, screaming heads,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.120
he drew conclusions about a patient's personality.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.640
And yeah, this was controversial.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.440
Some clinicians still do think that Rorschach test can be a helpful diagnostic tool

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.760
when used correctly and cautiously.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.780
But others remain critical of the test, calling them unscientific and unreliable.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.940
It's even been called "the Dracula of psychological tests"

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.620
because no one has been able to drive a stake through its heart yet.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.180
So I guess this is that part when I apologize for the set design.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.560
Sorry.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.420
But love it or hate it, the Rorschach test is one of the many methods

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.360
psychologists have used in an ongoing quest to understand personality.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.300
And of all of the concepts we cover in this course, personality is one of the most complex,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.020
and one of the most contested.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.140
This is where we bring in the household names.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.120
Not just Rorschach, but Freud, and Jung, 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.580
as well as other influential thinkers like Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.480
It's where some of the most familiar concepts in early psychology come into play,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.520
ones that people with even passing knowledge of the field have heard of:

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.160
the ego, the Oedipus complex, penis envy, inferiority complexes, even the idea of self-help itself.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.880
Whether you've heard of these as hard facts or simply as historical curiosities,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.960
these notions represent the starting points for some of the biggest and most compelling questions in the field.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.180
But they all come back to the same question:

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.580
What makes us who we are?

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.580
♪ [Crash Course intro] ♪

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.640
We always gotta start out with defining things. Personality. You think you know what that means,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.340
but we're gonna define it as your distinctive and enduring characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.460
And psychologists typically study personality in two broad ways:

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.080
1. By trying to understand differences in specific characteristics,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.720
like introvertedness versus extrovertedness.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.500
And 2. By looking at how all the various parts of each person mesh together as a whole.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.920
Basically, what are our characteristics and how do they combine to make me me and you you?

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.980
And guess what?

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.160
As you might expect, there are a number of competing perspectives on personality theory.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.660
4 to be exact.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.460
The first, and one of the most influential has been the psychoanalytic perspective,

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.340
first championed by our coke-loving, cigar-chewing friend, Sigmund Freud.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.260
It was through his clinical observation of patients that

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.280
Freud came to theorize the existence of the unconscious.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.140
For Freud, the unconscious represented a vast reservoir

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.040
of often unacceptable and frequently hard-to-tolerate thoughts, feelings, desires, and memories.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.580
Usually involving a lots of weird sex stuff.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.500
You gotta point out, by the way,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.900
that the Freudian unconscious is a different thing 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.460
from the contemporary idea of non-conscious information processing

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.220
when we're, like, processing information that we don't know we're processing.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.360
Freud's thing is, you know, a lot more titillating,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.120
but, the non-conscious is like empirically validated a real thing that we study now.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.300
Anyway, Freud believed that our personalities are largely shaped by the enduring conflict

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.280
between our impulses to do whatever we feel like, and our restraint to control those urges

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.740
between our pleasure-seeking aggressive urges and our inner social control over them.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.800
He theorized our minds as being divided into three interacting parts—

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.200
the id, the ego, and the superego—

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.900
that provide the battleground for this internal conflict that shaped our personalities.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.120
You can think of the classic Freudian mind like this iceberg.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.800
It's mostly hidden, and that big underwater chunk is your id:

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.540
your unconscious, primitive, and instinctive self.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.160
Freud thought the id was all about sex and agression,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.820
the so-called pleasure principle of immediate gratification.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.820
To him, infants were all id.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.820
That's in part why babies freak out when they don't get a snack like "Right now!",

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.080
instead of just taking a deep breath for a second.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.040
For that matter, a lot of the off-the-wall celebrities and dictators are big ids.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.360
The id's like a honey badger—they don't care.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.780
Eventually kids develop the ego part of their personality,

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.680
that largely conscious component that's charged with dealing with reality.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.320
The ego works on getting the id what it wants in a reasonable, timely, and realistic way

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.600
without, you know, getting arrested or beaten up.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.300
The final aspect to form in Freud's personality trifecta is the superego,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.520
the Jiminy Cricket of voice of our conscience that represents not just the real, but also the ideal.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.240
As you can imagine, the superego and the id don't much like each other,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.180
and it's up the the Referee Ego to sort everything out.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.360
And it's hard to be the ego.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.760
Freud believed that anxiety comes in part from the ego getting all stressed out about losing control

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.240
over the id and superego.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.860
So he proposed that our egos use a series of indirect and unconscious defense mechanisms

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.380
to protect themselves from this fear.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.440
And each person's particular configuration of defense mechanisms, in turn,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.980
makes up part of what we're referring to here as personality.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.420
You might already have heard of repression,

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.160
the defense that's thought to work by banishing any thoughts, feelings, or memories

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.040
that cause anxiety to the unconscious.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.340
And repression, Freud thought, allows our many other defense mechanisms to do their work.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.100
Regression, for example, involves a retreat to a more infantile psychosexual stage,

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.020
like, when a second-grader sucks their thumb when they're nervous.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.020
Reaction formation is kinda like passive-aggression.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.400
It involves flipping unacceptable impulses like desire to punch someone in the face

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.920
with their opposites, like offering them cookies with a fake smile.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.560
Projection is when you disguise your own impulses by calling them out in other people,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.760
and rationalization is just what it sounds like, when we offer explanations and excuses for our behaviors

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.920
instead of getting to the real unconscious reasons.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.620
Like, "Yeah, well, I ate six hot pockets at the party just 'cause I was being social!"

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.480
Displacement is the typical you got yelled at by your boss, and then came home and yelled at your roommate.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.880
It's when you shift your impulses toward a less threatening victim.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.960
And then there's denial,

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.540
which is when you refuse to believe or sometimes even perceive some kind of painful reality.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.860
Like, "No, my boyfriend isn't cheating on me."

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.380
and "I'm not gonna fail that class,"

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.040
and "These pants TOTALLY STILL FIT!"

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.980
Our defense mechanisms, as theorized by Freud, are pretty tied in with our personalities.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.440
Someone who engages in a lot of denial and not as much projection would probably look and act 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.100
a lot differently from someone who chronically does the reverse.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.100
Still, Freud was convince our personalities form in our first few years as we pass

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.620
through a series of five psychosexual stages,

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.140
essentially during which the id seeks to get its rocks off in different pleasure-sensitive areas.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.780
Infants start out in the oral stage because they get pleasure from eating.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.920
From there, a child enters the anal stage, focused on peeing and pooping;

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.540
then on to the phallic stage, as they discover their boy and girl bits.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.040
It was during this stage that Freud believed the infamous Oedipus complex reared up,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.000
characterized by a boy experiencing a form of sexual desire toward his mother

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.520
and a parallel jealousy or hatred of his father.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.540
Freud called from about age 6 to puberty the latency stage, marked by dormant sexual feelings

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.160
which eventually evolved into the fifth and final, adult, genital stage of mature sexual interests.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.620
Now, he believed if certain conflicts weren't resolved in any of these given stages,

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.920
a person could develop a fixation, or a lingering focus on a younger stage.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.720
Like if a baby was overfed or neglected and underfed, they might be fixate in the oral stage;

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.880
an orally fixated adult might seek oral gratification through excessive eating or chain smoking

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.300
and may develop issues with dependency or aggression.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.960
Now of course, not everyone was on board with Freud's model of personality development.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.240
Many of his ideas were controversial and remain so to this day;

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.360
even most modern psychoanalysts now dispute the whole Oedipal thing.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.700
In fact, while many pioneering psychoanalysts built on Freud's theories -- these are so-called neo-Freudians --

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:55.060
many disagree with lots of his ideas, and instead either emphasize the role of the conscious mind

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.380
or focus on non-sexual motivations.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.300
Take Karen Horney, for instance,

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.700
a German-born psychoanalyst credited with founding feminist psychology.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.620
She wasn't down with the idea that our personalities are primarily shaped by sex and aggression.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.620
She especially rejected the notion of penis envy,

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.560
which she thought was more than a little insulting to women.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.680
She actually proposed that womb envy may occur as much in men who were envious they can't give birth.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.720
She encouraged patients to take charge of their own mental health and engage in self-help and analysis,

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.600
believing people were often able to sorta be their own therapists.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.240
We mentioned Carl Jung, the famous Swiss psychoanalyst.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:33.380
Jung was a friend and disciple of Freud, but eventually, theoretical differences took them in different directions.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.380
He agreed that the unconscious was a powerful force,

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:40.500
but he believed it was more than just a holding cell for repressed sexual thoughts and feelings and memories.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.500
Jung believed sexual drive was only part of the equation,

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.980
and that we're also driven by a need to achieve a full knowledge of self.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.160
He also suggested that we have a collective unconscious,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.500
a group of shared images or archetypes that are universal to all humans,

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.660
and this was why different cultures share similar myths and imagery.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.800
Vienna-born Alfred Adler was another former collaborator of Freud who struck out on his own.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.020
Adler agreed with Freud that childhood was important,

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.520
but he emphasized ongoing social tensions, not sexual ones, as most crucial to the formation of personality.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.500
He coined the term "inferiority complex" 

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.720
and believed that much of our adult behavior is linked to childhood struggles with feeling inferior.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.900
In the end, not all of their their theories have endured,

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.920
but Freud and his contemporaries were key to the evolution of psychoanalytic theory

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.520
because they explored ways in which our mental life and personality

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.380
may be submerged beneath the veil of consciousness.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.660
But the psychoanalytical approach

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.580
is only one perspective on what makes us who we are.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.580
Rather than focuseing on how messed up we can be,

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:39.540
humanistic theorists focus on the basic goodness of people and how they strive to achieve their full potential.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.540
In other words, they believe in the potential for personal growth.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.380
Abraham Maslow is one of these guys;

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.920
he believed we're motivated by that pyramid-shaped hierarchy of needs

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.040
and that once basic needs are met, like food and shelter and whatnot, we're able to achieve higher goals.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.780
Maslow believed the top two rungs of that pyramid are where the real growth in personality takes place.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.400
First, with self-actualization, or the need to live up to our full, unique potential,

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:07.800
and then with self-transcendence, or finding meaning and purpose and identity beyond ourselves.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.800
Rather than study only troubled patients,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.160
Maslow look at healthy, creative types

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.800
with whom he discovered this common thread of self-actualization.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.700
Bolstered by a secure sense of self,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.620
these people were more sure of themselves, more compassionate, caring, driven,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.240
and uneasy around cruelty and pettiness.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.460
American psychologist, Carl Rogers, was another pioneer of humanistic theory,

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.420
who proposed a person-centered perspective on personality.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.560
Like Maslow, Rogers believed we're all basically good eggs

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.740
so long as we're nurtured in a growth-promoting environment that he thought required three conditions.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.500
The first is genuineness.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.100
Just the idea that parents and teachers should be transparent and open with their feelings.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.260
Then, there's acceptance; when folks are accepting,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.520
people around them won't be afraid to be themselves or make mistakes.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.640
And the third requirement, according to Rogers,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.040
is empathy, or the ability to share others' feelings and reflect their meanings.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.680
Rogers thought of these traits as the nutrients required to make a personality grow into a healthy self-concept,

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.060
that mix of thoughts and feelings that answer the fundamental question, who am I?

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:11.240
So, psychoanalytic and humanistic theories of personality were and are incredibly influential,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.000
even if one was a little sorted, and the other, a little sunshine and rainbows.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.280
But they didn't always lend themselves to clear measurement,

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.300
and as empirical standards began to take hold in the mid-20th century, this became a major concern.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.320
How did we deal with that? Well, tune in next week when we explore some of the newer ways 

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.480
of looking at personality and how we started measuring it.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.040
Today, you learned about personality theory and two of its early schools of thought:

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:39.400
the psychoanalytic theory, including Freud's three-part model of the mind and defense mechanisms,

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.000
along with the neo-Freudians.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.600
You also learned about the humanistic theory,

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.480
including Maslow's model of self-actualization and Roger's person-centered perspective.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.480
