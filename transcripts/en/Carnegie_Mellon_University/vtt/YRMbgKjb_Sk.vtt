00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:13.016
&gt;&gt; It was just last year that
we reached 100,000 living alumni

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.766
of the university in
more than 100 countries.

00:00:17.386 --> 00:00:22.606
With this commencement ceremony,
with you graduating today,

00:00:23.286 --> 00:00:29.666
we begin CMU's march toward
200,000 living alumni.

00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:32.556
When I called Earl Lewis

00:00:32.556 --> 00:00:37.146
to be our commencement speaker
this year several months ago he

00:00:37.146 --> 00:00:38.796
asked me what should
he talk about.

00:00:39.796 --> 00:00:40.746
I said he can talk

00:00:40.746 --> 00:00:42.666
about whatever he
chooses to talk about.

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.776
We never compared notes.

00:00:45.256 --> 00:00:48.196
I had no idea until he started
to speak what he was going

00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:55.106
to talk about, and he had no
idea what I'm going to say now.

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:56.376
It's all good.

00:00:58.846 --> 00:01:02.786
It turns out that we're
approaching the same theme

00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.386
from very different angles.

00:01:04.386 --> 00:01:09.016
Unbeknownst to each other we
are focusing on a similar theme.

00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:16.726
Early this year a group of CMU
faculty members and I travelled

00:01:16.726 --> 00:01:21.976
to Switzerland to attend the
World Economic Forum in Davos.

00:01:22.626 --> 00:01:27.746
For this meeting which attracts
world leaders, technologists,

00:01:28.396 --> 00:01:34.556
industry leaders, policy makers,
writers, film makers, performers

00:01:34.816 --> 00:01:40.236
and the global media the World
Economic Forum chose the theme

00:01:40.926 --> 00:01:43.136
"The Fourth Industrial
Revolution."

00:01:44.956 --> 00:01:48.056
The first industrial
revolution which started

00:01:48.056 --> 00:01:52.726
in the late 18th century
created mechanization.

00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:58.146
Specifically, according
to one perspective

00:01:58.146 --> 00:02:02.176
from the World Economic
Forum, it was the year 1784.

00:02:02.176 --> 00:02:06.326
And the catalyst for this
revolution was steam,

00:02:07.466 --> 00:02:11.746
water and mechanical
production equipment.

00:02:12.356 --> 00:02:15.576
A major outcome of this
revolution was the emergence

00:02:15.576 --> 00:02:20.106
of industrialized cities
where some form of human

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:24.116
or animal labor could be
replaced by mechanical labor.

00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:29.826
Each revolution created more
advanced forms of manufacturing,

00:02:30.426 --> 00:02:33.426
and altered the global
economy in unprecedented

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:35.066
and irreversible ways.

00:02:36.136 --> 00:02:39.686
The second industrial
revolution, which started

00:02:39.686 --> 00:02:43.966
in the late 19th century,
created mass production.

00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:47.746
The catalyst for
this revolution,

00:02:48.596 --> 00:02:53.636
considered to have began
in 1870, were the division

00:02:53.636 --> 00:02:58.306
of labor, electricity
and mass production.

00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:03.566
A major outcome of this
revolution was the emergence

00:03:03.566 --> 00:03:07.316
of industrialized regions
and economies of scale.

00:03:08.226 --> 00:03:12.806
The third industrial
revolution, which started

00:03:12.806 --> 00:03:14.546
in the late 20th century,

00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:19.546
created unprecedented
automation.

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:21.366
The catalyst for
this revolution,

00:03:22.466 --> 00:03:28.526
considered to have began in
1969, were microelectronics,

00:03:29.556 --> 00:03:34.486
information and communication
technologies, the internet,

00:03:34.486 --> 00:03:36.736
robotics and automation.

00:03:38.326 --> 00:03:42.756
A major outcome of this
revolution was the emergence

00:03:42.796 --> 00:03:44.506
of global production networks

00:03:45.476 --> 00:03:48.606
and the input costs were
significantly altered.

00:03:48.926 --> 00:03:54.176
The fourth industrial
revolution, which many leaders

00:03:54.176 --> 00:03:57.386
who are gathered at the World
Economic Forum focused on,

00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:02.756
is believed to be occurring
now in the early part

00:04:02.756 --> 00:04:06.796
of the 21st century,
although no one is quite sure

00:04:06.796 --> 00:04:09.656
when exactly it began.

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:15.816
In my view what makes the fourth
industrial revolution unlike the

00:04:15.876 --> 00:04:21.216
previous three stems from
at least a few key factors.

00:04:23.036 --> 00:04:24.446
The speed of change.

00:04:25.136 --> 00:04:30.936
The role of the individual
citizen of the world whether he

00:04:30.936 --> 00:04:37.826
or she is educated or
uneducated, is rich or poor,

00:04:37.876 --> 00:04:42.616
lives in a developed country
or a developing country,

00:04:43.706 --> 00:04:46.886
he or she can engage in
a two-way communication

00:04:47.326 --> 00:04:48.466
at the cutting edge

00:04:49.106 --> 00:04:52.836
of the fourth industrial
revolution at lightning speed.

00:04:54.076 --> 00:04:57.636
Individual empowerment scale

00:04:57.636 --> 00:05:00.846
in which the individual
can do enormous good

00:05:01.536 --> 00:05:06.656
and equally enormous
harm, the scope of change,

00:05:07.976 --> 00:05:13.116
the impact of that scope of
change on the global system,

00:05:13.116 --> 00:05:16.316
intended versus unintended
consequences,

00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:21.086
known unknowns, and
unknown unknowns.

00:05:22.706 --> 00:05:25.636
You are graduating at a
particularly exciting time

00:05:26.416 --> 00:05:28.286
where the convergence
of technologies

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:29.536
and human interactions

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:33.546
with those technologies is
creating new possibilities

00:05:33.546 --> 00:05:37.686
and new challenges, new
solutions to problems,

00:05:37.726 --> 00:05:41.796
and new threats that
create major new problems

00:05:42.386 --> 00:05:44.356
in many domains of
day-to-day life.

00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:50.376
On the one hand, the convergence
of the digital, physical

00:05:50.376 --> 00:05:53.766
and biological worlds is
generating unprecedented

00:05:53.766 --> 00:05:56.946
questions and concerns
about how governments

00:05:56.946 --> 00:06:01.016
and individuals will address
such issues as employment,

00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:08.686
income levels, equality,
ethics, security, policy,

00:06:09.356 --> 00:06:15.616
confidentiality, social
justice, taxation, diplomacy

00:06:16.086 --> 00:06:18.516
and global attractions.

00:06:18.516 --> 00:06:21.756
At the same time, the
intersections of the real

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:25.406
and virtual worlds, and the
tug of war between natural

00:06:25.406 --> 00:06:29.516
and artificial intelligence are
creating interesting questions

00:06:29.516 --> 00:06:34.796
about the ways in which the
21st century will unfold during

00:06:34.796 --> 00:06:37.276
your lifetime.

00:06:37.356 --> 00:06:43.406
In your careers, say 50 years
from now, Earl Lewis talked

00:06:43.406 --> 00:06:48.316
about the next 25 years, whether
we emerge as better human beings

00:06:48.816 --> 00:06:51.626
or not will critically depend

00:06:51.626 --> 00:06:54.446
on how you shape the fourth
industrial revolution,

00:06:55.346 --> 00:06:59.796
how you use or abuse the
tools at your disposal,

00:07:00.456 --> 00:07:03.076
intentionally or
unintentionally.

00:07:04.366 --> 00:07:07.006
Nobody is better prepared
to shape the world

00:07:07.006 --> 00:07:10.626
than today's graduates of
Carnegie Mellon University.

00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:16.996
CMU faculty, students and
staff played a pivotal role

00:07:16.996 --> 00:07:21.186
in their pioneering work that
enabled many of the technologies

00:07:21.186 --> 00:07:23.646
that are critical to the
fourth industrial revolution--

00:07:24.826 --> 00:07:29.236
computers and computing,
robotics, mobile communications,

00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:31.876
big data, deep learning,
science of learning,

00:07:32.256 --> 00:07:35.076
artificial intelligence,
human machine interactions,

00:07:35.616 --> 00:07:38.576
tools for cybersecurity
and the internet of things.

00:07:39.886 --> 00:07:44.226
CMU has purposefully emphasized
to you during the course

00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:47.126
of your education
here the importance

00:07:47.126 --> 00:07:48.606
of connecting the sciences--

00:07:48.826 --> 00:07:51.056
engineering, business
and technologies--

00:07:51.716 --> 00:07:55.266
with human creativity
in the arts, humanities,

00:07:55.656 --> 00:07:59.036
social behavioral and
decision sciences, and policy.

00:08:00.756 --> 00:08:03.206
CMU's own Dr. Herbert Simon,

00:08:03.726 --> 00:08:08.926
Nobel Prize-winning pioneering
professor, said in 1971,

00:08:10.386 --> 00:08:14.866
"A wealth of information
creates a poverty of attention."

00:08:15.846 --> 00:08:20.326
To paraphrase it
differently a wealth

00:08:20.496 --> 00:08:25.406
of information can create
sometimes enormous confusion

00:08:26.216 --> 00:08:30.416
between what Earl Lewis called
garbage and the real stuff.

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:34.806
Nobody is better prepared
than you to use a wealth

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:39.676
of information deliberately
using careful thought,

00:08:39.676 --> 00:08:43.616
reflection and evidence to
address major societal problems.

00:08:44.696 --> 00:08:47.616
Our five honorary degree
candidates are role models

00:08:47.616 --> 00:08:50.036
and an important connection
between technologies

00:08:50.036 --> 00:08:52.336
and the human condition
that will unfold

00:08:52.336 --> 00:08:53.916
in the coming years and decades.

00:08:54.626 --> 00:08:58.786
Holly Hunter and Sonia Manzano
used their beginnings at CMU

00:08:59.236 --> 00:09:01.656
to excel in the arts and
the entertainment world.

00:09:01.766 --> 00:09:06.346
And Sonia skillfully combined
entertainment and education

00:09:06.346 --> 00:09:07.716
to inspire young minds.

00:09:09.046 --> 00:09:11.886
Bob Langer is a pioneering
engineer whose work

00:09:11.886 --> 00:09:14.046
at the intersections of
engineering, science,

00:09:14.046 --> 00:09:16.556
and medicine shaped
new technologies.

00:09:18.186 --> 00:09:19.996
Our own alumnus, Jim Schwartz,

00:09:19.996 --> 00:09:22.656
excelled in creating new
business opportunities,

00:09:23.046 --> 00:09:26.266
economic value, and societal
impact on a global scale

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:29.586
for those kinds of rapidly
emerging technologies.

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:35.426
Earl Lewis, with a keen eye
and knowledge of history,

00:09:35.826 --> 00:09:38.286
used the past to shape
the present and the future

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:41.946
by applying his intellect and
energy to expand diversity

00:09:41.946 --> 00:09:45.196
and academia, to
connect the digital world

00:09:45.196 --> 00:09:48.136
with the humanities and
through his leadership roles

00:09:48.136 --> 00:09:49.986
in academia and non-profits.

00:09:51.476 --> 00:09:54.366
As many have said, and
as I have said before,

00:09:54.366 --> 00:09:57.426
that some of the greatest
technological achievements

00:09:57.426 --> 00:10:01.676
of the 20th century have played
a major role in creating some

00:10:01.676 --> 00:10:03.976
of the toughest grand
challenges of the 21st century.

00:10:05.616 --> 00:10:09.876
As CMU graduates and global
citizens you have exceptional

00:10:09.936 --> 00:10:12.586
talent and unique
cross-disciplinary perspectives

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:16.696
that will enable you to phase
and address these tough problems

00:10:17.356 --> 00:10:21.496
without creating new challenges
for the next revolution.

00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:27.606
My congratulations to you,
to your families and friends.

00:10:28.456 --> 00:10:32.516
And my enormous gratitude
to you for sharing your time

00:10:32.576 --> 00:10:35.106
with us during the
past few years.

00:10:36.046 --> 00:10:36.966
Congratulations.
