00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.660
Leonardo da Vinci's painting  "The Last
Supper" reminds us of that saying

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.680
"a picture is worth a thousand words."
Well, that's especially true when

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.560
it comes to remembering something.
Researchers at the University of of Waterloo in Canada

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.180
say that drawing is a powerful
influence on our memory

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.900
and can be especially useful for older adults
and even those with dementia.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.120
Researchers had participants draw quick pictures --
4-second drawings -- of words in a list,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.010
such as as "truck" and "pear." 
Well the people who drew pictures
 remembered them better

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.019
than when they wrote the word out multiple times.
Creating the drawings was

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.020
also more effective than imagining 
the items or viewing pictures of the words.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.160
Researchers also found that drawing
helps people remember even more complex words.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.740
People who were given a minute to
draw an image of a spore were

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.860
more likely to remember it than people 
who were asked to write out the definition.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.560
Now, younger people were better
than older people at remembering
the words that they wrote out,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.360
but there was no difference 
between the two groups as far

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.960
as the words they had drawn.
Researchers asked 13 people
diagnosed with dementia

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.240
to either draw or write 60 words that were read aloud
The results showed a massive memory benefit

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.180
for words that had been drawn rather than written.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.060
Now, in some cases the patient's drawings look like scribbles,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.980
but it doesn't matter because
drawing ability has nothing to do

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.900
with memory performance.
Even those of us who can only draw stick figures

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.860
can get memory benefits and here's why:
Retaining new information 
typically declines as we age

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.100
because of deterioration of critical
brain structures involved in memories,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.620
such as the hippocampus and frontal
lobes.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.280
However, visual spatial processing
regions of the brain involved

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.980
in representing images and pictures
remain mostly intact in normal aging.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.660
And in dementia, drawing makes use of brain
regions that are still preserved,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.600
and could help people 
experiencing memory impairment.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.240
These findings will likely lead to new 
interventions and therapies

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.000
to help dementia patients and all of us
hold on to valuable memories
