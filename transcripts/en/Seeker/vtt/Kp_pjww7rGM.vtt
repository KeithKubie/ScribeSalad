00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.330
There’s strange pulses of energy coming
from deep space and astronomers are trying

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.890
to understand what they mean...

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.259
Could it be aliens or maybe just your microwave
oven?

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:09.519
Hello!

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:15.950
I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer at Discovery
News, and I’m really excited to be shooting

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.630
here at the YouTube Space in in my hometown
of LA!

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.210
Now, if you’re a regular reader of my articles,
you’ll know that I LOVE a good space mystery.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.710
Not only does the word “mystery” get me
excited, it also makes web traffic soar like

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.960
hitting the jackpot on a Vegas slot machine,
so before pulling the “alien card” I like

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.120
to examine every possibility before jumping
to THAT conclusion.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.760
And fortunately, astronomers are of the same
mindset -- detecting a mysterious signal from

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.570
the depths of space isn’t necessarily a
strange thing; it’s just that with all the

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.150
awesome possibilities the universe contains,
a mysterious signal just means we’ve found

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.190
something new and exotic.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.390
So, that brings me to fast radio bursts, or
FRBs.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.850
FRBs are very rapid radio pulses that have
been detected at random locations in the cosmos

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:53.850
at random times.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.760
They are transient flashes lasting microseconds
that appear to originate beyond our galaxy.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.760
By pure luck, should a radio telescope be
pointing directly at one, we can measure its

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.760
properties.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.219
Since 2001 only a dozen of these FRBs have
been detected, mainly by the Parkes Observatory

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:12.340
in Australia, but astronomers reckon that,
if we could observe the entire radio sky at

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.229
the same time, we could detect thousands of
these flashes every day.

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.149
Astronomers have to be careful of interpreting
the source of FRBs as there are many terrestrial

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.729
sources of interference that can mess with
your data.

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.899
FRBs that originate from human activity or
weather events are known as PERYTONS, and

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.049
in an effort to understand the origin of perytons,
the scientists at Parkes decided to set up

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.790
a real-time radio interference detector at
the observatory.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.090
During an observation run in January, the
telescope detected three peryton events and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.909
these events matched detections by the real-time
interference detector.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.359
This was a sure sign that the radio pulses
were not extraterrestrial in nature.

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:49.079
And the mystery soon evaporated when they
realized that these perytons were actually

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.560
being generated by a microwave door being
opened prematurely in the kitchen at the observatory.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.149
This may sound like a silly investigation,
but it is quite the opposite -- by tracking

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.859
down sources of interference, astronomers
can better shield their sensitive radio antennae

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.689
against them and remove their signatures from
deep space observing campaigns.

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.890
But also, it proves that the FRBs of extragalactic
origin are real signals from millions of light-years

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.830
away and yet we STILL HAVE NO CLUE what they
are!

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.980
Of course the tabloid press still thinks the
signals are caused by aliens, but that’s

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.069
hardly surprising.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.049
When mysterious regular radio pulses were
detected in 1967, astronomers named the flashing

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.171
object “LGM-1” -- where LGM stands for
“Little Green Men” after the idea that

00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:27.909
the pulses may be created by an alien civilization.

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.630
The signal was actually being caused by a
rapidly spinning neutron star and became the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.469
first ever detection of a pulsar.

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.239
We have now detected thousands.

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.549
FRBs are just as mysterious as those Little
Green Men were in 1967, but there are some

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.310
exciting ideas as what they could be.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.790
Generated over a region hundreds of miles
wide in extra-galactic locations, FRBs must

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.090
be extremely energetic.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.849
That MIGHT suggest they are being triggered
by black hole collisions.

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.060
Or they MIGHT be generated by evaporating
black holes, hinting at a quantum origin of

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.060
gravity.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.129
Or they MIGHT be created by ... something
entirely different.

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.370
So the next time you hear about mysterious
signals from outer space, it doesn’t necessarily

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.849
mean aliens are behind it.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.080
Unless, of course, those aliens are using
microwave ovens to heat up last night’s

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.080
take-out.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.340
Sorry to burst your bubble - are you disappointed
in this finding or does it fascinate you?
