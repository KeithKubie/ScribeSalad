more and more we're seeing machine

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620
more and more we're seeing machine
 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.210
more and more we're seeing machine
learning as a part of everyday things in

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220
learning as a part of everyday things in
 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.330
learning as a part of everyday things in
your car in your cameras and your

doorbell we wanted to build something to

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740
doorbell we wanted to build something to
 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.279
doorbell we wanted to build something to
showcase the technologies and the power

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289
showcase the technologies and the power
 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.410
showcase the technologies and the power
of Android things and so we decided to

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
of Android things and so we decided to
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.840
of Android things and so we decided to
build a garden that can kind of react

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850
build a garden that can kind of react
 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.689
build a garden that can kind of react
and interact with the user Android

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:32.699
and interact with the user Android
 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.080
and interact with the user Android
things is a way to experiment with

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
things is a way to experiment with
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.930
things is a way to experiment with
machine learning in devices and do it

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
machine learning in devices and do it
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.600
machine learning in devices and do it
very rapidly we were brainstorming about

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610
very rapidly we were brainstorming about
 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.130
very rapidly we were brainstorming about
how flowers could become responsive to

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
how flowers could become responsive to
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.369
how flowers could become responsive to
people and one of the effects that we

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379
people and one of the effects that we
 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.319
people and one of the effects that we
see in the natural world is flowers that

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329
see in the natural world is flowers that
 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.860
see in the natural world is flowers that
follow the Sun so we had this idea that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870
follow the Sun so we had this idea that
 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.220
follow the Sun so we had this idea that
the flowers could follow people the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
the flowers could follow people the
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.110
the flowers could follow people the
emotion flowers is basically a smart

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
emotion flowers is basically a smart
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.560
emotion flowers is basically a smart
flower that reacts to a user's facial

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
flower that reacts to a user's facial
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.109
flower that reacts to a user's facial
expressions that will open when you're

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119
expressions that will open when you're
 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.300
expressions that will open when you're
smelling or like when you're winking at

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
smelling or like when you're winking at
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.750
smelling or like when you're winking at
it it'll turn shy and you know close and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760
it it'll turn shy and you know close and
 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.870
it it'll turn shy and you know close and
turn you know sort of pink so we added a

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
turn you know sort of pink so we added a
 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.429
turn you know sort of pink so we added a
camera in the head of the flower and it

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439
camera in the head of the flower and it
 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.120
camera in the head of the flower and it
detected faces and then the algorithm

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130
detected faces and then the algorithm
 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.580
detected faces and then the algorithm
that did the face detection controlled

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590
that did the face detection controlled
 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.240
that did the face detection controlled
the motors in the flower body and slowly

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250
the motors in the flower body and slowly
 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.929
the motors in the flower body and slowly
turned it to face people that were

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939
turned it to face people that were
 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.929
turned it to face people that were
standing there and be a little bit

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939
standing there and be a little bit
 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.819
standing there and be a little bit
reactive and responsive we wanted to

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
reactive and responsive we wanted to
 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.370
reactive and responsive we wanted to
just engage people with something that

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380
just engage people with something that
 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.190
just engage people with something that
was aesthetically pleasing beautiful and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200
was aesthetically pleasing beautiful and
 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.100
was aesthetically pleasing beautiful and
so we had a lot of flowers that had

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110
so we had a lot of flowers that had
 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.920
so we had a lot of flowers that had
lights leaves built around them these

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
lights leaves built around them these
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.859
lights leaves built around them these
were active and interactive and people

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
were active and interactive and people
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.010
were active and interactive and people
could stand in front of them so we had

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
could stand in front of them so we had
 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.109
could stand in front of them so we had
another section where we showed the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119
another section where we showed the
 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.410
another section where we showed the
Android things processor and the motors

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420
Android things processor and the motors
 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.899
Android things processor and the motors
and the cables and the spine and the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909
and the cables and the spine and the
 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.840
and the cables and the spine and the
vertebrae of this flower and we even let

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
vertebrae of this flower and we even let
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.240
vertebrae of this flower and we even let
them control the flower using game

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
them control the flower using game
 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.449
them control the flower using game
controllers we also use stuff you can

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
controllers we also use stuff you can
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.819
controllers we also use stuff you can
get from the hardware store like copper

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829
get from the hardware store like copper
 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.850
get from the hardware store like copper
piping for the stem and really it's a

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860
piping for the stem and really it's a
 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.450
piping for the stem and really it's a
matter of like how we put them

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460
matter of like how we put them
 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.640
matter of like how we put them
together to make it sort of look like

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650
together to make it sort of look like
 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.550
together to make it sort of look like
this flower that's not something you'd

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560
this flower that's not something you'd
 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.530
this flower that's not something you'd
see in nature but also convey the idea

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540
see in nature but also convey the idea
 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.290
see in nature but also convey the idea
that it is a flower there's a spine that

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300
that it is a flower there's a spine that
 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.020
that it is a flower there's a spine that
runs up the center of the continuum

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030
runs up the center of the continuum
 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.870
runs up the center of the continuum
robot and we finally found something

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880
robot and we finally found something
 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.120
robot and we finally found something
called a flex cable that was available

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130
called a flex cable that was available
 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.580
called a flex cable that was available
for a weed whacker and we were able to

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590
for a weed whacker and we were able to
 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.850
for a weed whacker and we were able to
build the spines which hold the

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860
build the spines which hold the
 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.370
build the spines which hold the
vertebrae on spines were printed plastic

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380
vertebrae on spines were printed plastic
 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.800
vertebrae on spines were printed plastic
and then we had to figure out how to

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810
and then we had to figure out how to
 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.050
and then we had to figure out how to
write the software to control this robot

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060
write the software to control this robot
 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.480
write the software to control this robot
and so we went back to seventh-grade

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490
and so we went back to seventh-grade
 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.990
and so we went back to seventh-grade
trigonometry to figure out you know how

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000
trigonometry to figure out you know how
 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.920
trigonometry to figure out you know how
much to move the wire caused how much to

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930
much to move the wire caused how much to
 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.130
much to move the wire caused how much to
move the continuum robot what we wanted

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140
move the continuum robot what we wanted
 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.520
move the continuum robot what we wanted
to do was make it super responsive you

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530
to do was make it super responsive you
 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.830
to do was make it super responsive you
go up to the cloud and come back you

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840
go up to the cloud and come back you
 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.020
go up to the cloud and come back you
have a little bit of a lag and we wanted

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030
have a little bit of a lag and we wanted
 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.940
have a little bit of a lag and we wanted
our flowers to be organic and natural

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950
our flowers to be organic and natural
 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.430
our flowers to be organic and natural
and not to show that lag and really the

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440
and not to show that lag and really the
 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.800
and not to show that lag and really the
whole thing is powered by Android things

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810
whole thing is powered by Android things
 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.620
whole thing is powered by Android things
right and so the idea is you have

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630
right and so the idea is you have
 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.590
right and so the idea is you have
sensory inputs in our case it's just the

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600
sensory inputs in our case it's just the
 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.620
sensory inputs in our case it's just the
the camera that senses the scene and

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630
the camera that senses the scene and
 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.010
the camera that senses the scene and
then on device processing so we started

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020
then on device processing so we started
 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.950
then on device processing so we started
with face recognition software library

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960
with face recognition software library
 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.760
with face recognition software library
that Google has we then we're interested

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770
that Google has we then we're interested
 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.510
that Google has we then we're interested
in how quickly could we recognize faces

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520
in how quickly could we recognize faces
 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.330
in how quickly could we recognize faces
in like a video stream on the Raspberry

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340
in like a video stream on the Raspberry
 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.420
in like a video stream on the Raspberry
Pi we detect that there's a face there

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430
Pi we detect that there's a face there
 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.970
Pi we detect that there's a face there
and then there's a neuro net that infers

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980
and then there's a neuro net that infers
 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.430
and then there's a neuro net that infers
your emotion and so depending on what

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440
your emotion and so depending on what
 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.120
your emotion and so depending on what
the emotion is we changed LED lights or

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130
the emotion is we changed LED lights or
 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.280
the emotion is we changed LED lights or
we move the servo motors to kind of

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290
we move the servo motors to kind of
 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.130
we move the servo motors to kind of
close and open the petals the platform's

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140
close and open the petals the platform's
 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.630
close and open the petals the platform's
that we have running the hardware that

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640
that we have running the hardware that
 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.820
that we have running the hardware that
we have running the Android things

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830
we have running the Android things
 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.850
we have running the Android things
system is quite capable it has a

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860
system is quite capable it has a
 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.130
system is quite capable it has a
multi-core processor and it can really

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140
multi-core processor and it can really
 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.120
multi-core processor and it can really
be responsive to changes in a video

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130
be responsive to changes in a video
 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.900
be responsive to changes in a video

to sort of do these DIY hobby type

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410
to sort of do these DIY hobby type
 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.130
to sort of do these DIY hobby type
projects you should just go and give it

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140
projects you should just go and give it
 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.710
projects you should just go and give it
a try I think you'll be surprised at

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720
a try I think you'll be surprised at
 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.810
a try I think you'll be surprised at
like how quickly you can build sort of
