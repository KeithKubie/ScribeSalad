Speaker 1:          00:06          It's like a boss. I um, I watched on Netflix, I watched that Ukraine documentary, uh, winter on fire.

Speaker 2:          00:22          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:22          you know, it was just one of those things where it's just like Jesus Christ. I knew I wasn't politically active, but watching what these people did, what they turned around, I'll, I'll try to give you a simple version of what happened, which, you know, with my brain, that's all you're going to get is basically what happened I guess around 2003, 2004, uh, there was some fucking Russian dude pro Russian dude, eight claim that he won the fucking election. And they were like, no, you didn't. Your piece of shit. You rigged it. And they proved it and he got bounced.

Speaker 3:          00:55          In 2004 pro Russian candidate, Viktor Yanukovych wins the presidential vote. The election was found to be raped. As a result, the people take to the streets in a peaceful protest called the orange revolution.

Speaker 1:          01:10          2009, the same dude comes back and guess what? He wins the election like that wasn't corrupt.

Speaker 3:          01:17          2010 Yana Covich returns this time. The election is confirmed and he regains full control.

Speaker 1:          01:24          So anyways, you, the Ukraine is a chance to join the European Union, right? To start being more like a European country. And for once and for all get out from underneath a, whatever you call, whatever. Russia has a dictatorship.

Speaker 3:          01:38          Fall 2013, a key milestone of coaches as Yanukovych appears ready to sign an association with the EU. Yet as the people look to the west, their leader turns to the east and the future of the nation hangs in the balance.

Speaker 1:          01:55          So the fucking Russian dude who allegedly got elected legitimately, you know, listens to the people and they say that that's what we want to do. We don't want to take a step towards Russia. We want to become part of the European Union. We want to have a future here. Like, um, what we see going on in western Europe and all of the fucking politicians go, you got it. All right. The people have spoken, we're gonna do what you said. And what do you think happened? Right in the midnight hour they gave him, they all right there, Fred. They're like, yeah, you know what? We're not signed to that. And uh, we're going go hang out with though. Vladi daddy over there poop none. Vladimir Putin and I were going to fucking shoot 18 holes of golf with him, but we're going to sell out your country to the ruskies.

Speaker 2:          02:51          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:51          so start it off this whole fucking revolution. I'm not going to say what the fuck. I mean, you got to watch it. It's unbelievable. But um, you know, I mean it's totally, it's not in the news. I mean, they ended up winning. They somehow ended up winning and these, these fucking people had no weapons. They were just getting shot at what I don't understand. I mean, I do understand it, but I, I, there's no place in the world where you can protest. You can't do it. You protest, cops show up and they beat the fuck out of you until you go home and they arrest a few and then that's it. Everyone. It happens in this country, this country with all its on would have free brave freedom of speech. You know those fucking occupy Wall Street people, right. They come down there, they beat the fuck out of them and everybody knows the old trick, the same shit that they was. They would claim when they did it in the Ukraine where basically when you have a peaceful demonstration, it's like, well fuck, we can't beat the fuck out them. What should we do? They hire a couple people to go down there and pretend to be the protesters. They throw a couple of fucking rocks and then the, the, the, the cops go nuts.

Speaker 3:          03:59          No. So yeah, still [inaudible] but then watch the [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:12          and then on the newest, they're like the protesters started attacking the police. You know, the police were just doing their job, but Blahblahblahblah the police's job is to go down there and beat the fuck out of them. Alright, isn't it? Isn't that what it is? Got Jesus Christ bills. I Dunno what, what do you know? I don't know. That's, that's Kinda what I got out of it. I got out of it that, um, it was an amazing documentary that these people actually with basically no fucking weapons and just, you know, died, lost their eyes, had all these horrific fucking injuries, got kidnapped, disappeared, all of this horrific shit and they were able to um, hold them off for awhile.

Speaker 2:          04:54          Okay.

Speaker 3:          04:55          What is the [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] what's the [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:12          so then the fucking Russian guy ends up having to leave, right? He fucking leaves and Da da Da. He's a jolly good fellow. It's all fucking over.

Speaker 2:          05:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:33          and then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, this, this other revolution starts with people who are pro Russia. Since the, since the document you've been made, like 6,000 Ukrainian people died. But, um, I'll try to say is if you get a chance to check a Ukraine

Speaker 3:          05:58          winter on fire,

Speaker 2:          06:03          [inaudible]

The protest is entering its second week. The arrest were caught on tape and uploaded to youtube as part of the occupy Wall Street movement. Today, activists are speaking out against the NYP di claiming officers used excessive force during yesterday's crackdown last night, a group march to a police precinct demanding answers about their friends who were taken into custody earlier in the day.
