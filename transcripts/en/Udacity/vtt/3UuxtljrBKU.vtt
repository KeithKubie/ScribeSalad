00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.290
After space and

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.580
color, type is the next item you should
consider when creating a great app.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.500
Roboto, the default sans
serif font family for

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.860
Android, is a great place to start,
as it was specifically designed for

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.440
user interfaces across
a variety of screens.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.530
Using Roboto gives you the comfort
of knowing your text will work with

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.570
a variety of languages and
remain crisp and legible on any screen.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.440
And, you can use Roboto across
your entire app, whether it be for

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.650
headlines, body text,
smaller captions or whatever.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.010
It includes a bunch of weights,
like light, regular, medium, bold, and

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.939
black, and
variants like condensed and slab.

00:00:41.228 --> 00:00:44.220
Having those variants available
in addition to font size and

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.570
color let's you clearly communicate, for

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.910
example, what's a headline versus
what's part of the body text.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.980
Or, as we sometimes say, it'll help
you establish a clear hierarchy for

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.510
the text in your app.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.370
Now, typography is a really large topic,
and we'll

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.390
try to fit as much as possible into this
course, but we can only cover so much.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.530
If you're interested in typography
outside the realm of mobile app design,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.620
I strongly encourage you to
check out some of the books

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.510
linked in the instructor notes.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.630
There's a whole world of information
out there if you're a typography

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.730
fanatic like me.
