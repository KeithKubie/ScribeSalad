00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
I wanted to talk about and why I think

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.390
string theory is probably right and I'm not

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.740
a string theorist, I'm a cosmologist

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:16.949
there is a debate and it's an extensive

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.090
debate within the scientific community

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.670
is probably more of a debate was given

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.320
is given more credence i think by

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.119
the public that than within science itself

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.580
but you know what is the correct

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.250
theory of a quantum gravity is it string

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.810
theory or is it one of the other suggested

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.700
alternatives and I'm in the string theory camp

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.560
and just wanted to sort of say why really

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.360
so string theory basically in a nutshell

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.440
postulates that all the building blocks of nature

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.840
so you normally think of these like being little particles

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.020
string theory says that well no they're not little particles

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.780
they're little tiny strings so those strings

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.129
can be either closed strings

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.920
when they're like a loop a loop of string or and/or

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.360
they're open strings that was like an

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.730
extensive string and a different modes

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.500
of vibration that those strings give you

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.570
the different particles that you

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.100
perceive in nature.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.700
[Brady]: but a string is longer than a particle

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.580
so wouldn't a string need to be made of particles?

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.280
No, it itself is the fundamental object

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.740
and when you look at it from it from

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.720
far away it looks like a particle

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.920
because you take it so far away

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.600
you can't you know resolve the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.630
distances that but yeah I mean

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.640
fundamentally it's a string you can't

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.280
break it down any further it would be

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.560
the fundamental objective of nature

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.659
it's this sort of old aristotelian idea

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.579
that you break things down further and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.920
further because he he postulates that

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.020
you reach the atom right of course now

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.610
we get to the atom and then we go we

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.140
know you could go further you can break things

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.670
down even further

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.810
well actually there is a point where

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.369
that stops it stops at the string

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.960
that's it there's no breaking down of

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.370
the string

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.930
if you look at what why where the problems in

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.710
quantum gravity arise it's when

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.110
you have point like interaction so when

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.670
things that are interacting at the point

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.010
particularly with gravitons are

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.890
interacting with Points and I think that

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.270
coupled to gravitons when that

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.760
happens you get divergencies you get

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.500
infinities and these are infinities that

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.869
you can't handle sometimes you get these

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.400
sorts of infinities in other theories as well

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.900
within the standard model for example but

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.910
you can handle them right in something

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.770
called renormalization you can't handle

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.880
them within just gravity so what string

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.290
theory does is very loosely it sort of

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.290
resolves that by instead of things

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.480
interacting with point where they can't

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.780
interacting at point anymore because the string has extense

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.080
[Brady]: it gives everyone a

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.030
bit of leg room if you like yeah it does

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.430
but what's important to realize is the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.650
it wasn't like that was the order of the

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.930
argument okay it wasn't like somebody

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.310
said okay well let's just give it an

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.380
extense and that's gonna fix everything

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.170
it's like you know let's imagine that

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.550
things made up of strings instead

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.680
of particles it's like why strings why

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.090
not just something different why you

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.190
know snowflakes whatever right

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.989
it wasn't it that these are plugged up

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.180
there was a natural progression of that

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.060
led to this this idea and I think that

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.440
thats what really convinces me

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.000
one of the things about

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.750
theoretical physics is that on the

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.370
one it's not like we just sort of come

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.780
up with an idea and then ask

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.459
experiments to come along in maybe a

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.379
hundred years after we've died to

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.569
verify its it's not like there's not an

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.450
anything goes attitude physics is a

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.150
it's an old field now as it is more

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.409
mature has been around for longer than

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.560
take biology so we've learned to

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.659
develop a lot of rules of the game that

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.140
we we can't mess with these rules

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.000
tell us what were allowed to do next

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.829
even before we even go to an experiment

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.480
because those rules came from experiment

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.819
themselves right so in particular that

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.250
the two big guiding principles that we

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.709
have are special relativity and quantum

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.579
mechanics and just those two things when

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.409
they come together they really restrict

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.480
what we're allowed to do and it leads to

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.609
very naturally to something like string

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.470
theory why do people some people not

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.060
like string theory well string theory

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.079
it's hard at the bottom line right it it

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.049
maybe it's predicted lots of things but

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.030
but in terms of actually like one of the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.859
things that you wanted originally from

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.530
string theory was and a unique solution

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.630
of string theory a unique solution of

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.150
string theory that describes say our

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.220
universe is compatible with our universe

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.630
now

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.139
string theory hasn't achieved that but

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.849
what you actually get out of string theory are

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:30.430
loads of different possible scenarios

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.169
loads of different possible universes a

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.380
truly gargantuan number and ours could be

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.060
one of them ours is compatible with one of

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.150
them but there's no unique solution so you

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.590
actually get these landscape and a lot of

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.760
people don't like that and make that

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.080
they are going to make it you lose

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.690
productivity at the end of the day what

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.460
you what we really need is to want you

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.599
to understand the mathematics of the

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.190
landscape more we can start to make

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.800
concrete statements but it at this stage

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.080
we're not at that level and the maths is

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.880
tricky but it but because of the

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.530
trickyness of the maths string theory

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.240
has also brought lots of important

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.140
developments with it within maths as well

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.159
the reason I like it is because

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:08.740
as I said it is the sort of it is a very

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.750
natural progression of an idea that

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.270
leads towards it and it is the same

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.219
thing that led inevitably to the to the

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:17.680
Higgs actually the same logic that led

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.030
to the existence of the higgs when

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.479
people talk about why the Higgs exists

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.030
right you usually talk about

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.669
it gives mass to particles or

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.050
if you're being a bit more sophisticated you might say

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.930
are because this symmetry is broken and

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:38.590
all that's true but the real important

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.330
thing about a Higgs is that it allows

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.000
our theory of nature to obey the rules

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.110
of special relativity and quantum

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.180
mechanics in a very particular way

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.639
what you get when you when you

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.039
consider relativity and quantum

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.570
mechanics together you get really called

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.820
quantum field theory which is the most

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.550
spectacularly beautiful theory that we

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.680
produced it's remarkably well and

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.560
you know well-tested it's it's it's it's a

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.940
great theory right

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.289
what are you really doing when you when

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:09.490
you do quantum field theory well you're

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.349
looking at how particles are interacting

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:12.370
right you might be interesting how

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.469
electrons are interacting so you fired

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:16.450
two electrons in each of it and you ask

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.310
what's the probability that they they

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.930
scatter by a certain amount or they

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.750
scatter through a certain angle and when

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.930
you do that you ever use quantum field theory to

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.789
do that calculate something called an

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.789
amplitude and that amplitude tells you

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:33.310
something about those probabilities and

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.710
when those electrons are interacting

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.200
they quantum field theory tells us that they

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.080
exchange a virtual particle which is

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.729
the photon it's not a real particle

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:44.830
it's not a particle that you can grab and hold

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.159
it it's a virtual particle so it has

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:50.889
real effects it causes of the and

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:52.479
electrons are scattered that but it's

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.039
not a real thing you can scatter these

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.419
things and use quantum field theory to

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:56.919
calculate it down to the two and

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:59.500
extract probability and when you do that

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.840
for the electron you get a central

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.500
number

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.289
ok you get a nice their number which is

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:08.110
nice and small so that we retain the

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.210
tablet of control over our calculations

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.060
and we can we can everything sensible ok

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.419
the trouble arises when you start

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:19.449
introducing W bosons which are different

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:21.099
types of particles is another particle

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:25.779
and W boson have have mass and that

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:28.220
means that they have an extra

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.840
of components that they would that they

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.160
have that they wouldn't have

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.420
if they didn't have mass and they have this

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.680
extra component which is kind of like

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.290
there because it's got mass and this is the

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.020
longitudinal component and when you

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.230
scatter the longitudinal components of W

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.900
bosons something goes wrong

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.640
it's all fine at lower energies

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.370
at low energies its fine at high-energy these aren't

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.720
you calculate these amplitudes and the

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.270
numbers get big they get big big and

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.040
they translate ultimately to

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.840
probabilities exceeding 1 this is

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.480
completely breaking down the quantum

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.130
mechanics so this tells you immediately

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.960
that something's gotta give

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.630
alright so you're like what can I do so

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.640
you look what you what you can do is you

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.770
can look at the expression the formerly

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.590
you've got for your amplitude and you

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.630
can say right it's cool at low energies I

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.460
need to fix it at high energy so i just

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.810
change the formula

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.580
ok I just fix it i just changed the

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.080
formula but then you say what can I

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.700
change it in any old way to show that it

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.290
works well at high energies as well when

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.090
you can just do anything again

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.140
quantum mechanics and relativity

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.910
commonly tell you that only certain

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.409
things that you can do you can't just do

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:37.159
anything so they tell you to look for

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.080
where the the poles where that where

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.849
things blow up in the amplitude look for

00:08:40.849 --> 00:08:42.860
the locations of these poles and look

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.930
for the properties of these poles these

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.550
poles are kind of where the amplitude sort of

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.230
spikes up if it spikes up you know

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.040
when you're approaching from one

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.240
direction of it spikes up in one

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.950
direction that good if it spikes out in the

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.839
other direction that's bad because what

00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:55.610
what are these poles they tell you about

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.890
when you do these experiments about

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.930
producing a real particle not just a

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.850
virtual producing a real one and they

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.170
tell you about the properties of those

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.420
particles and if there's spikes that are in

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.010
the wrong direction that means you've

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.450
got a bad part particle

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.339
it's inconsistent with quantum mechanics a particle

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:12.050
that will lead to negative probabilities

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.300
and all kinds of madness you do this you

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.770
can do this in a in a way that's

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.800
consistent for the W boson right and

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.240
it sends out the particle that you

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.450
actually introduced into the game was

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.400
the Higgs so it's softens everything

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.110
off and everything's well behaved so

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.480
this is the lesson from Higgs now let's

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.620
play the game of gravity

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.450
this is where string theory comes in

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.610
in gravity you have gravitons right these particles

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.530
of gravity if you like and you can

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.910
scatter them as well you can ask what

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.660
happens

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.690
at low energies everything's fine

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.449
at high energies things start to get big

00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:47.120
and start to blow open this makes a

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.100
nonsense of your probabilities again

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.589
so things are going around quantum field

00:09:51.589 --> 00:09:54.800
to be broken down you know you've lost

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.870
control and this is this is what goes

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.970
wrong with gravity so you can say right

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.379
I've got this formula again for the

00:10:00.379 --> 00:10:02.480
amplitude can i play the same game

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.699
okay can I just say right I'm gonna

00:10:04.699 --> 00:10:08.240
rewrite the formula so that I improve

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.149
its behavior at high-energy while keeping the

00:10:11.149 --> 00:10:13.370
same behavioral energy so they did it

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.110
and they say but then you can't again

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:16.550
you can't just try anything because you've got

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.019
to check where the poles

00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:20.240
what kind of new things have i introduced

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.740
right are they consistent with quantum

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.930
mechanics and you try and you try and

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.639
you try and it's really hard and it

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:26.959
seems to be like there's nothing you can

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:29.600
do and then one day these guys Virasoro

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.389
and Shapiro come along and they come

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:35.029
up with an answer and it works it doesn't

00:10:35.029 --> 00:10:36.949
introduce any crazy new particles that

00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:38.569
introduces perfectly well-behaved me

00:10:38.569 --> 00:10:41.089
particles and it's like well that works

00:10:41.089 --> 00:10:42.860
right it seems to have to say it

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.930
reproduces what we want to see at low

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.610
energies that has manifestly good

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.180
high-energy behavior it's consistent it

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.310
doesn't introduce any pop illogical new

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:53.930
species of particle or anything like

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.490
that it's great

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.130
and in this if nearly 50 years since this

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:01.339
was found nobody has come up with an

00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:05.360
alternative right now that I've

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.560
mentioned anything about strings of this

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.019
date I and this is a beauty of it this

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:10.490
is the beauty of it all this was done

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.290
before anybody mention the word string

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.569
right but now you look at the formula

00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:16.759
that you've got and you say can I

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:18.079
interpret it and you look and you

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:20.389
realise that actually it's a formula

00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:22.069
that describes not the scattering

00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:25.279
particles but really the scattering of

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:29.540
strings so wasn't that somebody said

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.550
let's try strings that never happened

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.680
you know you had this formula you

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.779
thought let's fix the formula

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:38.389
ok let's try to guess what the how this is

00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:40.129
going to behave and what it has to do

00:11:40.129 --> 00:11:42.500
and it's just kind of almost a unique

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.569
answer for what it could do and then you

00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:46.459
go low and behold it was string theory all

00:11:46.459 --> 00:11:47.750
along well originally of course

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.309
historically that they were looking

00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:50.660
at other things they were looking at

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.040
just trying to explain the strong

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.500
interaction but there's this logical

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.779
argument that you can apply to gravity

00:11:56.779 --> 00:12:00.920
and you realize actually the out pops

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.610
strings

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.459
it's not like you try strings it outpops

00:12:04.459 --> 00:12:06.050
strings of course they're certain

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.730
assumptions that making  here like that you

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.759
you're doing very standard way to try to

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:12.860
extend the theory into the UV and

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.050
keeping everything get weak coupling

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.490
that means that the interactions are not

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:18.620
getting too strong so there's some

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.870
assumptions in what I'm saying but it's a very

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.600
natural progression of ideas that lead

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.449
you along one path and that's the

00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:29.480
string theory and that's why i buy into it really

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.139
i think most people do buy it

00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:35.329
so i think i think i think most people

00:12:35.329 --> 00:12:36.079
do

00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:39.410
there are a community which don't

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.110
why don't they maybe I don't know that's

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:43.910
that's a controversial thing to

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.649
to actually I don't know

00:12:45.649 --> 00:12:48.350
ok so we mentioned a bit before about

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.920
and the fact it doesn't predict this

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.040
unique state of the universe it's all this

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.500
gargantuan number of possibilities that's an

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.540
some people might interpret that as a virtue because then

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.949
you've got so many possibilities you're

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:05.500
going to get one that's compatible with what

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.120
we see right that it could also be

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.370
described as a weakness i don't think

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.569
it's fair to say it's not really a

00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:13.490
testable theory i think i think that's not

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.459
true and I think you can for example you

00:13:16.459 --> 00:13:18.560
assume that the symmetries of special

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.019
relativity are present and we find any

00:13:21.019 --> 00:13:23.120
evidence that they're not then that

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.209
would be a proof again string theory so

00:13:26.209 --> 00:13:28.189
it's wrong to say that it's not then

00:13:28.189 --> 00:13:31.850
that it that it's not a testable theory

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.040
another issue that people might have

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.920
with with strings for example of BM the

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.689
cosmological constant we know that we

00:13:38.689 --> 00:13:40.459
see out there we see the universe

00:13:40.459 --> 00:13:42.319
acceleration that requires a positive

00:13:42.319 --> 00:13:44.509
cosmological constant just as parameter

00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:46.759
in your physical theory the vacuum

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:48.230
in the universe should be positive the

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:49.939
you take everything out the

00:13:49.939 --> 00:13:52.160
universe the leftover energy it should

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.410
be positive that would be compatible

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:55.939
with this accelerating universe that we

00:13:55.939 --> 00:13:56.899
see

00:13:56.899 --> 00:13:59.089
string theory doesn't really like that

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:02.089
it prefers either zero or negative

00:14:02.089 --> 00:14:04.220
that's not to say it can't necessarily

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.889
give you the positive one there are

00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:09.980
some ideas out there which tried to

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.439
construct these with in string theory

00:14:12.439 --> 00:14:14.779
they have been criticized in some

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.379
quarters its cutting-edge ongoing stuff

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.540
right. But that might be one perceived

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.399
weakness of string theory. Trying to get that

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:24.259
positive cosmological constant out but

00:14:24.259 --> 00:14:26.360
yet there are there are very serious

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.730
work out there doing that and indeed

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.259
the claim to have done it is there an

00:14:30.259 --> 00:14:31.850
ultimate test for proof is there are

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.470
silver bullet out

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.509
there that you could say look string theory

00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:37.759
was right all along well I i think i think that

00:14:37.759 --> 00:14:39.860
would be yeah I think I think so at the

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.079
moment we talked about the formula that this

00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:45.170
form of that sort of Virasoro

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:48.050
Shapiro came up with that does everything

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.929
it needs to do right now it's not been

00:14:50.929 --> 00:14:52.459
proved that that's the unique choice

00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:54.889
that you could have made that given all

00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:56.569
the criteria you want to reproduce the

00:14:56.569 --> 00:14:59.720
right things at low energies and it

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.579
doesn't introduce any pathology you know

00:15:01.579 --> 00:15:03.259
that violate quantum mechanics and all

00:15:03.259 --> 00:15:04.699
Is it unique?

00:15:04.699 --> 00:15:06.740
We don't know. If somebody comes along

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.240
and prove that it is unique

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.610
mathematically which is it is a

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.429
mathematical exercise now and then I

00:15:13.429 --> 00:15:15.559
cannot infer that was kind of like it

00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:17.179
could only have ever been string theory

00:15:17.179 --> 00:15:20.059
right and you didn't have to do any experiment

00:15:20.059 --> 00:15:21.259
to prove that all the other experiments

00:15:21.259 --> 00:15:22.610
you need to prove that are the

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.079
experiments that confirmed special

00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:27.170
relativity and quantum mechanics so that

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.120
for me would would would be great really

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.379
the other thing that string theory

00:15:30.379 --> 00:15:33.679
typically needs is super symmetry so and

00:15:33.679 --> 00:15:35.420
if we found evidence of supersymmetry

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.120
then that will be good

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.499
the string theory because we haven't

00:15:39.499 --> 00:15:40.910
found it is not going to be found at the

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.769
LHC about look at it but that's not to

00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:43.999
say that string theory is wrong it just

00:15:43.999 --> 00:15:46.069
means that supersymmetry kicks in at

00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:49.910
a higher energy than the LHC can't see

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.279
have two types of particles in nature you have

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:55.879
bosons and fermions so for example the

00:15:55.879 --> 00:15:58.819
higgs particle is it like a boson so

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.129
is the photon is a boson the

00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:02.860
graviton is a boson they're characterized

00:16:02.869 --> 00:16:04.300
by the fact that they have integer

00:16:04.309 --> 00:16:05.899
values of their spin it's like an

00:16:05.899 --> 00:16:06.550
intrinsic spin

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.830
and they have integer values there are

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:12.070
also fermions they have half-integer

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.140
spin so think about the electron and

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.600
what supersymmetry does it postulates

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.430
the symmetry between these two kinds of

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.170
particles so for every boson you have a

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.149
fermion for every fermion you have a

00:16:22.149 --> 00:16:26.170
boson and and yea that's its kind of

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:27.670
doubles up the number of particles but

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.399
it it is a very natural extension of the

00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:32.260
symmetries that we know of the than the

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.399
next step would be that you would

00:16:33.399 --> 00:16:35.170
include supersymmetry so again it's the

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.480
natural progression of ideas and string

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.570
theory requires it because without it it

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.940
predicts the it's unstable. It is the natural

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.500
path of all the ideas that we built of

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.269
twentieth-century that it in a way

00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:50.500
string theory is a natural place that you would go

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.300
next I don't think you'd need to rewrite anything

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.279
I think it's been the opposite if string

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:57.399
theory was found to just somehow not be

00:16:57.399 --> 00:16:59.350
right then you have to start thinking

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.240
about rewriting all the textbooks i think it

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.709
would be the other way around and the other

00:17:02.709 --> 00:17:03.910
thing I suppose that people people

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.640
criticize string theory for is that it's a

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.709
theory predicts the dimension out in the

00:17:08.709 --> 00:17:11.470
universe to be 10 space-time

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.620
dimensions which you know you look

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.660
outside and there is 4, 3 dimensions

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.720
of space one-dimension of time so where are

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.300
the other six but this is this you can

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.280
easily you know you can imagine that the

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.530
wrapped up very small or that we live on a

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.660
brane membrane or something like that or

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:28.990
not

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:36.410
not really an issue

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.390
you know I just got it is crazy to think

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.060
that you know it's so big

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.710
yeah we're looking at something so small

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:44.360
really into it the fans that were

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.590
breaking into the treasure box

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.080
it's ok so there this is authorized i'm

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.090
here with case all right you know what

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.170
just open the book

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.210
yes come on and what you know Moses

00:17:53.210 --> 00:18:00.190
knows I'm Brady argue with you
