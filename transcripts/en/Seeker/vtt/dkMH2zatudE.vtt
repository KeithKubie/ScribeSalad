00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.950
Haha, emoji's wait a minute.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.690
None of these look like… what?!

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.559
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.780
Emoji pictograms were created in 1999 by a
Japanese software engineer to be used in Docomo

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.780
devices.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.500
The company added the icons to their phones,
but no one else had them, so when they texted

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.840
non Docomo phones, they got "garbage characters."

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.000
That changed when the Unicode Consortium -- the
governing body of the computer code behind

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.320
text on the world's computers -- adopted emojis
too.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.329
Now EVERYONE had to add them, and by 2010
y'all started seeing them on your phones.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.499
Now, Apple is adding racial diversity to their
emoji keyboard for iOS 8.3, which is currently

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:46.590
in public beta.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.670
And in the words of Vice President Joe Biden,
"this is a big F**king deal."

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.929
Emojis might seem like a superfluous part
of our technology, but they've become a big

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.609
part of how people communicate.

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.289
Communication theory suggests that not knowing
a word for a thing, makes the thing invisible

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.040
to the larger culture -- it's called Linguistic
relativity.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.350
If you can't describe it, it doesn't exist.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.370
Race informs everything we do, not because
it exists -- its a construct, there's only

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.640
one human race: homo sapien -- but because
we're social and visual beings.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.140
So using those together… what's the implication
of adding a set of ethnically diverse faces

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.180
to the emoji keypad?

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.180
We've talked before about how video game with
avatars of different races, can reinforce

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.890
violent racial stereotypes; so what about
seeing your skin color?

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.330
How does that change our perceptions?

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:41.880
Obviously, science has yet to study THIS advancement,
but the study of the impact of human diversity

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.710
is widespread; as is the study of what's called
"Underrepresentation."

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.870
The director of media literacy group MediaSmarts,
told Think magazine, "Players who are not

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.930
white and male have to essentially leave some
of their self behind and take on this white/male

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.870
identity in order to participate in [a video
game]."

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.730
And emojis are very similarly powerful.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.020
It shows that "white is normal," but it's
not.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.550
And the more role models and representation
otherwise the better people will do.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.080
A study of racial diversity in criminal-justice-related
occupations found that when diversity increased,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.160
the punishments for crimes were less racially-driven.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.690
With black and white defendants being punished
more equally for similar crimes,.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.370
Plus 1 to Fairness and equality.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.090
In a 2008 study from the Annenberg School
for Communication, researchers found a significant

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.230
drop in white racial attitudes during and
after the successful election of President

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.230
Obama.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.840
And another in the Journal of Experimental
Social Psychology found having a successfully

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.320
elected role model, reduces race-based gaps
in academic performance.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.430
Exposure to other races and role-models equals
minus 1 to racism and plus 1 to education!

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.900
At least in the United States, diversity is
GOING to happen whether we like it or not.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.650
Using data from the 2010 census, the Census
Bureau announced that in the next 50 years,

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.810
there will be no single largest group.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.459
Instead, by 2020, a majority of the babies
born in the country will be non-white, and

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.319
what they call a majority-minority population.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.900
More diversity for everyone!

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.090
Plus 1 to melting pot?

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.120
In the end, "race" might be a thing we've
constructed, but if it's visible and in the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.090
open, society is more fair, less racist, more
educated, more melty and more powerful.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.370
Sounds like a pretty good place to live and
if emojis are one small step in that direction,

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.850
let's do it!
