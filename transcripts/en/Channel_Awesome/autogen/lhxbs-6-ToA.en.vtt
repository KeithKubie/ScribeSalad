mixed bag and I say that because like a
lot of the stuff in it is some of the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
lot of the stuff in it is some of the
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.420

the worst because we still have the
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.319

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.570
it's the best but I do think it has kind
of like the worst and best elements in

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580
of like the worst and best elements in
 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.170

yes the sort get into the nitty-gritty
 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.810
yes the sort get into the nitty-gritty
of it it does not go too much into the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820
of it it does not go too much into the
 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.229
of it it does not go too much into the
politics of how we came to be at least

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239
politics of how we came to be at least
 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.090
politics of how we came to be at least
why it starts out it's something like a

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100
why it starts out it's something like a
 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.220
why it starts out it's something like a
couple days before the first purge is

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230
couple days before the first purge is
 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.410
couple days before the first purge is
gonna start and at first I didn't like

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420
gonna start and at first I didn't like
 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.870
gonna start and at first I didn't like
that I wanted to see kind of you know

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880
that I wanted to see kind of you know
 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.670
that I wanted to see kind of you know
people in suits talking about how

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680
people in suits talking about how
 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.050
people in suits talking about how
they're gonna do this and stuff like

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060
they're gonna do this and stuff like
 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.130
they're gonna do this and stuff like
that but then the more I thought about

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140
that but then the more I thought about
 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.680
that but then the more I thought about
it I'm kinda glad they didn't because I

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690
it I'm kinda glad they didn't because I
 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.699
it I'm kinda glad they didn't because I
think it would've been too predictable

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709
think it would've been too predictable
 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.070
think it would've been too predictable
if anything the way this works is it

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080
if anything the way this works is it
 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.050
if anything the way this works is it
kind of works backwards where the purge

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060
kind of works backwards where the purge
 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.789
kind of works backwards where the purge
is gonna happen and then you see kind of

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799
is gonna happen and then you see kind of
 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.140

kind of keeping an eye on everything and
the scientist really is doing it mostly

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.630
the scientist really is doing it mostly
 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.060
the scientist really is doing it mostly
for the science even though it's it's

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070
for the science even though it's it's
 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.820
for the science even though it's it's
kind of it's a psychotic idea you know

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830
kind of it's a psychotic idea you know
 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.460
kind of it's a psychotic idea you know
it's still you know but she really is in

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.470
it's still you know but she really is in
 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.740
it's still you know but she really is in
it you know because the research has

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.750
it you know because the research has
 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.990
it you know because the research has
shown this and and my numbers have shown

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000
shown this and and my numbers have shown
 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.530
shown this and and my numbers have shown
this so this should happen so the

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:12.540
this so this should happen so the
 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.380
this so this should happen so the
build-up to this is probably the best of

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:15.390
build-up to this is probably the best of
 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.090
build-up to this is probably the best of
any of the purge movies because you know

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.100
any of the purge movies because you know
 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.430

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.240
to do it but you know they say the
reason in the opening and then they get

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:20.250
reason in the opening and then they get
 

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.830
reason in the opening and then they get
more to the main reason later which

of like seeing where some of these
 

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.809
of like seeing where some of these
things get going and where they come

00:09:32.809 --> 00:09:32.819
things get going and where they come
 

00:09:32.819 --> 00:09:34.489
things get going and where they come
from even though they're they're not

00:09:34.489 --> 00:09:34.499
from even though they're they're not
 

00:09:34.499 --> 00:09:36.199
from even though they're they're not
surprising but they're still cool to see

00:09:36.199 --> 00:09:36.209
surprising but they're still cool to see
 

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:41.090
surprising but they're still cool to see
uh but then you got stuff like the

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:41.100
uh but then you got stuff like the
 

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.069
uh but then you got stuff like the
biggest problem with this movie is the

00:09:43.069 --> 00:09:43.079
biggest problem with this movie is the
 

00:09:43.079 --> 00:09:46.730
biggest problem with this movie is the
tone because which is always kind of

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:46.740
tone because which is always kind of
 

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.009
tone because which is always kind of
been an issue with the purge movies by

00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:49.019
been an issue with the purge movies by
 

00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:51.379
been an issue with the purge movies by
me for the most part it's like it wants

00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:51.389
me for the most part it's like it wants
 

00:09:51.389 --> 00:09:54.590
me for the most part it's like it wants
to be creepy disturbing and it like an

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600
to be creepy disturbing and it like an
 

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.179
to be creepy disturbing and it like an
exploitation movie and like I said the

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:56.189
exploitation movie and like I said the
 

00:09:56.189 --> 00:09:57.319
exploitation movie and like I said the
first one I didn't think really worked

00:09:57.319 --> 00:09:57.329
first one I didn't think really worked
 

00:09:57.329 --> 00:09:59.239
first one I didn't think really worked
on that but but they got better as they

00:09:59.239 --> 00:09:59.249
on that but but they got better as they
 

00:09:59.249 --> 00:10:01.850
on that but but they got better as they
went along and this one still has that

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:01.860
went along and this one still has that
 

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.819
went along and this one still has that
exploitation angle down but then they'll

00:10:04.819 --> 00:10:04.829
exploitation angle down but then they'll
 

00:10:04.829 --> 00:10:05.929
exploitation angle down but then they'll
do stuff like they'll throw in this

00:10:05.929 --> 00:10:05.939
do stuff like they'll throw in this
 

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.790

00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:38.679
but I think you kind of know that's got
 

00:20:38.679 --> 00:20:40.500
but I think you kind of know that's got

exploitation movie and and even in a

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:46.900
exploitation movie and and even in a
 

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.440
exploitation movie and and even in a
strange way when it does get so obvious

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:49.450
strange way when it does get so obvious
 

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.690

with the commentary and it does
 

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.330
with the commentary and it does
obviously date it I feel like that also

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:54.340
