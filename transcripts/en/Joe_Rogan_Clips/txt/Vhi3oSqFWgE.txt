Speaker 1:          00:00          Here's an interesting idea. Why do we die at all? Why is natural selection never given us an immortal species? Have you ever thought about that? Yeah. Yeah, I have. I have never reached a conclusion, but I always figured you live long enough. We'll, especially up until recent history, only long enough to recognize it. It was all crazy hustle. It's a more philosophical, I'm looking for a scientific answer. Here's, here's one answer for why we're not immortal. So if you think about it, why would natural selection not have created a creature that lived forever, right? That'd be why. Why should we die? Yeah. Okay, so here's the one answers. It's not knowing for sure if this is the answer, but this is a good answer. Imagine there's the two different kinds of things that can kill you. Intrinsic Causes, an extrinsic causes, so things inside your body that result in you dying, defects, diseases and so forth, or things outside your body, like accidents, lightening strikes, trees fall, and you just die and so forth because it's impossible to eliminate all extrinsic causes because some people are going to die from accidents.

Speaker 1:          01:09          It would be inefficient from the point of view of evolution to evolve to be immortal. Because we would have all this capacity to be immortal. We would have these body's capable of immortality, which let's say would be evolutionarily demanding, like to evolve anything like an I or a brain or strong, any, any quality, lactase, right? We, like we talked about earlier, you, you don't have lactase persistence into adulthood because it's not needed. So evolution doesn't waste anything. There'd be no reason for that. So there'd be no that there would, uh, there, there would be no reason. The argument goes to evolve in mortality because inevitably some people would be killed eventually by accidents anyway. So unless you can create a world in which there are no accidents, there are no extrinsic causes of death, it would be inefficient from an evolutionary point of view to evolve in mortality.

Speaker 1:          02:01          So death, the reason we die naturally, some people think is that the reason we die naturally is that there are unnatural causes of death in the world, like accidents. If we could eliminate the unnatural causes so that nowhere, no, no time ever where we ever killed by trees falling or lightening strikes or things like that. Then actually over time we would evolve to live indefinitely. This is the theory. It's crazy idea is fascinating, but do you think that nature had that sort of sort of foresight? He was not a foresight, but that's how natural selection works. Think about like if I have suddenly magically transformed your body at great expense to make you capable of immortality and then two days from now you're hit by a bus. I've wasted all that effort. But if you only done to one person, you wasted that effort. If you did it to other people, you have the potential to create an incredibly wise person with a thousand years of life and experience and education and learning die.

Speaker 1:          03:04          He also had guy so everyone eventually would die for in these extrinsic causes. So perhaps lot, well, no, that's, that's, that's the assumption in the model. If it's not, perhaps if in fact there are no extrinsic, if in fact there is a world in which you're never struck by lightning, never hit by a bus, never a tree branch. Right. Then, uh, then the theory is that we would have evolved to be a mortal. So that's almost like the, the life that you live, you're inevitably going to get killed by extrinsic causes. Yes. If you extend that life to a thousand years, then it's absolutely going to happen. Yes. Therefore, why bother? That's just living in a bubble. Just terrified of the world falling rocks language in the entry. Yeah. But you can't transport, you can't take this theory and this model and apply it to an individual in an individual life. It's about our species evolved. It's not about how you should live your life. I mean, it's also true. I don't think you should live your life afraid.
