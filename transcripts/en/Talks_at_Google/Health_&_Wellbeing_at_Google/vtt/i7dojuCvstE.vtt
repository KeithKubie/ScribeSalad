[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.880
SPEAKER: Irit is a wellness
consultant, engineer, a mother,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.110
and a wife.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.005
During her 15 years of
meditation experience,

00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:17.540
she had peaceful moments
that gave her time

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.190
to hear her thoughts
and self-talk.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.430
She then realized the power that
her own thoughts had on her.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.160
This helped her
develop a unique tool

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.930
based on research
that can help others

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.700
develop a positive mindset and
utilize their full potential.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.081
Today, this took, which
is called ThinkUp,

00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:43.980
has become the most popular app
for motivation ad affirmations

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.710
in the app store.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.910
IRIT WALD: Hi, everyone.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.000
I'm Irit Wald and
I would like to--

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.820
before I will talk about
myself and everything--

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.745
I would like to start
with something funny.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.800
A very wealthy man invites all
the people in the neighborhood

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.450
to come to his wealthy party.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.270
And inside his house, that was
a pool full with alligators

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.580
and sharks.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.150
And he said, the one that
will swim across the pool

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.790
will get whatever he wants.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.770
So there was a huge silence,
and then he heard one splash,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.510
and someone started to swim,
swim, swim across the pool.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.356
Get out of the pool,
tried to calm his breath.

00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:40.880
So he arrived to
this man and he said,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.550
young man, you're
the bravest man

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.570
I have ever seen
in my entire life.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.920
What do you want in return?

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.370
So the young man said,
I want only one thing.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.750
I would like to know who is
the guy that throw me in?

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.240
So with life, sometimes
things happen.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.400
And in life, sometimes we get
inside pools full of alligators

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.090
and sharks and this
pool is dangerous for us

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.910
and there is a lot of
challenges and a lot

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.370
of obstacles in our life.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.590
And it happens.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.240
I don't even say for one minute
that life just happened to us.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.420
I think we have
control over our life.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.530
Yet sometimes
things happen to us.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:42.080
So the main of this talk is to
help you overcome difficulties

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.400
in a way that will
help you get better

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.110
results in any situation.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.410
And the most important thing is
how we overcome the challenges.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.350
It's very nice to
overcome a challenge

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.310
and to be so tired
and so powerless.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.700
But it's not the main
business of life.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.330
All we need to do is to
develop the right mindset

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.530
and to know what and how we
can practice on a daily basis.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.560
What can we do in
order to overcome

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:23.075
life, winners, successful, and
with a lot of happy moments?

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.340
One more story before we start.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.210
One evening, an elderly
chief talking to his grandson

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.260
about a battle between two
wolves inside our head.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.990
So he said, son, inside
every head of every person,

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.260
there are two wolves.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:53.840
One of them is evil, is
angry, is hate, is fear.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.450
It's low self-esteem.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.200
The other one is love, is
compassion, is empathy,

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.840
is giving.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.050
So the grandson just stop
and say, hey, hey, hey,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.820
which wolf wins?

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.060
So the grandfather
just smile and said,

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.850
the one that you feed.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.800
So all we need to understand
is how to feed the right one.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.470
What to do in our life
and how to practice

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.050
our mind, our body, everything.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.980
How to practice
our self in order

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.990
to feed the right wolf, to
overcome every challenge

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.750
in the way that
will encourage us,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.030
uplift us, and make
us a better person,

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.355
a better version of ourself.

00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:46.520
OK.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.770
So let's stop all the story and
talk a little bit about you.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.330
Everyone of you got this
near him, beside him.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.590
And I'd like you to write
in the upper-right corner,

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.540
just in the upper-right corner.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.520
I would like to diagnose you.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.530
Not me, you diagnose yourself.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.890
So if you need to--

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:15.290
if I ask you, how many positive
versus negative thoughts

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.070
you have a day, if you
need to evaluate yourself,

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.530
just on thought,
just throw a number.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.710
What is the first
number that you think?

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.140
50/50 positive/negative?

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.960
60 positive, 40 negative?

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.960
Maybe 40 positive, 60 negative?

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.255
What do you think?

00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:44.240
How do you think positive versus
negative emotion, thoughts

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.040
you have a day?

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.240
Just throw a number.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.990
What do you think?

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.319
Because it's in your head.

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:51.110
You are the only one
that knows the answer.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.110
No one but you knows it.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.670
Did you write?

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:58.170
OK.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.895
So after you write it and it's
written down on the paper,

00:06:00.895 --> 00:06:03.690
I would like to know,
how much is 60/40?

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.660
60 positive, 40 negative?

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.450
How much is 60/40?

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.730
How much is 50/50?

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.590
No one 50/50?

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.590
OK.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.365
60 negative, 40 positive.

00:06:18.365 --> 00:06:20.310
How much is more negative?

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.660
Hi.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.410
More negative.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.270
OK.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.470
So the funny thing--

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.040
it's not really funny,
but the funny thing

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.280
is 77% of the thoughts
of average person head

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.240
is negative.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:44.130
77% of our thoughts
are negative,

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.900
meaning that we never reach
our full potential, never,

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.410
with 77%.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.910
Never.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.650
It means that-- for the
people that see us--

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.690
it means that if we don't
practice on a daily basis

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:09.400
and rewire our brain
day after day after day,

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.400
we just keep being
our mediocrity.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.810
I'm not saying that you
are just in the middle.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:24.370
I just said that you can be
much better, much better.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:25.445
OK.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.070
Let's continue.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.360
There's five levels
of self-talk and I

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.980
would ask you to diagnose
yourself, so listen carefully.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.280
Self-talk is the way
that we talked ourself

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.440
on a daily basis, what
we say to ourself.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.900
This is self-talk.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.320
So there are five levels.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.950
I would like to know,
what level are you in?

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.660
The first one is
I'm not good enough.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.910
I can't do it.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:57.900
I can't do it.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.280
It's too hard.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.540
I'm not capable enough.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.310
This is the first one.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.860
The second one, I
shouldn't do it.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:09.220
Shouldn't do it and
it was a bad decision.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.010
This is the second one.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:15.450
The third one is I'm never
going to smoke again, eat sugar

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:19.620
again, I'm going to
exercise every day

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.100
or I'm never going to
procrastinate again.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.660
This is the third level.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.230
This is important.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.130
The fourth one is just positive.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.840
I'm grateful, thankful,
my life is good.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.360
I'm happy with who I am.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.000
I'm happy with what
happened in my life.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.799
This is the fourth one.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:41.370
And the fifth one, we are
all one consciousness.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.300
Now think about, which
level are you in?

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.620
Write it down.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.670
Write it down.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.310
You have-- hey, you have this.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.550
You have-- write down.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.700
Which level are you in?

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:02.170
Because when you know what
happens inside your head,

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.790
you can start to work with it.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.930
Otherwise, it just flows in
the space and you don't--

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.300
you didn't arrive
here just to know.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.910
You arrived here
to do something.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.470
So which level are you?

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.120
Did you write it down?

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.480
OK.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.470
So sadly, most of
us are in level 1.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:27.700
Most of us, all the
time just beat ourself.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.020
We never remember
what our success

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.430
is because after we pass the
success, we move forward.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.990
We don't remember.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:40.450
And our success is the
basic of who we are.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:46.660
This is the basic
of our character.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.060
The basic of our character.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.730
It means that the first one
is just Negative it only

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.930
destroys us.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:59.190
Nothing good can happen
with this first level.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.750
Nothing good.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.390
The second one is
better, but I would

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.020
like to explain a bit
what's better with it.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.750
I shouldn't do it means that
you focus your mind on the thing

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.020
that you don't don't want to do.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:17.430
But you don't tell your
brain what he should do.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:21.030
So your brain has
a lot of options,

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.920
yet you don't focus
in on the right thing.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.420
Therefore, you never
reach the place

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.660
you want to reach because you
don't tell your brain what

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.230
you want.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.420
The third one, I'm never
going to smoke again.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.240
Here, you start to have
responsibility on your life.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.985
You understand what you want.

00:10:40.985 --> 00:10:43.050
You understand what
you don't want.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.850
And if you understand
what you want and you

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:50.340
run in the right direction,
you decide, you visualize.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.690
You have a plan.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.350
You move one step forward,
you move other step forward.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.610
You never give up.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.810
You win everything.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.270
This is the way
dreams come true.

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:04.020
This is the way to succeed in
anything that you want in life.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.890
This is the way.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:05.730
Sure thing.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.360
Never give up, it will
arrive in the end.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.590
But when you understand that
you don't need to do something,

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.500
again, you train
your brain or you

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.540
focus of brain on
the wrong direction.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.110
So you just lose energy.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.810
The first one is positive.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:30.600
You understand that you
have wins, you have losses.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.490
In those losses,
you learn things

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.140
that you need to do
in order to become

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.510
a better version of yourself.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.910
And it really doesn't
matter what you achieve.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.390
It matter what you became.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:47.800
And if you put this
information in your head

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.645
that winning or losing,
it really doesn't matter.

00:11:50.645 --> 00:11:54.370
It matter what you learned.

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:59.200
And the fifth one is just
byproduct of the fourth one,

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.480
so we will continue.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.750
So now basically, you
have your measure.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.340
You know how much
percent that you

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.170
have positive versus negative.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:14.560
You know what is your
self-talk, what is

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.210
the self-talk inside your head.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.290
Now you can work with it.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.700
You understand what you do in
order to move one step forward.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.950
Now I can tell you one thing.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:28.390
That if you practice 10
minutes a day, when you sleep--

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.790
you don't even
need to be awake--

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.100
if you practice
10 minutes a day,

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.370
you can upgrade
your thought in 40%.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:42.100
I mean you can uplift
yourself or have a better

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:46.750
performance in 40% by 10 minutes
a day when you go to sleep.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.300
So close your eyes for a minute.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.450
I know that it's not easy, but
close your eyes for a minute.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.280
Don't go to sleep.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:02.730
And imagine the most
successful person on earth.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.530
Imagine.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:08.640
It can be someone
from movies or it

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.950
can be someone from
your family or it

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:16.520
can be just imaginary
guy, girl, whatever.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.710
Think a minute.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.400
How do you define success?

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.250
What is success in your eyes?

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:27.390
In order to be very
specific, to bring

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.630
your thoughts and your brain
to a certain direction,

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.840
you need to know what you want.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.250
So how do you define success?

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.140
Why does he or she
become so successful?

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:41.640
Why?

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.350
What is the reason?

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.610
Think about it.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:49.280
And what kind of skill
does he or she have?

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.830
Now please open your
eyes and tell me

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.100
how do you define success?

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.930
What is success?

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.480
What is success in your eyes?

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.640
What it means to be successful?

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.350
What is?

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:02.805
For example.

00:14:02.805 --> 00:14:03.930
AUDIENCE: Rich.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:05.420
IRIT WALD: Money.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:09.060
Let's call it financial freedom.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.180
Financial freedom.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.370
This is nice.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.750
OK.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.610
What more is to be successful?

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.350
What do you-- yes.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:18.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:19.780
IRIT WALD: OK.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.480
What more?

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.080
AUDIENCE: Being impactful.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.210
Having an effect on the world.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.580
IRIT WALD: To influence others.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.580
Yeah, it's easier word for me.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.640
OK.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.140
Yes.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.690
AUDIENCE: To live
with a purpose.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.310
IRIT WALD: To live
with a purpose.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.900
Anyone else?

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.940
Maybe to have a
balance in your life

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.910
that you'll be very
successful and very

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:50.540
good family member, very
good person, to help society.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.140
Maybe, maybe.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.455
This is mine, but
doesn't say anything.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.730
So we understand,
most of us understand

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:11.020
that to train our body,
to eat healthy food,

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:17.630
to exercise, to drink water,
is very important for the body.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.810
But what about
detoxing the mind?

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:25.400
It's very nice to
eat healthy food,

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.290
yet it's very
important to practice

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.200
our mind on a daily basis.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:38.780
Because without it, you can't
reach your full potential.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.480
And if you are
here, Googlers, you

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.310
want to work at
your full potential

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.740
because you are in the
best company ever, right?

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:51.420
So to train your body, to
exercise, to drink water,

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:56.850
and to eat good food, to eat
healthy food, it's not enough.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:01.170
And this is the reason why 77%--

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.690
sorry-- only 25%.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:08.326
25% of the people
right now on Earth

00:16:08.326 --> 00:16:11.360
are dealing with depression.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.870
This is the reason.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.940
Because people
don't understand why

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.720
they should invest
in their mind.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.870
Why they should practice
on a daily basis.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.240
This is the reason.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.520
This is the reason why
people are sad, why people

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.960
can't come out of the bed.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.580
And think about it.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.800
Everyone loses.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.920
The society loses, you
lose, your company loses.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.650
Everyone loses.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.650
So being positive
or having the best

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.360
mindset that will take
you one step forward

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.255
is not just for you.

00:16:47.255 --> 00:16:48.760
It's just for everyone.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.930
It's for your family.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.940
It's for your kids.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.200
It's for yourself.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.370
It's for the society.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.260
It's for everyone.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.840
This is the reason
it's so important.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.010
You can get out of the room and
say, OK, it was a nice talk,

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:07.359
but I don't want to practice.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:11.260
Because it brings you, it
leads you to mediocrity.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:15.490
And you are not part of the
world that live mediocre lives.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.246
You're Googlers, right?

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:18.745
OK.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.730
So thinking all the
time negative thoughts

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.530
destroys everything.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.000
Destroys our life.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.900
And as I told you before,
destroys the society,

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.390
destroys everything.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:39.360
And means that you say to
yourself, I'm not smart enough.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.830
He's smarter.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:41.450
He's better.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:45.690
Who think to himself this
kind of thought today?

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:51.900
He's smarter, she's prettier,
I'm not good enough.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:56.190
Everything about I'm
a loser, I'm a loser.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:57.840
Everyone is better than me.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.160
This kind of thought destroys
your self-confidence.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:08.820
Destroys the person that you
can be, destroys your potential.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.240
And if you want to change
it, all you need to do

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:17.640
is practice because this is
your life and it's your show

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.270
and you are the master of this
life and you need to practice.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:27.090
Not need you, I offer you to
practice and to help yourself

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.480
become a better version.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.230
Because you need to live
with yourself everyday.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:33.730
No one else, just you.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:37.180
I would like to tell you
a bit about my story.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:42.310
When I delivered my
third son [INAUDIBLE],,

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:46.480
I decided to deliver
him without painkillers.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:53.910
Now, for the guys in the
room, I would like to explain.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:58.850
Think about the root canal
treatment without pain killer

00:18:58.850 --> 00:18:59.980
ten times.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.010
This is labor.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.510
OK?

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.790
So this is a very
painful situation.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.320
And I don't know
if it was mistake

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.480
or not to do it
without painkiller,

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.410
but this wasn't my goal.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:15.820
The goal was to have the
delivery without painkiller

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.460
and not to suffer.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.710
I didn't want to suffer.

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:23.860
I wanted the pain
pass through me

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.910
and I finish this
labor like nothing.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.885
This was the goal.

00:19:28.885 --> 00:19:31.420
Next time that I go
in to have a baby,

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.000
I'm not going to do it anymore.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.780
This is one time.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:41.330
But I wanted to
enjoy the experience.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.810
So I delivered my
third [INAUDIBLE],,

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.050
during this delivery,
it was very painful.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:48.850
Of course, I forgot everything.

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.730
I didn't remember who I am.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:55.400
I just wanted these drugs.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.060
But then my husband reminded
me that I practiced.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.930
Over nine months, I practiced
this minute, this hours.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.880
I practiced for nine months.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.180
And I had a meditation
trick for myself

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:11.710
with my voice that I told
myself that I can handle it.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:15.820
And this is pain and it
goes away and I don't have--

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.182
I don't need to worry.

00:20:17.182 --> 00:20:17.890
It will leave me.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.060
Yes, it's painful,
yet I can handle it.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:24.970
And I just put it on
my ear and lie down

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:26.860
and some magic happened.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:30.040
I just take a big
breath in, listen

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.890
to myself in very powerful
voice, while I trained

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.220
myself for nine months.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:40.990
And then the pain left
me and I stayed alive

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.410
and just take a big breath
when the contraction arrived

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.800
and let the pain leave me again.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.420
And then I understood it.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.040
In a minute, I
understood it, how

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.960
to control the
pain, how to let go.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.690
I understood so many
important things,

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:03.020
and that's what I want
to share with you.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:08.920
So when I came home with my
baby, I had three victories.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.360
One, I had my adorable,
incredible, amazing, wonderful

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.770
boy.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:19.990
The second one, I felt
that I'm a winner,

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:25.480
that I have a power over my
life and I can do anything.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.290
And the third one,
that my app, ThinkUp,

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:33.490
which we will talk
about in a few minutes,

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:39.500
released for the first
time to app store.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.810
And the version was
approved and everything

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.835
and had her own life.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.460
We started with this
app and we heard

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.820
so many successful stories.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.030
Again, I'm not trying to--

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.572
I don't want you to
download the app.

00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:05.863
If you want to download the
app and you think that this

00:22:05.863 --> 00:22:07.150
is the best tool, you do it.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:11.060
If you can stand in front of
a mirror and say, I'm good,

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.799
every day, I'm getting better
and better, it's fine with me.

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:14.840
It's not selling the app.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:20.510
But I would like to
tell you my experience.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.280
We heard so many
successful stories

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.960
about people with
depression that

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.110
released the symptoms of
depression using the app.

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:32.900
And we have people that
relieve the symptom of grief.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.500
We had even one lady
that talked to us

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:42.560
about preparing her body to
surgery, to cancer surgery,

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.180
with our app.

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:49.630
But the most powerful
one for me was an infant

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:56.480
arrived to Stanford Hospital to
have some surgery in his heart.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:00.020
And during the
preparation, all his body

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:05.660
got [INAUDIBLE] with a virus
and the situation was very bad.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.600
He's two years old,
this kid, Jonathan.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:13.070
And the parents were
devastated and they are so sad

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.950
and they didn't know what to do
and I really tried to help them

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:17.510
and I didn't know why.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.264
Anyway, I arrived
to the hospital.

00:23:19.264 --> 00:23:20.930
They're a part of the
Israeli community,

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:24.890
so we know everything
about everyone.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:30.590
And I arrived to the hospital
and I told them, listen,

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:36.976
instead of listening all
the day of your complaints,

00:23:36.976 --> 00:23:41.240
if the baby could listen
to his mother encourage him

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.680
on a daily basis while
he was in the hospital,

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.800
while he was hospitalized, he
can listen to her, my dear son,

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.850
I know that it's a very, very
difficult moment for you.

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:56.510
But I really want to be
with you and it's important

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:58.100
for me to hug you
and to kiss you

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.860
and daddy wants to pick you
up, blah blah blah blah blah.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.500
And after one week
of listening to--

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:09.620
of making him listen to
this audio, he just woke up.

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.920
So I don't know if this is the
reason, but one thing I know

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:19.430
that all that common traits,
all the in common of all

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:23.960
those stories is this app.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.760
We can take a big breath in.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.320
Take your hands down.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.920
We can do a little meditation.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.210
Take a big breath in and out.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.235
Close your eyes,
release your hands.

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:41.210
Close it.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:42.800
We didn't come to
waste your time.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.100
We came here to
improve your ways.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.805
So take a big breath in and out.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.050
OK.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:58.010
Every day, I move
one step forward.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.150
I believe in myself.

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:05.620
I have the ability to succeed.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:10.442
Life is good.

00:25:10.442 --> 00:25:12.700
I'm grateful.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:17.720
Take a big breath in and out.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.100
I know who I am and it is good.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:26.800
Every day, in every way, I'm
getting better and better.

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.540
I feel a deep sense
of satisfaction.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:40.530
I can accomplish anything
I set my mind to.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:42.928
I was born to be successful.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:51.840
I love myself, respect myself,
and accept myself exactly

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.130
as I am.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:59.040
Just take a big
breath in and release.

00:26:07.284 --> 00:26:08.170
[MUSIC STOPS]

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:13.330
Think what can
become of you if you

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:19.510
train your brain over and
over again based on research.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:22.090
This is so easy to do.

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:27.280
It will empower you
that inside your head,

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.410
you have the
thought all the time

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:33.710
that you are born
to be successful.

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:40.070
You are born, you deserve
all the good in your life.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:44.630
If you train yourself to be
grateful on a daily basis,

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:48.080
you increase your
self-confidence,

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.590
you increase the level of
satisfaction from life,

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:55.460
and it will make you a better
employee, better husband

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:56.520
or wife.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.730
It will help you to do
anything in your life.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:04.880
It encourages you to be
a better person, a better

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.010
version of you.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:12.080
Now, if you use your voice,
your brain understands it more.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:17.450
And if you choose your music, it
releases dopamine in your body

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:22.890
and it engages your
emotional part of the brain.

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.360
So basically, what
I'm saying here,

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:30.230
this is kind of a personalized
meditation only for you

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:34.790
that will be good only for you.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.152
Let's talk about research.

00:27:37.152 --> 00:27:38.610
So there are
thousands of thousands

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:42.620
of researches talking
about positive psychology

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:48.815
and the body and your
success and your finance.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.460
And there is a lot.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.770
I will say only a few.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:59.240
So the first one that you,
of course, can read about

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:05.810
is about positive thinkers
cope better with stress

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:08.510
and have a better performance.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:10.790
And I'm not going to say--

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.230
I'm not going to explain
every one of them,

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:19.700
but the one that interested me,
it's about your immune system.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:28.850
So researchers show
that activation

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:35.900
in the brain area associated
with negative emotion

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.080
leads to--

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.390
oh, I forgot the word.

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:45.050
Leads to a weaker--

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:46.630
to a weaker immune system.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:47.970
Bluh, I forgot.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.460
Sorry.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:53.720
So it means that if you
have negative thoughts,

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.880
your immune system is weaker.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:00.230
So they took two groups
of people, very optimistic

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.080
and very pessimistic people.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.960
Both of the group
give nasal spray

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:10.160
and what they showed
in this research

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.880
was that the group
with positive emotion

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.760
had two times less
likely to get the flu.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:22.510
Means that if you train
yourself for positivity,

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:24.530
you will be healthier.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:27.260
And flu is just something
small, but everyone

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.620
want to be healthier, right?

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.830
So this is very
interesting research.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:36.940
But again, there are a lot,
a lot, a lot of researches.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.730
The one that interests me--
of course, you hear about it,

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:43.910
I know that you had a lecture
on it and talks on it in Google.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:45.700
And this is the neuroplasticity.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:51.390
Neuroplasticity is a field
that proves, with no doubt,

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:54.700
that the brain can
change his wire

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:59.500
and his structure when
you think positive.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.540
Means that if you train
yourself on a daily basis--

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.410
because repetition is
the key for success.

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:08.060
Think about it.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:11.230
Every day, you come to
work, you work for 9, 10--

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:14.130
I don't know, 11, afraid
to think about it.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:18.060
But you work for, let's
say, 10 hours, 9 hours,

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.520
yeah, and you train
yourself over and over

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.740
again to write code, to do
the thing that you do all day.

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.590
But to train your brain
to think positive,

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:31.570
you don't even have time for it.

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:33.150
So I offer you--

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:37.480
neuroplasticity is a
very interesting field.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.080
But there is another
research, very interesting,

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.740
about poverty versus wealthy.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:46.980
And this man, Tom
Corley, this is

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.980
the guy that did the research.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:57.750
He talked to 233 people that
are very wealthy versus 128

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.040
people that are very poor.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:03.900
And he shows that all
the people, that wealthy

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:10.530
have 16 things in common,
16 thoughts in common.

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:14.190
I will talk only
about five, but there

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:18.690
are 16 in common traits
to all the people

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.640
that have a lot, a
lot, a lot of money.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.970
So the first one, never give up.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:25.440
Doesn't matter what happened.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.630
Never give up.

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:29.190
Focus your mind on a goal.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:32.130
Visualize it, move
one step forward,

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.010
move the other step forward.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.260
Never give up.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.210
It doesn't work, go
to this direction.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.940
It doesn't work, just
move to this direction.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:47.340
As much as you keep doing
and moving and never give up,

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.250
this is the key.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:51.620
The second, avoid toxic people.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.030
Very rich people,
very wealthy people

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:57.395
understand that people
that don't believe in them,

00:31:57.395 --> 00:32:02.100
that don't encourage them, don't
move them one step forward,

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:05.700
are not part of their
relation friends.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:06.960
And think about it.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:12.030
Our peers are so important.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:16.860
All what they are talking
about stay inside our head, so

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.420
think about it.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.740
Choose the right friends
that believe in you.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:26.670
Now, I'm not saying just
to throw away friends, no.

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:34.590
I just say, put your focus on
the people that uplift you.

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:37.890
The third one, find
your limiting beliefs.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:39.000
What it means?

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.100
It's not so difficult
as you think.

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.370
It's easier than you think.

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.300
Every one of us has
limiting beliefs.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.840
Like money don't grow on trees.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.420
This is limiting beliefs.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:55.800
Like I can't do it.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.960
Like if you're rich,
you are miserable.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.490
You will never be rich if you
think that if you are rich,

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:04.545
you will be miserable.

00:33:04.545 --> 00:33:05.290
Never.

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:08.910
It doesn't matter how
much money you will have,

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:10.960
doesn't matter how much
luck you will have.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:15.300
You will never be
rich if you think so.

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:20.350
So I offer you to find
your limiting beliefs.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:23.610
In our workshop,
we work exactly how

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:25.390
to find those limiting beliefs.

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:28.350
What are the steps that we
need to do in order to know

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:30.450
what are your limiting beliefs?

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:33.250
You, every one of you,
has limiting beliefs.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:35.070
We can help you to find them.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:38.130
And then, when you find
them, you can use ThinkUp.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:41.470
This is our solution
to change them.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:45.992
So our baseline is
we know how to solve

00:33:45.992 --> 00:33:46.950
these limiting beliefs.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:49.350
This, we know, because
we have the tools.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:51.450
But first, you
need to find them.

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:54.190
And to find them, what
are your limiting beliefs,

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:55.680
we offer our workshop.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.220
But you can do it with a coach,
you can do it with a friend,

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.030
you can do it with yourself.

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:05.580
You can do it in any way.

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.710
Eliminate bad luck
from your vocabulary.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.040
Life is not luck.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.666
It doesn't just happen to you.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.750
It doesn't happen to you.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:19.889
You created your life,
therefore luck is not--

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:22.050
it can be one time
luck, two time luck,

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.449
but it's not on a daily basis.

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:25.590
Life is life.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.730
Ups, downs, that's it.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.389
And know your main
purpose is one.

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:34.530
Purpose is so important.

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:39.770
You can miss your life doing
something that you don't love.

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:43.699
You can miss so precious time.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:47.510
So no what is your purpose
and go through this purpose

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:51.860
and do the thing
that you are unique.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:52.370
OK.

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:56.610
So a bit about our solutions.

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:59.810
So let's summarize
what we say until now.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:00.510
Two things.

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:02.520
The first one, if you
want to be successful,

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.790
you need to condition
your mind for success.

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:08.060
You need to understand how
successful people think.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.040
You need to
understand what to do

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:14.510
and it's much easier
than you think.

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:18.020
Every thought you have, whether
it's conscious or subconscious

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.140
thoughts, determine
your self-talk.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:24.590
Negative self-talk can
sabotage and undermine

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:28.040
any effort in your life.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.040
So you need to control
your thought because this

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.100
is your show again.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.630
And because this is your
show and because you

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:39.050
are the main character
of this show,

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:43.490
try to delete completely
your negative thoughts

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:46.340
and replace them with
positive thought.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:50.300
And the third one is that we
have the solution for changing

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:52.590
our self-talk to positive.

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:56.270
So in our app, what you do
is you choose the new mindset

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:57.950
that you want to adopt.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.620
Record it in your own
voice because your voice

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:01.500
is so important.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.820
Your brain understands
your voice the most.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:08.960
It is personalized to you
and just you and no one

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.900
can use it because it's yours.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.810
You add your favorite
music because music, again,

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:20.680
engages your emotional part of
the brain, which is necessary.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:25.070
And you listen to it again and
again when you go to sleep.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:27.470
Now, why you go to sleep?

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:30.029
First, you don't waste time.

00:36:30.029 --> 00:36:31.820
The most precious thing
that you have right

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.280
now is the time, right?

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:38.990
So if you don't have time
for it, do it when you sleep.

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:40.970
You can do it when
you go out with a dog.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:42.906
You can do it when
you fold laundry.

00:36:42.906 --> 00:36:44.530
You can do it when
you clean the house.

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:45.810
It really doesn't matter.

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:50.790
You can do it when you
work, in the background.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:55.750
And when your conscious mind
is not focused on this talk,

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.220
your subconscious
mind can start--

00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.860
he listens to it.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.840
And if you put it again
and again and again--

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.430
while you work, with headphones,
no one listens to it--

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:08.490
your mindset will change.

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:11.910
So it's something
that you can do.

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:14.600
All you need to do is
you need to understand

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.450
that that's what you want.

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:19.350
This is the plan,
this one step forward,

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:26.070
this is day after day after day
after day until you achieve it.

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:30.490
And not to achieve
it is not an option.

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:32.680
One thing that I
can tell you that--

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.300
the bad thing of--

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:40.300
if we need to talk about
the difficulties right now,

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.660
is only 3% of the
people in the world

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.535
can practice ThinkUp
on a daily basis.

[PERSON SNEEZES]

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.540

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:54.200
Only 3%, but you,
the one that's here

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:59.720
and the one that listens to
us, you are part of the 3%.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.130
It's not easy, you know?

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:03.200
Like it's not easy to do diet.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:09.420
It's not easy, even though we
just press on the Play button.

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:09.920
That's it.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.480
You don't need to do anything.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.210
Even though it would
be very difficult.

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:19.330
But you need to commit
that you're going to do it.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.960
And if you decide that
you're going to do it,

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.470
you're going to win it.

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:26.780
And this is the whole story.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:30.290
You just need to commit
because we have a lot--

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:31.700
you can read about it.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.100
As much as you read,
you understand how much

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.700
positivity is important to
your body, to your life,

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:38.900
to your children.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.910
How many of you
have children here?

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:44.360
OK.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.800
Most of you.

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:53.010
So part of us don't really
want to be good for ourself.

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:56.390
But for our kids,
it's different story.

00:38:56.390 --> 00:39:00.245
When we see that they
do something negative,

00:39:00.245 --> 00:39:02.000
it hurts us.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.690
We really want for our child.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:06.060
So think about your child.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:09.790
What will become of you if
you will be more positive?

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:12.100
What will become of them?

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.670
This is a good why because
sometimes, for yourself, you

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:19.760
don't do, good, for others,
it's something else.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:25.510
So if you decide to commit
that you want it and,

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:27.430
again, you can use
the free version.

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:30.070
It's not downloading, it's
not making money here.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:31.340
It's the purpose.

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:34.000
And the purpose is
to spread positivity

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.470
and this is my life mission.

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:40.510
And you are going to do it.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:45.240
You're going to do it
for my life mission.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.470
I'm just kidding, of course.

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:54.120
My kids train themself
on a daily basis

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:57.980
and this is very,
very important to me.

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:01.380
And what happened is that
they put it to themselves

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:05.730
when they go to sleep,
just press the Play button

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:06.720
and that's it.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.100
No more.

And right now, when I go out
with a phone, one of them

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.330
used my phone because
he doesn't have.

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:21.000
And when I go out, he put
a lot of notes in the house

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.820

put ThinkUp near his bed.

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:27.720
Think about every opportunity
you have in the way.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.780
Don't focus human
on the difficulties.

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:35.520
Try to be grateful on
anything that you have.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.500
Celebrate your victories,
like I told you,

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.700
with the small papers.

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.230
Put it in the drawer.

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:42.129
Every Friday, open the drawer.

00:43:42.129 --> 00:43:43.170
Look what happens to you.

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:46.750
You will become happier,
much more satisfied.

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:50.220
And practice positivity for
10 minutes a day with any tool

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.720
that you want.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:57.380
So put it on your tables and
remind you for one month.

00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:01.350
If after one month, doing
it day after day after day,

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:06.460
nothing happened to you, I
would like you to write me

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.340
and I will help you
personally, every one of you.

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:12.350
I will help you
reach your goals.

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:14.520
Deal?

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.230
Thank you.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:19.580
[APPLAUSE]
