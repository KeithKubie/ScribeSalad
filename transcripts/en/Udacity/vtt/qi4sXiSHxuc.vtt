00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Once again, congratulations.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You've learned about Aristotle's mistaken belief that objects

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
fall at a speed proportional to their mass,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and Galileo's more accurate description of motion--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that all objects fall at constant acceleration.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You can solve problems of motion in 1 and 2 dimensions

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and are able to calculate given only an objects initial speed and direction

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the exact path it will follow.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You now can fully describe how motion behaves.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Stay tuned for next week when we'll go to Cambridge University in England

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to know why motion occurs this way and investigate the actual causes of motion.

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
See you in class.
