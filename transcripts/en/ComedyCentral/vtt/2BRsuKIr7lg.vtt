Dorm enematainment.

Are you guys starving students?

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.362 align:start size:88% position:13%
Are you stripping to
pay tuition, because you

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:04.130

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.231 align:start size:63% position:38%
- No.
Not you.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.633
You look like a mighty duck.

- Actually it's dormtainment
It's not that hard.

Okay, listen. Here's

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:33.626

You're gonna do what

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:04.457
- I don't care.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.793
- You're a lot cuter in person.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:09.562

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:14.334

And I mean....anything.

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:20.206 align:start position:0%
- Listen, I don't know who told
you what. Or what you know.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:24.210 align:start size:97% position:3%
But I have a girlfriend,
okay? So you can't do nothing

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.479

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:29.983 align:start size:97% position:3%

We have Fiji, Perrier, Gatorade.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.962

- Gatorade.
- I'll take Gatorade.

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:48.635
You know my dad used

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:52.539
He'd be having all the

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.176
Thunderblast, Tornado
Wind, Ocean Salt, yeah.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.777
- Interesting.

00:02:57.777 --> 00:02:59.979 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You know I don't really like
telling people that though,

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.715 align:start position:0%
'cause then they only goin'
want me for my Gatorade connect.

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:05.852 align:start size:94% position:6%
You need a girl who goin'

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:19.732 align:start size:94% position:6%
Excuse me sir, do you know

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.201

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:26.439
Okay.

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:29.776 align:start size:81% position:19%

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:33.146
The Grim's comin' out my ass.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:35.548
Oh God.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.284

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:39.619

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:44.090
Give me the money,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.758 align:start size:81% position:19%
Put it through the
slit slut. Now!

00:03:45.758 --> 00:03:46.993
- Enough with the slut shaming.

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:48.094
Take the money.

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:49.596
- You know what they say bitch,

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:52.832
once you go black, we
don't want you back.

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.033
Alright, what else you guys got?

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:55.468
- I ain't got nothin'.

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:57.604 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What's this
shit, huh? A check?

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.872
Do I look like I
got a license, huh?

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.608 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You stupid peace of
shit, give me your watch!

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:03.176
- Hey man, my daddy
gave me this watch.

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:05.411 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Your daddy could
suck this fuckin' cock.

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:08.181
Just like you're gonna
suck both of these cocks.

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:10.483
(laughs) I'm out. Fuck you guys.

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:13.052
Kid and Play could suck a dick.

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:17.890 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Do you think I'm a slut?
I am.

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.327
- Ooh, that was fun.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:29.435
- Uh uh, uh uh, you are not
trying to leave already.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:34.140 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Listen,
Krist...Krist...Krista....

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.176 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Kristy!
- No, no, I got it, I got it.

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:40.546 align:start size:97% position:3%
I've been thinking, and
this isn't going to work out

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:42.148
between me and you.

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:45.151
- Just go.

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:46.219
- That's cool.

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:49.155
- Get out. (sighs)

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.227
(Carey pants and grunts)

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:59.032
- You like Gatorade?

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:02.135 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What the hell? Get
off of my friend.

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:05.705
He has a girlfriend.

00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:08.141
But I don't.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.810
- You just had sex
with my roommate.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.779
- We just broke up.

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.948
- [Chaz] You know
what I'm sayin?

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:18.084
I'm hungry again, man.

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:19.852
- Do you ever stop eating, dog?

00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:22.388 align:start size:94% position:6%
- No. Basically I got like
a Greek god of a body.

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:24.691 align:start size:97% position:3%
So Zeus came down like
"boop." There you go Chaz .

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:25.958
You know what I'm saying?

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.995 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Ain't that where
the car used to be at?

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:31.164
Like, I'm not trippin' right?

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.532
- Where's the car?

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:34.033
- Where's the car?

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.002 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Where's the car?
- [Amanuel] I thought y'all

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.203
was at the car.

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:38.504
- Y'all supposed
to stay by the car.

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:40.173
- Yeah, okay you
said that, but....

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.741
- Someone stole the car?
- Why you carrying Mike?

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:43.543 align:start size:84% position:16%
- He was sexually
assaulted by a woman.

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:46.646
(police sirens)

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:48.848
- Freeze BLACKstreet.

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.484
Make a move, I'll shoot you
right in your FUBU jeans.

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:53.586
Have you guys been robbing
check cashing places? Huh?

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:55.121
- No sir.
- No sir.

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.090
- You throw a gun in a
little white girl's face?

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.559
You got her all
scared and horny?

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:01.561
That little pervert
was freaking out.

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:03.596 align:start size:97% position:3%
You guys listen to some Lil'
Jon, get all cruncked up,

all fired up?
Start riding dirty?

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:07.800
Drinking that codeine shit?

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.936 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Officer, we had
nothing to do with that.

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:11.237 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Why'd I get a report
that you did that?

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:12.905 align:start size:84% position:16%
- That was the dick
sucking robber.

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:15.575
He was talking a lot about
sucking dick, I don't know.

00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:16.776 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What's up with
the little guy, huh?

00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:18.177 align:start size:84% position:16%
What are you smiling
at, little guy?

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:19.579
Turn down for what?

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:21.514
- I was helping my friend shit.

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:23.683 align:start size:97% position:3%
- He just held my butt
cheeks open while I was....

00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:25.118
- Whoomp, there it isn't.

00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:26.352
(mumbling on police radio)

00:06:26.352 --> 00:06:28.054 line:0%
- That's your problem,
Cam. You always playing.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.088
Stop playing!

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:30.022
- If they didn't leave the car,

00:06:30.022 --> 00:06:31.257
this would have never happened.

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:32.291 align:start size:81% position:19%
- They the ones
that left the car.

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:34.160 align:start size:88% position:13%
(arguing)
- Shut the fuck up, man.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.130
- Hey, Poo Tang Clan,
(knocks) knock it off!

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.565
