This is Jocko podcast number five with Echo Charles and me,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.130
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo,
Gerald [inaudible] evening.

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.610
Welcome to podcast number five.
Here we are.

4
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.370
Here we are number five.
Thank you everyone for joining us.

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.840
So tonight

6
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.270
I got asked on Twitter
a,

7
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.330
could you talk about coaching some people and that kind of prompted me to think

8
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:44.331
about something that I have pulled out in the past when I'm teaching some

9
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:46.650
leadership classes.

10
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.220
And what this is is to counseling notes that I wrote for sessions when I was

11
00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:04.161
trying to help a couple of seal leaders improve themselves and get better.

12
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.350
And the first one was for a seal that was a buddy of mine and who was a little

13
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:19.110
bit junior to me,
just a little bit junior and me in rank.

14
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.710
But you know,
because I was a prior enlisted seal,

15
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.130
I had actually been in the seal teams for a much longer time and this guy was a

16
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.620
real great,
great leader,
great guy,

17
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.570
and very passionate about Duna a solid job and very passionate about the seal

18
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:39.510
teams,
which is an awesome thing to see.

19
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.620
And with that passion,
and I've said this before,

20
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:47.460
sometimes your strength can be your weakness and sometimes he would get a little

21
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:51.270
bit too passionate about stuff and a little bit emotional and B be a little bit

22
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.540
easy to read.
And

23
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.670
so I was in a meeting with him and I kind of saw how he was acting and I saw how

24
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:02.190
other people were reacting to him.

25
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.980
And so when I saw that I kind of sat down and just put some words on paper to

26
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.220
let him know that he had a little area of improvement.

27
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.580
And what's good about this is,
you know,
I was the detached person,

28
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.800
so I was able to sit outside the situation.
It just watch and see,
oh that's that.

29
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.620
He's not coming across the way he thinks he's coming across.

30
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.060
And so I'm gonna start off with that one is pretty positive echo when you,

31
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.900
when you say put words on paper,
is that like an official thing?
You know,

32
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:36.930
like when you get written up at work or something,
it's like,

33
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:40.950
here's your official warning,
right?
This one was not,
this was just a bro.

34
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.880
Say Amen.
Here's some,
here's some tips.
Almost like a deal note almost.
Yeah.

35
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.590
Note.
Yep.
Yeah,
this is a DL note.

36
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.700
So what's interesting is there's,
there's,
in the seal teams,

37
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.840
there's not a lot of writing up all in this,
in this capacity.

38
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:01.000
So if somebody has a safety violation where they do something unsafe,

39
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:05.080
that gets written up immediately.
But this type of thing is a little bit,

40
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.771
you know,

41
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:09.040
because normally you're just trying to bring someone along and help them out and

42
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:10.810
improve their leadership.
You know,
it's just mentoring.

43
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.480
So a lot of times that you don't need a document when you're trying to help out

44
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:17.650
your buddies.
The reason,
that's why I'm kind of lucky here,
I forget what it was,

45
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:19.930
but I,
you know,
I went to a meeting,

46
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:23.470
he was in it and I kind of forget the situation,

47
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:28.420
but for whatever reason I wrote this down and I think I sent it to him and said,

48
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:31.420
hey,
let's talk about this later.
But just,
just wanting to give you this stuff,

49
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.890
you know,
now.

50
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.570
And so I'm kind of lucky that I wrote it down is kind of like in the spirit of

51
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.780
organization.
Yeah.
And just,
I think it was more of just,

52
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.180
I couldn't talk to him immediately for whatever reason.

53
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.460
And so I just sent him an email and said,
hey bro,

54
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.110
where I like left it on his desk,
I forget if it was digital is probably email.

55
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.760
But so

56
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.813
<v 1>here we go</v>

57
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.960
<v 0>and there's,</v>

58
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.730
there's some interesting comments in here and that's why I think I saved it.

59
00:03:59.731 --> 00:04:04.320
And that's why I think it's,
it's good conversation.
So here we go.

60
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.230
Here's my note to a seal leader.

61
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.553
<v 1>That</v>

62
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.150
<v 0>is it,
buddy.
Tried to try to move along is leadership paradigm.
And here we go.</v>

63
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.560
One leadership is getting people to do things.

64
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.020
This is a form of manipulation.
So right there,

65
00:04:25.021 --> 00:04:27.660
I use this word that everybody hates manipulation.

66
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.550
And people often replace that word with influence.
And I do it too.

67
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.990
You know what saying,
Oh,
you want to use your influence.

68
00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:36.420
But what you're really saying is you want to manipulate people,

69
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.850
but it's very negative.
And the way I break that down,

70
00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:41.670
the way I separate that from something negative and something positive,

71
00:04:41.671 --> 00:04:46.650
as if I'm trying to manipulate you in a negative way,

72
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.160
that means I want you to do something that's going to benefit me and it's gonna

73
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.480
hurt you.
To me,
that's manipulation of that's negative.

74
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.580
But if you're trying to influence someone,
you're trying to lead them,

75
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.990
you're still manipulating them,

76
00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:57.120
but you're trying to get something that's going to be positive for them and

77
00:04:57.121 --> 00:05:00.030
positive for the team.
So as far as I'm concerned,

78
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:01.590
when you're influencing someone,

79
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.940
you're really manipulating them for a positive outcome.
So,

80
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.440
but that being said,
I think people need to recognize that.

81
00:05:10.441 --> 00:05:13.800
And that's why I use that word because everyone knows what manipulation as

82
00:05:13.801 --> 00:05:15.760
you're trying to get someone to do something right.

83
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.030
And that's what leadership is.
If you think about it,

84
00:05:18.031 --> 00:05:19.830
you're trying to get someone to do something,
but I use that word.

85
00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:21.690
So it's very clear what you're trying to do.

86
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.590
Leadership is nothing more than getting people to do what you want,

87
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.940
both up and down the chain of command.
So not just the people below.

88
00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:36.480
You want the people above you to do what you want them to do.
More importantly,

89
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.433
getting them to,

90
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.560
to want to do what you want them to do is the best form of leadership and the

91
00:05:42.961 --> 00:05:44.670
highest form of manipulation.

92
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.520
So this is a situation where you don't even want you,

93
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.400
you want the person just to want to do what you're getting them to do,
right?

94
00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.890
<v 2>So now I go on.
Every time we open our mouths to speak to another person,</v>

95
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.630
our goal is to get them to do what we want them to do.
Otherwise,

96
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.470
why the hell are we talking?
So everything you say,
the tone of your voice,

97
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:10.910
that the words you choose,

98
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:15.530
the inflection on those words and body language and facial expression are all

99
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:20.531
tools to be used to make progress in getting your way or tools that you Ms.

100
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.180
Hughes and isolate yourself and move away from your goals.

101
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.630
So again,

102
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:34.631
I wanted to make sure that this guy knew that every little facial expression,

103
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:36.470
everything that he said and how he said it,

104
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.880
all those things have an impact because people forget that you'll realize how

105
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:45.881
important your words are and how important your facial expressions are and how

106
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:49.370
important your tone is and how that impacts people.

107
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.813
<v 3>Okay?</v>

108
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.620
<v 2>You are always in negotiation.</v>

109
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.210
Everything you say and do and the manner in which you say and do it has an

110
00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:02.920
impact on future outcomes.
Pretty simple.
Now,

111
00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:07.820
this is
when I say this to people,
they go,

112
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.250
oh,
so here it is.

113
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.460
The best way to win is when the other person doesn't know you won.

114
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.920
And if possible,
might not even know there was a fight.

115
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.910
If your ego requires the constant food,
a victory,

116
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.140
you can never win in this manner.
So just to restate that,

117
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.210
the best way to win in a,

118
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:35.070
in a competition of getting something,
getting something to happen,

119
00:07:35.071 --> 00:07:36.660
or getting some,
someone do something.

120
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.930
The best way to win is when they don't even know that you won.

121
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.250
And even better than that is that they don't even know that there was a game.

122
00:07:44.251 --> 00:07:48.030
They don't even know that they're doing this for a reason other than by their

123
00:07:48.031 --> 00:07:50.100
own free will,
right?
Right.
That's what they think.

124
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.710
That's what you want them to think.
And again,

125
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.270
this is manipulation and I'm sorry about that.

126
00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.130
The thing is,

127
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.660
is that you're manipulating for positive outcomes.

128
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.490
You're not manipulating for your own benefit.

129
00:08:05.491 --> 00:08:09.480
You're not manipulating for D to make bad something bad happened,
that person,

130
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:14.130
you're influencing them so that they do a better jobs of the team does better so

131
00:08:14.131 --> 00:08:15.420
that the mission gets accomplished.

132
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.353
Now I go on.

133
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:25.380
Creating adversarial or antagonistic relationships never helps you reach end

134
00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:29.740
goals.
This is slightly related to the old.

135
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.960
Keep your friends close enemies closer.

136
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.440
People that outright oppose me will never help me and we'll usually maneuver to

137
00:08:37.901 --> 00:08:42.700
hurt my cause.
This is never good.
At least a neutral relationship.

138
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:47.710
Seldom real results in someone actively sabotaging my efforts.

139
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:53.230
So it's really easy to get an adversarial relationships.

140
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.650
And that wasn't one of my little goto words that I used to use when talking to

141
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:02.220
my subordinate leadership.
What?
Add the theater,
your relationships,
you know,

142
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:02.701
I'd say,
Hey,

143
00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:05.330
you're starting to get into an adversarial relationship with this person and

144
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.010
then where's that gonna go?
And I would say it's never going to be good.

145
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:10.800
They're never going to,
they're never going to go out of their way to help you.

146
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.830
In fact,
when you're an adversary of somebody,

147
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.690
they go out of their way to sabotage you and hurt you.
And that's,

148
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.980
that's just never going to be helpful.
So then I go on to say,

149
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:28.050
your history reveals that you are good at getting into adversarial situations.

150
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.470
You should work to control that impulse.

151
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.390
It will never help you attain your goals.
And that's the,
you know,

152
00:09:36.391 --> 00:09:38.910
you're laughing because that's a very blunt statement,
right?

153
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.200
That's a very blunt statement.

154
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:44.310
Your history reveals that you are good at getting into adversarial situations.

155
00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:49.230
Too.
Good at it though.
Like that's a skill.
Yeah,
you're real good at it.
Um,

156
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.780
and you can see this is,
this is pretty blunt,
uh,

157
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.370
pretty blunt writing here.

158
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.830
And the reason is because I had a relationship with this guy.
You know,

159
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.490
he was open to hear what I had to say.

160
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:06.840
And so it wasn't like I was just being a jerk and I was going to put them on the

161
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:11.670
defensive
and he knew that and he knew that I was always,
you know,

162
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.910
looking out for his best interests and I knew he would look out for mine as
well.

163
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:19.380
So we had a very good relationship
going on.

164
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.080
Don't burn bridges,
period.

165
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.190
Nothing is ever gained by this.
The future is never known.

166
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.700
And I always do what I can to keep lines of communication open bridges intact

167
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.140
and reinforced if possible.

168
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.590
So why burn bridges?

169
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.770
So seldom in life should you

170
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.830
burn a bridge?

171
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.900
And a lot of times people think,
because almost see you'll,

172
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.270
and I'm aggressive that I've,

173
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:54.360
I'm like this kind of burn bridges type of person.
Right.

174
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.520
And it's,

175
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.990
it's just not true because it's not an effective way to go through life.

176
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.470
Now I go on to make a note about that.
I don't like to say never,

177
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.860
but when dealing with human relationships,

178
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.560
which are inherently complex and the unpredictable,

179
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:15.540
I believe that you should never follow courses of action that can not be undone,

180
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.200
reversed or manipulated in the future.
Of course,

181
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:24.150
now I'm talking about you know,
people on the same team.
I'm not talking about,

182
00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:24.984
you know,

183
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:29.720
going to war and there you obviously do things in war that are completely on

184
00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:32.760
reversible because you're destroying and killing people and they're never coming

185
00:11:32.761 --> 00:11:34.830
back.
So this is different.
This is,

186
00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.220
this is in a team situation where you're trying to work together and you're,

187
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.240
you're in a leadership role

188
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.950
going on.
Believe in what you're saying,

189
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.140
but except that you might be wrong.

190
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.410
I believe in what I'm saying and if I don't it,

191
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.560
I study and question it until it makes sense or I change what I am saying until

192
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:03.520
I do believe it.
That's a little hard to understand.
That last piece.
So,

193
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:05.110
so what I'm saying is you've got to believe in what you're saying.

194
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.290
You have to believe in what you're saying.
And if you don't believe it,

195
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.140
then you've got either a question,

196
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.640
whatever it is that you're being told to believe or that you should believe that

197
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:16.510
you're supposed to believe.

198
00:12:16.511 --> 00:12:20.800
You've got a question that until you understand it and then once you understand

199
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:23.830
it,
then you have belief in it.

200
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.590
And you know,
I,
I'm not going to go into crazy detail on that because in,

201
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.220
in our book that Leif and I wrote,
you know,

202
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.580
there's a chapter and it's called belief and it explains exactly what I'm

203
00:12:37.581 --> 00:12:41.570
talking about when it comes to making sure that you believe in what you're

204
00:12:41.571 --> 00:12:42.404
saying.

205
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:47.690
But I think the point that I was focused on here was more that sometimes you're

206
00:12:47.691 --> 00:12:52.320
wrong and you have to be able to admit when you're wrong.
And I,

207
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.310
I go on to kind of go into some detail here if I'm wrong,

208
00:12:55.370 --> 00:13:00.370
I look forward to admitting it because it gives the opportunity to advertise

209
00:13:00.951 --> 00:13:02.360
being humble and open minded.

210
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.850
That's interesting.
And people miss that opportunity all the time.

211
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.231
When they're wrong,

212
00:13:10.231 --> 00:13:15.231
they either put their foot down and deny it or they don't take advantage of the

213
00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:18.630
fact that they got that,
that when they're wrong,
they say,
oh,
you know what,
Echo,

214
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.350
ah man,
I,
I'm definitely wrong here.
I think you had a much better idea.

215
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:27.720
Let's I'm stepping back and you run with it.
That's a great sign.

216
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.540
It makes people respect you and go,
yeah,
that's cool.
This guy,

217
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.320
this guy's humble enough to admit when he's wrong and they liked that.

218
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:39.060
So that's actually a form of manipulation in its own right,

219
00:13:39.061 --> 00:13:43.260
because I want you to think that I'm humble and I am humbled,

220
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.020
but I want to make sure that you see that,
right.

221
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.040
I go on to tell this individual,

222
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.490
you are not good at being wrong or taking criticism.

223
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.600
This is a weakness of yours.
So recognize pool and again,

224
00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:58.880
you can see the hear the,

225
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.520
that's where that kind of the relationship that I had with them comes out.
Right.

226
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.100
You really put that,
yeah,
yeah.
No,
that's real serious.
Real good.

227
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.550
And this is written,

228
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:10.740
I would say maybe eight years ago,

229
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.000
something like that.
So it's pretty old.

230
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.530
Thank God for computers because we have,
you know,

231
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.160
<v 4>uh Huh.</v>

232
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:23.260
<v 2>Records of things,
right?
Right.
You saved it,
right?
Control F.
Yeah,
for sure.</v>

233
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.700
Now I go on.
Think strategic.

234
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.890
You will win and lose daily battles all the time.
If you flaunt your victories,

235
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.920
which you do,
they hurt you strategically.

236
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:40.060
If you soak in your defeats,
which you also do,

237
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.520
it hurts you strategically.
This is wrong.

238
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.810
Winning in daily battles gives you the opportunity to deflect credit,

239
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.920
show your humbleness and victory and show your ability to lead,

240
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:55.370
which all help you in the longterm fight to achieve your goals.

241
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.120
Losing a battle gives you the opportunity to generous,

242
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.920
generously seed your position to admit you're wrong,
which both display,

243
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:07.130
humbleness and display your ability to follow.

244
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.373
So

245
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.920
people in every business and every job in in life,

246
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.270
in your house,

247
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:22.300
you win and lose little battles all the time and deciding which ones are worth

248
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.700
fighting for,
number one.
And then when you do win them,
how do you act?

249
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.720
And then when you lose them,
how do you act?
And all of these,

250
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:38.140
the winning and the losing is not as important as how you act upon winning or

251
00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:43.100
losing and how you,
you continue to influence the situation.

252
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.900
Even though you might have lost,

253
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.200
you do it in such a way that you show humility and you open up,

254
00:15:50.661 --> 00:15:53.060
you show your open mind and it makes the person,

255
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.530
you build your relationship with them.

256
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.250
So winning or losing is not important.

257
00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.650
What's important is how you react to winning and losing.

258
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:05.070
<v 5>Yeah.
Like when you,
um,
like when you say you're sorry,
right.
You know,</v>

259
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:10.090
like if two people were in a relationship or even friends and get into an

260
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.060
argument,
fight,
whatever about whatever.
And uh,

261
00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.610
in one person they don't want to say they're sorry,
you know,

262
00:16:15.611 --> 00:16:20.170
because it'll show that I was wrong or it'll show that I lost the argument or

263
00:16:20.171 --> 00:16:22.630
show that my points aren't valid or whatever they think.
Yeah.

264
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.020
But when you say sorry and ferreal say sorry,
don't be like,
well,

265
00:16:26.021 --> 00:16:29.680
I'm sorry if you were offended.
Don't say that kind of stuff.
Don't be like,
okay,

266
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.370
I'm sorry.
Don't say like that.
Like really mean it and when you can do that,

267
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.330
it's consistently,
it'll be any future argument.

268
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.810
It'll start to break down that barrier of defense.
You know?

269
00:16:40.811 --> 00:16:45.250
So the the person that people,
both of them won't go into it thinking,
okay,

270
00:16:45.251 --> 00:16:49.270
I gotta,
I gotta Mount this defense against this person.

271
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.860
Now it can be little bit more of a fair problem solving situation more so than

272
00:16:53.861 --> 00:16:55.120
this argument me against you,

273
00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:00.240
because they trust they're not going to get attacked if if they show weakness or

274
00:17:00.911 --> 00:17:04.900
whatever.
If they're like,
oh,
you know what?
I know I,
I made a mistake there.

275
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.910
They you demonstrate by saying,
sorry,

276
00:17:06.911 --> 00:17:09.640
you demonstrated that you're not going to go and turn up the heat.

277
00:17:09.641 --> 00:17:11.920
When they start showing that weakness,
it's like,
okay,
you can,

278
00:17:11.921 --> 00:17:16.540
you can solve problems a lot more easy.
That's that's thinking strategic.
Right?

279
00:17:16.541 --> 00:17:17.374
Right.

280
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:22.120
<v 2>Speaking to people going on here,
speaking to people,
oh wait,</v>

281
00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:23.043
going back,

282
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:27.340
I say you have a bad tendency to get caught up in tactical battles.

283
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.560
You expend effort and ammunition,

284
00:17:29.561 --> 00:17:33.250
receive wounds and tear yourself up when you should be straight thinking

285
00:17:33.251 --> 00:17:35.040
strategically.
And that kind of goes to what you were just saying.

286
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.920
People will get all angry and they'll hurt the relationship.
Why?

287
00:17:38.921 --> 00:17:42.880
Because they want to win this meaningless battle.
Meaningless battle,

288
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.560
so detached.
She

289
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.930
<v 5>yourself.
When you start feeling that anger,
that aggression,</v>

290
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.070
frustration,
detach

291
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.290
<v 2>yourself and ask yourself,
what am I really arguing about?</v>

292
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:55.800
What is happening right here?
Why am I getting worked up?

293
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.390
You probably shouldn't be.

294
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:04.140
Now go on to speaking to people will literally speaking to people,

295
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.490
treat everyone with respect from e one to Oh 10,
he will,

296
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.280
he won in the military is the lowest ranking person.

297
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.480
Oh 10 and officer 10 is the highest.
That would be an admiral or a general.

298
00:18:15.481 --> 00:18:18.910
The e one is the,
is the seaman recruit,
uh,

299
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.840
the lowest ranking person.
What I'm saying?
Treat everyone with respect.

300
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.700
Speak with humility.

301
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.840
This disarms people and is one of the best forms of manipulation.

302
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.490
And again,

303
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:37.150
if everyone is is put off by that term manipulation,

304
00:18:37.761 --> 00:18:42.761
which I know it is a very derogatory term and but you have to get over that

305
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.040
because you have to understand what I'm trying to say.

306
00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:50.060
I'm trying to make sure that people understand that when you're in a leadership

307
00:18:50.061 --> 00:18:52.550
position there's nicer ways of saying it,

308
00:18:52.551 --> 00:18:55.790
but what you're trying to do is get people to do what you want them to do.

309
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:58.430
That's what leadership is.
And that's also what manipulation is.

310
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.921
Disarmed.

311
00:19:00.921 --> 00:19:05.720
People are open to suggestion over confidence and condescending tone,

312
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.670
which is common for you,

313
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.750
causes defenses to go up and people to get defensive.

314
00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:18.560
So w the minute you come in and you start being overconfident or talking to

315
00:19:18.561 --> 00:19:20.150
people in a condescending manner,

316
00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.940
they get defensive and all of a sudden they're not really listening.

317
00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.770
That being said,

318
00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:32.050
subtle confidence and believing in what you are saying as noted above,

319
00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:37.890
allow people to also believe in what you are saying and that they trust in your

320
00:19:38.951 --> 00:19:41.950
judgment and leadership,
however,

321
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:46.570
do not speak as if you know things your opponent does not.
That offends everyone,

322
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.460
especially seals.
So he never,

323
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.480
never like talk to people as if you know something that they don't.
You know,

324
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.930
because it offends people.
It offends me.
It offends everybody.

325
00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:59.260
It's impossible not to be offended by that.
He makes you feel stupid.

326
00:19:59.261 --> 00:20:00.160
You get defensive.

327
00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:04.570
So what you've got to say things in a manner that you don't sound like I know it

328
00:20:04.571 --> 00:20:05.540
and you don't.
Right?

329
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.160
Your rank means nothing in an argument.

330
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:15.450
Pulling rank in any way is defeat.

331
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.930
So the minute I have to say Echo,
I outrank you,

332
00:20:20.931 --> 00:20:23.330
therefore I'm right means I means I couldn't.

333
00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.490
It means my argument didn't make sense.

334
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:30.230
It should be able to stand on its own two feet.
And similar to that,

335
00:20:30.231 --> 00:20:31.130
and this is something we,

336
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.700
we saw a lot in the seal teams and you see it a lot in the business world as

337
00:20:34.701 --> 00:20:38.690
well.
It's similar to rank,
it's the experience,

338
00:20:38.691 --> 00:20:42.800
it's pulling the experience card,
pulling the experience card is weak.

339
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.670
Arguments should be able to stand on their own without needing to be backed up.

340
00:20:46.671 --> 00:20:50.620
By the way,
we did it in Baghdad,
the way we did it in Ramadi,

341
00:20:50.621 --> 00:20:53.680
the way we did it in Afghanistan or whatever the case may be,

342
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.580
you shouldn't need to say that.
Now you can cite an example,

343
00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.130
but that shouldn't be the basis of your argument.

344
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:04.060
And we see that in the business world where someone will say,
well,

345
00:21:04.061 --> 00:21:07.310
we've been through this before,
right?
And well,

346
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.940
why did you go through it before then?
Why are we going through it again?

347
00:21:09.941 --> 00:21:11.710
If you went through it before,
maybe you did something wrong,

348
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.350
but that's a tendency that people have,
and in the business world,

349
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:19.500
you end up with people that have been in a specific industry for 2030 40 years,

350
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.670
and so it's very easy for them just to fall back on the,
well,

351
00:21:24.671 --> 00:21:27.460
this is the way we'd done it before.
I've seen this a million times.

352
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.550
I've always done it.
I've done this before.
I've been through this before.

353
00:21:30.551 --> 00:21:34.000
You've heard all of these examples.
It's what people do.
Also like if people,

354
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.580
they're in some kind of debate or argument about,
I don't know,

355
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.630
whatever the solar system,
there'll be like,
oh,
I have a college degree.

356
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:45.760
Almost like my argument is better than yours regardless of what it is because I

357
00:21:45.761 --> 00:21:47.380
have that college degree.
Yeah.

358
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:52.410
I have an example of that where a young seal was feeling as if he was being

359
00:21:53.711 --> 00:21:58.360
disrespected about what?
That he didn't know very much.

360
00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:02.280
He's a pretty new seal and he fell back on the argument of exactly what you just

361
00:22:02.281 --> 00:22:03.960
said.
Well this was like,
you know,
I have an,

362
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.610
I have a degree in problem solving or something along mother.

363
00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.530
I've been to classes on problem solving.

364
00:22:08.531 --> 00:22:10.870
That was his reason why people should listen to them,

365
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:16.650
which is not a good card to pull out in any situation and definitely not in the

366
00:22:16.781 --> 00:22:19.930
seal teams.
Hey,
I've been a client,
I've been to a class on problem solving.

367
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:24.970
You need to listen to me.
Wait a second,
why don't you just present your solution?

368
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.790
Right.
And then let it stand on its own two feet.

369
00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:31.360
Because if you're so good at problem solving than we surely you must have a

370
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:36.130
wonderful solution.
Yeah,
you took that class for sure,
man.
Uh,
but yes,

371
00:22:36.131 --> 00:22:40.390
it's the same thing.
So to close this thing out,
I said anyway,

372
00:22:40.391 --> 00:22:43.210
those are some thoughts.
I've thought about this today.

373
00:22:43.211 --> 00:22:44.830
After we had that conversation,

374
00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:51.040
I left thinking about my principles of management leadership off the battlefield

375
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.140
in administrative situations.

376
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.430
These are the same principles I used in combat building relationships and

377
00:22:57.431 --> 00:23:02.410
leading.
And I also use them in administrative leadership situations.

378
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.830
And as you know,
I've been successful in that environment as well.

379
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:07.690
You're a great leader.

380
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:11.920
Just make some adjustments to your game and you'll be even better.

381
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:17.800
And that's it.
That's how I close it out to this guy who was,

382
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:23.200
you know,
got this note from me and hit me back and said,
hey man,
thanks.

383
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:27.250
That's good stuff and I'll take action.
And definitely improved as game with it.

384
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:29.830
Now that's a pretty

385
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.840
nice counseling session or a nice attempt to help somebody.

386
00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:37.931
Now,

387
00:23:37.931 --> 00:23:42.931
this next example that I'm going to go through is somebody that was on his last,

388
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:51.130
he was in a leadership position and he was having some significant problems.

389
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:53.683
Now

390
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.810
he was an inexperienced guy and for some unknown reason,
he was cocky.

391
00:23:59.811 --> 00:24:02.000
He was arrogant,
he was failing as a leader,

392
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.650
and he'd been through multiple verbal counselings like I talked about.

393
00:24:06.651 --> 00:24:10.190
And you asked me,
do we write people up?
I mean,
the seal teams for,

394
00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:12.620
for writing somebody up for a leadership problem.

395
00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:17.860
They've been counselled numerous times verbally because you don't expect,

396
00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:21.560
I mean,
it's not that hard,
you know,
it's not that hard to say,
hey,

397
00:24:21.561 --> 00:24:23.330
make this adjustment.
The Guy Goes,
oh yeah,
okay.

398
00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:24.350
I didn't see that I was doing that.

399
00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.130
The only time you ended up with someone that you have to actually write it down

400
00:24:28.131 --> 00:24:30.080
is when someone gets,
starts getting to a point where you say,
okay,

401
00:24:30.081 --> 00:24:35.000
this person's job is now in jeopardy.
[inaudible] and this is,
uh,

402
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.900
again,
thanks to technology.
I,

403
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:41.710
I saved this to technology.
Yeah.

404
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.650
So here we go.
Seldom do I have to do this.

405
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:53.240
Most guys listen and adjust and get better and move on.

406
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:59.350
My cadre meaning that the training crew that I had,

407
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.840
my contrary and your leadership asked that I talked to you and it is my job and

408
00:25:05.691 --> 00:25:10.220
my duty and my responsibility to try and make squared away.

409
00:25:10.221 --> 00:25:14.900
Tactical seal leaders
know this.

410
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:20.950
I have personally worked with and seen all kinds of platoon commanders with all

411
00:25:21.471 --> 00:25:22.910
kinds of personalities.

412
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:28.130
If you count my previous experience in platoons and training cell and as an

413
00:25:28.131 --> 00:25:30.680
enlisted man,
the number is pretty big.

414
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:36.500
I've done seven deployments serving in every spot from the youngest e three new

415
00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:39.260
guy to the oldest and the task unit commander.

416
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:45.140
That being said,
I'm not that good at anything but I am a hard worker.

417
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.920
I don't like to waste my time with people that don't appear to have the desire

418
00:25:48.921 --> 00:25:53.360
to be better seals and you don't appear to have a desire to improve yourself

419
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:58.010
despite your history,
which includes the following,

420
00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.920
getting bad FITREPs.

421
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.950
So fit reps is short for fitness reports and that's basically an evaluation.

422
00:26:03.951 --> 00:26:08.880
And this guy had really bad evaluations,
just like general evaluation.
Not yet.

423
00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.590
His stuff,
well,
it's fitness.
Fitness is like one block,

424
00:26:12.591 --> 00:26:15.620
but there'll be a block on leadership.
There'll be a block on tactical knowledge,

425
00:26:15.621 --> 00:26:17.510
there'll be there.
So there's all these blocks in his,

426
00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.810
and he had bad fitness reports,
bad evaluations,

427
00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.230
getting sent to a staff bill it as a junior officer.

428
00:26:24.231 --> 00:26:28.430
So they took him and instead of making him and putting him in a seal platoon,

429
00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:32.390
they had them in some administrative job,
which is a big signal.

430
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:36.680
Sometimes they'll do that in between tours or after you do an assistant platoon

431
00:26:36.681 --> 00:26:40.040
commander tour,
they'll give you a tour like that to expand your knowledge.

432
00:26:40.041 --> 00:26:43.470
But he just got put straight into that.
So that wasn't good.

433
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.310
And finally having a horrible reputation in the teams,

434
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.060
which this individual certainly did have.
No,

435
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.860
I go on and say,

436
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:57.900
I didn't take this into account when looking at you as a seal officer and as a

437
00:26:57.901 --> 00:27:00.720
man,
I don't care what people say,

438
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:04.350
I judge people on what I see with my own eyes.

439
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:09.240
At first I thought you were just in another Alpha male seal that rubs people the

440
00:27:09.241 --> 00:27:14.010
wrong way.
No big deal.
There are plenty of seals like that.
I usually like them.

441
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:17.850
Most of my true friends fall into that category and that was one of the things

442
00:27:17.851 --> 00:27:18.511
about this guy,
you know,

443
00:27:18.511 --> 00:27:23.511
he was like a big guy and he was pretty aggressive and

444
00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.540
I thought to myself,
just what I said,
I thought,
okay,
you know what?

445
00:27:28.541 --> 00:27:30.220
Maybe he's rubbing people the wrong way and,

446
00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:35.140
and people are a little intimidated by that.
As time passed,

447
00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:38.980
I began to see something different.
This is what I see.

448
00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.970
You are insecure about something.
I don't know what,

449
00:27:42.971 --> 00:27:46.090
but it forces you to act arrogant and chrome across as selfish.

450
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:51.730
Your performance as a tactical leader varies between below average and average

451
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.400
with some visible spikes of increased potential.

452
00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.710
You almost incapable of communicating with other people respectfully.

453
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.890
So those top three right there for whatever reason to that,

454
00:28:05.891 --> 00:28:08.560
and I never figured out what made this individual so insecure.

455
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:12.100
I don't know if he,
I,
I'd have no idea.
I don't know what happened to them,

456
00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:16.570
but it's okay.
We have insecurities,

457
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.090
we get intimidated.

458
00:28:19.091 --> 00:28:23.860
We feel like we have to over prove ourselves.
It's okay,
these things happen.

459
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.500
You just make adjustments.
That's all you gotta do.

460
00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.610
You gotta make some adjustments.

461
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.660
You gotta realize that you're not communicating with people respectfully.

462
00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:34.800
And when somebody tells you that you're not,
you got a question,

463
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:36.010
what do I sound like?

464
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:40.120
Maybe you pull out of of a recorder and listen to yourself.

465
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.610
You have some good ideas,
you have some good ideas from time to time,

466
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.910
but you act as if you know everything all the time.

467
00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:56.270
Your ability to elevate your presence to that of a respected leader of men on

468
00:28:56.271 --> 00:29:00.470
the battlefield and in garrison is almost nonexistent.

469
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:06.640
And I don't know if at this time I was really using the term like detach that

470
00:29:08.001 --> 00:29:12.770
much,
but that's what I was trying to get across to him is that he wasn't able to

471
00:29:12.771 --> 00:29:16.880
elevate his presence.
He wasn't able to come across like a leader.

472
00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.290
He was right there in mentally with the rest of the platoon

473
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.183
going on.

474
00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:30.220
You cannot mask your emotions and you don't understand the ramifications of that

475
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.100
shortfall.
So these are the little things.

476
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:39.440
The little eye roll.
The heavy sigh.
Yeah,

477
00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.160
the crossed arms.
I just,
all these

478
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.100
<v 0>little things that it was like,</v>

479
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.170
it was like an open book when you'd see this guy,

480
00:29:47.171 --> 00:29:52.171
you knew exactly what he was thinking and he had no idea that it was so obvious

481
00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:56.710
to everybody else.
Myself,
all the rest of my instructor staff,
his leadership,

482
00:29:56.711 --> 00:30:01.090
everyone was thinking the same thing and in his mind he,
he was good to go.

483
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.090
He was,
you know,
he was a stone face poker player.

484
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.380
<v 5>Yeah.
And he kind of gets worse when you can't mask your emotions,</v>

485
00:30:09.381 --> 00:30:12.380
but your emotions are reflective of your insecurity,

486
00:30:12.381 --> 00:30:15.740
which you mentioned is one of the first things.
So it's like this double whammy.

487
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:19.650
It's one thing if you can mask your emotions,
but you're pretty humble in,

488
00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:22.470
in general and you're a nice guy or whatever your though with kind of,

489
00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.730
<v 0>yeah.
And the,
the emotions that you're not masking or something positive.</v>

490
00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.460
That's great.
Psalm positive

491
00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.850
<v 5>or,
or a lot of puzzles,
maybe some negative,
but hey look,</v>

492
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.350
no one's perfect kind of thing.
But yeah,

493
00:30:31.351 --> 00:30:34.230
if it's just like insecurity oozing out of

494
00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.320
<v 0>yeah,
that'd be any insecurity was really the,</v>

495
00:30:37.321 --> 00:30:42.150
what oozed out of him was I know everything you don't know.

496
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:42.931
Look,
Jocko,

497
00:30:42.931 --> 00:30:46.740
I know you've been in the teams for 18 years and you done multiple deployments

498
00:30:46.741 --> 00:30:50.280
overseas and even though I have done zero deployments overseas,

499
00:30:50.281 --> 00:30:54.390
I know more than you.
Yeah.
Uh,

500
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.120
here we go on and,

501
00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:02.340
and so now I start trying to make sure I cover all the bases with this guy.
Sure.

502
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.950
You do not have the understanding of human nature,
team building,

503
00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.830
leadership,
influence,
manipulation,

504
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:15.000
compromise and the broad concepts of tactical operation,

505
00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.790
operational and strategic leadership and management.

506
00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:23.130
Perhaps you don't have the intellect to understand these things because if you

507
00:31:23.131 --> 00:31:27.240
did,
why are we sitting here right now talking about this?
And by the way,

508
00:31:27.241 --> 00:31:28.620
the reason this is written down,

509
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.560
I wrote it down and then brought him into my office,
put it in front of him,

510
00:31:31.561 --> 00:31:35.010
and then read it to him because I wanted to be crystal clear.

511
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.490
And so that's why this is written in that perspective.
Them saying,

512
00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.220
why are we sitting here talking about it right now?

513
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:46.880
Why am I not thinking this might not be the most polished guy in the world,

514
00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:50.340
but he's a good guy and he'll get things done because you're gonna end up with

515
00:31:50.341 --> 00:31:51.510
plenty of seals that are just,

516
00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.900
they're just not that polished or they're a little rough around the edges or

517
00:31:54.901 --> 00:31:57.880
they can't brief well or whatever.
I mean,
it's cool.
There's,

518
00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:01.890
there's all kinds of different guys in the seal teams and you just gotta take

519
00:32:01.891 --> 00:32:04.980
what you get and you,
you strengthen your weaknesses a little bit.

520
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:08.010
But this guy was just not getting there

521
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.800
for some reason.
You believe that you are a victim,

522
00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:17.970
that people don't like you or have it out for you.
And this was so weird,

523
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:22.410
this guy had this attitude that everyone wanted to fire him,

524
00:32:22.411 --> 00:32:26.340
that everyone was against him.
And he was this,
he was in this,
you know,

525
00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:30.120
struggle on his own against the world.
And it was just completely not true,

526
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.760
especially in the beginning.
I mean,
obviously it escalated to that,

527
00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:37.140
but that he brought it upon himself.
But,
but honestly that's something I kind of,

528
00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:40.010
I kind of pride in,

529
00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:45.010
<v 2>in as a leader in taking a,</v>

530
00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:51.260
a blank slate when I meet somebody and saying,
okay,
cool.
You know,
hey look,

531
00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:53.030
this guy has a bad reputation or whatever.
I'm gonna,

532
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.430
I'm gonna see what I can do with them.
I want to make them better.

533
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.790
I kind of take pride in that and want to make people better.

534
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.290
And so for him to think that I was out to get him to this training cadre was out

535
00:33:03.291 --> 00:33:07.880
to get him.
Oh,
it was just not true.
Just completely not true.
Uh,

536
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:10.610
this is not true,
but it isolates you,

537
00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.900
hurts your ability to interact with people and keeps you in a paranoid,

538
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.420
guarded and confrontational state.

539
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.130
<v 1>It's,
it's a rough,
rough</v>

540
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:24.703
<v 2>next.</v>

541
00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:29.890
You don't understand the broad skills required to be a good seal leader such as

542
00:33:29.961 --> 00:33:34.010
tact,
teambuilding communications and trust building.

543
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:40.350
So it's interesting.
None of this is about fire maneuver.
None.

544
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:44.570
This is about taking down a building.
None of this is about,

545
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:48.890
you know,
how to,
how to plan and execute and assault.

546
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:54.820
None of this is about that because that stuff is relatively easy to do and what

547
00:33:56.811 --> 00:34:00.770
we would,
99.9% of the time when we fire a leader,

548
00:34:00.771 --> 00:34:03.200
it had nothing to do with their tactical prowess.

549
00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.730
It had to do with them as a leader.

550
00:34:04.731 --> 00:34:09.731
Now them as a leader effect would effect the tactical outcome of operations for

551
00:34:10.911 --> 00:34:14.210
sure,
but that wouldn't be the,

552
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.720
the key component of their failings.

553
00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:20.180
The key component of their failings would be they're arrogant.

554
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.023
<v 1>What's</v>

555
00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:26.003
going on.

556
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:29.840
<v 2>You do not understand the burden of command.</v>

557
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:34.520
You do not understand the influence you have on your men.

558
00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.320
This is a big one.

559
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.490
This is one of those ones that I,

560
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:44.670
I find this with CEOs,
I find this with mid level managers.

561
00:34:44.671 --> 00:34:49.671
I find this with everyone where they don't understand their influence on their

562
00:34:50.451 --> 00:34:51.260
people.

563
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:56.260
They understand when they say something off the cuff that everybody listens and

564
00:34:56.981 --> 00:35:00.310
they think they mean it and it has real impact on people.

565
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:05.530
They don't understand when they show up late now being laid as okay when they go

566
00:35:07.031 --> 00:35:11.920
home early.
Going home early is okay.
Those were the little things,

567
00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:16.570
examples of little things that people don't understand the influence they have

568
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.040
on their troops

569
00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.053
<v 1>going on.</v>

570
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:27.810
<v 2>You do not understand the gift you've been honored with to lead men in combat</v>

571
00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:31.450
against our nation's sworn enemies.

572
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:40.150
My concern is how you will act overseas when lives are at stake.

573
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:45.660
I cannot allow you to go forward with these shortfalls.

574
00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:47.683
<v 6>Okay?</v>

575
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:55.740
<v 2>And that is something that
in the seal teams,</v>

576
00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.380
so in the seal teams,
people think,
well,
if someone's no good,
you just fire them.

577
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.810
That's it.
And it's actually not true.
You know,

578
00:36:03.811 --> 00:36:08.811
you have to have good reason and document what issues they're having.

579
00:36:10.411 --> 00:36:14.520
And the other thing is that that's really harsh about firing someone in the seal

580
00:36:14.521 --> 00:36:18.180
teams is when you fire someone in the seal teams,
you're ruining their life.

581
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:22.020
It's their dream to be a seal.
Now they're not gonna be CEO anymore.

582
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:26.610
Their paycheck,
their retirement.
I mean,
they've got plans,
they,

583
00:36:26.611 --> 00:36:30.270
they're counting on this.
So when you fire someone in the seal teams,
it,

584
00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:35.370
it can be devastating career blow and it can really ruin someone's life.
Now,

585
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:38.220
there are times where we go,
hey,
you know what,
this guy's going to be okay.

586
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.920
We need to push him back a little while when you recycle and he'll be able to

587
00:36:40.921 --> 00:36:43.830
come back and he'll get better and he just needs to learn more if that happens

588
00:36:43.831 --> 00:36:47.250
as well.
But in this type of situation,

589
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.820
this guy was already with a bad reputation.
This was going to be,

590
00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:52.260
if he got fired from this job,

591
00:36:52.261 --> 00:36:55.620
this was going to be a death sentence for his career.

592
00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:58.740
So when you fire someone from the seal teams,

593
00:36:58.741 --> 00:37:03.000
they're not out of the military there or it is on the situation?

594
00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.210
Yeah,
sometimes they they'll get,

595
00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:09.480
it's a lot of times the officers will be removed from the military.

596
00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:13.480
The enlisted guys might go to the regular navy,
which is,

597
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.950
which is a harsh punishment for a guy that's been in the seal teams that you in

598
00:37:16.951 --> 00:37:19.530
the seal teams,
you have quite a bit of freedom.
You get more money,

599
00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:22.710
you doing some job that you really like and then all of a sudden you're not

600
00:37:22.711 --> 00:37:23.630
doing a job that you really like.

601
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.550
And that can be a severe form of punishment as well.
Is it,

602
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.330
is it like going to the miners from the major league baseball?
It's just,

603
00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:31.860
it's just a totally different job.

604
00:37:31.861 --> 00:37:36.750
It's like going from baseball to something completely different.

605
00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:39.600
I mean it's going from baseball to do an accounting,
you know,

606
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:43.140
or from baseball to going to construction.
You know,

607
00:37:43.141 --> 00:37:47.550
cause the regular navy has regular jobs that are like that.

608
00:37:47.551 --> 00:37:50.790
There's accounting jobs,
there's building jobs,
there's you know,
technique,

609
00:37:50.791 --> 00:37:54.810
technical jobs.
So it's like going from a job that's like a sport,

610
00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.750
which is the seal teams going into a job.
That's more of a job.

611
00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:02.250
But it's not like a dishonorable discharge situation.
No,

612
00:38:02.251 --> 00:38:05.790
not unless the guys,
and you know,
it's interesting,
I remember I was on a,

613
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.400
I was on the ship one time and

614
00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:15.590
the waves were big and it was cold and we were launching off this ship in the

615
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.160
middle of the night.
And there was this regular navy guy,
FirstClass Bosens mate,

616
00:38:20.161 --> 00:38:21.600
which means,
you know,
he ran the,

617
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.710
the deck operations of the ships and putting boats in the water and,

618
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:28.650
and it was all stormy and dark.

619
00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:30.470
And we're on these little boats out in the middle of the ocean.

620
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:34.560
We're about to go launch.
And,
uh,
the guy says to me,

621
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:40.750
man,
I would never want your job.
And that's,

622
00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:44.140
you know,
that's what he was thinking.
And I look back at him and I said,
well,

623
00:38:44.141 --> 00:38:47.380
that's good cause I would never want years either because I would never want to

624
00:38:47.381 --> 00:38:50.500
be stuck on a ship and doing that kind of work.
But it's,

625
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:54.280
we both had jobs that we liked.
You know,
it,
everyone's got jobs they like,

626
00:38:54.281 --> 00:38:55.990
but so when a person's in the seal teams though,

627
00:38:55.991 --> 00:38:57.010
and they're getting put to a job,

628
00:38:57.011 --> 00:38:59.740
it's normally a job that they don't really like.
Uh,

629
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:05.310
and what my point in all of that is that it is difficult to ruin someone's

630
00:39:07.661 --> 00:39:12.661
career and it is a heavy burden when you have to do this to somebody.

631
00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:18.700
That being said,
you're going to send these people,

632
00:39:18.701 --> 00:39:20.620
especially a person in a leadership position,

633
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:24.580
they're going to be overseas and responsible for people's lives.

634
00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.460
You have got to do the right thing.
Yeah.

635
00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:30.790
And I say that to business leaders now,
you know,

636
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:36.390
you've got to do everything you can to mentor someone and that's,

637
00:39:37.391 --> 00:39:37.810
that's,

638
00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:42.810
that's actually how I know you've done everything you can to mentor and get

639
00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:47.770
someone along.
Because when you fire them,
you shouldn't feel guilty about it.

640
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:52.090
And when,
when a leader says all really,
I feel bad about firing this person,
okay,

641
00:39:52.091 --> 00:39:54.550
then that means you haven't done everything you can to mentor them.

642
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.010
Because if you have and they still fail,

643
00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:01.360
then they're incapable of doing the job and they need to go find a different
job.

644
00:40:01.361 --> 00:40:04.610
But then you get put in different positions.
That's just the facts.
Right.

645
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.510
But if you've done everything you've can and they can't do it,
then yeah,

646
00:40:07.511 --> 00:40:10.790
they need to move on.
But when you go,
oh,
I'd feel,

647
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:13.120
feel bad about getting rid of this person,
it's cause you,

648
00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.210
cause you haven't had this conversation that I'm having with this guy right
here.

649
00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:19.420
The laying it out and saying here's what you're doing wrong,

650
00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.330
here's how you need to fix it.
This is what the expectations are.

651
00:40:22.331 --> 00:40:24.070
And if you don't meet them,
you're not going to be here.

652
00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:26.050
You need to clearly understand that.

653
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.180
<v 5>Yeah.
It really puts it into perspective.
Right on that last item there one,</v>

654
00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:39.360
when you said my concern is how you would act overseas when lives are at stake,

655
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:42.480
like that really puts it into perspective for,

656
00:40:42.481 --> 00:40:46.500
I mean really looking at it in a lighthearted kind of way.

657
00:40:46.501 --> 00:40:48.870
You can kind of compare this to let's say,

658
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:52.550
you know when you're in kindergarten you get a report card or whatever and then

659
00:40:52.551 --> 00:40:55.150
at the end if you're a kid like this guy,
Yup.

660
00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:59.510
You get a little note at the end says does the all it does not play well with

661
00:40:59.511 --> 00:41:00.950
others.
Right.
And you're like,
all right.
You know,

662
00:41:00.951 --> 00:41:03.050
he doesn't know an easy whatever this,

663
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:05.450
especially when this is the adult version of that,

664
00:41:05.451 --> 00:41:09.290
but times it by like 10 and it sums it up right here with that last one,

665
00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.210
like when lives are at stake

666
00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.630
<v 2>and that's exactly what was going on.</v>

667
00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:19.390
So here I tried to give this guy corrective measures is what I called it,

668
00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:22.720
corrective measures.
Number one,

669
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:28.360
be humble.
And we get asked all the time,

670
00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:32.200
what's the most important characteristic of a leader and Lafe and I will say all

671
00:41:32.201 --> 00:41:35.120
the time,
humility.
And

672
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:38.240
if you're not humble,

673
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:43.070
then how can you look at yourself and say,

674
00:41:43.071 --> 00:41:45.380
I need to do stuff better.
How can you look at your team and say,

675
00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:48.320
we need to get better.
How can you look at your enemy and say,

676
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:52.220
I better respect them.
[inaudible] if you don't have that humility,

677
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:56.600
you're gonna fail there.
So my first corrective action to this guy,

678
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:59.060
be humble.
Number two,

679
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:05.590
truly and deeply accept the fact that you have some serious personality defects

680
00:42:05.751 --> 00:42:10.751
that you need to immediately put in check and over the longterm completely fix.

681
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:16.850
So always very concerned that this guy was going to sit there and nod his head.

682
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:18.920
Yup,
okay,
Yup.
Sorry,

683
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:24.230
but not truly and deeply except the fact that he had these issues because

684
00:42:24.231 --> 00:42:29.030
there's a big difference between non your head and saying,
I got you sir.
Okay,

685
00:42:29.031 --> 00:42:32.630
sir.
Yep.
Yes sir.
Oh,
I'm gonna.
I'm going to do better.

686
00:42:32.631 --> 00:42:35.660
There's a big difference between that and going home,

687
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.910
looking in the mirror and saying,

688
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:41.210
I've got some serious problems that I need to fix

689
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:43.783
going on.

690
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:48.650
Understand that the criticism you are hearing from me is not mine alone,

691
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:52.100
but also my staffs and your leadership's as well.

692
00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:56.870
I've also heard this from other people outside your command.

693
00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:01.700
Your reputation is horrible.
Again,

694
00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:06.410
I wanted to make sure that he didn't think this was just Jocko being hostile.

695
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:12.910
I wanted him to realize it was my entire staff and his leadership that was being

696
00:43:13.701 --> 00:43:18.620
hostile,
going on corrective measure,

697
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:24.250
embrace and contemplate the solemn responsibility of being a seal officer about

698
00:43:25.821 --> 00:43:29.840
to lead men into battle and possibly to their deaths

699
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:33.760
and brace.
The burden of command.

700
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:38.480
This is one that for me,

701
00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:39.333
<v 1>me</v>

702
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:46.450
<v 2>was very disturbing to see because I had lead men into battle and I had</v>

703
00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.470
had my guys get killed.

704
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000
So to have him with this attitude where I could see that didn't occur in his

705
00:44:01.351 --> 00:44:01.950
brain,

706
00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:05.820
he didn't understand that these guys that he's supposed to be in charge of,

707
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.210
he's going to be asking them to do things that can get them killed.

708
00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:14.670
And I don't think he understood that.
Hmm.
The burden of command,

709
00:44:14.671 --> 00:44:19.260
that's the burden of command.
That's that heavy responsibility.

710
00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:27.170
Yes.
In combat it means guys getting wounded or getting killed,

711
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:30.740
and that is a heavy burden.
But I will tell you in the business world,

712
00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.560
when you've got people's jobs at stake,

713
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:38.760
when you've got the profitability or the survival of a company at stake,
and

714
00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:45.380
dozens or hundreds or thousands of people may or may not have a job,

715
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:50.310
if you don't do your job correctly as a leader,
that is a heavy burden as well.

716
00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:51.453
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

717
00:44:56.410 --> 00:45:01.090
<v 2>Going on,
be the best at everything you do</v>

718
00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:07.030
in doing that
one.

719
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:11.440
Put everyone else before yourself.
Push away compliments.

720
00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.050
Shift them to your peers and your men,

721
00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.850
except responsibility of failure and shortfalls.

722
00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:21.340
Only foreign in them

723
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:25.590
is the improvement and growth.

724
00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:30.710
So this is actually a conversation we had on one of our earlier podcasts.

725
00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:34.070
Any compliments success,

726
00:45:34.071 --> 00:45:39.071
you shift that to your peers and your men and you're accepted responsibility for

727
00:45:39.261 --> 00:45:41.570
the failures and the shortfalls.
And again,

728
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:45.320
if you don't accept the responsibility for those failures and shortfalls,

729
00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:47.870
how are they ever going to get fixed?
The answers,
they're not.

730
00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.800
I'm never going to change everything.
Anything.
If it's all echo's fault,

731
00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.080
I did everything right.
It's all echo's fault.
Yeah.

732
00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:56.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

733
00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:03.600
<v 2>Truly listen and try to understand what people tell you by first understanding</v>

734
00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:08.350
that your personal compass is wrong,

735
00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:13.650
truly and completely wrong for what is right and wrong for what a good seal and

736
00:46:15.701 --> 00:46:20.590
a bad one is for what makes an exceptional leader and a horrible one.

737
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:25.990
You must correct this compass so that it may guide you in the right direction.

738
00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:27.740
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

739
00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:32.360
<v 2>And my point with this was that I think in his mind,</v>

740
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:37.010
his vision of what a quote unquote good seal was.

741
00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:39.180
I think he thought he was being [inaudible].

742
00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.060
And I had to explain to him that he was wrong.

743
00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.690
He did not understand what a good seal was.

744
00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.360
He did not understand what an exceptional leader was.

745
00:46:50.361 --> 00:46:52.220
He just did not understand it.

746
00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:58.970
You must correct this compass so that it may guide you in the right direction,

747
00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:05.343
the final

748
00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:06.870
<v 1>okay</v>

749
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:09.660
<v 2>corrective measure,
lose your ego.</v>

750
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:15.810
This guy,
despite having

751
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:22.700
eight treacherous record and a horrible reputation despite that for some unknown

752
00:47:25.411 --> 00:47:29.230
reason,
but I cannot fathom he had a big ego.

753
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:31.840
He thought he was a great seal.

754
00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:37.030
He thought because he was a big dude and could shoot well,
he's a,

755
00:47:37.031 --> 00:47:41.110
he was a talented athlete as well,
but he thought that that made him a good seal

756
00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:43.980
<v 1>and it didn't.</v>

757
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:48.920
<v 2>It just gave him a big ego.
So</v>

758
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:54.110
now I tell them,
these are tall tasks,

759
00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:56.090
but you control them all.

760
00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:02.610
And that's true.
If you look at every one of those things,
be humble.
Yes,

761
00:48:02.611 --> 00:48:05.970
he controls that.
Except the fact that he needs some serious work.
Yes.

762
00:48:05.971 --> 00:48:09.270
He controls that.
Understand that the criticism is coming from a bunch of people,

763
00:48:09.271 --> 00:48:12.300
not just me.
Yes.
That's under his control.
Embracing,

764
00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:15.600
contemplate the solemn responsibility of being a seal officer about to lead men

765
00:48:15.601 --> 00:48:20.310
into battle and possibly to their deaths.
Yes.
He controls that ability.

766
00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:25.330
Be the best at everything you do.
Yes.
That's under his control,

767
00:48:25.331 --> 00:48:30.130
so all these things lose your ego.
These are all things that he had control over.

768
00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:38.380
We need good aggressive leaders in the seal teams.

769
00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.380
We don't need the person that I outlined above,

770
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:45.640
and the reason I pointed that out is because I think in this guy's mind,

771
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:47.710
he was an aggressive guy

772
00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:52.020
and he was a good leader in his mind,

773
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:54.660
but I wanted him to know that,
yes,

774
00:48:54.661 --> 00:48:57.090
we do need aggressive leaders in the seal teams,
but we don't need this guy.

775
00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.720
We don't need the guy that I'm just talking about.
It's in your hands.

776
00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:05.550
Good luck.
Then I asked him,
do you have any questions or comments for me?

777
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:10.200
Which he did not.
I asked him,
are you sure?

778
00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:12.203
He was sure.

779
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:18.060
I asked him if he understood and he nodded his head.
And again,

780
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:21.060
the reason I'm reading these because these are my actual notes.

781
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:22.603
<v 1>Okay.</v>

782
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:25.590
<v 2>And then I said,</v>

783
00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:31.280
do you believe I am right or do you just think I don't or do you think I just

784
00:49:32.101 --> 00:49:34.770
don't get it and that you actually know what's up?

785
00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:43.830
And He of course said,
no,
I understand.

786
00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:48.740
And even as you were saying on those words,
yeah,

787
00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.190
I was not convinced.

788
00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:55.163
<v 1>And</v>

789
00:49:55.940 --> 00:50:00.940
<v 2>this gentleman did not make it in his leadership role and he ended up getting</v>

790
00:50:00.951 --> 00:50:01.784
fired

791
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:09.220
when he said he bet he understands.
Was it like,
was he all salty?

792
00:50:09.221 --> 00:50:12.520
Like you understand and no,
I mean he was,

793
00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:14.780
he was not destroyed.

794
00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:20.130
He was not openly disrespectful and maybe somewhere in his brain he was trying

795
00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.190
to understand,
trying to listen

796
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:31.770
<v 3>and trying to believe,
but</v>

797
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.120
<v 2>the,
it,
it wasn't there.</v>

798
00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:37.503
<v 3>Okay.</v>

799
00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:40.360
<v 2>So in going through this,</v>

800
00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:45.420
and I think one of the reasons why I wanted to do this on the podcast was

801
00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:52.600
a lot of times leadership is about awareness.

802
00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:55.083
And

803
00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:02.170
I use this example all the time in the movie terminator,
it says,

804
00:51:02.171 --> 00:51:03.004
you know,

805
00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:08.370
in the year 2016 the machines became aware and I used to get to see that with cu

806
00:51:09.981 --> 00:51:13.900
leaders like they,
they become aware of being in a leadership position.

807
00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:18.550
And so that's,
that's one form of awareness.

808
00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.890
And I think a lot of times

809
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.280
you don't recognize,
if you're not aware of something,

810
00:51:25.281 --> 00:51:29.780
you can't recognize what the problem is.
And so going through this,

811
00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:32.420
all these issues that this guy had,

812
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:35.690
I people that are listening to this podcast,

813
00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:39.020
you don't have all these issues.
It's impossible.

814
00:51:39.021 --> 00:51:42.860
You wouldn't even like to listen to this podcast because this is a podcast where

815
00:51:42.861 --> 00:51:47.150
we're all kind of sitting here taking ourselves apart and seeing what we could

816
00:51:47.151 --> 00:51:49.610
do better and trying to learn and,
and people with,

817
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:54.200
with this type of attitude that this guy had,
they,

818
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:58.200
they don't even enjoy this because they think they know everything.
Yup.

819
00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:03.050
You're not even talking to them.
I'm not even thought out,
but everybody,

820
00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.640
myself included,

821
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:09.590
I still go through this and I go,
I'm doing that a little bit right there.

822
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:14.180
I'm falling into that trap.
I'm getting a little bit arrogant on this thing.

823
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:19.160
I'm doing this wrong.
I'm not,
I'm not.

824
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:22.310
I'm letting my emotions out too much.
And again,

825
00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:24.560
I'm not telling people to be robots,

826
00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:31.680
but you can't be an emotional disaster or emotional show for your people.

827
00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:38.730
So show that awareness and thinking about it.

828
00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:40.450
And the other thing,

829
00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:45.480
this is the other reason why I wanted to use this particular note is because I

830
00:52:46.661 --> 00:52:50.560
think it's as direct of a note.
I could write someone,

831
00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:52.900
maybe I could do better now,
I don't know.

832
00:52:52.901 --> 00:52:57.760
But at the time to go face to face with someone and kind of call them out.

833
00:52:58.270 --> 00:53:01.090
This is about as stern as I could do it.

834
00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:07.110
And this is the standard that we need to hold ourselves to that sternness of

835
00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:10.000
that.

836
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.000
What am I doing wrong and how do I be honest with myself and be my own worst

837
00:53:16.091 --> 00:53:19.150
critic,
which is a big cliche,
but yeah,
be your own worst critic.

838
00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:24.490
Look at yourself and you can't be your own worst critic if you don't detach from

839
00:53:24.491 --> 00:53:26.100
the situation.
If you're inside your own head,

840
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.280
<v 0>you can't even critique yourself.
So you got to get out of that brain.</v>

841
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.540
And that's going to be a common theme for not just for this show,

842
00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:39.120
not just for this podcast but forever.
Cause it's one of those things.

843
00:53:39.121 --> 00:53:44.121
It's really helped me and I think has helped the people that I've worked with

844
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:49.170
when they,
when they overcome that.
So there's some counseling

845
00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:53.060
for everybody,
myself included.

846
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:57.620
So now we are looking into the Internet questions.

847
00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:59.510
So again,

848
00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:03.740
if you're listening to this podcast and you're wondering where these questions

849
00:54:03.741 --> 00:54:08.510
come from,
they come from a couple of different places on the Internet.

850
00:54:08.511 --> 00:54:13.300
Facebook,
I actually get most of them from Twitter.

851
00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:18.010
Um,
you,
if you want to see what's happening on Twitter with me,

852
00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:22.780
it's at Jocko Willink.
If you want to see what's happening on Twitter with Echo,

853
00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.090
it's at Echo Charles.

854
00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:29.140
And if you wanna see what's happening on there.

855
00:54:29.141 --> 00:54:31.390
And also if you want to submit questions,

856
00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:36.420
then for me Twitter is the place to do it because I can jump on there you,

857
00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:39.880
that means you have to be disciplined and keep your question short.

858
00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:46.020
And I just dragged those questions out of there and and put them into the well

859
00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:51.480
of questions.
And
with that

860
00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:57.950
in some of my answer,
you know right there on the spot and some of them I go,

861
00:54:57.970 --> 00:55:02.160
Ooh,
that's a good topic.
So with that in mind and,
and I'll tell you,

862
00:55:02.161 --> 00:55:05.550
this is still from the well of questions where most of these,

863
00:55:05.551 --> 00:55:10.440
I don't have the name of the person cause I'm still on the well of questions of

864
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:12.630
the first time I asked and I got hundreds of questions.

865
00:55:12.631 --> 00:55:16.620
So I'm still going through those.
And here we go.

866
00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:21.270
What drove you to become an English major in college?

867
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:25.110
This is something I surprisingly get asked a lot.

868
00:55:25.111 --> 00:55:28.650
And I guess it shouldn't be that surprising because if you don't know my story

869
00:55:28.651 --> 00:55:31.050
with college,
I was actually already in the seal teams.

870
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:34.830
I had spent 10 years in the seal teams.

871
00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:37.620
When I finally got sent to college,

872
00:55:37.621 --> 00:55:41.610
I had to get a college degree in order to continue my career as a seal officer.

873
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:43.710
And when I went to college,

874
00:55:43.711 --> 00:55:46.500
it was not even a question that I was going to be an English major.

875
00:55:46.501 --> 00:55:48.000
So why is that?
Well,

876
00:55:48.001 --> 00:55:53.001
luckily I'd spent enough time in the seal teams to realize that the most

877
00:55:53.671 --> 00:55:58.671
important skill from an officer perspective that could differentiate and make

878
00:56:00.151 --> 00:56:04.310
you do a better job of something you can,

879
00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:06.030
I mean we talk about leadership all the time and,

880
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.640
and the different points and humility and discipline,

881
00:56:08.641 --> 00:56:10.590
all those things that make you a good leader,
that's great.

882
00:56:10.591 --> 00:56:12.600
But those aren't things that you learned in college.

883
00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:17.660
So which skill could I learn in college that will actually make me do a better

884
00:56:17.881 --> 00:56:19.530
job as a seal leader?

885
00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:24.010
And I knew before I even showed up there and exactly what

886
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.860
<v 2>that was going to be in that was English.
Why?
Well,</v>

887
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:31.480
English to me was the study of the English language.

888
00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:35.310
The English language is the methodology that we,

889
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:39.640
American humans use to communicate with each other.

890
00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:45.240
And as a leader it is critical that you have a good control and a good grip on

891
00:56:50.831 --> 00:56:55.330
this medium that you're going to use to communicate what your vision is,

892
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:59.920
what your ideas are,
what your strategies are,
what the orders are.

893
00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:04.720
You have to be able to do that in clear and concise language.

894
00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:09.400
And I knew that English would provide me with that.

895
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:14.430
You also have to be able to understand what you are being told to do or what the

896
00:57:16.301 --> 00:57:20.710
orders are or what the mission is or things like rules of engagement.

897
00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:25.690
So rules of engagement as a legal document written by lawyers and you have to

898
00:57:25.691 --> 00:57:27.400
read it and understand it.

899
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:33.250
And I found that this was very,

900
00:57:33.251 --> 00:57:37.510
very useful.
This was probably,
and again looking back,
cause you know what,

901
00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:40.510
I guess I could have gotten a degree in history and I could have really drilled

902
00:57:40.511 --> 00:57:42.490
down in the military and that would've been helpful as well.

903
00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:47.880
But the practical application of English in that job was very important.

904
00:57:51.071 --> 00:57:54.460
And I will tell you that in anyone that's gonna end up in a leadership position,

905
00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:57.820
the command of the English language is a very important thing.

906
00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:03.370
And when I started to get into Shakespeare

907
00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:10.090
and Shakespeare,
no,
there's at least half the audience just went,

908
00:58:10.091 --> 00:58:14.260
Oh God,
what is he talking about?
Shakespeare.
The thing about Shakespeare's,

909
00:58:14.261 --> 00:58:18.070
and this is what I had to learn in college,
when you first see Shakespeare,

910
00:58:18.071 --> 00:58:22.750
you think,
oh,
I don't understand this you,
this is a bunch of Gobbledygook.

911
00:58:22.751 --> 00:58:24.700
This doesn't sound like English.
I don't understand it.

912
00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:26.620
You're not supposed to understand it.

913
00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:30.190
And people don't pick up a Shakespeare play and just understand it.

914
00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:35.460
You have to study what the words mean.
The guy made up words,

915
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.170
he just made them up.
So how could you know what it means?

916
00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:40.840
You're lying if you say,
you know what I mean?
Is He made it up.

917
00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:44.830
He used archaic words that,
or words back then that weren't archaic,

918
00:58:44.831 --> 00:58:47.250
but there are archaic now and people do not use them anymore.

919
00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:50.020
So how could you know what they mean?
You don't.

920
00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:52.660
You have to look them up and figure out what they mean.

921
00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:58.170
And that was very good for me to take a bunch of Shakespeare and have to look at

922
00:58:59.771 --> 00:59:03.760
these,
look at this writing and figured out what it all means.

923
00:59:03.761 --> 00:59:07.750
Because I realized that when three years later,
four years later,

924
00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:11.290
when I got a rules of engagement that was written by a lawyer,

925
00:59:11.410 --> 00:59:14.200
and there was words in there I didn't understand,
I didn't just go,
Oh God,

926
00:59:14.201 --> 00:59:16.940
I don't understand this and throw it away.
No.
I said,
okay,
there's a word.

927
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.490
Understand.
I just need to look it up,

928
00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:22.820
figure out what it means and make sense of it.
And that's what,

929
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:27.470
that's what studying Shakespeare specifically did for me.
And you know,

930
00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:30.140
at some point we're going to get into some Shakespeare right here.

931
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:33.650
And there's some very,
very powerful

932
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:36.710
things that Shakespeare wrote,

933
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:41.720
which are unmatched in language,
in my opinion.

934
00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:45.050
So that's down the road.
Probably not too far,

935
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:50.300
but that is why I studied English in college.

936
00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:59.240
How do you deal with delayed onset muscle soreness or stiffness from weight

937
00:59:59.241 --> 01:00:02.650
training?
And how does it affect your Jujitsu?
Uh,

938
01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:07.610
the Jujitsu questions.
Awesome.
So

939
01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.790
obviously I work out,

940
01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:15.560
I work out pretty much every day I work out,

941
01:00:15.561 --> 01:00:18.770
that means I lift weights,
I do calisthenics,
I do sprints,

942
01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:23.800
I do some kind of physical conditioning every single day.

943
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:27.680
And that means that yes,

944
01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:32.740
I am always at least somewhat sore and tired when I show up to train the

945
01:00:34.311 --> 01:00:36.740
Jujitsu,
which I usually do in the evenings.

946
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:39.950
So for me,

947
01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:45.170
Jujitsu always makes me feel better.
You know,
you're,

948
01:00:45.171 --> 01:00:50.171
you're basically getting a very gnarly full body massage.

949
01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:51.380
When you train in Jujitsu,

950
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:56.410
you're getting a very aggressive and involuntary full body massage and you're

951
01:00:57.201 --> 01:01:01.820
getting stretched in different directions.
So whenever,
you know,

952
01:01:01.821 --> 01:01:05.560
if I did some exercise that made me sore,

953
01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:09.590
if I did dead lifts and I'm feeling sore,
tied to my back and I go do Jujitsu,

954
01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:12.400
by the time it's done,
I don't feel that soreness anymore.

955
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:16.200
So just like a massage or a stretch,
I think it,
it,
um,

956
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:20.960
loosens you up and,
and it's pretty normal for me.

957
01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:26.560
I also like to train sore and tired because it just makes training a little bit

958
01:01:26.961 --> 01:01:31.280
harder and makes you more ready.
And all that being said,

959
01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:36.580
when I do heavy squats or high repetition squats or any squats where I kind of

960
01:01:37.851 --> 01:01:38.750
pushed the envelope,

961
01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:43.010
yeah my legs are really sore and it sucks to get on the mat and I do it anyways.

962
01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:48.140
And,
and also the training,
while your muscles are sore,
when you're tired,

963
01:01:48.141 --> 01:01:52.370
it helps your technique.
Right.
So you're not in trouble.
She has a bigger guy.
Yup.

964
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:53.060
You know,

965
01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:56.900
having strengthened weight at the same time as an advantage can be used as a

966
01:01:56.901 --> 01:01:59.840
weapon but can get in the way of your technique.

967
01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:03.090
They can get new techniques and he can't get in the way of your progression and

968
01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:05.600
progress.
Yes,
for sure.
Um,

969
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:10.910
you might be speaking from a standpoint of someone who is in good condition by

970
01:02:10.911 --> 01:02:15.050
the way.
Cause I would say that for most people,
I would argue

971
01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.070
for most people it's not a full body

972
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.640
<v 0>massage.
It doesn't loosen you up.</v>

973
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:28.530
It makes you more sore.
Yes.
And you know what,
that's a good point.

974
01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:31.380
And beyond the fact this is,

975
01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:35.280
you actually are right on more points than you know,

976
01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:36.720
because beyond the fact that yes,

977
01:02:36.721 --> 01:02:39.780
I am in fairly good condition because I do work out every day.

978
01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:45.170
Also Jujitsu from me because I am experienced is generally not a 100% physical

979
01:02:49.051 --> 01:02:53.850
war like you have when you're not quite as experienced.

980
01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:57.720
Right.
And if you watched you,
you know,
when I'm rolling with guys,

981
01:02:57.721 --> 01:03:02.190
all my training partners,
they're all good guys too.
So we're,
we're training for,

982
01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:05.820
you know,
an hour and we can do it.

983
01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.430
It's not because we're that much better condition,

984
01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:11.430
it's just that we're that got much more relaxed or we're relying more on

985
01:03:11.431 --> 01:03:14.880
techniques.
So,
so that's a good point.
And I could see where in the early days,

986
01:03:14.881 --> 01:03:15.714
now that being said,

987
01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:20.280
I trained this way the whole time that I've trained.

988
01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:25.400
So I even when I was a spazz crazy,

989
01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:27.630
you know,
white belt warrior,

990
01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:33.180
I still worked out every day and when I was a blue belt training,
super hard,

991
01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:35.550
I still worked out everyday.
So you're,

992
01:03:35.790 --> 01:03:38.250
I was going down the path that you are right.

993
01:03:38.251 --> 01:03:41.790
But now I'm going to renege on that and say that you're wrong and you just need

994
01:03:41.791 --> 01:03:45.570
to work out and get on the mat,
loosen it up and keep trading.

995
01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.760
<v 5>Well yeah,
I think in the grand scheme of things you'd be more loose.
Yeah,</v>

996
01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:54.820
but we're talking about delayed onset muscle soreness I think.

997
01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:58.580
I think I would argue that most people after training Jujitsu,

998
01:03:58.581 --> 01:04:01.640
unless it is like just a light like role.
But if you're,
you know,

999
01:04:01.641 --> 01:04:04.100
if you're doing just,
I don't know,
your normal Jujitsu guy,

1000
01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:10.730
<v 0>let's say he does for around six minutes,
one minute in between [inaudible]</v>

1001
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:15.950
he's going to get more delayed onset muscle soreness the next day from the

1002
01:04:15.951 --> 01:04:20.690
Jujitsu.
I don't think so.
I think so.
I don't think so.

1003
01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:25.490
This is a issue that will not be solved on the Jocko podcast.

1004
01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:30.290
I would say try it.
Try it.
That's what I'm saying.
I think so.

1005
01:04:30.291 --> 01:04:35.030
Cause I've been trying it for years and years so we're going to go ahead.

1006
01:04:35.090 --> 01:04:37.610
Another thing is every time you show up to do Jujitsu,

1007
01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.660
it's not a competition day.
You know,

1008
01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.530
and not that you don't have roles and good roles and you go hard,

1009
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:49.130
but there is a difference between like,
oh,

1010
01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:51.410
I'm going to let this guy pass my guard or I'm going to,

1011
01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:53.750
I'm going to hang on with every little piece of might.

1012
01:04:54.110 --> 01:04:55.760
And what does this look you're giving me right now?

1013
01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:58.480
<v 5>I agree with you,</v>

1014
01:04:58.481 --> 01:05:02.920
but it still doesn't change my argument that even if you're rolling that way
yet,

1015
01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:08.520
I think that you have to roll pretty light to not get any delayed onset muscle.

1016
01:05:09.371 --> 01:05:09.690
Okay,

1017
01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:12.980
<v 0>and here's one more story and this is where,
this is where you might be,
right?</v>

1018
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:17.180
This is a funny story.
So like I just talked about when I went to college.

1019
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:22.120
So when I went to college at the University of San Diego,
it was,

1020
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.400
I was still in the military,
but I was,
my job was to go to college,

1021
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:31.450
which meant that for somebody that was used to working 18 hours a day as a seal,

1022
01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:35.710
all of a sudden I didn't have 18 hours a day to work.
So I trained a lot.

1023
01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:40.630
And one of the things I noticed one day,
for whatever reason I had,

1024
01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:45.660
I think I had one of my kids was born and I had final exams or just some,

1025
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:49.060
some perfect storm of events.

1026
01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:54.810
And I missed and I didn't train Jujitsu for three days.

1027
01:05:56.410 --> 01:06:01.410
And on the fourth day I got up out of bed and I felt all the like young and I

1028
01:06:02.801 --> 01:06:06.250
wasn't sore and I just,
I,
I was Dang,
I feel great.
What does this,

1029
01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:10.690
and knew what it was was that I hadn't trained.
And at that time,
at that time,
we,

1030
01:06:10.691 --> 01:06:15.691
this is when Dean lister and I were training like mad men and he was constantly

1031
01:06:16.421 --> 01:06:19.300
competing.
I was competing and he was,

1032
01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:23.650
and we would train for two to four hours a day of just cycle rolling.

1033
01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:26.950
And,
but again,
even when we were doing cycle rolling like that,

1034
01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:32.290
it wasn't competition day and,
but we,
but it definitely made me sore.
Yeah.

1035
01:06:32.291 --> 01:06:35.350
And so you do get some soreness.
You're,
you're correct.

1036
01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:38.960
I think I'm just used to being in a continued state of,
yeah,

1037
01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:41.180
<v 5>yeah.
That's what it is.
So when you're like,
oh yeah,</v>

1038
01:06:41.181 --> 01:06:43.470
I didn't roll for three days on that front end of that,

1039
01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:46.700
fourth day you woke up and you're like,
Dang,
I feel young.
What is this?

1040
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:51.470
That's called rest.
You rested and you recovered.
It happens.
Agriculture,

1041
01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:54.710
apple now.
And there'll be days obviously days when I don't get to train.

1042
01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:02.490
Okay.
So this question is,
um,
it,

1043
01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:04.740
I don't know if it's an addition to the other question,

1044
01:07:04.741 --> 01:07:07.250
but it's phrased like this also,
I'd like to hear more,

1045
01:07:07.251 --> 01:07:11.730
but more about your writing process.
Tough Times.
What worked well,

1046
01:07:11.731 --> 01:07:12.900
creative breakthroughs.

1047
01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:17.280
<v 0>Is that true?
I don't think these were related.
I think this is just pulled out,</v>

1048
01:07:17.281 --> 01:07:20.790
so,
oh,
right,
right.
Okay.
Creative breakthroughs.

1049
01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.273
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1050
01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:27.930
<v 0>So first of all,
if to go specifically on how I wrote this book,</v>

1051
01:07:27.931 --> 01:07:31.140
and you could probably apply this to any kind of task that you're looking at

1052
01:07:31.141 --> 01:07:34.550
doing,
but the first thing we did,
and Leif and I wrote this book together,

1053
01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:38.100
the first thing we did was we outlined the book and what the chapters were about

1054
01:07:38.310 --> 01:07:40.350
and what the stories inside the chapters.

1055
01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:43.890
So we both knew what the chapter was and then we said,

1056
01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:46.080
and if you haven't read the book,

1057
01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:50.910
I wrote half the chapters and he wrote half the chapters,

1058
01:07:50.911 --> 01:07:51.990
so we didn't,

1059
01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:56.910
we didn't write it together and try and mind meld the whole thing.

1060
01:07:56.911 --> 01:08:00.900
Now the intro we wrote together in the outro or whatever it's called,

1061
01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:03.240
we wrote it together and that was cool.
You know,

1062
01:08:03.241 --> 01:08:05.610
we just edited it because it was both of us talking,

1063
01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:10.820
but we didn't have to try and mind meld or or come to agreement on the rest of

1064
01:08:10.951 --> 01:08:15.120
it.
We just wrote separate chapters.
And so what I did was once we,

1065
01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:17.540
we knew what the chapters were,
once we knew what they were going to be about,

1066
01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:23.140
then I wrote a thousand words a day no matter what that was.

1067
01:08:24.051 --> 01:08:28.160
My,
I was very busy at the time,
was doing some big contracts.

1068
01:08:28.161 --> 01:08:33.161
I was super busy and I knew that I had to do it in chunks.

1069
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:38.890
And I also know that my attention span is I can force it,

1070
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:43.730
but it's not fun.
So a thousand words took me about an hour,

1071
01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:47.850
like 50 minutes to an hour.
So every day,
no matter what,
I sat down and I,

1072
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:52.310
I ended up writing about 60,000 words.
So it took me,
I think it was 55,000 words,

1073
01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:56.900
took me 55 days,
55 days straight in my draft was done.
And that's,

1074
01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:02.120
that's,
there's a couple of good advantages to it.
Number one,

1075
01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:03.940
when you write every day,
if you write,

1076
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:05.960
if you skip two days and then you'd go back,
guess what?

1077
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.350
You've got to go back and reread what you wrote because you don't remember it.

1078
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:14.060
Whereas if you just go back into it,
I could just pick up where I left off.
Boom.

1079
01:09:14.061 --> 01:09:16.970
I could start writing again an hour later,
I'm done.
Don't have to waste any time.

1080
01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.510
I have to go back and reread.
I know what my train of thought was.

1081
01:09:20.511 --> 01:09:24.410
That's important thing.
Mental.
So,
so that was important.

1082
01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:28.570
And sometimes I didn't feel like writing of course,
but I just wrote anyways.

1083
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:31.070
And sometimes it would come out not that great,
but it doesn't matter.

1084
01:09:31.071 --> 01:09:33.860
You've got a thousand words that you can hone and you can adjust and you can

1085
01:09:33.861 --> 01:09:38.750
turn it into something good in.
And also it just takes away every excuse is gone.

1086
01:09:38.751 --> 01:09:40.090
There's no excuse.
There's no excuses.

1087
01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:43.310
There's only you do what you're supposed to do.
That's the only thing.
Not,

1088
01:09:43.311 --> 01:09:46.610
I'm don't know what to think.
I um,
I'm,
I lost my train of thought.

1089
01:09:46.611 --> 01:09:49.300
I have writer's block or whatever.
I'm too tired.
No,

1090
01:09:49.301 --> 01:09:52.640
it's like one answer for all these problems.
And that is right.

1091
01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:56.330
So you've got writer's block.
Good,
right?
You got A,
I'm too tired.

1092
01:09:56.331 --> 01:09:59.060
I had a long day.
Good.
Right.
Oh,
I'm stuck.

1093
01:09:59.061 --> 01:10:02.270
And I don't know where to take this story.
Good.
Right.
That's the only,

1094
01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:04.430
it's just one answer.
Solved every problems.

1095
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:09.530
And that's kind of the same thing with,
with everything,
you know,

1096
01:10:09.531 --> 01:10:13.820
with going to the gym.
You know what,
I'm tired.
Good.
Go work out.
I'm sore.
Good.

1097
01:10:13.821 --> 01:10:18.380
Go work out.
I'm super busy right now.
Good.
Go workout.
You could do this,

1098
01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:22.640
you can apply this to any sort of,
you know,
with training,
Jujitsu.

1099
01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:27.230
I Dunno if I'm,
I'm,
I'm not feeling like my a game tonight.
Good.

1100
01:10:27.231 --> 01:10:30.560
Go train when you're weak.
Right.
Good.
Go train when you're mentally not,

1101
01:10:30.561 --> 01:10:33.530
not there because it doesn't matter.
What is it?

1102
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:36.620
Is it the world championships today?
And even if it is the world championships,

1103
01:10:36.621 --> 01:10:38.350
you got to go fight anyways because it's the world championships.

1104
01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:43.010
So get on the mat and train.
Yeah,
you can,
you can

1105
01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.740
<v 5>look at these when you say that,
that applies to everything.</v>

1106
01:10:46.770 --> 01:10:47.940
Like you don't feel like it or whatever.

1107
01:10:47.941 --> 01:10:52.620
A lot of times create like creative block and I'm just realizing,

1108
01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:54.630
right when you said that this is the first time,

1109
01:10:54.631 --> 01:10:57.990
I'm kind of understanding this and realizing that,
okay,

1110
01:10:57.991 --> 01:11:02.370
when you have a creative block,
that's almost like
in my experience,

1111
01:11:02.371 --> 01:11:07.371
it's a good reason to not do creative stuff cause I can't because creativity

1112
01:11:07.801 --> 01:11:11.580
comes from a real,
like you have to feel it,
you have to want to do it.

1113
01:11:11.581 --> 01:11:14.910
It's like a creative thing.
Inspirado

1114
01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:19.440
<v 0>yeah.
Or you cannot,
you manufacture Inspirado tech quote.
Tenacious D.</v>

1115
01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:22.750
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You can't,
you know,
get me back on any,

1116
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:26.460
whenever it's brought up.
So,
you know,
it's different than going to the gym.

1117
01:11:26.461 --> 01:11:29.940
So are you saying though,
if you get creative block,

1118
01:11:29.941 --> 01:11:31.050
and for those of you who don't know,

1119
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.920
Echo Does v writes and produces and films and directs videos of all kinds.

1120
01:11:39.330 --> 01:11:43.350
So you're saying when you can't think of what to write,
you just stop.

1121
01:11:45.570 --> 01:11:50.040
Yes,
we have a queer in our meds,
you know what I'm saying is,

1122
01:11:50.041 --> 01:11:52.390
and that's okay.
I mean we all different techniques.
My,

1123
01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:55.080
my technique is not better than your technique.
Your technique may work.

1124
01:11:55.081 --> 01:11:58.050
Sometimes it may be work 100% for you.

1125
01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.740
I'm talking about my technique and my technique was like,
okay,

1126
01:12:01.741 --> 01:12:03.450
I've got writer's block.
I don't know where to go with this.

1127
01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:04.760
I'm going to write anyways.
Right,

1128
01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:07.710
and what you're saying is when that happens to you,
you say,
you know what,

1129
01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:11.430
I'm just going to walk away from it right now and come back to it later and

1130
01:12:11.431 --> 01:12:15.360
that's okay.
I see it until right now though.
I just realized that when you said,

1131
01:12:15.361 --> 01:12:15.601
okay,

1132
01:12:15.601 --> 01:12:20.601
if you don't feel like writing or good do it anyway because I guess I never

1133
01:12:21.541 --> 01:12:24.330
really thought past that because when you say,
yeah,

1134
01:12:24.331 --> 01:12:26.730
you'll just have more stuff to hone into.
Okay.

1135
01:12:26.731 --> 01:12:28.950
If later on when you do hit inspiration,

1136
01:12:28.951 --> 01:12:31.710
which now you have more material to draw inspiration from,

1137
01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:36.220
it's going to come clear like,
okay,
that thing that I wrote or you know,

1138
01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:40.500
put in when I wasn't inspired the,
okay,
that's got to go,

1139
01:12:40.501 --> 01:12:43.710
but you can learn so much from what you put down there.
Why doesn't that work?
Or,

1140
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:44.131
Dang,

1141
01:12:44.131 --> 01:12:47.490
that was pretty good when I was feeling bored at when I was feeling whatever.

1142
01:12:47.491 --> 01:12:49.760
That's pretty good.
I'm gonna use that,
you know?
So you're gonna,

1143
01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:54.270
you're gonna get way more results potentially than you would if you simply don't

1144
01:12:54.271 --> 01:12:57.060
do anything and wait.
And what if the inspiration doesn't come back,

1145
01:12:57.210 --> 01:13:02.010
which she'd flocking doesn't a lot of the time,
then it's too late.
So yeah.

1146
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:06.000
Good lesson learned right there.
Thanks.
That is a good one.

1147
01:13:06.330 --> 01:13:11.330
So next question from Jennifer from Jennifer.

1148
01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:15.180
This one I put in there that has a name.
Nice.
Jennifer.

1149
01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:18.510
Jennifer says,
I'm really struggling with focus lately.

1150
01:13:19.050 --> 01:13:22.080
I'd love for you to cover it on the podcast.

1151
01:13:22.410 --> 01:13:25.450
Focus cover that this is,

1152
01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.540
do we get asked this a lot about focus?

1153
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:30.990
I don't know if we've got last specifically.
Yeah.
Specifically about focus,

1154
01:13:30.991 --> 01:13:35.070
but this is one of those things,
and this is,

1155
01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:40.160
this is I'm starting to realize a underlying theme with a lot of,

1156
01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.980
with a lot of what people are asking me and

1157
01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.193
<v 3>yeah,</v>

1158
01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:47.221
<v 0>that is,</v>

1159
01:13:47.221 --> 01:13:52.221
I think people have a vision or a thought that I am.

1160
01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:58.380
I've got some answer that is like,
Oh,
you didn't lack focus,

1161
01:13:58.410 --> 01:13:59.340
follow steps one,

1162
01:13:59.341 --> 01:14:03.180
two and three and I've talked about this with leadership and then I've got some

1163
01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.070
easy button solution for these situations.

1164
01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:13.940
And this got me thinking about my kids and one of my daughters who when she was,

1165
01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:16.510
I don't know what,

1166
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:19.180
how old you are when you're supposed to learn the times tables,

1167
01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:25.140
but she was that age and she got really disappointed because she didn't know our

1168
01:14:26.501 --> 01:14:30.550
times tables and she would actually,
you're young.
When I,
again,
I don't,

1169
01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:35.350
I forget the grade,
but it's,
you know,
it's like maybe second grade,
third grade,

1170
01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:38.290
second,
third grade.
So she supposed to know her times tables,

1171
01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:40.990
she doesn't know him and she starts getting this,

1172
01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:46.040
this negative attitude of I'm stupid.
You know,

1173
01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:50.770
I'm dumb.
Other kids know them.
I don't know him.
And I just said,

1174
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:55.540
oh well have you studied them?
And she hadn't,

1175
01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:56.620
she hadn't studied them.

1176
01:14:56.621 --> 01:15:01.420
She'd sat in class when they would go over to them and she'd picked up 50 or 60

1177
01:15:01.421 --> 01:15:05.830
or maybe even 70% of them.
But you know,
there's some hard ones in there,
right?

1178
01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:09.770
12 Times 1212 times 12 is a tough one.
You know,

1179
01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:12.640
there's some tricky ones in there that she didn't know.
And so I said,

1180
01:15:12.670 --> 01:15:17.620
oh well you need to study them and then you'll know them.
So you know,

1181
01:15:17.621 --> 01:15:20.410
we made the flash cards and she studied them and all of a sudden she knew him

1182
01:15:20.411 --> 01:15:24.880
and then she realized that you have to practice these things and you have to put

1183
01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:28.420
effort into them.
And it's the same thing with sports.
No,

1184
01:15:28.421 --> 01:15:31.140
you'll get the kid that says,
I'm not any good at baseball.
We've,

1185
01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:33.220
you don't spend any time practicing it.

1186
01:15:34.090 --> 01:15:38.950
And so it's the same thing with focus.
You,

1187
01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:42.490
it takes effort.
You just don't,
I don't wake up in the morning,
flip a switch,

1188
01:15:42.491 --> 01:15:43.900
and then become focused.
When I was writing,

1189
01:15:43.901 --> 01:15:47.620
when I was just talking about writing this,
this book that we wrote,
I didn't go,

1190
01:15:47.621 --> 01:15:50.360
okay,
flip the switch for focus.
I'm going to do a thousand words right now.
No,
no.

1191
01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.250
I had to,
I did sit down and go,
okay,
listen,
idiot,
this is your job.

1192
01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:58.210
You need to do it,
get it done.
You know another,

1193
01:15:58.270 --> 01:16:03.270
another funny story is in the seal teams we have these helmets where we had

1194
01:16:04.991 --> 01:16:06.130
them,
we've modified them since,

1195
01:16:06.131 --> 01:16:09.790
but had these helmets and underneath the helmets you would wear this,

1196
01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:14.230
this headset that your radio headphones would go into some.

1197
01:16:14.290 --> 01:16:16.060
When you're in the seal teams,
you're out on the battlefield.

1198
01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:18.940
You got to talk to different people and you've got to have a radio and you've

1199
01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:22.780
got nice almost,
I guess it would be to describe it.

1200
01:16:22.781 --> 01:16:26.440
It's like a Bose noise canceling headset for all practical purposes,

1201
01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:29.320
but it's durable and you wear that underneath your helmet.

1202
01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:33.280
And if you're in a leadership position and sometimes you have one group of

1203
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.590
people talking into one ear and the other one might be the air frequency.

1204
01:16:38.591 --> 01:16:39.760
So you can hear the aircraft talking.

1205
01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:44.500
So you've got all this stuff going on inside your head and that's tricky and

1206
01:16:45.010 --> 01:16:45.843
kind of a pain.

1207
01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:50.830
But what was really painful was the way they made these headsets,

1208
01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:52.080
they didn't fit right.

1209
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:58.060
So they were very painful and they actually squeezed your head.

1210
01:16:58.061 --> 01:16:58.750
So when you put your,

1211
01:16:58.750 --> 01:17:02.020
you put your headset on and then you put your helmet on over it and it actually

1212
01:17:02.021 --> 01:17:06.310
squeezed your head and it was very,
very uncomfortable.
Give you a headache.

1213
01:17:06.311 --> 01:17:09.250
It was just,
it just wasn't fun at all.
It sucked.

1214
01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:16.420
So we were out on this training mission and this is when I was a task unit

1215
01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:20.930
commander and it was a long one.
It was,
you know,
14 hours.

1216
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:25.400
We were out there on this target and we were securing it and we were holding it

1217
01:17:25.401 --> 01:17:27.590
and we are searching and doing all this stuff.
It took a long time.

1218
01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:32.420
In about eight hours into it,

1219
01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:37.690
one of the junior officers came up to me and he says,

1220
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:43.940
have you kept your helmet on this whole time?
And I said,
yes.

1221
01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.510
He said,
doesn't it hurt a lot?

1222
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:52.910
And I said yes.
And that was it.

1223
01:17:53.150 --> 01:17:53.900
You know,

1224
01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:57.410
there was just pain to be experienced that I just sucked it up and eventually we

1225
01:17:57.411 --> 01:18:00.890
figured out how to,
how to cure it.
But the point is,
is that,

1226
01:18:00.891 --> 01:18:05.030
does it take some pain to focus?
Yes,
it is not easy.
There's,

1227
01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:09.770
it takes will and it takes mental effort to make it happen.

1228
01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:13.520
You know,
when it's there we get into kind of the things,

1229
01:18:13.521 --> 01:18:16.220
I think I talked about this last week,
but you know,
shut off the music,

1230
01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:19.490
set a goal for what you're trying to get done and then put a time limit on it.

1231
01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:22.250
You know that I used to race myself when I was writing those words,
you know,

1232
01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:25.880
like race and see how fast I could get them done and then go and that's,

1233
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:27.050
that's that,
that's your focus.

1234
01:18:27.051 --> 01:18:29.690
Your focus is something that you control and you can make happen.

1235
01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:32.300
So get focused,

1236
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:38.210
<v 5>practice focusing,
practice focusing.
Yeah cause he kind of</v>

1237
01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:44.420
at first glance or the first thought isn't that you practice focusing,

1238
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:49.220
you focus on practicing or you focus on writing where you focus on,
you know,

1239
01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:51.350
and if he can't focus like Dang,
that sucks.

1240
01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:55.810
But if you practice focusing then you can focus on your writing and focus.

1241
01:18:55.850 --> 01:19:00.380
And also everybody knows the deadlines make you more focused when something's

1242
01:19:00.381 --> 01:19:04.160
due.
I mean so put a deadline on yourself and make it real somehow.
Right?

1243
01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:08.660
Like kind of like if someone texts you,
say,
Hey,
I'll be over in 10 minutes.

1244
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:13.790
You can clean your house pretty quick in that 10 minutes.
That's true.
I mean,

1245
01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:17.430
but give yourself three hours to clean.
It's going to take three hours.

1246
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:18.283
It'll probably take three.

1247
01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:23.000
<v 0>And I say when,
when people would to plan for an operation,</v>

1248
01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.400
how long does it take to plan for an operation?

1249
01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:28.580
We always say a half an hour longer than you have.

1250
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:32.140
That's how long it takes to just get on it and start planning it and,

1251
01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:35.720
and go forward.
And also diet.
What do you eat

1252
01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:40.010
<v 5>and any thoughts on using suits,
superfood,</v>

1253
01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:44.510
<v 0>amaranth to increase fuel,
nutrition,
amaranth.</v>

1254
01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:47.180
Do you know what Amaranth is?
No,
I didn't know what it was either.

1255
01:19:47.181 --> 01:19:49.130
I didn't look it up and looked at it.
I looked it up.

1256
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:51.980
I'm no stranger to looking things up.
No one is injured.

1257
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:56.420
It's some kind of a grain,
some kind of a grain.

1258
01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.540
So what do I eat?
Uh,
in short,

1259
01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:04.220
I guess you'd classify me as a Paleo type of person.

1260
01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:08.940
I a steak,
I eat chicken,
I eat pork.

1261
01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:12.000
I actually,
for whatever reason,

1262
01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:16.620
don't like the taste of fish and seafood that much,
or eggs,

1263
01:20:16.621 --> 01:20:20.270
which is really unfortunate.
Yeah,
I know.
It's really bizarre.
Uh,

1264
01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:24.060
I eat a lot of hamburgers growing up and I kind of didn't eat a lot of seafood

1265
01:20:24.061 --> 01:20:27.750
grownups,
so I just am not,
not a big fan.
So I,
but I eat a lot of steak,
chicken,

1266
01:20:27.751 --> 01:20:32.250
pork,
I some kind of salad,
you know,
just about every day.
A Caesar,

1267
01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:35.790
I love Caesar Salad.
So I had a lot of that,
a spinach salad.

1268
01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:38.610
I put a lot of olive oil on it,
kind of Bay that this is

1269
01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:45.350
Peter Attia who's a really smart doctor and the,

1270
01:20:48.570 --> 01:20:51.480
I guess the president and CEO of something called a new set new sea,

1271
01:20:51.481 --> 01:20:54.120
which is this nutrition science,
which is large,

1272
01:20:54.570 --> 01:20:57.210
the biggest organization to study nutrition.

1273
01:20:58.230 --> 01:21:03.230
And he gave me a good fault or the way he explained the salads.

1274
01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:04.510
You know,

1275
01:21:04.510 --> 01:21:09.510
he looked at salads as a vehicle to eat fat by just putting a ton of olive oil

1276
01:21:11.490 --> 01:21:12.480
basically.
So I,

1277
01:21:12.481 --> 01:21:15.420
I've gotten into that lately and just really making these big salads with

1278
01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:18.030
massive amounts of olive oil so I can get plenty of fat.

1279
01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:23.100
So I'm definitely a fan of eating as much fat as possible.
You know,

1280
01:21:23.101 --> 01:21:27.930
if you want to,
if you want to talk about why I do that,
if you,

1281
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:31.260
you know,
there's a book called good calories,
bad calories by Gary Tobbs,

1282
01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:35.340
which is a fantastic book and it gives a lot of background on it.

1283
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:38.640
The eye,
like I said,
Peter Attia,

1284
01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.050
who's just a brilliant guy who I've had a lot of great long conversations with

1285
01:21:43.051 --> 01:21:46.650
because we've done some stuff together and he's actually the person that

1286
01:21:46.651 --> 01:21:49.230
introduced me to Tim Ferriss.
I,
I mentioned that on the first podcast,

1287
01:21:49.231 --> 01:21:50.490
but it's funny,

1288
01:21:50.491 --> 01:21:54.630
we'll go out for dinner and he wants to know about seal stuff,

1289
01:21:55.230 --> 01:21:58.590
but I just want to about nutrition stuff in his take on nutrition stuff so that

1290
01:21:58.591 --> 01:22:02.760
we have good conversations and good trade offs,
but he will,
you know,

1291
01:22:02.761 --> 01:22:05.040
he explains a lot of this stuff really well.
And then,

1292
01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:09.900
and then another good thing,
there's on the Tim Ferriss podcast,

1293
01:22:09.901 --> 01:22:14.901
he did an interview with Dom D'agostino who's got a really good perspective and

1294
01:22:15.871 --> 01:22:18.900
other another doctor that's,
you know,

1295
01:22:18.901 --> 01:22:21.810
a workout guy and understand nutrition very well.

1296
01:22:21.811 --> 01:22:26.811
So that's where I have gotten to in my life and I've got a long story,

1297
01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:31.710
you know,
about nutrition and maybe someday we can go into it.

1298
01:22:31.710 --> 01:22:34.920
It's just just the discovery and it's just with everyone else.

1299
01:22:34.921 --> 01:22:39.210
I mean just the fact that I guess 20 something 25 years ago,

1300
01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:41.790
everyone thought,
well not everyone,

1301
01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:46.590
but most people thought fat was bad and carbs were good.

1302
01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:51.750
That's not true.
Actually.
Carbs are bad and fat is good.

1303
01:22:51.870 --> 01:22:54.030
So it's been a,
it's been a real,

1304
01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:57.900
and I was lucky to have been around people that knew that early and,

1305
01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:03.450
and taught the information to me.
So that's,
that's the in a nutshell.

1306
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:06.700
And if you want to get with the experts,
then people like Gary Tobbs,

1307
01:23:06.701 --> 01:23:09.610
people like Peter Attia,
people like Dom D'agostino,

1308
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:14.740
they're the ones that can give you the science behind what I'm talking about or,

1309
01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.600
or what I've experienced as well.

1310
01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:20.373
Nutrition.

1311
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:25.630
Nutrition is also one of those subjects that,
you know,

1312
01:23:25.631 --> 01:23:28.150
people vehemently disagree with each other on.

1313
01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:33.630
There was a while where I was banned by my wife from talking about nutrition

1314
01:23:34.451 --> 01:23:39.451
with her friends in the early days of me being completely pro fat and pro

1315
01:23:40.630 --> 01:23:45.550
protein and really anti carbohydrates when no one really thought that,

1316
01:23:45.551 --> 01:23:48.100
you know,
10 years ago in,

1317
01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:52.300
I would be giving all of her friends a hard time about what they reading and

1318
01:23:52.301 --> 01:23:53.440
what they were feeding their kids.

1319
01:23:53.441 --> 01:23:57.790
And my wife eventually banned me because I was problematic in that situation

1320
01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:01.210
cause I could see that.
Yeah.
I mean even just saying,
you know,

1321
01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:05.290
carbs are bad.
I mean there's a lot to that,
you know,

1322
01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:10.210
but to say carbs are bad,
that's a controversial thing to exactly.
Yeah.

1323
01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:15.250
And this another thing that I keep saying this,
but I'm not,

1324
01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:19.970
I'm not here to convince anybody and if you want to tell me that carbs are
great,

1325
01:24:20.050 --> 01:24:25.000
good for you.
I hope you enjoy type two diabetes,
get after it,
but,

1326
01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:29.020
but it's not like carbs.
Cute.
Thisi what you're doing right now,

1327
01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:33.560
you're going to start a little argument and no,
no,
I'm not going to.
Okay.

1328
01:24:34.090 --> 01:24:38.200
But because the bottom line is I don't,
this is stuff that I

1329
01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:43.990
have figured out,
I've learned from people,
I've used it myself,

1330
01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:46.990
and I know what works for me.
And,

1331
01:24:46.991 --> 01:24:49.420
and if you don't want to believe that I'm okay with that.

1332
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:53.740
I'm not here to save your life.
I'm not here to change your mind.
You know?

1333
01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:54.731
And it's the same thing.
You know,

1334
01:24:54.731 --> 01:24:58.390
you've heard me say this about Jujitsu where I used to be really,
you know,

1335
01:24:58.391 --> 01:25:01.330
know Jiu Jitsu is better than this and she just better than that.
Now I'm like,

1336
01:25:01.331 --> 01:25:04.840
no,
actually there's other,
and first of all there's other perspectives,

1337
01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:09.550
but also that are correct and Jujitsu.
And I actually believe that you did too.

1338
01:25:09.551 --> 01:25:11.860
I actually do believe need to be well rounded and all this other stuff.
But

1339
01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:17.590
the bottom line is I'm not a,
I'm not a here to convert people,

1340
01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.390
but somebody asked what I ate and I told them.
Right.
And that's,

1341
01:25:22.391 --> 01:25:26.710
that's what I typically,
that is 100% true.
That's what I did.

1342
01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:30.670
And if you want to argue those points,
don't argue with me.

1343
01:25:31.150 --> 01:25:34.510
Argue with Peter Attia.
Argue with Gary Taubes,

1344
01:25:35.410 --> 01:25:40.150
argue with Dom D'agostino cause those guys are s w I mean Peter and dom are

1345
01:25:40.151 --> 01:25:43.690
scientists and doctors so they know and they will give you the facts,

1346
01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:47.890
which I could give you,
but I won't be doing nearly as convincingly.
Yeah,
yeah.

1347
01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.670
Okay.
Next question.
A couple of guys I'd like to hear your thoughts on

1348
01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.230
Richard Mark Chenko,

1349
01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:02.500
Marcinko Marcinko and Henry Rollins

1350
01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:09.320
Marcinko and Rollins.
So let's start off with

1351
01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:16.610
Dick Marcinko demo.
Dick Marcinko,
who if you don't know who that is,

1352
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:20.000
he was a seal in Vietnam,

1353
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:22.400
a seal officer in Vietnam.

1354
01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:27.640
He was the founder of seal team six he created seal team six he ended up getting

1355
01:26:34.011 --> 01:26:39.011
in trouble with the navy and they kind of did a witch hunt on him.

1356
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:44.210
And he was eventually,
I don't actually,
he did.

1357
01:26:44.211 --> 01:26:45.950
He did a little bit of jail time.

1358
01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:51.400
They found that he had falsified some travel records and maybe some money.

1359
01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.750
They found stuff on him,

1360
01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:58.970
but it was kind of trivial stuff that was trumped up.
Um,

1361
01:26:59.450 --> 01:27:04.450
but be in a forced him out of the military and he wrote a book in the 90

1362
01:27:05.841 --> 01:27:07.480
[inaudible] in the early nineties,
cause it,

1363
01:27:07.481 --> 01:27:11.600
it showed up in the seal teams right around when I got actually through buds and

1364
01:27:11.601 --> 01:27:12.211
under the seal team.

1365
01:27:12.211 --> 01:27:17.211
So it was sometime around 1990 or 1991 he wrote a book called Rogue Warrior and

1366
01:27:18.771 --> 01:27:23.240
it did amazing,
well sold a lot of copies and it was,

1367
01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:28.780
it definitely broke the mold of this idea of the quiet professional,

1368
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:33.710
which was how I was small.
Certainly raised in the seal teams.

1369
01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:34.760
And it's something that I've,

1370
01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:39.890
I've obviously contradicted now because wrote a book with life,

1371
01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:42.560
have this podcast.
I've been on TV,
so I've,

1372
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:46.340
I've definitely broke the paradigm of the quiet professional.

1373
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:54.490
I absolutely try to respect the spirit of the quiet professional.

1374
01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:59.450
And I,
I'm not,
you know,
even if you,

1375
01:27:59.451 --> 01:28:03.620
the book that Lafe and I wrote isn't a book about our triumphs and everything.

1376
01:28:03.621 --> 01:28:04.200
We did greater,

1377
01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:09.200
it's a book about what we learned at usually from bad situations and humbling

1378
01:28:11.031 --> 01:28:13.460
experience.
That's what the book is about.

1379
01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:18.520
And it's an effort to pass on leadership lessons learned that we learned in a

1380
01:28:19.821 --> 01:28:24.140
humbling way.
So,
so there's that.

1381
01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:30.680
But Richard Marcinko from my perspective and the seal teams,
and again,

1382
01:28:30.681 --> 01:28:34.310
this was right when I came in,
he was kind of the guy that broke this mold and,

1383
01:28:34.311 --> 01:28:36.100
and of course there's been,
you know,

1384
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:40.700
dozens and dozens of quote unquote seal books now,

1385
01:28:41.690 --> 01:28:42.650
but here are the first one,

1386
01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:47.740
very well received and definitely got some flack from the seal community.

1387
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:53.240
And that is what it is now.
Now,

1388
01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:58.330
I worked for guys that worked for him that literally,

1389
01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:02.220
or you know,
they,
that he was their commanding officer.

1390
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:08.010
And I remember one of them,
I said to this one senior guy that was,

1391
01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:12.420
had been ton of experience and I said,
you know,
you worked for Marcinko.

1392
01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:17.010
Well how was he?
And he looked at me with no hesitation,

1393
01:29:17.011 --> 01:29:20.880
said best commanding officer I ever had.
And that's,

1394
01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:25.940
I heard that everybody ever asked just about told me that the only people that

1395
01:29:27.091 --> 01:29:30.510
you'd hear anything different from would be senior senior officers,

1396
01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:35.460
that he was,
you know,
he'd be over the top.
He wasn't,

1397
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:39.690
he didn't quite play the game and,
but there's no doubt about it.

1398
01:29:39.691 --> 01:29:40.381
He was a tough guy.

1399
01:29:40.381 --> 01:29:44.880
He was a hardcore guy and the guys that worked for him,

1400
01:29:45.570 --> 01:29:46.860
respected him and liked him.

1401
01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:53.180
The thing that I learned from him was seeing how that transition took place and

1402
01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:58.680
how he,
he,
the thing that got him

1403
01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.470
to where he was to,

1404
01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:06.160
to get that responsibility of creating seal team six,

1405
01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:11.520
which is this elite counter terrorist part of the navy.

1406
01:30:12.230 --> 01:30:16.420
You know,
obviously he was trusted and he was liked and he was respected.

1407
01:30:16.930 --> 01:30:19.690
And so I saw that he had gotten himself to that level,

1408
01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:22.370
which is very cool.

1409
01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:31.490
But I also saw,
and I,

1410
01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:33.460
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1411
01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:35.170
<v 0>again,
this is a topic that comes up a lot.</v>

1412
01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:38.050
Our strengths are often our biggest wheat weaknesses.

1413
01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:42.400
And so this kind of cowboy mentality,
this aggressive mentality that he had,

1414
01:30:44.050 --> 01:30:47.500
it got him there.
But once he got there,

1415
01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:52.180
he doesn't seem like he was able to reign that back in.

1416
01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:58.150
And that is something that I became cognizant of because no doubt,

1417
01:30:58.180 --> 01:30:59.440
when I was a younger guy,

1418
01:30:59.441 --> 01:31:03.340
when I was a young seal and then a young seal officer,

1419
01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.620
I was definitely fairly cowboyish.

1420
01:31:06.250 --> 01:31:08.710
And as I moved up the ranks,

1421
01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:14.100
I recognized that I had to mature and I had to grow up and I had to do things

1422
01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:16.241
differently.

1423
01:31:16.241 --> 01:31:21.070
I couldn't do the same things they did when I was a young platoon guy as I

1424
01:31:21.071 --> 01:31:21.904
could.

1425
01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:25.030
I had to tighten it up when I became a young officer and then there became a

1426
01:31:25.031 --> 01:31:29.890
platoon commander and then I became a task in your commander and I had to grow

1427
01:31:29.891 --> 01:31:33.370
up,
you know,
for lack of a better word.
And,
and looking back,

1428
01:31:33.371 --> 01:31:37.480
I should've grown up even more,
you know,
but you don't see that at the time.

1429
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:43.470
So that's something that I learned from Marcenko even though I never worked for

1430
01:31:45.731 --> 01:31:47.620
him.
And I met him a handful of times,
you know,

1431
01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:49.720
but never spent any actual time with them.

1432
01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:55.020
But I have also seen this exact same thing with business leaders,

1433
01:31:56.021 --> 01:32:01.021
with CEOs is specially with CEOs that come into a company that is not doing well

1434
01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:06.790
and there's only one kind of person that can turn that company around.

1435
01:32:06.791 --> 01:32:08.920
Somebody with a dynamic personalities and with a vision,

1436
01:32:08.921 --> 01:32:10.300
someone that's going to kick down doors,

1437
01:32:10.301 --> 01:32:11.590
some of these going to make things happen.

1438
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:15.520
And you see those guys go in there and they get that done and they turn those

1439
01:32:15.521 --> 01:32:20.521
companies around and then the real test comes is can they transition from being

1440
01:32:20.981 --> 01:32:25.660
that cowboy to be in that company person to be in that straight shooter

1441
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:27.940
straightened Arrow that takes,

1442
01:32:27.941 --> 01:32:32.530
that takes the company then from survival to thrive.

1443
01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:36.160
And some of them make it and some of them don't.

1444
01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:41.340
And I look at Dick Marcinko as a cautionary tale to everybody that comes up

1445
01:32:41.861 --> 01:32:46.861
through the ranks and gets to that point where you're need to take it to the

1446
01:32:47.171 --> 01:32:50.890
next level and how you have to change what got you there

1447
01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:53.890
is not going to be what keeps you there.

1448
01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:56.980
You have to change and you have to adapt and grow.

1449
01:32:57.130 --> 01:33:01.060
And so I think that's important to recognize and it's important to constantly be

1450
01:33:01.061 --> 01:33:05.440
looking around for examples and saying,
okay,
I see.

1451
01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:09.370
I saw what happened there and try and push yourself forward.

1452
01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.680
So that's,
that's my,

1453
01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:16.550
I don't want to say my opinion because it's not really my opinion.
That's,

1454
01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:20.950
those are my thoughts on demo.
Dick Marcinko,

1455
01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:24.640
the rogue warrior.
The other one

1456
01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.120
is Henry Rollins,

1457
01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:32.350
and if you don't know who Henry Rollins is,

1458
01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:37.380
he was a young kid from the DC area who grew up in the punk rock scene in DC.

1459
01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:48.820
Went to a military academy,
and eventually,

1460
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:53.910
even though he was kind of just a kid at at some point,

1461
01:33:54.190 --> 01:33:56.350
a band called black flag,

1462
01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:00.760
who was a incredible band led by a guitarist named Greg [inaudible].

1463
01:34:01.810 --> 01:34:04.030
They asked Rollins,

1464
01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:07.360
who was just a fan who had jumped on the stage at some point in saying one of

1465
01:34:07.361 --> 01:34:10.750
their songs,
they said,
hey,
they there,
they had a falling out,

1466
01:34:10.751 --> 01:34:13.030
or I forget what happened with their first a singer,

1467
01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:16.060
but the first thing that wasn't singing anymore,
if they need a new singer,

1468
01:34:16.090 --> 01:34:17.290
they asked Rollins to try out.

1469
01:34:17.291 --> 01:34:22.291
Rollins jumped on the opportunity and took that Gig and ended up being the lead

1470
01:34:25.211 --> 01:34:30.211
singer of the band black flag who is a really pivotal band in American rock and

1471
01:34:33.641 --> 01:34:37.840
roll.
And I think he took,
you know,

1472
01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:40.420
black flag to a whole new level.
And I've talked about,

1473
01:34:40.421 --> 01:34:43.300
talked about this on Tim Ferriss and I,
I'll talk about it again,

1474
01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:46.870
but there was an album called black flag,
my war,

1475
01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:52.860
which is an incredible album and it's especially an incredible album.

1476
01:34:53.711 --> 01:34:55.420
And if for those of you that listened to that,

1477
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:57.260
for those of you younguns out there,

1478
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:02.000
the records used to come on a piece of vinyl and there was two sides to it.

1479
01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:05.720
And so the,
this black flag album called my war had two sides to it.

1480
01:35:05.721 --> 01:35:09.350
And the first side sounded fairly similar to what most of black flag sounded

1481
01:35:09.351 --> 01:35:14.120
like prior to that,
which is just sort of punk rock,
fast beat,

1482
01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.330
whatever side too.

1483
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:21.290
Was this slowed down,
heavy

1484
01:35:23.050 --> 01:35:24.250
dredging,

1485
01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:30.010
powerful music and the whole side is like that.

1486
01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:34.420
And that that side of that album was on my record player when I was,

1487
01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:39.010
I don't know,
13 or 14 years old for like a year.
I just,

1488
01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:44.040
all I listened to and I really related to it because it just was something that

1489
01:35:45.370 --> 01:35:49.840
this heavy,
this introspective,
this,

1490
01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:54.960
this aggression and anger was something that I wouldn't,

1491
01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:57.730
when I heard it for the first time,
I was like,
oh that's,

1492
01:35:57.970 --> 01:36:01.210
that's what I think that's,
that's what my mind is filled with

1493
01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:04.630
and this was sort of my,

1494
01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:08.140
the next thing that came after black sabbath for me because black Sabbath is the

1495
01:36:08.141 --> 01:36:09.610
first thing he said.
Okay,
that's what I,

1496
01:36:09.611 --> 01:36:13.990
that's a heavy and that's dark and I understand.
I relate to that.

1497
01:36:14.170 --> 01:36:16.870
The happy music that I was hearing,
I didn't understand that.

1498
01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:21.880
I didn't relate to it,
that heavy stuff.
When I heard that this dark stuff,

1499
01:36:21.970 --> 01:36:23.930
I related to it and I understood it in a,

1500
01:36:23.931 --> 01:36:28.210
fueled me and so Rawlins,
black flag,

1501
01:36:28.211 --> 01:36:31.990
my war side too,
definitely had a big impact on me.

1502
01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:34.090
And then from there,

1503
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:40.350
eventually he was out of black flag and he formed his own band and they made an

1504
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:47.480
epic record,
which is called lifetime.
Just,
uh,

1505
01:36:48.290 --> 01:36:52.940
again,
this,
this hit me at an age where,
uh,

1506
01:36:52.941 --> 01:36:57.941
what was I 16 and here comes this album called lifetime.

1507
01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:03.110
That was very powerful,
very raw,

1508
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:05.410
very hard.
And it just,
it,

1509
01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:10.540
I can't imagine a better sound coming into my ears when I was 15 or 16 years old

1510
01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:16.820
then this album lifetime.
So myself and my buddies at the time,

1511
01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:20.420
we were listening to Rollins,
and again,
this was,
these were songs about power.

1512
01:37:20.421 --> 01:37:22.760
These were songs about,
as a matter of fact,

1513
01:37:22.761 --> 01:37:27.710
the cover of the lifetime album was two hands gripping the earth.

1514
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:30.080
It was,
you know,
this kind of,
this message of,

1515
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:33.590
at least that's how I interpreted it as that the other member,

1516
01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:38.800
I was a kid and I'm hearing this stuff and I'm overlaying what my thoughts of

1517
01:37:39.501 --> 01:37:43.460
the world are on top of it.
It sounded aggressive to me.

1518
01:37:43.670 --> 01:37:47.690
It sounded tough to me and that's what my mind was like at the time.

1519
01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:52.640
And so I put what I wanted it to,
I made it what I wanted it to be.
And to me,

1520
01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:55.250
two hands holding the earth,

1521
01:37:55.530 --> 01:37:59.310
a powerful symbol of I'm going to go,
I'm going to take over the world,

1522
01:37:59.311 --> 01:38:01.650
I'm going to control the world,
I'm going to make things happen.

1523
01:38:03.930 --> 01:38:07.320
So we actually,
when I was a kid,

1524
01:38:07.321 --> 01:38:12.090
we actually followed Rollins around and we would,
you know,
he played,

1525
01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.030
this was in,
I want to say this,

1526
01:38:14.031 --> 01:38:18.750
who's like 88 or 89 but myself and my buddies who were,

1527
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:23.960
we were all under Rollins and we went and buy pie song play 10 or 15 times on

1528
01:38:24.091 --> 01:38:27.420
the eastern seaboard.
Maybe it wasn't til maybe,
maybe it was 10 times.

1529
01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:30.810
And we know this is back in the day,
this is,
this is,
you know,

1530
01:38:30.811 --> 01:38:34.140
he's playing in clubs that are the size of your living room,
you know,
you're in.

1531
01:38:34.141 --> 01:38:36.900
We'd help them on load their instruments and we'd help them offload and we'd

1532
01:38:36.901 --> 01:38:39.930
hang out with them afterwards.
And it was,
it was great,
it was cool.

1533
01:38:41.010 --> 01:38:45.780
And that was my experience.
And I was definitely,

1534
01:38:46.290 --> 01:38:47.910
I think that had a big impact on me.

1535
01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:49.530
Another thing I hadn't mentioned this about light,

1536
01:38:49.531 --> 01:38:54.030
that album lifetime in between the songs,
you know,

1537
01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:58.710
if you look at vinyl records and there's a space in between the songs

1538
01:39:00.630 --> 01:39:02.970
and there's,
you know,
there's like a standard,
I don't know what,
you know,

1539
01:39:02.971 --> 01:39:05.550
there's a standard of two millimeters,
let's say.

1540
01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:08.100
And when I first got that lifetime record,

1541
01:39:08.670 --> 01:39:12.810
this space in between the songs you could see it was,
it was tiny.

1542
01:39:13.110 --> 01:39:17.250
And that's because the,
the,
the one song would end in boom,
that the other song,

1543
01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:19.680
after a moment of silence,
boom,
the next song would kick in.

1544
01:39:19.681 --> 01:39:23.880
And that's what the album was like,
this intense just driving,
getting after it.

1545
01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:28.590
So we would go to those shows and we would just go completely nuts in,

1546
01:39:29.130 --> 01:39:32.580
get our insane mosh pit destruction on.

1547
01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:38.330
So out of that,
you know,
spawned this.
And the other thing was cool,

1548
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:42.360
you know,
Rollins was,
you know,
we were not into drinking,

1549
01:39:42.361 --> 01:39:45.600
we were not our drugs and neither was Rawlins.
So he was this kind of,
you know,

1550
01:39:45.601 --> 01:39:49.200
we'd see Rollins doing pushups before the show is we'd say,
Oh yeah,
this,

1551
01:39:49.201 --> 01:39:50.790
this guys like us.
You know,
this,

1552
01:39:50.791 --> 01:39:55.290
I relate to this guy cause I want to be strong and I don't want to do drugs and

1553
01:39:55.291 --> 01:39:58.860
I'm staying clean and he's staying clean.
And so we had this good thing going.

1554
01:39:59.670 --> 01:40:04.110
But again,
this is my 15 year old brain.

1555
01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:07.410
And uh,
so what happens?

1556
01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:13.160
So I took all that to mean that's the way life is.

1557
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:15.510
For instance,

1558
01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:19.890
Rollins has a big tattoo on his back that says search and destroy.

1559
01:40:21.210 --> 01:40:24.960
Okay,
I took that literally,
you know,
okay,
this,

1560
01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:27.600
I need to search and destroy.
How do you do that?
Okay,

1561
01:40:27.870 --> 01:40:30.510
what is the most hardcore thing?
What does the most physical thing?
What is,

1562
01:40:30.511 --> 01:40:33.900
how do you get control?
How do you do?
How do you be aggressive in the nth degree?

1563
01:40:33.901 --> 01:40:38.130
You know how you do it?
You'd be a commando.
And so,
so those,
again,

1564
01:40:38.131 --> 01:40:41.550
those weird twisted interpretations of my mind said to me,
okay,

1565
01:40:41.551 --> 01:40:45.780
that means you need to be a commando.
Hmm.
And that's what I did.
That's how I am.

1566
01:40:45.781 --> 01:40:48.090
That's one of the,
one of the,

1567
01:40:48.990 --> 01:40:53.990
I would say one of those factors that led me on the path that I'm,

1568
01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:55.413
that I'm here today.

1569
01:40:56.060 --> 01:41:01.060
So went through seal training and actually interestingly the first Lollapalooza

1570
01:41:01.781 --> 01:41:04.420
tour,
and we'd have to Google this and see when this was,

1571
01:41:04.421 --> 01:41:07.900
but it was the first Lollapalooza and Rollins was playing and they played down

1572
01:41:07.901 --> 01:41:10.390
in somewhere in San Diego.

1573
01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:13.300
Lollapalooza came and I went

1574
01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:17.140
and I didn't want to pay for it for whatever reason.

1575
01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:22.260
So I went backstage and I waited until I saw the Rollins and I saw Rollins and I

1576
01:41:23.261 --> 01:41:27.940
said a Rawlins,
he said,
hey,
and you could see,

1577
01:41:27.941 --> 01:41:32.560
he kind of recognized me.
I mean we,
he recognized me and went over and said Hi.

1578
01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:34.450
And I said,
Hey,
can you get me into the show?

1579
01:41:35.230 --> 01:41:37.150
And I've got a couple of buddies with me and he said,

1580
01:41:37.151 --> 01:41:40.240
it'd be easier to get you into Fort Knox.

1581
01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:45.910
It was kind of weird because back in the day we would sit there and hang out

1582
01:41:45.911 --> 01:41:48.850
with them and help him load his van and get walked right in.

1583
01:41:48.850 --> 01:41:53.850
And it was just really cool to have that much interaction with somebody that you

1584
01:41:53.901 --> 01:41:58.030
are into.
I mean,
you can't do that normally.
And all of a sudden there it was.

1585
01:41:58.090 --> 01:42:02.560
Now he's in Lollapalooza and even though he's on tour and he doesn't know

1586
01:42:02.561 --> 01:42:06.310
anybody there,
there's a guy there,
me and I can't get in.

1587
01:42:07.150 --> 01:42:11.260
So it was,
you know,
it was cool.

1588
01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.670
Um,
but it was definitely a sign to me that,

1589
01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:19.390
that things were a little different now.
Mm.
And he had kind of made it right.

1590
01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:22.810
I guess he made it now and he ended up having some pretty big,

1591
01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:26.230
or he had some bigger records that did better than,
than lifetime.

1592
01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.540
But the way it kind of continues,

1593
01:42:31.650 --> 01:42:36.650
the way this story continues is that wrong ones was a guy when I was a kid that

1594
01:42:39.971 --> 01:42:43.200
talked about Vietnam vets,
and if you read any of his,
you know,

1595
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:47.980
we used to write books and I'd read his books and he would talk about Vietnam

1596
01:42:47.981 --> 01:42:48.350
vets.

1597
01:42:48.350 --> 01:42:52.480
Now this guy taught him so much about discipline and then he talked to me and he

1598
01:42:52.481 --> 01:42:54.280
had this tattoo,
this search and destroy.

1599
01:42:54.850 --> 01:42:57.730
And in his books are in his shows.

1600
01:42:57.731 --> 01:43:01.030
He would talk about the violence and the fights and all these things.
And,

1601
01:43:01.150 --> 01:43:03.430
and he even talked about like,
missions

1602
01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:07.120
remain calm,
prepare to destroy.

1603
01:43:07.121 --> 01:43:10.210
That's from a song that's from a Henry Rollins song,
remain calm,

1604
01:43:10.211 --> 01:43:12.460
prepare to destroy.
So he,
he kind of

1605
01:43:14.050 --> 01:43:16.870
had this thing that I thought was cool

1606
01:43:18.370 --> 01:43:19.330
when I was 14

1607
01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:25.980
and then I actually went in and I did this stuff,

1608
01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:27.460
you know,

1609
01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:31.900
I actually went and did the stuff that he had talked about and that he spent his

1610
01:43:31.901 --> 01:43:32.830
career talking about.

1611
01:43:35.650 --> 01:43:39.130
And so all of a sudden this connection,

1612
01:43:39.131 --> 01:43:41.800
this sort of,
um,
yeah,

1613
01:43:41.801 --> 01:43:45.970
this connection that I had with him,
all of a sudden it kind of faded because I,

1614
01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:51.060
I looked at it from a different light as it was no longer me looking at someone

1615
01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:57.770
thinking this guy's done this cool stuff.

1616
01:43:58.220 --> 01:44:02.630
It was actually starting to look at him thinking he didn't do this cool stuff.

1617
01:44:03.650 --> 01:44:04.483
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1618
01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:08.410
<v 0>And,
and now I think when I see them now,
and it's weird,</v>

1619
01:44:08.411 --> 01:44:11.830
I think he's about 10 years older than me,
maybe 12 years older than me.

1620
01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:15.520
So he,
I can kind of see

1621
01:44:17.230 --> 01:44:19.360
it's a little bit of a glimpse into the future,
but you know,

1622
01:44:19.361 --> 01:44:22.750
because you see a guy that's a certain years older than you and you know what he

1623
01:44:22.751 --> 01:44:27.100
looked like when he was 25 and you know what he looked like when he was 35 and

1624
01:44:27.101 --> 01:44:31.480
45 and now he's probably 55 and I can see what he looks like and what he did

1625
01:44:31.481 --> 01:44:33.190
look like.
So I kind of,

1626
01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:38.430
I see him now and he seems to be a result of that life that he ended up with,

1627
01:44:42.251 --> 01:44:46.840
which is Hollywood and kind of famous and kind of being in movies and being a

1628
01:44:46.841 --> 01:44:47.674
rock star

1629
01:44:49.710 --> 01:44:50.543
<v 1>and</v>

1630
01:44:51.730 --> 01:44:55.800
<v 0>it's,
I don't have the same,
like I said,</v>

1631
01:44:55.801 --> 01:45:00.060
connection that I,
that I did.
But like I said,

1632
01:45:00.090 --> 01:45:03.600
when I was a kid,
when I was 13 years old,
when I was 14 years old,

1633
01:45:03.601 --> 01:45:07.140
when I was 15 years old,
I was,
I was definitely,

1634
01:45:08.670 --> 01:45:09.780
I definitely

1635
01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:15.990
took some things from him and apply them to my life and I'd love,

1636
01:45:15.991 --> 01:45:18.960
I'd love to meet up with him.
I know he lives up in La and if at some point,
Hank,

1637
01:45:18.961 --> 01:45:21.600
if you're listening,
let me know.
Let's,
let's link up.

1638
01:45:21.601 --> 01:45:23.070
We'll talk about the old times,

1639
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:26.970
but you know,

1640
01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:31.290
I think that might might even be something to close with is when,

1641
01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:34.990
when you're dealing with people,

1642
01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:39.413
<v 1>people</v>

1643
01:45:40.410 --> 01:45:43.530
<v 0>are not who you want them to be.</v>

1644
01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:47.850
Your idols,
the people that you look up to,

1645
01:45:47.851 --> 01:45:52.470
the people that you think are cool are not,
they're not that person.

1646
01:45:54.190 --> 01:45:58.200
You kill your idols.
It now there's things that we can learn from people,

1647
01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:04.230
but they aren't going to be what you think they are or they aren't going to be

1648
01:46:04.231 --> 01:46:08.580
even what they should be.
Those people,

1649
01:46:08.581 --> 01:46:10.500
when you take them and you put them on a pedestal,

1650
01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:14.550
they're not deserving of that pedestal.

1651
01:46:15.090 --> 01:46:16.680
They're going to be fault that they're going to be weak.

1652
01:46:16.681 --> 01:46:20.310
They're going to be ego maniacal.
They can be condescending.

1653
01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:24.540
They're going to be all those negative things to me,
lazy,

1654
01:46:24.541 --> 01:46:26.880
they're going to be entitled,
they're going to be short sighted.

1655
01:46:27.150 --> 01:46:28.560
They're not going to be perfect

1656
01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:34.160
far from it and that's fine.
That's okay.

1657
01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:40.240
You learn from their weaknesses and you learn from their strengths of course,

1658
01:46:40.370 --> 01:46:43.400
and you mimic them and you,
you emulate them.

1659
01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:46.070
But equally is important.

1660
01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:51.480
You learn from their faults and you see what not to do

1661
01:46:53.670 --> 01:46:58.670
because the bottom line is you can't control other people.

1662
01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:05.860
I know we spent time tonight talking about manipulation and influence,

1663
01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:10.770
but the bottom line is you can't control them.

1664
01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:15.720
You can't make people be what you want them to be.

1665
01:47:16.150 --> 01:47:16.983
<v 7>Okay?</v>

1666
01:47:18.890 --> 01:47:21.620
<v 0>The only person that you can control</v>

1667
01:47:23.290 --> 01:47:26.390
<v 7>is you
view.</v>

1668
01:47:29.150 --> 01:47:32.210
<v 0>And that's what you've got to focus on.
Focus on you.</v>

1669
01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:34.430
Focus on focus.

1670
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:38.780
Focus on making yourself who you want to be.

1671
01:47:40.010 --> 01:47:44.810
Faster,
smarter,
stronger,
more humble,

1672
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:48.380
less ego.
Discipline your body

1673
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:54.890
so you can free your mind.
Get up early and go get after it

1674
01:47:57.470 --> 01:48:00.050
and be that person that you want to be.

1675
01:48:01.970 --> 01:48:05.060
And that's not easy and not everyone can do it.

1676
01:48:05.150 --> 01:48:08.300
And I'm not here to tell everybody that everybody can do it,

1677
01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:14.600
but it can happen.
And it does happen

1678
01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:20.870
through one small decision at a time

1679
01:48:22.490 --> 01:48:26.990
and every one of those decisions important in building

1680
01:48:28.570 --> 01:48:29.403
<v 7>you.</v>

1681
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:39.860
<v 0>And that's all I've got for today.
So at every bum,</v>

1682
01:48:40.010 --> 01:48:44.900
everyone out there.
