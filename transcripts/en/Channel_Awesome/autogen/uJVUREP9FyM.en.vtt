is that the I was still teaching yeah
 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:01.120
is that the I was still teaching yeah
yeah that's very crack died now of

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.130
yeah that's very crack died now of
 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.500
yeah that's very crack died now of
course he's faking it anyway yeah but

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.510
course he's faking it anyway yeah but
 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.640
course he's faking it anyway yeah but
yeah at the same time I'm like oh I know

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:06.650
yeah at the same time I'm like oh I know
 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.260
yeah at the same time I'm like oh I know
we can go for this but I didn't see that

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270
we can go for this but I didn't see that
 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.210
we can go for this but I didn't see that
he was going to use that like he was

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.220
he was going to use that like he was
 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.360
he was going to use that like he was
faking it the whole time I didn't draw

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370
faking it the whole time I didn't draw
 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.040
faking it the whole time I didn't draw
that conclusion so I like that I like

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050
that conclusion so I like that I like
 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.300

guessing like that don't exactly know
 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:18.790
guessing like that don't exactly know
where they're gonna go

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800
where they're gonna go
 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.420

duo's of glitter it probably would have
 

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.600
duo's of glitter it probably would have
been stronger if you got the idea like

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:37.610
been stronger if you got the idea like
 

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.630

venture time yeah it probably probably

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:01.220
venture time yeah it probably probably
 

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.750
venture time yeah it probably probably
well worked a little better it still got

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760

there's I know it sounds strange because
I know it's a show of like randomness

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:32.660
I know it's a show of like randomness
 

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.000
I know it's a show of like randomness
and strangeness but I thought there was

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.010
and strangeness but I thought there was
 

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.850
