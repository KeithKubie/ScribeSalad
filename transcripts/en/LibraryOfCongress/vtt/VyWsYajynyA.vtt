&gt;&gt; Suzanne Shadl:
Good afternoon,

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.770
thank you for being here today.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.750
Welcome to the Library
of Congress.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.590
My name is Susanne
Shadl, I am the chief

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.940
of the Hispanic Division.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.810
I have the privilege of
working with a tremendous team

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.820
of librarians, including several
in the audience, thank you all

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.940
for your work, to improve access
to diverse publications written

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.700
in Spanish, Portuguese, English

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.340
and several indigenous
languages of the Americas.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.100
Today we are fortunate
to partner internally

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.090
with the Poetry and Literature
Center, and externally

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.230
with the Uruguayan Embassy.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.930
If you're here for
"Another voice sings,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.270
celebrating Uruguayan
women poets" you're

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.570
in the right place.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.280
If you came for something else,
we hope you'll stay [laughter].

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.560
For me and my division
it is an honor

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.490
to welcome a tremendous
panel comprised of writers,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.850
translators, teachers,
professors, for a reading

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.110
that celebrates the
strong tradition

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.300
of Uruguayan women poets,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.980
and recent publications
reflecting four generations

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.120
of Uruguayan poetry,
written by women.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.500
That's an important
thing for me today.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.690
In addition to hearing
the work of Silvia Guerra,

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.830
who's here with us today,
you will also hear work

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.260
from Amanda Berenger,
Marosa Di Giorgio,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.560
Circe Maia and Melissa Machado.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.040
I have to plug my division in
the work they do to some extent

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.010
at these events, so if you're
not familiar with the handbook

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.220
of Latin American studies,
and you searched the handbook

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.450
or Latin American studies on
our catalogue which is online

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.840
and anybody has access
to it, you will find all

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.770
of these authors and
connections to other authors

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.230
and to other work, so I would
invite you to check that out

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.750
and see where those
lengths take you.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.410
And if you prefer the
book format, volume 66,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.440
actually has a very
important entry on our guest

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.190
of honor today, Silvia Guerra.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.490
Okay. One plug, there's
more coming, I'm sorry.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.730
This event is inspired by part
by a previous event called

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.340
"Celebrating Idea
Vilariño's poetry".

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.200
An audio file of that event can
also be found in our catalogue

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.640
by searching "Idea Vilariño".

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.720
I'm going to spell that
because I there it spelled that,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.660
then the web address where
you're going to find it, okay?

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.350
So, the name in quotation
marks will take you

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.940
where you need to go.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:57.540
Idea, I-D-E-A, Vilariño,
V-I-L-A-R-I-Ñ --

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.920
that's the N with the
little stinging on top,

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.220
in case there's anybody here

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.550
that isn't Spanish
speaking, O, okay.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.370
Today we welcome Uruguayan
poet as I said, Silvia Guerra.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.630
You have this information
in your --

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.040
hopefully you all have
a program, but I'm going

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.880
to go ahead for the
purpose of the audio

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.970
and tell you a little bit
about each of our speakers.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.050
Her books include "Un mar
enmadrugado", "Pulso",

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.040
"Estampas de un tapiz".

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.400
She's also the author of
"Todo comienza lugar",

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.230
coedited with Cuban poet José
Kozer, and "Fuera de regato".

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.450
From 2009 to 2011
she was coeditor

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.080
of the seminal Uruguayan poetry
press "La flauta mágica".

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.480
In 2012 she received
the Morosoli Prize

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.510
in poetry for her career.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.510
Yesterday Catalina Gomez, who
works in the Hispanic division,

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.890
taped Silva Guerra for our
archive of Hispanic literature

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.560
on tape, and eventually that
recording will be available

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.300
to all of you, but in the
meantime I hope you check

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.140
out that archive and see
what other Uruguayan poets

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.860
and writers and other
Latin American poets

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.500
and writers are there and you
can get there by going to www --

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.050
I'm going to give you
the website this time,

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:29.580
loc.gov/RR/Hispanic/archive,
okay?

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.800
Also, today we have several
other esteemed guests,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.700
Jesse Lee Kercheval is
a translator and author

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.880
of 14 books of poetry,
fiction, non-fiction.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.670
She specializes in
Uruguayan poetry.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.550
Her translations include
"The invisible bridge",

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.160
"Selected poems of
Circe Maia" and "Fable

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.890
of an inconsolable man",
by Javier Echeverra.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.930
She's also editor of "America
Invertida, an anthology

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.330
of emerging Uruguayan poets"
and "Earth, Water, Sky",

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.590
a bilingual anthology
of environmental poetry.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.020
She was a 2016 NEA
translation fellow.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.900
She is the sonagale
[phonetic] professor of poetry

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.740
at the University of
Wisconsin, Madison,

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.970
and she directs a program
in creative writing,

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.760
and she might stand at this
podium more than I do today.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.580
Also, we have in
attendance and participating

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.220
with us Jeannine
Pitas, a writer, teacher

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.730
and Spanish English
literary translator.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.270
She's the author of two poetry
checkbooks, and the translator

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.860
of several Uruguayan poets
including Selva Casal

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.990
and Marosa di Giorgio.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.290
She's published translations

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.090
of acclaimed Uruguayan writer
Marosa Di Giorgio's work.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.110
I remember "Nightfall" and
"The history of violets".

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.140
She's an assistant professor
at the University of --

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.850
oh my gosh, Debuke,
that's what I thought,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.390
and then I just flipped
at it and thought,

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.100
"that sounds strange".

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.470
I know. And then also we
have with us Seth Michelson,

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.210
who is a poet and
translator, whose collections

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.560
of poetry include

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.380

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.820

Uruguayan poets Victoria Estol,

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.110

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.530
He currently teaches the
poetry of the Americas

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.530
at Washington and
Lee University.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.590
Thank you all for being
here, and I look forward

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.890
to hearing everyone else speak.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:07:06.830
[ Applause ]

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.540
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval:
Thank you so much for coming.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.620
This is a great privilege
and honor.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.970
I want to thank everyone at the
Hispanic division who has been

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.030
so supportive of my work,
and Rob Casper and people

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.930
in the Port Lloyd's office,
and the Uruguayan Embassy,

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.000
and all of Washington DC --

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.060
well, maybe not all of
Washington DC [laughter].

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.260
I wanted just to
say a little bit

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.120
about why this is a celebration

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.970
of Uruguayan women's
poetry and why --

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.800
I'm so obsessed with it.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.220
It's a tradition that's
just amazing to me.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.690
Uruguay is a country
of 3.3 million people,

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.580
the smallest Spanish speaking
country in Latin America.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.450
It's a country full of poets.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.650
My joke is they produce two
things in world class level

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.250
on super abundance, which is
the soccer players and poets,

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.250
but besides that, it has a
long tradition of poetry.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.920
But it has this really amazing
tradition of poetry by women.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.360
And this is important in
an era where, even now,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.740
I'd buy a great,
big, fat anthology

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.700
of Latin American
poetry, edited by people

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.500
who they really know what
they're doing, and there are two

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.920
or three women poets
in the whole thing.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.680
And there are many
more good women poets

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.390
and that just in Uruguay.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.540
And the tradition specially
gets started at turn

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.580
of the 20th century, with poets

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.270
like Maria Eugenia Vaz
Ferreira and Ramiro Agustini.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.610
And we don't start quite that
far back, but we're really going

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.980
to cover quite a run
almost up to the present,

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.260
and that is we're going
to have some poetry

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.560
by some of the poets.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.300
There's something called
"The Generation of 45",

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.950
which was the great flowering
of literature in Uruguay.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.610
And we have poems
by Amanda Berenger,

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.670
and there's a wonderful new
anthology of work coming out

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:52.790
and Ana Dini -- Ana -- who's
going to be reading some

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.170
of her translations, it'll
be in that anthology.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.220
And [inaudible] by Idea
Vilariño, who is, again,

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.390
a really essential poet
that we had a reading just

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:00.690
of her work two years ago.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.210
And then, that's the people born
in the 20s, and then you sort

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.490
of jump up to people who
are born in the 1930s,

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.200
we're going to have the work by
the amazing Morosa Di Giorgio

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.750
and Jeannine Pitas
is her translator,

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.660
and it's a wonderful new
book called, I remember,

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:14.960
"Nightfall" out of her work.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.690
And the poet Selva
Casal who I adore.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.830
Jeannine is just starting
to bring it to English.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.850
It's really not been
available in English before.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.970
And also born in the
30s is Cirse Maia,

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.970
the poet that I translated
for this book from Pittsburgh,

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.060
"The invisible bridge".

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.630
And so, that's starting out
so, that's the 20s and the 30s,

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.850
and then we move forward
to Silva, who is a --

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.260
you know, a several
decades ahead,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.440
and right now we're just really
privileged to have her with us.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.730
She's really one of the most
important living women poets

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.440
in Uruguay, especially
someone who is,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.030
you know, of her generation.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.440
I'd just have to say Ida
Vitale who is in the generation

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.740
of the 20s is still alive.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.550
Uruguayan women poets,
they live forever.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:56.820
But Silvia Guerra is really an
important Uruguayan women poet.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.510
And she's really been
at the center of poetry,

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.460
which she works in poetry
foundation, she's worked

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.430
for presses, she's doing
interviewing poetry,

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:05.060
really works hard to move
forward this tradition.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:09.620
And Jeannine Pitas -- and I will
be reading translations of hers.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.090
We've just started
translating her work.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.910
And then to close or sort,

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.790
the youngest person
will be Melissa Machado,

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.280
who is just in her 40s

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.610
and Michaels Seth
translated her book

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.120
which she was published
here last year.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.550
Now, we won't be reading in
that order, we're reading

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.980
in the order that's in the
program, but I just wanted

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.080
to give you a sense of the
sweep, from people born

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.040
in the 1920s, to
people born, you know,

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.570
just at the end of
the last century.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.160
And, really if we wanted
to and we have time,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.460
we can go all the
way down to poets

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.500
who are publishing books now and
being discovered in anthologies

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.610
in Uruguay who are
in their 17, 18, 22.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.140
It's just this constant
flowering

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.170
of Uruguayan women
poets, and this tradition

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.450
that makes each woman aware of
the possibility of being a poet.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.750
And I'm talking about
being serious,

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.300
well-known public intellectual,
not someone, you know,

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.010
who writes secretly and it's
discovered after they're gone.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:00.410
So, I really feel
this is something

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.150
that should be better
known outside of Uruguay,

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.420
and I hope you feel the same
way after you hear the poetry.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.510
Thank you.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:27.590
[ Applause ]

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.890
&gt;&gt; ¿Está bien?

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.360
&gt;&gt; Silvia Guerra: ¿Ahí sí?

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.490
Bueno, buenas tardes.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:45.150
Estoy muy contenta
de estar acá.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:53.640
Esto que voy a leer se llama
"Ese espacio que es mío".

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.510
Este libro es un libro que
salió en Buenos Aires.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:07.380
Para nosotros es importante
decirlo porque el Río de la

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:13.530
Plata funciona un poco como
Río de la Plata entonces,

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:19.340
para el Uruguay Buenos
Aires es muy importante.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:30.290
Somos como una especie
también de región, ¿no?

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.880
El Río de la Plata.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:43.010
Este libro salió en Buenos
Aires en una editorial que la

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:50.500
llevan adelante tres poetas
mujeres que se llaman Dolores

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:58.460
Echecopar, María Mascheroni
y María del Carmen Colombo.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:05.550
Y me gusta nombrarlas porque
me parece que está bien.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:12.880
Siempre le tengo que agradecer
a Jesse todo lo que ha hecho con

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:18.090
la traducción y bueno,
a Jeannine, pero digo,

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:23.300
Jesse es como la persona que ha
ido al Uruguay y ha traído a

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.070
los uruguayos para acá.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:31.800
Este poema se llama "Ese
espacio que es mío".

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:39.080
"Ese espacio de cielo, ese
que es mío, en la palma,

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.270
pedazo de arena, salvia, viento.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:50.190
¿Qué puede demostrar al
mundo uno o dos dientes,

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:55.090
de sombrero ladeado,
de aguafiestas?

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.340
Todo es un torbellino.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.460
El silbido del viento,

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:05.100
la claridad previa del
trueno detrás de la isla,

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.430
los postibones verdes.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:16.600
Ese espacio de cielo, las rocas
justas que entran en la ventana,

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.960
Javier por la bajada,
el chorro de agua.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.850
¿Qué son ahora
uno o dos dientes?

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.150
¿El hincapié?

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.450
¿La angustia?

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.390
¿Qué son ahora los dientes de
Drácula de plástico olvidados

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:30.990
en el lavabo de un
baño que no es mío?

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:34.690
¿Quién va a decirme
a mí lo que era mío?

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.110
¿Quién va a explicarme
a mí lo que me resta?

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.700
Me aguarda un paraíso de
ramas extendidas que para en

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.000
la caída.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.300
Me aguarda una arboleda,

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.600
muchedumbre de árboles
juntados esperándome.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.900
Ese espacio de cielo
reservado, salvia, viento.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.200
Ese espacio de cielo,
estoy segura."

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.500
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval: Silvia
was saying this was a book

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.800
of verses that was published
in Argentina last year.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.100
There's a sort of
culture that Argentina

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.400
and Uruguay share
Rioplatense culture.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.700
And it's an anthology all
selected of her books.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.000
"That space is mine, that
space of sky is mine,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.300
in the palm, a bit of sand.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.600
Sage, wind, what can
I show the world?

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.900
One or two teeth like a
tilted hat, a squeal sport.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.200
Everything is a whirlwind.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.500
The whistling wind,
the early clarity

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.800
of thunder behind the
island, the green shutters.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.100
That space of sky, the precise
rocks fitting into the window.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.400
Javier going down,
the jet of water.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.700
What are they now?

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.000
One, two teeth?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.300
The stress, the anguish?

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.600
What are the plastic Dracula
teeth now, forgotten in the sink

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.900
of a bathroom that is not mine.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.200
Who is going to explain
to me what is mine?

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.500
Who is going to tell
me what remains for me?

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.800
I await a paradise of
outstretched branches that fall.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.100
I wait a grove, a stack of
trees together, waiting for me.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.400
That space of private
sky, sage and wind.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.700
That space of sky,
I am certain".

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.000
&gt;&gt; Silvia Guerra: Esto se
llama "La copa de alabastro",

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.180
y es un conjunto
de varios poemas.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:27.630
Este es el número uno.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:36.220
"Una fisura se tiñe con la
niebla que inicia en la llanura.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:41.790
Verde del jade oblicuo que da
la transparencia que es medada.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:48.170
Hojas de espeso tinte,
aroma que desciende.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:52.070
Fragor de ese principio
como vacuo,

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:58.270
condena desde el tinte al
aroma, durazno que recubre.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.770
Sonrosa la línea
y va sonriendo.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.590
Pide de su dulzor
al cardenal azul.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.530
Cardenalicio moretón de celo.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:15.280
Rosa en la ventana del espanto
el azul tinte, de morada medusa.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.150
No mora donde acusa
y va de luto.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:24.920
Golpeando la cabeza
contra el vidrio,

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:32.020
el roto cardenal abre de
rosas la cumbre del brazo.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.510
La curva que la dicha
no quisiera.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:50.940
Es tarde. Deben abandonarlo todo
con sangre entre los dientes.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:59.150
Con el espeso aroma de las
hojas humeantes de la niebla.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.830
Batirse en retirada a duelo,

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:09.230
sobre las alas de ese inmenso
albatros disecado colgando desde

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.900
el techo del sepulcro.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.320
Dorada bóveda de brillos,

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.990
blandir en el trasluz del
fuego la mano echada en aguas,

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.190
soñar de crisantemos.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:24.270
Al levantar el mando
que es la niebla,

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:28.730
está la espejada de
luz con manantial,

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.740
el fruto de la aurora.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.110
Tajo en la frente
mórbida, sombría,

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.290
eje de evanescencia,
distraído."

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.850
&gt;&gt; Jeannine Pitas: This is
called "The alabaster cup",

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:43.500
and it's a series of a few
poems, this is the first one.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:49.070
"A crack is stained with fog
that begins on the flat plane.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.190
Green from the oblique jade,

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:57.580
that gives transparency,
also negates it.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.180
Leaves of thick dye,
aroma that falls,

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.490
clamoring at the
somewhat empty start.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.340
Condemnation from the dye to
the aroma, peach that covers.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.280
The line blushes and smiles,
asks for its sweetness

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.050
of the blue bruise,
bruise of jealousy.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:17.360
Rose in the window of fear, the
blue dye of purple jellyfish.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.590
Doesn't live where he
accuses and mourns.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.710
Banging his head
against the glass,

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.600
the broken bruise opens the
roses, the curve of the arm,

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.900
the curve that happiness
wouldn't want.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.200
It is late, they
must leave everything

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.500
with blood between their teeth.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.800
With the thick aroma of
leaves damp from the fog.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.100
To be beat the retreat
from a duel, on the wings

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.400
of that immense stuffed
albatross,

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.700
handing from the
sealing of the tomb.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.000
Gilded vault of shackles,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.300
brandishing in the
hand the light

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.600
of the fire made of petty coats.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.900
Dreaming of chrysanthemums

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.200
by lifting the cloak
that is the fog.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.500
There's the translucency
of light with spring.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.800
The fruit of the dawn, a cut
on the morbid forehead, somber,

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.100
axis of evanescence,
distracted".

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.590
&gt;&gt; Silvia Guerra:
Esto se llama "Cloto".

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:51.440
"Afuera, en el cóncavo
espejo que es ahora,

00:18:51.440 --> 00:19:00.300
un fino entretejido se suspende.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:08.190
Alguien habla de dos,
otros de cifras que son

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.220
inmensas cantidades.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:20.870
La ascendencia se pierde
en estratos que no tienen

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.550
demasiada importancia.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:31.030
Se nombran los caminos, los
pasos, los pequeños jilgueros.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:40.010
Se camina sonriendo por la
empinada cuesta con las botas

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.590
sucias del barro del camino.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:44.490
Se llenan los carrillos,
los rojos, los sonrientes,

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.620
de un aire que allá arriba
se dice que es purísimo.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.060
Y se habla de la guerra,
del color de la guerra,

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.590
y aparecen los muertos en
fila con el plato vacío.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:50.890
Me preguntan algo
que no entiendo.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.190
No entiendo qué me dicen,

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.490
no entiendo qué hago
ahí, por qué me siguen.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:54.790
Yo no sé qué hacer
y ellos tampoco".

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.090
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval:
This poem is titled "Cloto".

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.390
It's one of the great figures
who measures out the thread,

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.690
gives you the length
of your life.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:19:59.990
"Cloto. Outside in the
concave mirror that is now,

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.290
a fine interweaving
is suspended.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:02.590
Someone speaks of two, other
figures of immense quantities.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.090
The lineage gets lost on layers
that don't hold much importance.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:09.720
Paths, country houses, little
gold finches are named.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.860
He walks smiling down the
steep slope with boots dirty

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.200
from the mud of the road.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.490
The cheeks, the red, the smiling
are filled with the air that way

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:21.760
up there they say is so pure.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.670
And they talk of war,
of the color of war,

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:29.620
and the dead appear in line
with their empty plates.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.230
They ask me for something
I don't understand.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.770
I don't understand what
they're saying to me,

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.080
I don't understand
what I'm doing here,

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.290
why they are following me.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.960
And I don't know what to do,
and they don't know either".

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.880
&gt;&gt; Silvia Guerra:
"La esperanza".

00:20:51.880 --> 00:21:02.580
"Siempre, como un punto
blanco y arrasante.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.870
Una luz de pura esencia
necesaria, incandescente.

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:09.860
Cegada por la luz,
la boca abierta,

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.830
palpita algo en el
valle, ruido de agua,

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:16.030
hojas de eucalipto perfumado.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:22.590
Algo de paz se recoge
sobre el oro esparcido.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.020
Algo parecido a la
misericordia queda"

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.320
&gt;&gt; Jeannine Pitas: "Hope".

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.620
"Always, like a white and
devastating point of light,

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:32.600
of pure essential
essence, incandescent.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:38.460
Blinded by light, open mouth,
something throbs in the valley.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:43.870
Noise of water, leaves
of perfumed eucalyptus.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:48.250
Some peace gathers on
the scattered gold,

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:52.730
something similar
to mercy remains".

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.030
&gt;&gt; Silvia Guerra: Bueno,
esta es la última.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:06.670
Bueno, les agradezco de vuelta.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:10.050
Le agradezco mucho a Jesse
y a todos los traductores,

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:15.700
porque yo creo que así
es como se hace la vida.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:21.380
Esto tiene un número
que es el número 32.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:28.480
"En la otra punta de la línea
se balancea la impotencia,

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.540
pero en medio está todo.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:38.600
Pugnando por su forma imposible,

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:43.580
acumulándose en el
producimiento interminable.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:52.830
Se huele, se oye un ruido de
fondo que acelera su pulso.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:23:07.670
Emerge de los sueños mezclada
con la niebla en jirones,

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:16.580
crujiendo de asombro
en la penumbra.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:30.810
Acunada, y el diálogo
amoroso que descansa en la paz

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.600
del laurel.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:38.240
Preferís el mes de tierra
removida como marca el recuerdo,

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:45.540
y esa voz que se escucha en
los andenes de alta velocidad

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:51.080
repite, 'no te creas',
'no te creas',

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.430
'no te creas', 'no te creas'.

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.210
Se sostiene porque la sola vida,

00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:01.450
la sola manera de estar
vivo ha dictado esa cifra,

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:06.530
que gotea en la especificidad
del tramo.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:12.380
Aparece en los ojos la
perdición justo cuando la

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.140
enfermedad daba la vuelta.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:19.090
La proyección tira del
halo más allá, que jala.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:20.390
Ya nadie sabrá nada.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:25.380
Solamente retumba en los
andenes al compás del zumbido,

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.900
y parece que dice 'chajá',
'chajá', 'chajá'".

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.200
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval:
A note for the word

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.500
at the end of this poem.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.800
"Chajá", which is the name of
a bird, a large bird indigenous

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.100
to Uruguay, it has
a very loud sound.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.400
If you want to know what
it really sounds like,

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.700
you have to Google the words
"screaming chicken" [laughter].

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.000
"On the other end of the line
balances the helplessness,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.300
in the middle is everything.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.600
Fighting for its
impossible form, accumulating

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.900
in ceaseless production,
you smell,

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.200
you hear the background noise
which quickens its pulse.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.500
It emerges from dreams
mixed with tatters of fog,

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.800
squeaking with astonishment
in the half life.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.100
Rocking and loving dialogue
rests on peace laurels.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.400
You prefer the month of plowed
earth as marked by memory

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.700
and that voice that's
heard on the high speed

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.000
of platforms repeating, 'don't
believe it', 'don't believe it',

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.300
'don't believe it',
'don't believe'.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.600
It holds because the
only life, the only way

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.900
of being alive has
dictated that number,

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.200
that drips into the
specificity of the stretch.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.500
Perdition appears in the eyes,

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.800
just when the illness
is taking a turn.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.100
The projection pulls
the halo further away.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.400
That tug, no one will
know anything anymore.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.700
Only the voice booming on the
platform to the beat of the hum

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.000
and it seems to say,
'chajá, chajá, chajá".

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.800
&gt;&gt; Gracias.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:17.290
[ Applause ]

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:18.590
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Schadl: Thank you.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.720
I omitted one person when I
was introducing the others so,

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.430
if our other translators
could come up,

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:27.680
I'd like to introduce
another one.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.070
Anna Deeny Morales,
is with us also today.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:33.000
She's translated
several collections

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.780
of Raul Zurita's poetry,

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.990
including "Purgatory"
and "Sky bellow".

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.560
Other translations
include "Floating lanterns"

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.640
by Mercedes Roffe [phonetic],
as well has her translations

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.350
of Alejandra Pizarnik,
which are included

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.790
in "Pinholes in the night".

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:55.290
Enter translations of the
Uruguayan poet Amanda Berenger.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.750
She's a translator and
adjunct professor at the Center

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.050
for Latin American Studies

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.710
at Georgetown University
just down the road.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.510
So, thank you, Ana.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:10.010
[ Applause ]

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.750
&gt;&gt; Anna Deeny: Thank
you so much to Suzanne

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.850
for receiving us here
today, Catalina Gomez,

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:20.760
Jesse first of all for
organizing this beautiful event,

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.160
the Hispanic division and the
people of poetry and literature.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.340
And thanks to all of you
for taking the time to come

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.370
out here today, it's
great to see you all.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:34.530
So, I'm going to read four
poems by Amanda Berenger

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:38.440
and one poem by Idea Vilariño.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.820
Amanda Berenger was born in
1921 and she died in 2020.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:48.830
She was a prolific poet of
the "Generación del 45",

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:50.860
and like many of
her contemporaries,

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.220
Berenger's poetry often
represents meaning under siege.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.740
She wrote this book
that I'll read

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.110
from during the Uruguayan
dictatorship,

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:03.200
which was from 1973 to 1985.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.470
So, this is from the
identity of certain fruits,

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:08.340
"la identidad de
ciertas frutas",

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:12.790
which was published in 1982.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:16.930
"Uno, la manzana.

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:21.170
Con las manzanas
deliciosamente conozco el deseo,

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:26.040
descubro la salud, y esa larva
de muerte que se lleva en medio

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.030
del esplendor.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.870
Ser como la manzana
implica todas las culpas,

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:34.850
pero es excitante la propuesta.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:38.890
La manzana es brillante
y peligrosa.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:43.000
Una sola puede incendiar
un huerto.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.550
Ser como la manzana es estar
en la alta fiesta del día,

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:51.290
toda de lazo rojo y diamantes,

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:59.810
y llevar en el índice
enguantado un anillo de sombra".

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:03.600
"One, the apple.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.960
By way of apples deliciously
I come upon desire.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:12.250
Discover, wellbeing, and
that larva of death folded

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:15.340
in the midst of splendor.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:21.950
To be as the apple involves all
fault, but the proposal thrills.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:25.220
The apple is brilliant
and dangerous.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.780
One alone can flame an orchard.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:33.930
To be as the apple is to be
at the high dance of day,

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:36.280
all red satin and diamonds

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:43.980
and on a gloved finger
wear, a ring of dusk".

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:47.430
"Nine -- nueve, los higos.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.970
Tiene sangre el fruto
de la higuera,

00:28:52.970 --> 00:29:00.610
y destila su néctar tenaz, su
culposo jarabe, sigilosamente.

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:02.900
Ha habido un crimen,

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.970
una violación bajo
las grandes hojas.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:11.460
Yo observaba, embebida
a través de las ramas.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.760
Los higos cuelgan maduros,
amoratados, remordimientos.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:21.610
Los higos cuelgan del árbol
como murciélagos de melaza,

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:28.690
como ahorcados por robar
un manojo de lujuria".

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:31.090
"Nine, the figs.

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:34.450
The fig trees' fruit
holds blood,

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:36.740
and distills its
tenacious nectar,

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:40.090
its guilty syrup
surreptitiously.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:45.290
A crime was committed, a
violation under the wide leaves.

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:48.770
I watched, drunk
through the branches.

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:52.360
The ripe figs hang black
and blue of regrets.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.710
Figs hang from the tree,
like molasses bats,

00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:00.970
like people hanged for
robbing a fistful of lust".

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.780
"18, las guindas".

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.970
A Marosa Di Giorgio.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:16.080
"De las guindas guardo su
retrato, su pintura ardiente,

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.160
el rincón vivo de
una naturaleza muerta.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.610
Su vibrante vocación
de licoristas.

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:28.640
Guardo su retrato
protegido por el vidrio.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:33.820
Desde los frascos labrados,
desde las sombreadas alas,

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.510
desde los aparadores
con cristales,

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:42.950
custodian sus pequeños senos
de púrpura prisionera en recato

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:44.600
y arrogamiento.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:49.940
Las visitas no beben
ya guindado,

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.870
las visitas no son visitas.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:56.700
Las tías y las amigas de las
tías tienen en la mano una

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.000
copita vacía".

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:06.590
"18, the cherries"
for Marosa Di Giorgio.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:13.640
"Of cherries I keep her
image, her fervent paint,

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.230
the living alcove
of a still life.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:20.610
The vibrant call of distillers.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:24.340
I keep her image
safeguarded by the glass.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.350
From ornamented jars,
from shaded halls,

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:31.970
for the credenza cabinet
displays they look

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:36.030
after her small breasts
purple prisoner

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:40.090
in restraint and rapture.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:44.140
Guests no longer
drink cherry liquor.

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.310
Guests are not who
they used to be.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.890
The aunts and the friends

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:56.000
of the aunts each hold a
cordial, and it's empty".

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.870
"20, las castañas dos".

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:05.350
"En otras ramas del árbol
renacen otras castañas.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:08.000
Estamos en Montevideo.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.100
Verano u otoño quizás.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.970
Miro una evanescente
bombonería,

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:18.890
miro las hojas de espejo
con iniciales detrás,

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:25.220
en su caja maleada de festón y
puntillas, están los capullos,

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:30.600
los cofres, bajo un
blanco pétalo glaseado.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.360
La bella durmiente del bosque,

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.070
la princesa extranjera
Majón Glasé,

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:41.180
serenísimas y lujosas
crisálidas.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:45.660
Entonces, vuela una extraviada
imagen, las castañas desnudas,

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:51.600
cubiertas de plata
resplandecen imposibles".

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.410
"20, the chestnuts two.

On other branches of the tree
other chestnuts are born again.

We're in Montevideo.

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:09.860
Maybe summer or fall.

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:13.150
I see an evanescent candy store.

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:16.500
I see the initial
mirrored leaves.

Behind in her box lined with
festoon and point lace, there,

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.520
the bugs, the treasures.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.780
Below a white glassed petal.

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.310
The sleeping beauty
of the woods,

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:34.740
the foreign princess
Majón Glasé, such serene

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:38.140
and luxuriant chrysalises.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:42.500
Then a lost image glides through
the air, the naked chestnuts,

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:48.380
covered in silver, they
resplend impossibly".

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:53.230
And this poem is
by Idea Vilariño

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:57.960
who was born a year before
Amanda Berenger in 1920,

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.920
and died a year before
Amanda Berenger in 2009,

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.700
also from la "Generación del
45", the generation of 45.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.970
This was published
in an anthology

00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:11.850
of Latin American poetry
selected by Raul Zurita,

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:15.070
edited by Forest Gander and it's
called "Pinholes in the night",

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:17.370
published by Copper Cannon.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:22.440
"Ya no. Ya no será.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:29.060
Ya no, no viviremos juntos,
no criaré a tu hijo.

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.970
No coseré tu ropa, no
te tendré de noche,

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:36.170
no te besaré al irme,
nunca sabrás quién fui,

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:39.060
por qué me amaron otros.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.490
No llegaré a saber por
qué ni cómo nunca,

00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:46.530
ni si era verdad lo que dijiste
que era ni quién fuiste ni

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:53.330
quién fui para ti, ni cómo
hubiera sido vivir juntos.

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.970
Querernos, esperarnos, estar.

00:34:56.970 --> 00:35:03.650
Ya no soy más que yo para
siempre y tú ya no serás para

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:04.950
mí más que tú.

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:08.260
Ya no estás en un día futuro.

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:14.810
No sabré dónde vives, con
quién ni si te acuerdas.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:18.060
No me abrazarás nunca
como esa noche, nunca.

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:22.570
No volveré a tocarte.

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:24.100
No te veré morir".

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:28.940
"Not any more.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:32.270
This won't be, not anymore.

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.820
We won't live together,
I won't raise your son.

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:40.090
I won't sew your clothes,
I won't have you at night.

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:42.510
I won't kiss you as I leave.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:47.390
You'll never know who I
was, why others loved me.

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:50.470
I will never know
why or how ever,

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:54.380
or if it was even true what you
said it was or who you were,

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:58.040
or who I was for you, or
how it might have been

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.080
to live together.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:06.780
To love one another, to
wait for each other, to be.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.200
I no longer more than I forever,

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.850
and you won't be any
more than you for me.

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:16.990
You're no longer
in a future day.

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:22.490
I won't know where you live with
who, or if you even remember.

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:25.080
You'll never hold me
like that night, never.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:29.050
I will never touch you again.

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:31.710
I won't see you die".

everybody, I'm Seth Michelson.

Great to be here,
thank you for coming.

Thank you to Rob Casper,

thank you to the Spanish

Thank you very much, Catalina
Gomez for all your help.

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:57.290
It's an honor and
pleasure to be with you.

00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:00.080
Thank you, Jesse Lee
Kercheval, for all that you do.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.760
Thank you, Cilia, for your long
journey, and it's great to be

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.010
with Amandine Morales,
a fabulous translator.

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:08.590
And Jeanine Pitas, it's
wonderful to be with you too.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.980
I'm going to read first from
a book called "The red song",

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:15.780
that it's translated by a
relatively young, in the context

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.080
of what we've been
discussing, poet,

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.560
Melissa Machado, born in 1961.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.080
She's an Uruguayan poet.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.560
Her imagery can be surreal,
the language can be difficult,

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:30.500
the syntax wonderfully vibrant
in its innovative creativity.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.050
So, you're going to
have to listen close

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.500
and I hope you're not too tired.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.800
So, here we go.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.220
Maybe a test of the cycles
that she works through.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.020
This is from "The red song"
put up by action books

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.250
under Johana Sorenson's
visionary direction

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:44.230
of the press.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:50.530
Preamble. "I am lighter, before
strangers I sing [inaudible].

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:58.320
The prosperity of my tongue,
white animals, black animals,

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.660
poison liquids, clear water,
the resurrection of the flesh,

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:09.940
resurrection in all its forms,
sin, extreme unction, my scars.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:15.520
The Sinai song that hospital,
love, white sheets, barbed wire,

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.220
poems that look like this.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:21.830
Illicit love, the
size of my hope.

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:25.410
Licit love, the vacancy of some.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:31.130
Twilight of my life, my face in
the mirror after, clean scent.

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:34.690
Urine scent of the
old and sick".

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:38.980
"Cats, descent, dampness
in all its forms,

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:42.000
imperfection, iron, truth.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.730
The delicate skin of
eyelids, canvas, closet,

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:51.890
the word 'purity', yellow
benches, clarity, forgetting".

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:56.800
"The black song", one.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:02.530
"I've seen you, brother combing
my hair like you'd pet a dog.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:06.790
Night flowers gesturing,
the body as stem.

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:09.890
Hands extended to tongue.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:15.330
And the scanction of my
head, bread of beatitudes".

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:19.160
Two, "I sleep now
with folded wings,

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.590
lying in a wordless groove.

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:26.210
I chew the dark fruit,
bittersweet like bread.

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:34.230
Frozen honey, godless mask,
all the coupled black animals".

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:41.780
Three, "perfection is this
ice, water startling the feet.

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:50.160
Eyes licked by fever, taste of
the name dissolve in the mouth".

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:56.070
Four, "at the end of
hands, darkness is as soft

00:39:56.070 --> 00:40:00.710
as your tongue, trailing
across my brain".

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:06.620
Five, "vertigo curdles
in your eyes,

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:10.550
an anguish of fish swallows
the stone of your tongue.

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:16.050
Lucid birds at the
edge of clavicles".

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:22.100
Six, "your ear bones cut
flowers hidden from rain.

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:27.620
Your silence is perfect, like
a wineskin that won't drip.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:33.480
Nothing is left of me, just
the light shooting through".

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:38.360
Seven, "the packs of
dogs maws cresses,

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.840
shreds the anguish
of your breath.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:48.430
Octopus hair tangled in
fingers, legs pure as luces.

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:52.890
There's no higher power
than these, my clavicles".

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:57.630
Eight, "give me a glass of
water from your icy lap.

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:59.710
Keep my teeth from freezing,

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:04.170
shred this flower
sprouting under my tongue".

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:09.020
Nine, "take my flesh
unbound, this weak pulse,

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.120
protect me from wrinkles
of gawl.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.230
The acrid verb.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:17.910
I, who breaded my dead into
my hair, who sprayed myself

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:22.500
with their scent, want to
go back to sowing my heart".

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.550
So, that's some of Melissa.

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:27.240
A beautiful poet, and I'm just
going to throw in a bonus poet,

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.140
who's very young, born in 1983.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.570
Victoria Estol, and this is
book put out by "Toad" Press

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:36.720
under Genevieve Kaplan's
direction, out in Los Angeles.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.540
And it's just one
poem by Victoria,

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:40.570
from a book called
"Rolley Polley".

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:44.110
It's titled in Spanish
"Bicho bola", from Yaguaru,

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:46.600
the wonderful press
town in Montevideo.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.280
And this is Victoria Estol.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.100
"The bees use their stingers to
carve poems intro tree trunks,

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.200
and the grasshoppers
are beautiful

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.750
with their sad, attentive eyes.

00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:00.030
And all that we didn't
see during winter,

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:03.460
because we believed it
frozen, begins to whisper,

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:07.440
and suddenly we realize
we're surrounded by beauty.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.120
Pure, quiet beauty, which
is the most glorious kind,

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:16.280
because its musicality
is almost inaudible.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.350
But if one listens hard
enough, it can be heard

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:23.600
like a termite working
on a violin".

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.900
Not one of those
[inaudible] hopefully.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:29.550
"It can be heard like a
termite working on a violin,

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:32.210
that no one has touched
in years,

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:36.540
but that the bug makes
sing while destroying it

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:38.290
or not, who knows?"

and the varooms open door
through which neighbors

and angels came in,
and the clouds,

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:15.090
November evening clouds drifting
in circles over the land.

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:18.910
The little trees burden
with jasmine, with doves

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:21.070
and droplets of water.

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:25.010
That joyous pealing,
that endless chirping,

every evening the same.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.080
And then, the next morning,

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:33.550
with its tiny dead angles thrown
everywhere like paper birds,

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:36.110
or the most exquisite
of eggshells.

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:39.890
Your dazzling death".

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:44.590
This is Marosa Di Giorgio
who lived from 1932 to 2004.

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:49.410
All of these poems were
published in the 1960s and 1970s

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:52.390
in Spanish originally.

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:55.100
"That summer the
grapes were blue.

Each one big, smooth,
without facets.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:02.950
They were totally
strange, fabulous,

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:06.480
shining with an awful
blue brilliance.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.390
On the paths through the
vines you could hear them,

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:12.880
growing with the deep,
outrageous murmur.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:17.280
And in the air there was
always the perfume of violets.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:21.330
Even the plants which were not
grapevines produced grapes.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:24.130
Butterflies came
from all directions,

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:26.860
the most absurd,
the most unusual.

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:30.520
From the four cardinal points
came the forest roosters

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:34.280
with their wide wings,
their heads of pure gold.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:38.010
My father dared to kill a
few of them and got rich.

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:41.340
But grapes were bursting
out from everywhere.

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:45.690
A big, rough, blue bunch even
emerged from the wardrobe,

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:51.010
ancient wood, and lasted
forever like a poet.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:56.670
The gladiolas it's a spear, its
edge loaded with carnations,

00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:58.950
a knife of carnations.

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:02.570
It jumps through the
window, kneels on the table.

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:07.040
It's a vagrant flame, burning
up our papers, our dresses.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:10.020
Mama swears that a
dead man has risen.

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:14.010
She mentions her father and
mother and starts to cry.

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:17.370
The pink gladiolas
opened up in our house,

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:20.210
but scare it off, tell it to go.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:23.670
That crazy lily is
going to kill us.

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:30.440
Last night it came
back again, the shadow.

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:33.260
Even though 100 years
had passed,

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.590
we recognized it immediately.

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:38.090
It floated past the
guardian of violets,

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:40.000
the bedroom, the kitchen.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.130
It circled around the syrup
jars, the plates white as bones,

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:46.430
the syrup jars that
smelled like roses.

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:49.160
It went back to the bedroom,

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.480
interrupted lovemaking,
embraces.

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.510
Those who were awake
lay with fixed eyes,

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:58.610
those who were sleeping,
still saw it.

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:00.950
The mirror in which
it either saw itself,

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:04.580
or didn't see itself,
collapsed and shattered.

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:07.780
It seemed like it
wanted to kill someone,

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:10.400
but then it floated
out to the garden.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:14.040
It was spinning,
digging in the same spot,

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.480
as if there were a
corpse buried beneath.

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:22.430
The poor cow grazing close
to the violets went crazy.

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:25.810
She groaned like a
woman or like a wolf.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:29.600
But the shadow took off
flying, off towards the south.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:33.340
It will return within
a century".

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.160
I'm still happy to hear
some of you laughing.

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.960
Di Giorgio's meant to be funny.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:40.020
And I mean, if you
heard her read it --

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.860
I mean, yes, I would read one
in Spanish but in the interest

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:49.530
of time I will just read one
more poem by another poet

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:53.910
from her generation, Selva
Casal, who was born possibly

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:57.170
in 1929, possibly in the 1930s,

00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:59.250
different sources
say different things.

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:03.390
She's still living
and she won't tell me.

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:11.580
So, she is a former penal lawyer
and professor of sociology

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.310
who wrote this book during
the time of the dictatorship,

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:16.650
and lost her job before it.

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:21.500
So, you know, some people paid
with more than that for standing

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.430
up for what they believed,
but she still paid a price

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:27.120
for standing up for
what she believes

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:30.490
and that's what I
admire about her so much.

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:34.840
"There's no sea anymore,
there are bullets.

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:38.640
You come back from the
wave and move forward.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:42.730
The bullet hisses, it
hisses on the golden foam.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.820
Foam, blood, sea.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:50.030
Today an absurd man in
growing in your eyes.

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:52.780
He has neither sea nor house.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:57.310
He's the everyday world,
violent to the point of delirium

00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:00.610
that grabs you by the
feet, snatches you,

00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:03.750
climbs up your feet
and devours you.

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:07.420
Lays you out naked
and alone over death,

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:10.090
over a landscape of flies.

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:13.710
There's no sea anymore,
there are bullets.

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:19.260
There's this world, awarded
blood, parades, assaults.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:24.180
Later, they put on
statistician's voices and speak

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.200
of a democratic system".

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.000
Thank you so much.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:39.520
[ Applause ]

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.820
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval:
Thanks again.

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.410
I'm going to close with
two poems by Cirse Maya,

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:47.630
was born in the 1930s.

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:50.300
And actually, the poem Jeannine
read set up this one very well,

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.060
which is that in Uruguay
the poem are written

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.440
at certain period
during the dictatorship,

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:56.250
and if you read them
knowing that,

00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:59.690
you think differently
of the poem.

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:02.620
And so, Cirse Maia's
husband, who was a doctor,

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.910
was sent to prison
during the dictatorship

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:06.710
and she didn't really know
whether she would ever see

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:08.010
him again.

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:10.750
This poem is called "Treason".

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:15.940
"The last son did not say
to him 'I am the last son'.

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:18.290
Nothing prepared him.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:20.320
The water spilt over his body

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.190
and you didn't know
this was the way

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:24.880
that the water said 'goodbye'.

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.310
He did not know.

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:28.160
No one told him anything.

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:32.200
When night came, it came to
stay, and he never knew".

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.370
And then we're going to read
the last poem in the book,

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:38.830
and it's called "Invitation".

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:41.550
And it's pretty
self-explanatory,

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:43.360
but it also has a
backstory for me and that is

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:48.070
when you go visit Cirse Maia,
in Uruguay, which is a country

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:51.860
of 3.3 million people,
1.5 million live

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:53.700
in the capital, Montevideo.

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.060
Nearly all the poets
live in the capital,

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:57.360
even if they were
born somewhere else.

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.500
It has that kind of
Paris attraction.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.510
But Cirse Maia lives
in Tacuarembó,

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:03.590
which is a five-hour bus
trip, I can tell you,

00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:06.730
having made it many times
upwards the Brazilian boarder.

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:08.940
But when you go to visit
her, when I go to visit her,

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.580
Silvia and I went to a
wonderful visit this last spring

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:12.880
to interview her.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.760
When young poets make this
trip to her door, she takes you

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.030
through the house and out
to her back-wall garden

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:21.320
to sit under her lemon tree.

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.130
So, if you think of that when
you have a poet address you

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:25.640
in this palm, that would
be the right vision.

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.820
And Cirse, I have to say,

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:31.010
is the most lovely
person I've ever met.

00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:32.850
"Invitation".

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:37.260
"I would like you to hear my
voice, wish I could hear yours.

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:39.140
Yes, yes, I'm talking to you,

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:42.470
silent case that runs
over these lines.

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:45.070
You disapprove, perhaps,
of this impossible desire

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:47.190
to escape paper and ink.

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:49.050
What would we say to each other?

00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:51.780
I don't know, but it has to be
better that when I was talking

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:55.050
to myself, turning
phrases, sounds, placing

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:58.370
and removing parenthesis
and putting them in again.

00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:02.100
If your voice interrupts and
breaks this very line, come in.

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:04.350
I was waiting for you, this way.

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:05.780
Let's go into the garden,

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:09.570
there are fruit trees,
you will see, come".

Lee, thank you Silvia and thanks

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.600
to all of our translators.

Thank you all for coming up, my
name is Rob Casper, I'm the head

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:35.090
of the Poetry and Literature
Center, and I'm just going

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:38.570
to finish things up today by
saying a couple of things.

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:41.180
One, you should all have
an event survey next

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.670
to you, near you.

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:44.770
Please do fill it out.

00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:47.120
You can leave it on the
chair, you can hand it to me,

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.820
you can hand it to anyone
else involved in this program.

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.670
It's very useful for us to find

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:54.810
out what you think
about this program.

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:59.190
Secondly, we have an exciting
event coming up on Saturday

00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:03.100
if you happen to be here in DC.

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:08.020
Please come back here 1:30p.m
upstairs in the room LG119

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.500
for the road back, "Bets
in literary writing".

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:13.850
We'll have acclaimed,
veteran poet Bruce Waggle,

00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:16.400
and some cowboy poets,
Bill Jones, West Quinland

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:20.050
and Dave Richmond, there with
their favorite rural one writers

00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:22.570
in connection with the
exhibit that we have,

00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:24.310
and then they'll show us
lectures of their work.

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:29.550
You can also find out more about
literary events at the library

00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:33.090
at www.loc.gov/poetry

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:36.350
out the Hispanic division's
reading room page to find

00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:38.670

there are also books for sale

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:43.940
in the back so, go
get some books,
