00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.020
Hi, everyone. Today on DNews Reports,

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.620
we're looking at one of the biggest

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.240
black markets in the world:

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.100
the illegal wildlife trade.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.040
We're starting with a very unusual police bust in Russia.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.100
Take a look.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.780
Police in Russia recently pulled over a hearse for speeding,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.300
and made an unexpected discovery.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.860
$200,000 worth of contraband

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.280
hidden in the trunk and also in the coffin.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.480
The funny thing about the accidental bust

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.860
is what was seized.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.180
It wasn't drugs.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.180
It wasn't weapons.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.500
It was caviar.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.840
$200,000 worth of illegal caviar.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.020
This report made the rounds

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.280
largely on the strength of its quirkiness.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.980
But it's actually a small piece of a much larger, ongoing story:

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.460
the story of the illegal wildlife trade.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.400
That term covers a lot.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.040
Logging of exotic woods,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.520
endangered animals sold as pets,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.440
and all sorts of wildlife harvested

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.620
for traditional medicines and foods,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.620
like caviar.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.780
It's a broad term, but it adds up to big business.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.420
In terms of money earned for black marketers,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.300
the wildlife trade is up there

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.660
with the drug and weapons trades.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.440
Smuggling fish or plants or exotic pets

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.320
is a classic high-risk, high-margin outfit.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.020
In a lot of ways, in fact,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.820
it operates a lot like the drug trade.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.300
There are petty, small-time dealers.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.820
In South Africa, for example,

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.340
chameleons are caught illegally and

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.440
sold as pets on the side of the road.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.180
And then there's the big time.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.800
Tiger skins reportedly go for

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.920
hundreds of thousands of dollars a piece.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.340
And profits like that have attracted the attention

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.440
of drug cartels looking to diversify their businesses.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.180
In other words,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.040
the drug and wildlife trades

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.580
are similar enough that they're

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.920
actually starting to merge.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.260
For the most part,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.240
wildlife smuggling is something that

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.580
individual countries have to manage themselves.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.940
The United Nations did create a treaty

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.320
known as CITES,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.820
which lists specific species

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.300
under threat of trafficking

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.960
and recommends enforcement policies to member countries.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.080
And the vast majority of world governments

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.280
have signed on to that treaty.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.200
But CITES itself has almost no enforcement power.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.660
So, like the UN,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.820
it's often accused of impotence.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.160
Meanwhile, in all those CITES member countries,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.340
authorities are left to their games of whack-a-mole

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.940
with wildlife smugglers.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.320
That accidental caviar bust is just

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.220
one example, but it's actually a pretty dire one.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.000
Caviar traditionally comes from sturgeon

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.940
in the Caspian and Black Seas.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.700
Beluga sturgeon, the largest species in the family,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.040
produce the most prized caviar.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.580
And because of that, they're critically endangered.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.380
In the 1990s and 2000s,

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.880
beluga experience a 90% drop in population.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.660
In response, the US has banned imports of it,

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.680
and Russia has greatly restricted beluga harvests.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.520
The root of the problem is that eating caviar

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.220
is celebrated in Russia.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.160
That wasn't always the case.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.040
Back in the 13th century, it was considered peasant food.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.160
But now caviar's popularity is wrapped up in status.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.500
And scarcity only enflames its exotic appeal.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.500
So, what can be done about demand for illegal caviar?

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.340
Or for tiger skins? Or chameleons, for that matter?

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.160
Well, one thing to do, at least,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.060
is make sure that that demand isn't met.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.080
Russian authorities are taking this to heart

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.940
and doing with seized caviar

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.200
what they'd be doing with seized drugs.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.040
They're destroying it.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.780
