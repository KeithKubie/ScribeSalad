00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 . 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 In this presentation, I want to see more questions 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.060
 Which deals with graphical representations of lines 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.010
 We have a gym here 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.900
 An offer to new members 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.040
 Members can register by paying a subscription fee 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:22.690
 $ 200 monthly installment 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.940
 This is the registration 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.570
 Registration 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.120
 How much does this registration cost the member 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.890
 At the end of the year? 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.710
 So let 's find the equation determined 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.470
 The amount of amount we will pay 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.680
 p = Amount of amount to be paid 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.230
 Against membership 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.300
 If it does not matter how many months we will be participating in the sports club, all we care about is that when 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.020
 To subscribe to the club, we have to pay $ 200 registration fee 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.100
 I'll write - everything we'll assume will be in dollars - 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.830
 If I write $ 200 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.800
 Then we will have to pay $ 39 for each month 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.400
 We share the club 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.200
 If we take the number of months that 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.430
 We share it and hit it with 39 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.130
 They noticed that if we stayed there for one month, we would have to pay 1 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.550
 Month x $ 39 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.230
 We paid $ 200 as registration fees 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.310
 If we have paid $ 239 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.440
 If we stay two months, we pay $ 200 registration fee 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.110
 Then pay 39 × 2, how much is equal? 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.180
 Approximately 78 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.600
 If the total amount is $ 278 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.630
 All this is considered as linear associations 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.430
 As graphic representations, let us represent this relationship 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.840
 Remember that the graphical representation of a line can be y 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.700
 = mx + b 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.500
 This is one model, so we put this line in this picture or 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.490
 By equation with this image, we can rearrange 39m and 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:55.210
 200 and we get p = 39m + 200 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.300
 What is the slope and y intersection? 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.360
 Maybe you'll bother and say, there's x here 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.670
 And y, but now we deal with p and m 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.699
 Just remember that this variable is independent of this 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:10.780
 The dependent variable 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.200
 Here this is the independent variable 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.170
 How many months? 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.210
 We choose a number for the month and I will tell you what it is 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.490
 The total value of the membership amount 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.250
 The same 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.280
 This is as x 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.790
 This is as y 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.570
 Using the similarity pattern, this 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.810
 - We can say that it is the vertical intersection or the intersection of p 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.030
 Or - I almost say cross y 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.970
 But we actually intersect with the axis of p instead of 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.430
 Axis y here 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.210
 This is the tendency 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.770
 Let us represent this pairing graphically 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.710
 I will not paint it very accurately 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.550
 Because I want to draw it manually 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.820
 So you realize the idea 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.450
 We can say it in the first quarter 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.860
 We will not have bad months and the sports club 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.840
 Will not pay us money 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.852
 Here on the right, will 

00:02:58.852 --> 00:03:05.610
 We pay $ 200 to the sports club 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.040
 $ 200 vs. 0 Months 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.380
 Then for each month, we'll 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.450
 Pay $ 39 extra 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.380
 If the inclination is 39 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.800
 Suppose this is one month 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.050
 This is months 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.250
 This is for months 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.380
 This axis is the price, pivot p 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.040
 This intersection of P or 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.190
 Intersection y 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.940
 If it counts one month, how much will we pay? 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.000
 Well, the tilt is 39, if we move one month forward 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.730
 We will have to move up by 39 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.630
 If here, that would be 239 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.880
 If we move for another month, it will be 278 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.880
 The naming of these axes is strange, but I do 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.190
 I think you got the idea 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.800
 If the graphic representation of the cost per month will look like 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.630
 So 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.510
 The question was how much each member would cost 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.340
 At the end of the year? 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.060
 12 Months 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.840
 We have to go 2, 3, all this way until we get to 12 months 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.750
 Which will be here 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.565
 Then the graphic representation will be somewhere here 

00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:07.650
 But we can find it algebraically 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.830
 At the end of the year, m will be 12 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.090
 When m = 12, how much would it cost? 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.870
 Membership cost will be $ 200 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.829
 Registration fee + 39 × number 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.110
 Months, i x 12 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.760
 How much does it cost 39 × 12? 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.500
 2 × 9 = 18 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.930
 2 × 3 = 6, + = 70 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.680
 I have 0 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.630
 1 × 9 = 9 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.680
 1 x 3 - We want to ignore this 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.910
 1 x 3 = 3 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.340
 If we have 8 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.720
 7 + 9 = 16 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.370
 1 + 3 = 4 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.230
 If the membership cost is $ 200 + 39 × 12 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.120
 = $ 468 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.240
 If it equals $ 468 at the end of the year 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.200
 If we went all this way to 12, we would have to appoint 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.360
 668 somewhere here on the line, if 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.290
 We continued to go 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.310
 Let us solve more of these issues 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.070
 Bobby and Petra are holding a lemon juice stall and paying 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.430
 $ 0.45 per cup lemon juice 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.780
 $ 0.45 per cup 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.650
 To achieve a point, they must collect $ 25 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.410
 How many cups of lemon juice should they sell until they reach a tie? 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.980
 Let me solve it using y and x 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.875
 y = the sum they collect 

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:42.290
 The amount they collect 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.460
 Not the highest value - but the amount they collect 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:53.850
 Let x = the number of cups they sell 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.810
 Which they sell 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.180
 How much is y as a conjunction of x? 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.040
 If y = - well, for each cup sold 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.090
 They get $ 0.45 - if = $ 0.45 x 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.800
 Number of cups 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.760
 This is not the least amount they need 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.440
 For a girl or not the least value that 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.430
 They have to pay to run the kiosk 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.480
 How much do they earn a point equal to each 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.170
 A cup of lemon juice? 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.020
 They need to collect $ 25 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.300
 And to make a tie they have to collect $ 25 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.570
 How many cups of lemon juice should they sell? 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.360
 You must be $ 25 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.530
 How many cups should they sell? 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.230
 Well, put this equation 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:55.310
 Say 0.45x should equal 25 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:03.860
 We can divide both sides at 0.45 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.440
 On the left side, we have x 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:14.875
 We get x = - you output 25 0. 0.45? 

00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:21.050
 = - they should sell exactly 55.55 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.150
 Cup or 56 when I zoom in 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.310
 55.5 cups refined 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.520
 But we can not sell half a cup or supposed 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.340
 Do not sell half a cup 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.372
 If you answer this, he should sell 56 cups 

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:38.960
 Because you can not sell half a cup, I suppose so 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.250
 If they must sell 56 cups to share the amount equally 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.530
 Let us do this graphically 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.930
 Again, we will be in the first quarter because 

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.620
 Everything will be positive 

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.750
 The price per cup is $ 0.45 

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.570
 Suppose they sell - that's it 

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.390
 Number of cups, x 

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.010
 That is the amount they collect 

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:04.500
 Let me follow the 5 multiples 

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.730
 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.810
 In fact I will need even greater complications to get 

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.530
 The point we're talking about 

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.520
 So let me put the 10 multiples 

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:21.270
 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.320
 This is the number of cups 

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.700
 When they sell 0 cups, they will collect $ 0 

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.940
 This intersection y 

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.740
 y = 0 

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.260
 When they sell 10 cups, they collect $ 4.50 

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.610
 This is 4.50 

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.640
 This is 9 

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.230
 In fact let me follow this method 

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:50.500
 Let me just see the 9 multiples 

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:59.610
 To move 9, 18, 27, 35 

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:03.700
 When they sell 10 cups, they will collect $ 4.50 

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.170
 10 x 0.45 

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.540
 This is here 

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.240
 20 cups, they will collect $ 9.00 

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.670
 We can continue here 

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.940
 40 cups, they will collect $ 18 

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.810
 You'll see the tilt 

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.220
 The more you move 10, the higher it will be 4.50 

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.860
 This graphic representation will look like this 

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.520
 The line must be straight 

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.430
 And if you want to see a draw, a draw 

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:29.125
 It should be $ 25, and it is located here 

00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:32.170
 Located here 

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.130
 The break-even point is $ 25 and is located here 

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.220
 Located here 

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.600
 Let me paint the line better than this 

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.020
 The line will look like this 

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:52.240
 If the break-even point is $ 25 - you'll be here - you see 

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.720
 They have to sell about 56 cups 

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.930
 As is clear, the way I draw out is not very accurate 

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:04.010
 But I hope it has given you the general idea 

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:04.466
 .
