generous I say ok the physic is

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270
generous I say ok the physic is
 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.020

quantum computing but we don't know if

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120
quantum computing but we don't know if
 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.560
quantum computing but we don't know if
it will be very feasible and certainly

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
it will be very feasible and certainly
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.119
it will be very feasible and certainly
not a chop there may be after 20 years

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129
not a chop there may be after 20 years
 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.340
not a chop there may be after 20 years
something like that
