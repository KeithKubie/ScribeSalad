00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.770
Hello.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.190
I am Terry Fisher.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.310
This is the
introduction to a series

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.710
of 12 lectures on copyright.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.980
My hope, in these
lectures, is to provide you

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.610
the following things:

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.210
First, an understanding
of the basic principles

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.290
of copyright law;

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.670
Second, an appreciation
of the ways

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.860
in which that law affects, for
better and worse, creativity

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.320
and innovation in a wide variety
of artistic and technical

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.980
fields.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.600
(To that end, I will
be providing you,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.890
along the way,
illustrations of the ways

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.740
that copyright works in
literature; music; film;

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.140
photography; graphic art;
software; comedy; fashion;

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.820
architecture; and so forth.)

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.120
Third, I will try to provide
you a critical understanding

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.970
of the main theories of
copyright by which I mean,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.590
the arguments, developed
over several centuries

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.660
by economists, philosophers,
and political theorists,

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.580
concerning the purposes or
functions of the copyright

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.450
system.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.580
These theories are not mere
matters of academic curiosity

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.880
and dispute.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.440
Copyright law is
changing very fast,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.620
in part in an attempt to
address new technologies,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.000
and the lawmakers who
are making the changes

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.630
are influenced by
and in turn help

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.820
to shape the competing
theories of copyright.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.590
So, to understand
where the law is going

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.690
and certainly if you wish
to affect its trajectory

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.540
you need to know a fair
amount about theory.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.310
This bring me to the fourth
and last of the ambitions:

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.520
By the end of these
lectures, I hope

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.860
to have increased your
ability and confidence

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.360
to make informed judgments
concerning how, if at all,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.210
the copyright system
should be reformed.

00:01:58.872 --> 00:01:59.580
SO, TO SUMMARIZE:

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.020
copyright law;

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.420
its impact on creativity;

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.310
theories of copyright;

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.979
and ways in which the
system could be improved

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.460
those are the general
themes I will be addressing.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.890
The themes are
intertwined, of course,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.880
and I will try to identify, in
the lectures, the relationships

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.560
among them.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.090
The topics of the 12
lectures, in which

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.600
I will be addressing
these themes

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.060
are set forth on your screen.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.930
This first lecture is
called "the foundations

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.250
of copyright law."

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.130
Once I am finished with
the introductory material,

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.650
I will discuss three
aspects of copyright

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.330
that can be thought
of as fundamental:

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.580
--the concept of originality;

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.070
--the crucial distinctions in
copyright law between ideas,

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.530
facts, and expression;

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.680
--and the system of
multilateral treaties

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.020
that constrain the freedom
of almost all countries

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.430
when shaping and administering
their national copyright

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.170
systems.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.380
Along the way, I will discuss
some current controversies

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.600
that those basic
principles affect.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.510
The 2nd lecture will
examine and contrast

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.070
two theories of copyright
law specifically

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.310
the fairness theory,
which is especially

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.280
prominent in countries (like
Great Britain, the United

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.700
States, and Australia)
that have been influenced

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.510
by the common-law
legal tradition;

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.750
and the personality
or personhood theory,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.590
which tends to be somewhat
more prominent in countries

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.310
(including Continental
Europe and Latin America)

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.580
that have been influenced
by the civil-law tradition.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.780
In the 3rd lecture, we will
return to legal doctrine.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.190
Specifically, I will survey
the kinds of original works

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.640
that are subject to
copyright protection.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.040
Some of these (such as
novels, musical compositions,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.460
and films) will be unsurprising.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.460
Others (such as software,
fictional characters,

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.840
and three-dimensional
useful objects)

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.580
may be somewhat
more eye-opening.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.050
The 4th lecture will
concentrate on the most complex

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.600
of the copyright
theories: the welfare

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.320
theory, an outgrowth of
the philosophic tradition

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.810
of utilitarianism.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.130
As we will see, this theory
has growing influence,

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.500
certainly among scholars and
increasingly among lawmakers,

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.310
in all jurisdictions
in the world.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.350
The 5th lecture will consider
the complex set of rules that

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.579
define the term, "author"
-- and identify the persons

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.580
and organizations that
qualify as authors.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.940
The 6th lecture, entitled
"the mechanics of copyright,"

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.000
considers how the copyright
system works in practice.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.780
I will discuss, for example,

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.890
--what, if anything,
an author must do

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.080
to secure copyright protection;

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.940
--the preconditions for bringing
a copyright infringement suit;

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.430
--how long copyrights last;

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.600
--how the rights
associated with copyright

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.726
are transferred from
one person to another;

00:04:50.726 --> 00:04:52.350
--and how the copyright
system attempts

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.802
to shield authors (or their
families) against exploitation.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.480
The 7th and 8th lectures
will examine in some detail

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.470
the legal rights that a
copyright owner enjoys.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.470
The primary entitlements,
we will see,

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.970
are the exclusive rights to
reproduce, modify, distribute,

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.120
or perform their works.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.250
We will examine the scope
of each of those rights --

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.450
and the equally important
list of specific exceptions

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.580
and limitations
upon those rights,

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.340
which are designed to
protect the public"s interest

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.630
in enjoying and transforming
copyrighted materials.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.210
The 9th lecture will
examine the general defense

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.540
to copyright infringement
known variously

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.090
as fair use and fair dealing.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.450
This is among the most
controversial and unstable

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.570
aspects of the copyright system.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.110
How this doctrine evolves
in the near future

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.960
will have a big impact on
journalism, music, film,

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.650
graphic art, and so forth.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.670
In the 10th lecture, we will
return for the last time

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.450
to copyright theory,
examining an approach that

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.870
seems gradually to be growing
in influence in many countries.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.900
It goes by various
names, but I will

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.000
use the term cultural theory.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.760
In the 11th lecture, we will
examine 2 important supplements

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.140
to the set of legal rights
enjoyed by copyright owners.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.990
The first of these
is the doctrine

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.470
of secondary liability, which
enables copyright owners

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.980
sometimes to control the
behavior of organizations that

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.940
do not themselves engage
in copyright infringement,

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.290
but rather facilitate the
infringing behavior of others.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.860
(Included in this group are some
quaint organizations, like flea

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.000
markets, and some modern ones,
like peer-to-peer filesharing

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.340
systems.)

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.910
The second supplement
is the recent addition

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.000
to the copyright
system of prohibitions

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.600
on the circumvention of
technological protection

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.610
measures.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.710
That cumbersome term
refers to legal efforts

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.190
to increase the ability
of copyright owners

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.320
to control uses of their
works through encryption.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.320
Finally, in the 12th lecture, I
will survey the legal remedies

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.610
that are available to
a copyright owner whose

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.410
rights have been abridged.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.260
As is probably obvious, there
is a color scheme to this list.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.480
The lectures described
using a black font focus

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.190
on copyright law and
its applications.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.000
The lectures described
using a red font focus

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.400
on theoretical or
policy considerations.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.190
When discussing details
concerning copyright law,

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.460
I will most often make
reference to the rules

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.920
currently in force
in the United States

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.720
partly because I know
that system best,

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.040
and partly because,
for better or worse,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.770
US law is influential in
many other jurisdictions.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.580
But I will also devote
significant attention

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.650
to the differences
between US law

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.680
and the legal systems
in other countries.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.780
Now, a few words about the
logistics of these lectures:

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.090
Each will last
roughly 90 minutes.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.320
A fair amount of graphic
and audiovisual materials

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.510
will company the presentations.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.990
Consequently, it
will be best if you

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.170
view recordings of the
lectures on a computer

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.150
or on a screen of some sort.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.760
You could, of course,
just listen to them,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.350
but you would be missing
much illustrative material.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.970
The most important of the
supplementary visual materials

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.160
will be two maps
I have prepared.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.150
One covers the main
features of copyright law.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.060
The other covers the main
features of copyright theory.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.370
Because the maps themselves
and my use of them are unusual,

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:38.220
I will say a few more
words about this feature.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.799
The heart of the first
map looks like this.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.090
As you might imagine,
the "plus" signs

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.860
identify opportunities
for expansion.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.590
If you click on a "plus"
sign, it will open additional

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.910
branches of the map -- like so.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.570
These icons identify links.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.160
Some of the links will
open slide presentations

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.280
that I have prepared.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.250
Others lead to copies of
statutes or judicial decisions

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.570
-- or to supplementary materials
prepared by other scholars

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.580
or lawyers that are accessible
through the Internet.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.060
The second map, which examines
Intellectual Property Theory,

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.200
works the same way.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.400
Both of the maps were created
using the Mindmanager software

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.530
program, and I will be
displaying the Mindmanager

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.380
versions on your screens
during these lectures.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.020
If you want to explore
the maps at your leisure,

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.650
you can gain access to them
through the CopyrightX website

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.830
or through my personal
homepage, the address of which

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.010
is: tfisher.org.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.720
If you want to edit the
maps, for example, to add

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.200
your own notes or to
supplement the links

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.720
you will need a software
program of some sort.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.990
You can, of course,
use Mindmanager --

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.450
which you can obtain from
the website for Mindjet --

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.900
but it is expensive.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.120
Other programs that can be used
to import and edit the maps

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.270
include ithoughts, which is
available for a modest price,

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.430
and XMind, an
open-source program

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:10.120
that is available for free.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.800
Last but not least, if you
want to explore the maps

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.820
but not edit them, the
easiest way to do so

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.420
is to use the "flash"
based versions,

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.460
which are available on
the CopyrightX website.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.080
To use those, you do not
need any software at all;

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.040
they will open in
most modern browsers.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.350
Together, the two maps contains
all of my lecture notes

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.730
for all 12 of these lectures,
plus links to a wide variety

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.200
of additional materials.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.210
The result is that they contain
-- or provide access to --

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.750
a large amount of
information and commentary.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.040
However, it is
important that you

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.880
understand their limitations.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.680
In particular, you should
not think of the first map

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.130
as the equivalent of a
treatise on copyright law;

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.740
it is certainly not a
comprehensive survey

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.480
of the law, and it contains some
opinionated material that would

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.770
be inappropriate in a treatise.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:08.180
Rather it is a pedagogic aid --
a device intended to facilitate

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.720
your understanding of --
and capacity to remember --

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.960
the main features of
the copyright system.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.900
I modify both of the
maps with some frequency.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.560
Most often, I do this to
take into account changes

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.710
in copyright
statutes or treaties

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.920
or new judicial decisions.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.150
But I also sometimes
revise the maps

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.330
when I change my mind
on a particular issue

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:34.210
or when another commentator
deploys a novel argument.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:38.240
Accordingly, if you find the
maps useful in the future,

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.910
you should probably check
the CopyrightX website

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.010
to make sure that you have
the most current versions.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.250
I will try to keep the
maps reasonably up to date

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.140
as long as I am able.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.290
Finally, if you have
suggestions concerning

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:56.190
the content of either map
(bearing in mind, of course,

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.810
their limited purposes),
feel free to e-mail

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.880
me using the address listed
on the CopyrightX website.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.220
The same principle
applies to these lectures.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.810
If you have suggestions
concerning how they might be

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.680
improved -- please let me
know, by sending a message

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.005
to the same email address.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.320
This concludes the
introduction to lecture #1.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.560
In the next segment,
I will take up

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.340
the first of the substantive
topics in the course:

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.840
the concept of originality.
