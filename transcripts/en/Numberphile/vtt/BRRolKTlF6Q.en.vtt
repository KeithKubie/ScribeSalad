00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
MATT PARKER: 0 is a perfectly
good number.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.140
And you ignore it
at your peril.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.870
The problem is it's a
dangerous number.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.910
And a lot of things can go
horribly wrong with 0.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.520
And because it is a slightly
more unusual, nuanced number,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.750
you have to be a little
bit more careful with

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.730
how you handle it.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.510
And so there are some things
that you can't do with it.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.000
So you can't divide
something by 0.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.670
And you can't have things like
0 to the power of 0.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.470
And I get asked about
these all the time.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.250
People are constantly, why
can't I divide by 0?

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.610
I want to divide by 0?

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.880
Isn't it just infinity?

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.680
Blah, blah, blah.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.720
And so I thought I would
do two things.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.050
First of all, I'm going to show
you why, no, you cannot

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.860
divide by 0.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.280
It's not just infinity.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.950
It's a bit more complicated
than that.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.780
And then, I'm also going to look
at why you can't have 0

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.690
to the power of 0.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.230
JAMES GRIME: OK, so this is
something that we've been

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.370
asked a lot at Numberphile.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.570
Well, you may know that
something like multiplication

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.210
is just glorified
adding, really.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.970
You want to do 5 times 10?

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.210
You just add on 5 plus 5
plus 5 plus 5 10 times.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.420
Division is just glorified
subtraction.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.920
So if I want to take a number
like, oh, 20, and then divide

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.400
it by 4, I just keep
subtracting 4.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.780
So you take away 4, take
away 4, take away 4.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.960
You do that five times.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.290
And that number, 5, that's
your answer.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.300
20 divided by 4 is equal to 5.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.210
So it's just glorified
subtraction.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.770
That's really what it is.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.910
Now, if I divide by 0, then that
means I'm subtracting 0

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.500
over and over.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.750
So 20 divided by 0 means
I take away 0.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.430
I've got 20.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.830
And then, I take away 0 again.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.450
I've still got 20.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.970
I take away 0, and 0, and that
would go one forever.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.770
You would never get very far
doing something like that,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.180
keep taking away 0.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.270
So 20 divided by 0?

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.930
That's infinity, isn't it?

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.510
Surely--

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.640
surely it's infinity.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.980
And that's what I expect
people to think.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.640
Surely only a nerd would
tell you differently.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.255
That's when you cut to Matt
telling them differently.

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:04.740
MATT PARKER: Because first of
all, everyone goes, why can't

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.060
you just say that's something
divided by 0?

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.499
So let's say I'm going
to do a function.

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:11.280
I'm going to have the
function of 1/x.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.330
JAMES GRIME: We don't say
something is equal to

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.375
infinity, OK?

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:17.160
So infinity is not a number,
and it can't be

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.680
treated like number.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.650
It's an idea.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.960
So we can't say 1 divided
by 0 equals infinity.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.610
We can no more say that than we
can say 1 divided by 0 is

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.510
equal to blue.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.620
But if I am naughty and I do
this, 1 divided by 0 is equal

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.950
to infinity, you would get just
as equally 2 divided by 0

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.660
is equal to infinity.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.720
And obviously you get
the problem here.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.250
That's one seems to
be equal to 2.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.610
Oh, and we see that's
nonsense.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.880
And that's why we don't-- so
for a very good reason, we

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.145
don't say it's equal
to infinity.

00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:56.720
You're going to get nonsense
like 1 equals 2.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.610
MATT PARKER: But what
if you take a limit?

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.520
What if you just take
the limit as x gets

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.930
really close to 0?

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.100
Doesn't this equal infinity?

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.210
And so you would say that
actually, dividing by 0, you

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.630
could therefore conclude that 1

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.055
divided by 0 equals infinity.

00:03:14.055 --> 00:03:15.890
And I'm going show you why
you can't do that.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.020
So if you imagine your
number line here.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.670
This is the number line.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.160
I'm going to put
0 right there.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.090
So there's 0 in the middle.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.870
And out here, this might be 1
and so on, all the way up.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.630
And as you go along, this here,
I'm going to draw on

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.270
this axis going up.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.120
This here is 1/x.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.910
I'm going to have 1/x on that.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.100
And over here where it's 1, this
would be about 1 there.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.430
When you come back to, let's
say, about 1/2, this is going

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.060
to be a bit bigger.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.900
It's going to be twice as big.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.500
By the time you get down to
about 1/4, that's going to be

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.940
twice as being again.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.570
And if you come-- as you get
closer and closer, this does--

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.010
it does, I absolutely agree--
this gets bigger and bigger.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.750
This goes racing off.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.050
And it does tend to infinity.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.320
This is absolutely correct.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.180
But this only works if you're
approaching 0 from the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.370
positive numbers, if you're
coming in from the right on

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.120
your number line.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.470
If you come in from the left,
it's completely different.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.620
So if you start over here at
negative 1, then your value is

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.010
actually down here at 1.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.670
If you then go to negative
1/2, it's down here at

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.079
negative 2.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.260
And as you get closer and
closer, the value goes racing

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.440
off in this direction.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.610
In fact, it goes racing down
to negative infinity.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.370
So yes, if you approach
0 from one

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.670
direction, you get infinity.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.120
But if you come in a different
way to exactly the

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.200
same place, you get--

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.400
well, you can't get much
more different

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.340
than negative infinity.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.280
And people will yell at me
if I say it's infinitely

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.470
different from positive
infinity, blah, blah.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.560
Maybe this line goes all the
way around and wraps around

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.010
the entire universe and then
comes back up here.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.070
But as far as I'm concerned,
if you're coming from one

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.360
direction you get one answer.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.800
If you're coming from the other
direction, you get a

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.690
different answer.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.360
You're going to the
same place.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.650
There is no one limit as you
get closer and closer to

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.430
dividing by 0.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.520
There's more than
one limit with

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.530
completely different answers.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.140
And that's why we say
it's undefined.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.950
Mathematically, what we
would say is we say--

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.430
I want blue this time, sorry.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.570
If you approach the limit as x
approaches 0 from the positive

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.280
direction, equals positive
infinity.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.020
And then separately, down
here, the limit as x

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.200
approaches 0 from the negative
direction of 1/x equals

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.450
negative infinity.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.340
And these are different.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.670
They equal different things.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.530
We simply cannot just assume
that 1/0 equals infinity.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.890
JAMES GRIME: If you go to 0
from this direction, it's

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.470
going off to plus infinity.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.360
And if you go to 0 from this
direction, it goes off to

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.400
minus infinity--

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.130
two different answers.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.800
BRADY HARAN: When I type
1 divided by 0 into my

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.140
calculator or my computer,
it can't do it.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.560
It can't handle it.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.210
What's it trying
to do, though?

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.200
What can it not do?

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.740
What happens in those
circuits?

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.280
What did it try and
fail to do?

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.000
Or has the calculator
been taught?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.730
MATT PARKER: Oh, that's
a very good question.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.120
Is it attempting to do
something, and then it's not

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.820
getting an answer?

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.770
Or has it just been rote taught
to not divide by 0?

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:11.850
I honestly don't know.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:18.090
I suspect it's just been taught
that if someone hits

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.140
divide by 0, say error.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.960
Or what it might do is actually
try to get to that

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.110
answer by an iterative process,
which it then finds

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.070
exploding in one or the other.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.420
And so it's got some kind of
built-in cap or some kind of

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.950
safety switch which goes off
to say, this calculation is

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.110
getting out of control.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.100
Call it off here.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.160
Just say maths error.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.830
But I imagine it might even vary
from device to device.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.080
But it'd be one of the two.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.480
The other thing that people get
very annoyed about is when

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.870
you've got 0 to the
power of 0.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.680
And the reason they get annoyed
about this is when

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.780
you've got anything, anything at
all, to the power of 0, you

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.880
always say it equals 1.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.230
And when you've got 0 to the
power of anything, you always

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.090
say it equals 0.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.150
So what happens when
these collide?

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.780
And people, to be honest, argue
different ways depending

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.720
on what they need.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.940
More often than not, people
argue for 0 to the 0 equals 1

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.850
in my experience, although the
video I did on 345 for

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.690
Numberphile, people in the
comments argued that 0 to the

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.350
0 should be 0, which is, of
course, equally insane.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.120
And I'm going to show you
why you can't have this.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.720
And this is absolutely lovely
because when you start with

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.870
your number line here--

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.980
this is a normal number line.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.250
There's 0 in the middle.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:41.170
This time, you can look at the
limit as x approaches 0.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.190
So this time, our function is
x to the power of x, right?

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.565
And we're going to
slide it in.

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.570
And in fact, we have to do
it from both directions.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.360
We have to come in from the
positive direction.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.980
And as we know, we have to
come in, the limit as x

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.030
approaches 0, from a negative
direction of x to the x.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.440
And we'll see what we get.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.170
And obviously, if they're
different, then things are

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.270
going horribly wrong.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.680
So if I draw in my
y-axis here.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.250
This is where I'm going to
be graphing x to the x.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.910
As you get closer in--

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.430
and to be honest, the path
we follow is irrelevant.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.450
But what happens is as
you come in from one

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.300
side, you hit 1.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.050
As you come in from the
other side, you hit 1.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.760
In fact, these have exactly
the same answer.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.390
They both give you one.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.800
And so you say, well, if it
doesn't matter which side

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.790
we're coming in from, if we can
come in along the number

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.720
line this way into the middle,
or we can come along the

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.090
number line this way into the
middle, and both cases, the

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.650
function has the same limit,
surely we can just call it 1.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.419
But it's slightly more
complicated because this is

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:45.090
only the real number line.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.350
I'm not going to go into this.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.170
But the real number line is very
boring because it's one

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:49.670
dimensional.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.620
You can go backwards and
forwards on your numbers.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.410
You've also got the
complex numbers.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.420
And for that, you need to
put in the imaginary.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.410
So I'm going to put in-- this
is my imaginary axis.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:03.380
And so now, you've got this
entire surface of numbers.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.610
And you've got the real
in one direction,

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:05.480
imaginary in the other.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.240
And any single point in there is
part of the complex plane.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.240
In fact, now there are loads of
different ways to come in

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.320
towards the origin.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.030
And you could approach it from
anywhere on the complex plane.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.780
And then, these approaches,
you get different limits.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.490
You don't get 1 anymore.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.820
It starts to fall apart once you
go to the complex plane.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.640
And so this is why, even though
on the surface of it it

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.200
might look like the limit should
be 1, it doesn't work

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.810
once you go to complex
numbers.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.120
And that's why mathematicians
still get very emotional when

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.470
you try to say that 0 to
the 0 has a value.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:45.620
In fact, it is still undefined
because the limits vary.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.710
JAMES GRIME: How about something
like x divided by y?

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:51.730
So I'm going to draw--

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.430
here's x and here's y.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.640
If I think about x
divided by y--

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.900
BRADY HARAN: Slide that
page around a bit?

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.290
JAMES GRIME: If I think about x
divided by y, this is going

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.460
to be fine except here.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.570
This is called the origin.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.600
It's the point 0, 0.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.830
x is equal to 0 and
y is equal to 0.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.630
So at this point, we have
something that is

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.460
0 divided by 0.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.420
That doesn't sound like
good news at all.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:18.560
What is that?

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.640
Is it 0?

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.400
Is it infinity?

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.440
What is it?

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.160
In fact, it can be any answer
you want it to be depending on

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.640
the angle you come from.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.550
I'll show you what I mean.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.150
Now, this line is y equals x.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.930
This line.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.990
Now, if I travel along
that line, then

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.610
this thing here, x/y--

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:41.840
why did I say this?
y equals x?

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:47.020
This is actually x divided
by x now, which is 1.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:47.710
So this is 1.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.110
Everything on this line is 1.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.520
So it would be OK if I'm only
traveling along that line.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.520
I would be quite happy to say
that that is a 1 as well.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.900
Everything else is.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.120
So I'm going to say,
yeah, that is.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.485
That's called a removable
singularity.

00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:04.450
That's it's proper name.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:09.010
If I travel along this
direction, this is the line y

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.810
equals minus x.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.450
If I do that, y equals
minus x.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.340
In that case, you get
x divided by y.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.320
y is equal to minus x.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.140
So this is minus 1.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.600
Everything on this
line is minus 1.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.330
Now, let's try this.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.850
I'm going to travel
along the x-axis.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:29.650
X-axis--

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.580
In other words, this
is y equals 0.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.790
That's what the x-axis is.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.440
So y equals 0.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.850
If I do that, then I
get x divided by y.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.450
I said y equals 0.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.520
So here's x divided by 0.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.660
Oh, dear.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.900
Well, we know that this
is a problem.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:52.820
But it's going to be something
like I'm going to be naughty.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.500
It's going off to infinity--

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.080
plus infinity, minus infinity.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.990
But it's something like that.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:05.100
If I go along this direction,
which is the y-axis, here x

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.400
equals 0 down here.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.470
But you have the same thing,
right? x is equal to 0.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.760
So I'm going to say 0.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.120
x is equal to 0.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.650
Divide it by y.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.060
That's 0 divided by 1.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.240
Everything on this line
is equal to 0.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.490
So I would be justified to say,
well, that point is the

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.530
only problem.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.300
Take it out, and call it 0.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.840
So it just depends on which
angle you approach from.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.220
In fact, I can make
any number.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:36.280
I've made minus 1, plus
1, infinity, and 0.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.220
And depending on which angle you
come at, you can make any

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.720
number you want out of that.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:48.440
So 0 divided by 0 is this
property called undefined.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.700
Frankly, we could make it to be
anything we want it to be

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.150
depending on the angle
we come at it from.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.760
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.625
MATT PARKER: It's all to do with
the angle that the match

00:12:57.625 --> 00:12:59.320
takes as being sort of--
