WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Because we can communicate doesn't mean we're communicating the right things.

2
00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:05.850
Animals live in harmony with nature in a very different way.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.190
You know what I mean?
They kill for hunger,
you know what I mean?

4
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:11.400
They AIDS can kill for reasons that are non hunger related and things that

5
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:15.150
nature.
So we know that's a part of us,
but I,
I honestly think,
yeah,

6
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:19.350
I think we evolved from something that didn't necessarily look like us know.

7
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:20.521
Yeah.
It's,

8
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:24.210
that may have swung from a tree where the most advanced of the primates,

9
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.710
but we exhibit characteristics so we can see in the lower primates and if you

10
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:33.600
pay attention to all the top scientists who have spent studying human evolution,

11
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.990
they're all pretty much in agreement that there was something that we were all

12
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:40.110
similar too.
And they all branched off in a bunch of different ways.
It's amazing.

13
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.280
They keep finding new forms of people too.
Yeah,
I saw it.

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.930
I just found destined Noveon or something like that.
That's what it's called.

15
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.700
The one from Russia.
So do you think,
do you think Eileen has really popped down?

16
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.120
Fucked a monkey and we popped out nine months later and we go,
oh look,

17
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:56.280
that would be the most fun.
Yeah,
I think so.

18
00:00:56.281 --> 00:01:00.240
Most fun thing if a pit stop happened and what was the movie that was really

19
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:01.650
crappy and not as good as it should have been?

20
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.950
That was the aliens like precursor or something.

21
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.480
It showed essentially where they can atheists,
atheists,
right.

22
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:08.910
They should have been very good at theory.
But yeah,
I think,

23
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.340
I think that that that's the possibility.

24
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.780
Aliens were chick hanging out at the moon,
said,
Yo,

25
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:17.070
look the blue plans to fucking go see what is and say Yo,
wow,
monkey looks great.

26
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.100
Fuck the shit out of it.
Got Out of there.

27
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.840
And the next thing you know you have war and pestilence and violence and poverty

28
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:24.600
and MMA.
Mm and joints.

29
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.780
But one monkey that accelerates past way past all the other ones.

30
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.700
Like one invention,
the invent,

31
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.110
the ability to communicate and the ability to having opposable thumbs to the

32
00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:38.160
ability to communicate.
And then it started advancing.

33
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.810
As soon as he started talking,

34
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.190
started figuring out ways to express itself to each other.

35
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:46.320
And then they started making things and they're off to the races.

36
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.720
The next thing you know,
a couple of hundred thousand years later,

37
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:50.010
the world's different Pune.

38
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.640
It's like this thing erupts and then just covers a world with its shit.
Yeah.

39
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.660
And that's us.

40
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.870
How do you subscribe to the theory that we just may be a virus and the earth may

41
00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:02.820
be getting rid of us?
Well,
no one would like to think that.
Right.

42
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:05.580
But the reason you call a vibe or something,
it's just an a,

43
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:09.960
a word that's been assigned to a living organism and a system by biomedical

44
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:14.330
science.
I mean,
we all know what a virus is.
It's a real thing.
It's amazing.

45
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.700
These brilliant people have discovered it and come up with vaccines to stop and

46
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:21.630
prevent them.
But it's a,
some sort of a life form really.
Essentially.
Now,

47
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:25.900
if we looked at the earth as being a living organism,
and so we should shirt,

48
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.280
it's certainly,
you could make an argument that it's a kind of a life form,

49
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.470
that it's a host of massive amounts of life yeah.
Of all the life.
Yeah.
Um,

50
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.620
you would think that maybe some of those things would not be in harmony.

51
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:40.380
Just like some of those things in the human body aren't in harmony,
right?

52
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:44.760
Your gut bacteria is off or you got a cold because there's bacteria in your body

53
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:48.900
that you picked up from a fucking bathroom somewhere or whatever.
Your sad,

54
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.320
all that stuff could easily apply to how human beings interact with the earth.

55
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.750
Are we the virus though?

56
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.740
Like when you got to look at it at some point the earth is,
Oh,
you are.

57
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:03.640
The theory is it's a living,
breathing organism.
Here's one I can say for sure.

58
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.060
Okay.

59
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.200
We are the virus to the ocean because we don't even look at them and think about

60
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:11.110
it.
That's life.
Before we were monkeys,

61
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.830
we were something that crawled out of the ocean.
Right?
Right.

62
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.130
Imagine if the earth,
the ocean was,
I mean,
I don't know what it was like.

63
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.380
We are kidding.
100 really stolen now.
This is where our phase one is to go,

64
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.463
were stoned as fuck.

65
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.130
I don't know what the ocean was like a couple hundred thousand years ago before

66
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:28.660
people really became what we are.

67
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:33.190
Tool tool using people that figured out how to get out into the ocean and

68
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:37.000
capture fish boon.
Imagine if you could see it.

69
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.810
Imagine if you could see an image of how many fucking fish were out there

70
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.150
200,000 years ago versus how many are now.

71
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.480
It's like they live next to a vampire that just keeps sucking the life out of

72
00:03:48.481 --> 00:03:52.930
it.
I bet we've killed 50% of all life in the ocean.

73
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.070
That's what I'm saying.
We have to think of ourselves as some point.

74
00:03:57.071 --> 00:04:01.640
You gotta say maybe the best thing human beings could do for the earth is,

75
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.460
is to end humanity.
Maybe,

76
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:07.630
but maybe viruses are there for a reason to maybe that it all needs to exist.

77
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.700
There needs to be some sort of a balance.

78
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.530
We're always trying to eliminate bad things.

79
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.480
Maybe they do serve some sort of weird fucking purpose.
So even even in that,

80
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:19.090
we find purpose is healing.
That's the talent of humans.

81
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.130
The ability to adjust and make logic out of us.
Being here.
Yeah.
Well,

82
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:25.750
and to keep moving and make more of us.
