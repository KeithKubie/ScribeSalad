00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.996
Percent literally means per 100.

00:00:03.996 --> 00:00:05.370
That's where the
word comes from.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.540
Cent from cents or century or
any of those words means 100.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.859
So if someone tells
you 7 per cent--

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.400
and I'm separating the word so
it makes a little more sense--

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.680
they're really saying 7 per 100.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.260
This is the same
thing as 7 per 100,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.640
which is the same thing as a
fraction as 7 per 7 per 100.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.170
With that out of
the way, let's see

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:36.810
if we can write 0.601
as a percentage.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.930
Well, we essentially want to
write it as something over 100.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.730
So you could view
it as-- I'll just

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.800
rewrite this part
right over here.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.600
You could write it
as 0.601 over 1.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.152
This is obviously
the same quantity.

00:00:50.152 --> 00:00:51.610
If you divide
anything by 1, you're

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.370
still going to get
that same anything.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.105
And I'm going to multiply
it by 100 over 100.

00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:01.730
Obviously, this won't
change the value.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.310
This is just 1 here.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.000
But what this does is it'll
give us a fraction in term

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.800
with the denominator being 100.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.790
So the denominator, if I
multiply these two characters

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.530
right over here in
the denominator,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.480
the denominator of our
product is going to be 100.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.370
If I multiply 0.0601 times
100, what am I going to get?

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.570
Well, every time I multiply
it by a multiple of 10

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.130
or every time I
multiply it by 10,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.850
I'm going to shift the decimal
over to the right once.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.560
So if I multiply it
by 10, I'd get 6.01.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.070
And if I multiply
it by a 10 again

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.830
or if I multiply it by
100, I'm going to get 60.1.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.700
So 0.601 times 100 is 60.1.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.240
Let me rewrite that again.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.930
If I were to write 0.601, and
I want to multiply it by 100,

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.250
shift the decimal once,
I multiply it by 10.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.020
If I multiply it by 10 again, or
essentially multiply it by 100,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.130
I get 60.1.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.600
So this is times 10.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.880
This is times 10 again.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.970
I've essentially
multiplied it by 100.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.880
But now we have it
in the form we like.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.919
We have 60.1 over 100.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.550
Or you could rewrite this.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.500
This is the same
thing as 60.1 per 100,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.860
which is the same
thing as 60.1 percent.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.460
And we'd obviously want to write
it then as 60.1 percent, as one

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.930
word, or 60.1, and we'll
just use the symbol-- 60.1%.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.940
We are done.
