00:00:00.284 --> 00:00:01.700
Let's think a
little bit about how

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.404
margin works for a
futures contract.

00:00:03.404 --> 00:00:05.195
So let's say that the
terms of the contract

00:00:05.195 --> 00:00:09.950
are a 1,000 pounds of apples
for delivery on November 15,

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.400
and we're assuming that this
is some date in the future.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.290
And right now in the
Futures Exchange,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.860
the market delivery
price, so the price

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.280
at which the apples will change
hand in the future, is $200.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.000
And I've written here what
the exchange specifies

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.660
for the initial and
maintenance margin,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.947
we'll talk about that
more in a second.

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:33.530
But this essentially means that
both the buyer and the seller,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.170
for the initial margin,
have to put up $20.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.767
Sometimes it'll be specified
as an absolute dollar amount

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:39.600
like I've just done.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.370
Sometimes it might
be a percentage

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.290
of the actual delivery price.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.220
So they both have to
put up $20, and this guy

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.960
has agreed to buy a
1,000 pounds of apples

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.540
from this guy on
November 15 for $200.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.920
So it's essentially
$0.20 a pound.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.670
Now, let's say
that a day goes by,

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.870
and the next day-- these
guys have this contract.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.860
This price right here
is fixed in their minds.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.570
But let's say, the next
day, the same contract

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.560
between two other parties
trades with the delivery

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.700
price of $190.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.660
Now, all of a sudden this
guy over here feels silly.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.900
He's like, man, I'm
agreeing to buy something

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.180
for $200 in the future
which some other dude, all

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.140
of a sudden, has
agreed to buy for $190.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.250
This guy over here
feels really smart.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.210
He agreed to sell something
for $200 the day before,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.610
and now people are
selling it for $190.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.810
So he's kind of $10
better than the people

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.380
participating in the
Futures Market today.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.392
The way market to market
works with futures contracts

00:01:44.392 --> 00:01:46.350
is that the exchange
says, well, you know what?

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.100
I'm afraid that this guy, if
things keep moving against him,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.720
he's not going to even
want to put up the money

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.170
to buy it at $200 if he can
buy in the market at $190

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.960
or something lower.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.360
So I'm going to reset their
futures contract to a delivery

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.100
price of $190, but,
to make things fair,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.509
this guy's going to
be $10 in the hole.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.680
He's getting a $10 deal.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.000
If I take the delivery
price from $200 to $190,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.790
I need to take
$10 from this guy,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.930
because he's getting
a $10 better deal.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.570
So from his margin account,
I take it from $20 to $10.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.410
And then I place the $10 in
this guy's margin account.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.410
If he's going to get
$10 less of a good price

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.660
on the delivery date, than let
me give him the $10 right now.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.620
So his margin account
will go to $30.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.120
Now, this number was
18, 17, 16, or 15,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.910
this guy wouldn't
have to do anything.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.682
But right here, he's triggered
his maintenance margin.

00:02:47.682 --> 00:02:49.640
Actually, he's right at
our maintenance margin.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.010
So let's say that he goes--
that the next day, this happens

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.760
a little bit more.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.650
It goes down to $185, and we
have to do the process again.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.570
This guy loses $5,
he goes down to $5,

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.180
This guy will be given
$5, so he goes to $35.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.370
In order for him to essentially
reset the Futures Price,

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.420
he's been given another $5.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.180
Now, this guy has only
$5 in his margin account,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.640
and the maintenance
margin is $10.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.990
So triggers a margin
call, and this guy's

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.550
got to find some place to put
another $15 in his margin call.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.420
Every time you get below
the maintenance margin,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.900
it triggers a
margin call, and you

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.090
have to refill your margin
account to the initial margin.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.323
So he has to add $15,
so he gets back to $20.
