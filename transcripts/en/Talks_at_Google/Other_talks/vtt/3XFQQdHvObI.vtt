00:00:00.956 --> 00:00:04.302
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:08.130
BONITA STEWART: How many
of you have actually

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.310
heard of "The Third
Metric," so we can-- OK.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.820
Great.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.280
But some of you have not.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.160
And so part of
"The Third Metric"

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.820
is moving just beyond
money and power.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.490
So I thought, Arianna,
could you talk to us

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.520
a little bit about what does
it mean, what does success

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.350
look like when you start to
think about a third metric

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.707
and what it means?

00:00:31.707 --> 00:00:33.290
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Well first of all,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.360
I'm delighted to be
here, and delighted

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.860
to have this conversation
with you, Bonita.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.060
And I loved our
last panel and what

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.110
you said, that I'm
going to query you

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.220
on about sacred spaces.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.350
And so the third
metric is an idea

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.540
that occurred to me after I
collapsed from exhaustion,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.310
burnout, and sleep deprivation,
which is how I start the book.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.610
And as I came to-- that
was seven years ago--

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.379
in a pool of blood,
having broken my cheekbone

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.242
and got four stitches
on top of my right eye,

00:01:08.242 --> 00:01:11.940
I basically started asking
a lot of these questions

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.060
that we often stop asking
when we leave college,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.370
like what is a good life?

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.950
What is success?

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.770
And why by conventional
definitions of success

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.240
are successful.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.390
By any sane
definition of success,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.170
if you come to in a pool of
blood and nobody has shot you,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.330
you're not successful.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.920
So that's when I started
thinking our society

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.850
defines success in
terms of these two

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.620
metrics of money and power.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.700
We give them different
names, but that's

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.510
what it comes down to.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.850
And I came to the conclusion
that life is really not

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.130
complete without
the third metric.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.580
It's really like the
third leg of the stool.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.850
The first two metrics
are the two legs.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.420
And you basically try
to sit on the stool,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.620
and you will at
some point fall off,

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.890
because it's not sustainable.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.320
The third metric consists
of these four pillars,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.330
and each of the pillars
is a section in the book.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.710
Well being, which
starts with sleep.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.230
Because I love the fact
that Googlers are all

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.500
about data and evidence, right?

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.640
That's why I have in the book 55
pages of scientific end notes.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.600
Because all the things about
sleep, meditation, renewal

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.120
pauses are not kind of new
agey, flaky, California stuff.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.780
They are actually
scientifically-based

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.220
performance enhancement tools.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.690
And for all the
skeptics in the room,

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.790
look at the scientific data.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.140
All the major universities
now, for example,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.510
have a sleep division as part
of their medicine school.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.040
In fact, I became such
a sleep evangelist

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.110
that Harvard asked me to join
the board of their school

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.290
of medicine sleep division.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.810
That gives you an idea of
how much I talk about it.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.890
In fact, I gave a
commencement at Smith,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.150
and I told the women graduates
to sleep their way to the top.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.790
And I was a late
convert, because I

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.890
came to this realization
having collapsed

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.790
after I used to get
four to five hours.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.670
And then I read
the scientific data

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.170
and realized that if I
got seven to eight hours,

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.890
I would actually be more
productive, more creative, less

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.150
reactive, and happier.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.780
So it became a priority.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.950
And just very quickly, the
second pillar is wisdom.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.930
And we can talk more about that.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.320
But everybody here
wants to be creative.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.430
And every creative
person will tell you

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.970
that creativity is not the
product of clearing our email

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.230
box, or being on
the zone, it's often

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.500
the product of
these Eureka moments

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.780
which come when we create
some space in our lives

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.360
in which to hear
the whisperings,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.000
as Steve Jobs called it,
and basically connect

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.950
with some deeper wisdom
and deeper insights.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.990
The third part of the
third metric is wonder.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.130
Being connected with the
wonder, the mystery of life.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.649
Often just the ordinary
beauty of life.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.070
We spend so much
time multitasking.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.500
I mean, you walk down
the streets of New York,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.450
and hardly anybody's
just walking.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.730
People are either walking
and being on the phone,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.610
walking and texting, and also
if they're walking and texting,

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.020
the assumption seems to
be that if you are not

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.880
texting while walking, it means
you're not as busy and not as

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.500
important, so you better
get out of the way.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.350
And I remember when I stopped
doing that seven years ago, I

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.400
started noticing things that
I had completely ignored,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.360
like this beautiful
building by my apartment.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.870
And I remember I told a
friend, "This is so beautiful.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.420
Look at the
ornamentation at the top.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.350
When did it go up?"

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.520
And she said, "1890."

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.070
So what else are we missing?

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.420
And the final pillar is giving.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.660
That giving is really part of
a completely fulfilled life.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.000
And it starts with small acts
of connecting with people

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
that otherwise you might take
for granted in our daily lives.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.300
BONITA STEWART: So in
the book you talk about,

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:33.200
this is not a simple
thing to actually thrive.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.290
You have to know
what you're doing.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.950
You have to think about
it and be more conscious.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.280
And I think for the women-- and
there's even a question here--

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.360
but we've all been told now
with this worldwide conversation

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.910
on leaning in, how do
we go about leaning in.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.480
And then also this
notion of having

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.830
a life where you can thrive, and
just invoke this third metric.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.167
How would you address the women
in terms of those two aspects?

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:08.750
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Well first of all,

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.150
I think these two are
completely compatible,

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.630
which is why Sheryl Sandberg did
a big endorsement of the book,

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.550
and actually did the
first conversation.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.920
I've had a series
of conversations

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.270
with women like you, which
has been really great.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.980
And Sheryl Sandberg
did the first one

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.010
when the book came out at the
end of March in San Francisco,

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.570
at the Symphony Hall.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.140
And the reason for that
is to make it clear

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:37.470
that thriving and taking care
of the third metric in our lives

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.200
doesn't mean that we
don't have big dreams,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.430
or accomplish big things.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.600
It just means
recognizing that we're

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.740
going to lean in more
effectively if we learn

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:55.020
to lean back, recharge
ourselves, and lean in.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.220
It's like a dance.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.995
And if anybody here has a
cat, if you look at cats,

00:07:01.995 --> 00:07:03.030
you know what they do.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.220
They kind of-- if
they're going to jump,

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.910
they lean back before they jump.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.185
In French, for those
who speak French,

00:07:10.185 --> 00:07:11.870
there is a term
called reculer pour

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.880
mieux sauter, which
literally means,

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.790
lean back in order
to jump higher.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.730
And it's really what modern
science has demonstrated,

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:25.790
which is the need for recovery
time, they need for renewal.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.770
And really, ahead of
women and businesspeople,

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.320
athletes having incorporated
these practices.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.460
I was in Los Angeles and
I met with Kobe Bryant

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.590
a couple of weeks ago.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.480
And he was telling me how
he has a nap-- sometimes

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.500
a 90 minute nap before
he gets out to play.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.110
And that clears his
mind, de-stresses him,

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.680
and allows him to
be fully present.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.790
Now when he said Phil
Jackson, their coach,

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:58.740
started having them meditate
and do Tai Chi, and have naps,

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.870
they all kind of looked
at the him aghast.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.580
But he was like this amazing
coach, so they all did it.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:09.050
And then they began to see
the impact it had on them.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.130
So that's really why
there's absolutely

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:14.470
no contradiction
between the two.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.500
If we just lean in without
leaning back and recharging,

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.120
that's when we fall over.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.020
And you see so many women-- not
just my own experience-- look

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.030
at what happened
to Hilary Clinton.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.220
She literally collapsed, again
from exhaustion and burnout.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.140
And hers was more
serious-- ended up

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.480
with a clot in the brain.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.620
And you look around
and you see men

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.350
having heart attacks in their
'50s, high blood pressure,

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:46.380
and diabetes, pulmonary
embolisms-- all of these

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.780
are stress-related diseases.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.630
And 3/4 of our
health care costs now

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.900
are because of stress-related
chronic preventable diseases.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.100
So basically, what I'm saying
when it comes to women,

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:04.000
is women should not just want
to be at the top of the world.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.310
They also want to
change the world.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:10.380
Because the way it's been
working is not sustainable.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.540
BONITA STEWART: So
it's interesting.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.572
I started tracking, just
learning more about the sleep.

00:09:15.572 --> 00:09:17.030
And my husband
said, "I don't think

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.610
you're getting enough sleep."

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:19.330
And I said, "Aw."

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.940
But then you look at the data.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.680
And then the data tells
you in fact, you're not.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.590
But when you do, it just adds
so much to your well being.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.370
One of the things
Arianna, that you

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.660
talked about in the book, which
I think just made me smile,

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.000
because I think we all can
hearken back to our childhood,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.360
and when we did have
that sense of wonder.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.360
Can you just elaborate on
wonder and how we can actually

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.800
bring that back into our lives.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.682
Because I thought that was an
interesting aspect of the book.

00:09:53.682 --> 00:09:55.140
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Well thank you.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.970
Because I actually love
that chapter particularly,

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:04.510
because everybody here--
let's just take everybody

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.720
in the room-- is really curious.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.220
Right?

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.860
You wouldn't be here
if you were not.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.560
You are curious about
everything, from whatever you

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.480
can Google, and any
amount of big data,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:20.430
to finding out
about Mars or Venus.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:24.670
But we're not really
particularly curious

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:28.420
how about our inner
space, our inner space

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.805
exploration of who are we?

00:10:29.805 --> 00:10:31.580
Why are we here?

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.995
And why do we die?

00:10:32.995 --> 00:10:35.000
You know, all these
questions, I find

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.270
them completely fascinating.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:42.050
And I have a lot of friends
who find them fascinating.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.670
So we have a lot of
these conversations.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:49.680
And if you think of it as
The Onion headline put it--

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.645
death rate holds steady at 100%.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.300
So much though we want to
ignore it, it's a reality.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:04.150
And when somebody dies
who is close to us,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.230
it makes us often
look at our lives

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.140
and really kind of recalibrate.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.860
I was meeting with Jared Cohen
upstairs before I came down.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.370
And we were talking about that.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:17.070
And he told me when Michael
Hastings died suddenly

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.560
in a car crash, and was his
age-- 31 I think when he died.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.610
Jared is 32 now.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:28.160
He said it made him just
recalibrate his own life.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.970
It made him prioritize
friendships, for example.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.090
And whatever impact it
has on each one of us.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.700
So I think these
are conversations

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:41.490
which make us reintegrate the
sense of wonder and mystery

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:42.100
about life.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.910
Wherever we are in the spectrum
of religion and spiritually

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:45.600
doesn't matter.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.350
I have friends of mine
who are religious,

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.290
and friends of mine who
are complete atheists.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.480
As Reid Hoffman calls
himself-- a mystical atheist.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.210
He says, "I'm an
atheist, but I'm

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.950
very aware of the
mystery of life.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.410
I'm very aware that there's
a lot I don't understand.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.940
And I like the exploration."

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.260
So I like the exploration.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.070
And I like the
conversation around it,

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:15.850
because I feel it enriches life
and opens up our perception

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.340
to things that
otherwise we would miss.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.700
That's why I have a section in
that chapter on coincidences,

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.500
because a lot of
people-- even people are

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.100
complete atheists who don't
think there's anything

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.100
to life beyond what we see and
touch and feel and smell-- they

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:36.700
love coincidences because it
sort of makes us stop and feel,

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.510
is there some kind
of hidden purpose

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.920
to what's happening
in our lives?

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.720
Because this coincidence
is absolutely amazing.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.040
And some of them are
trivial coincidences,

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.930
I have some of them in the
book too, and some of them

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:49.590
are significant coincidences.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:54.350
But I remember I mention a
trivial coincidence, when there

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.200
was somebody taking
a survey at a mall

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.910
and asks people to give
them their numbers.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:09.840
And one person gave him a
number that he made up--

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.220
the phone number.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.970
And the server said,
"That's not your number."

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.010
And the guy said, "Why
isn't it my number?"

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:20.740
He said, "Because
that's my number."

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.070
And so it suddenly stops you.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.200
I doesn't mean anything,
but it stops you,

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.360
because what is the
probability of this happening?

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.830
So when things happen that have
an incredibly astronomically

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:36.120
high probability
of them happening,

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:41.140
it stops us and makes
us just look at life,

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.740
and look at the possibility
that maybe there

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.190
is some kind of hidden
purpose and maybe even

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.550
somebody with a sense
of humor behind it.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.550
BONITA STEWART: So why
don't we start lining up,

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.900
because I know many of you
have questions in the room.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.930
And I'm going to go
through the Dory questions.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.554
But start thinking
about your questions

00:14:00.554 --> 00:14:01.590
and line up at the mics.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.510
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: And
while we're doing that,

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.700
can I ask you a question?

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.160
BONITA STEWART: Sure.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:04.660
Of course.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:08.320
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Because
we did an interview with you

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.500
for The Huffington Post.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.360
And you had something
very interesting.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.630
I don't know if
everybody here knows

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.050
that Bonita is a ballet dancer.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:20.840
And when you were in
ballet practice one day--

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.450
you said normally you don't
bring your smartphone in,

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.260
this is your sacred time.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.040
But one day you just
looked at your smartphone,

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.940
and the minute you looked
at your smartphone,

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.250
your whole work life included
into that sacred space.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.650
And the rest of the time
you could not be as present.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:42.820
And I think that's just
a great example of why

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.970
it's important for us
to create those spaces

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.960
where we disconnect
from our technology

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.950
and reconnect with
ourselves or our loved ones,

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.590
or the present moment.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.176
And I just loved the story.

00:14:56.176 --> 00:14:57.800
You can tell us a
little more about it.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.420
BONITA STEWART: Yeah,
so I've shared this.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.240
But I do take ballet class.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.980
And I just decided
during the break--

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.615
once you leave, you do the
floor, and then you leave.

00:15:09.615 --> 00:15:11.240
And you take a break
and you come back,

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.010
and you do the combination.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:17.770
And so I looked at my phone,
and I had received a call,

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:23.590
and it just changed everything
about the rest of the class.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.990
I couldn't do my pirouette.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.270
I wasn't focusing
on the combination.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.170
I just decided at
that point this

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.700
is the one thing that
is so important to me--

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.790
this is my sacred space.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:40.500
And I'm not going to let
technology invade my space when

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.140
I'm taking ballet.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.540
So I just, I made
that as a point.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.950
And I do think that all of us
have to-- especially when we're

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.780
24/7 in many cases
with technology--

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.080
we do have to be very
conscious about making sure

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.700
that we do have a sacred space.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.937
So what is yours, Arianna?

00:15:58.937 --> 00:16:00.520
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
So my sacred space

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.869
is first of all, at night--
and this is one of the 12 steps

00:16:03.869 --> 00:16:04.660
I have in the book.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.180
I have 12 steps that I
recommend for people.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.230
And I picked 12
deliberately because we

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:13.910
are addicted to this current
way of being perpetually on,

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.700
and even addicted to burnout.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.727
So the first step for
me is picking a time

00:16:21.727 --> 00:16:25.570
at the end of my day when
I turn off all my devices

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:27.870
and gently escort them
out of my bedroom.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:36.190
Because if I keep my iPhone,
say, charging by my bed,

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.760
and I wake up in the middle of
the night for whatever reason,

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.470
I'm going to be tempted
to look at my data.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.740
And I don't want my day life
to intrude into my night life.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.650
I want to wake up fully charged.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:50.941
Because again, the science shows
that if you look at your data

00:16:50.941 --> 00:16:52.440
in the middle of
the night, A-- it's

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.420
going to take you longer
to go back to sleep.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.910
And when you go back to sleep,
it's not going to be as deep

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:02.250
and recharging, because your
brain has started already

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:06.385
processing things you
have to do during the day.

00:17:06.385 --> 00:17:08.510
BONITA STEWART: So let's
take some of the questions

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:09.369
from the Dory.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:12.849
So one question we
actually covered,

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:15.339
just Cheryl's book
in terms of lean in,

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:17.569
but what kind of
meditation do you practice?

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.910
And you have a specific
mantra or mantras

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.660
that you come back to
in times of high stress?

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.640
So what do you do in
those high stress times?

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.630
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: So
I now meditate every day

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.740
in the morning for about 20
minutes, sometimes longer If I

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:34.490
can.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:38.340
But in the book I recommend that
you start with five minutes,

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.880
because everybody
has five minutes.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.510
And to remember
one thing-- there

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.680
is no wrong way to meditate.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.550
Because everybody here
is a perfectionist.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:52.090
You want to do everything right.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.230
So that's where you
have to surrender.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:57.350
All you have to do is
give yourself five minutes

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.920
and concentrate on your breath.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.070
I have specific
steps in the book,

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.310
but you don't even have
to worry about a mantra.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.580
You can just focus on the
inhalation and exhalation

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.650
I also have an appendix
with 12 meditation apps.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.810
I know it's a paradox
to use technology

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.870
to help us disconnect
from technology,

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.015
but hey, whatever it takes.

00:18:20.015 --> 00:18:24.100
So I have picked my 12
favorite meditation apps,

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.510
if you want to be walked
through a meditation.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.540
One of my favorites
is Headspace.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.620
Is anybody here on Headspace?

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:36.620
It's a really great app that
was created by an Englishman who

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.520
then became a Buddhist monk,
and then became a juggler.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:44.610
And it's really great.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:50.430
And now you know, it's really
become very popular in England.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.110
Even the Bank of
England is using

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.780
it, which is part of the
amazing thing that has happened.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:01.300
In 2013, meditation
became mainstream.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.910
And CEO's started coming out
not as being gay, but as being

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.480
meditators.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.160
Like Ray Dalio, the co-founder
of one of the biggest hedge

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.580
funds, Bridgewater,
came out saying

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.410
I've been meditating
for 35 years.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.800
And I consider it the
foundation of my success.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.790
Mark Benioff, the
CEO of Salesforce.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.420
Mark Bertolini,
the CEO of Aetna.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.830
It is really truly amazing.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:29.140
In Davos last year
there were 27 sessions

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:34.060
who CEO's about meditation,
mindfulness, et cetera.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:41.290
Just amazing shift in the
zeitgeist around these issues.

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.290
BONITA STEWART: MIchael.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:43.630
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Bonita.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:44.270
Hi Arianna.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.520
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Can we
put the lights up a little,

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.011
so I can see you?

00:19:48.011 --> 00:19:52.089
I mean, I can see Michael, but
I'd like to see everybody else.

00:19:52.089 --> 00:19:54.130
AUDIENCE: Well It's a
pleasure to meet you, and--

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:54.620
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Michael, actually what

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.770
would be great if you
tell us what you do,

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.635
and also if you
have a sacred space.

00:19:58.635 --> 00:19:59.260
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.950
OK.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:01.840
Yeah.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.010
My name is Michael Peggs.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:05.460
I've been at Google
for 4 and 1/2 years.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.660
I work in the online
partnership group.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.090
We're essentially responsible
for selling AdSense,

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.210
ad exchange, double click, a
lost of sales type products

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.920
here.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.110
I started in Mountain View.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.780
And I came to New York
2 and 1/2 years ago.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.350
My sacred space.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.700
I do enjoy a drink
on the weekend.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.370
So probably any bar.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.840
But honestly--

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.602
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
What's your sacred drink?

00:20:31.602 --> 00:20:33.310
AUDIENCE: I'm into my
whiskies right now.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.497
But um-- my sacred
space is probably

00:20:36.497 --> 00:20:38.580
either in Tompkins Square
Park, near where I live.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.210
Or kind of Central Park
with a book of my hand,

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.310
just people watching.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.350
New York is great for that.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.730
But my question is,
I think a lot of us

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.530
do seek the conventional
types of success,

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.440
and arguably they
allow you space

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.430
for kind of the third
leg, if you will.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.170
I'm wondering as you were
building your business,

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.300
looking back, could
you have built it

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.910
to the success it is now with
seven, eight hours of sleep?

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:05.710
I think there's this
constant hustle we all

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.730
feel, where it's this kind of
need to work harder and more

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:10.249
often.

00:21:10.249 --> 00:21:12.540
Could you have built the
Huffington Post and you empire

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.180
to what it is now on seven
to eight hours of sleep?

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.500
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Well, great question.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.080
And I would say
categorically, yes.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.390
In fact, most of the success
of the Huffington Post

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:28.820
has been built after my wake up
call, in the last seven years.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:29.480
We are nine.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.850
Years old.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:34.210
And I can say
categorically, looking back,

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.590
that the most
important thing you

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.310
can do for a
business, whether it's

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:43.370
a startup or a big
businesses, is having clarity

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.240
about your vision of
where you're going.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:49.030
And for me, it was
very clear for example,

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.720
between the two grow
internationally,

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.640
and this would have
to become a priority,

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.770
and to do it in a way
that would be fast,

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.470
which meant with
partners in each country.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.760
We are now in 11 countries.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.410
We're going to be launching
in India and the Middle East

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:05.022
in the fall.

00:22:05.022 --> 00:22:06.980
And we're also going to
be launching in Greece,

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.270
that I'm very excited about.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.190
Because I'm Greek, in
case you hadn't noticed.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:13.660
This accent is for real.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:18.190
And I really believe that having
absolute clarity about where

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:25.160
you're going is often a function
of operating from a place where

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.490
you are connected to your own
wisdom and a place of insight.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:32.120
And I really believe that
about leadership too.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.110
President Clinton
is quoted in my book

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.710
saying, "The most important
mistakes I made in my life,

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:38.930
I made when I was tired."

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.540
He did not specify
what mistakes.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.290
But in our own ways,
we can all say that.

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:52.980
And everybody who works here,
I mean basically, you're

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.520
not paid for your stamina, you
are paid for your judgment.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.870
And ultimately you are
paid for your good ideas.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.240
A good idea is worth everything.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.330
And the evidence is
overwhelming that you're not

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:07.190
going to have a lot of good
ideas if you are burnt out.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.910
You can still operate,
and process things,

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.570
and work through your
email box, et cetera.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.970
But your function is going to
be more transactional and less

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:17.080
creative.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.590
So increasingly now, as we
all have so many machines

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:24.050
to do a lot of the work
that human beings used

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:30.650
to do, partly thanks to
Google, we now in fact,

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:34.920
have an even greater
opportunity to be creative,

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.720
and therefore a
much greater need

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.837
to connect to that place in
us from which we are creative.

00:23:40.837 --> 00:23:41.670
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:42.920
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Thank you.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.723
And please write
about Tompkin's Park.

00:23:44.723 --> 00:23:46.820
In fact, I want to
invite all of you

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.080
to write-- tell your
stories of burnout,

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:54.280
wake up calls, sacred
spaces, anything you want.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.410
We'll have a hashtag campaign.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.320
Hashtag how I thrive.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.760
The reason for that
is that I really

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.790
believe that we can
get to the point

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:08.385
where we can prevent a lot of
people having their own wake

00:24:08.385 --> 00:24:09.200
up calls.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.240
We can learn from each
other's wake up calls.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.010
Why can't you learn from
mine, or Hilary Clinton's?

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.100
Why do have to have your own?

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:21.300
And also we can learn from
your story about the ballet.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:26.930
Or learn from your sacred
space, and get ideas

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.380
about what can help us thrive.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.280
And to make it super
easy, I'm going

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.890
to give you my
email address so you

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.600
can bypass the Huffington
Post bureaucracy.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.600
Arianna-- with one R and
two N's @huffingtonpost.com.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.800
One of the good things
about founding a company

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.480
is that you get the
good email address.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.120
AUDIENCE: Hi Arianna.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.390
I'm Desmonique Monet.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.980
I manage one of the sales teams
here in our New York office.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.180
I had the pleasure of seeing
you speak about two years ago,

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.520
maybe, at a leadership
event we did for women here

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.010
at Google when you had
your previous book in.

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:09.980
I went straight from that event
to one of my respites in Maui.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.140
I grew up in Hawaii.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.780
And had a long time to
think about the things you

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:18.460
shared with us there, and made
a lot of changes ex post facto.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:22.870
And one of the things that
I've been trying to think about

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:26.420
is how we-- those of us
who manage teams or lead

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.950
groups-- can take some of
the individual practices

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:33.020
that you share and
build kind of a team

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.190
or a group ethos around it.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:39.380
I'm curious as to maybe some
things you do with your teams

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.490
or the people who work
with you to build that

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:48.320
into the fabric of your company,
of those who report to you

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.730
and things of that nature.

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:50.130
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Great.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:51.800
Thank you so much
for the question.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.490
Absolutely.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:56.840
We are definitely implementing
a lot of these things

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.520
at Huff Post,
starting with the fact

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.820
that we have two nap rooms.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:07.150
And we have regular meditation,
yoga, breathing classes.

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:10.610
But also in terms of not
just my own leadership team,

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:14.040
but everybody in the company,
we have an email policy

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.320
which makes it clear
that people are not

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.350
expected to be on email
when they're off work.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:23.190
And the idea is if there's
something urgent that happens,

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:26.160
we can text them or call them.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.180
But otherwise, people
need predictable time off.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:36.880
And if they have to be on-- even
if nobody reaches out to them,

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.250
something is different.

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:40.650
You feel you have
to be checking.

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:43.750
You cannot really be
completely disconnected.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:47.000
So we found that
incredibly helpful.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.050
Also, I find that I have
regular walking meetings.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.130
Instead of having a
meeting in my office,

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.200
I just go for 20
minute, 30 minute

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:00.730
walk with whoever, one of my
editors or business leaders.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.360
And we just have our
meeting while walking.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.900
So I have a pair of
tennis shoes in my office.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.790
And it's just really great.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:14.900
It makes it a completely
concentrated conversation.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.920
The other thing that
we're just introducing

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.610
is unless you have a
specific reason why

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:24.835
you need to be on your device,
our meetings are device-free.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:30.400
I mean, my leadership
meetings went from one hour

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.720
to half an hour when I said
no devices in the meeting.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.950
We've given everybody
nice notebooks

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.450
where they can take
notes if they want.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.140
Does everybody
remember how to write?

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.280
So we are also creating
an well-being committee

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.090
with a lot of
companies, to learn

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:53.885
from each other in
terms of best practices.

00:27:53.885 --> 00:27:55.510
So I would love to
talk with you if you

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:59.710
want to be in touch about some
of the other best practices

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.060
that we are identifying
from different companies.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.830
And I love what you
have at Google--

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:07.040
Search Inside Yourself-- I
think it's a great program.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.140
And actually I just
joined the board of Search

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.870
Inside Yourself.

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:15.240
And I really love all the
work being done there.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.870
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.090
One of the things
we started doing

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:21.340
as a result of reading a
lot of what you share also

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:24.230
on your blog is no emailing
first thing in the morning,

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:27.020
and really starting
with strategy,

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.630
or just meditation, or
reflection, as opposed

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:32.411
to like getting right into that
pulse of the-- fight the email

00:28:32.411 --> 00:28:32.910
urge.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:33.630
So thank you.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:34.280
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
That is fantastic.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.430
That's major.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.420
Because again, there's
so much science

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:42.200
that shows that when you start
your day responding to emails,

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.310
you are basically allowing
other people to hijack your best

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:51.280
time-- the time when you
can be most creative.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.670
You're just becoming
reactive and responding

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.865
to what other people
consider their priorities.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.529
BONITA STEWART: Thanks
for that reminder.

00:29:01.529 --> 00:29:02.070
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.510
My name's Courtney and
I'm interning at Google.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:05.870
And this is my first internship.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:07.536
And I was wondering
what piece of advice

00:29:07.536 --> 00:29:10.070
you would give yourself
when you were starting out,

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.970
that you wish you had
known looking back.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:14.400
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Great.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.285
I would tell myself
to stop worrying.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.650
Because I was a big worrier.

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:26.900
I had this voice in my head that
I called the obnoxious roommate

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.630
living in my head
puts me down, that

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.660
has negative fantasies
about the future.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:39.850
And I think what I would
have told my young self is,

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:43.140
be in the moment and recognize.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.270
One of my favorite
quotes in the book

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:49.570
is by Rumi, the poet, who said
live life as though everything

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.792
is rigged in your favor.

00:29:51.792 --> 00:29:54.880
You know how often we
tend to live life thinking

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.960
that whatever
happens, immediately

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:02.820
we'll say just kind of life is
not fair, feeling kind of sorry

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.190
for ourselves.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:06.270
And when we look
back at our lives,

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:10.090
very often some of the
hardest things that happen

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.730
were the things that
opened other doors

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.500
and lead to other
wonderful things happening.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:19.390
I mean I have so many stories
like that in my own life.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:22.240
And I mention a few
of them in the book

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.970
just to remind all
of us that that's

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:27.299
the same truth for all of us.

00:30:27.299 --> 00:30:28.132
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:31.748 --> 00:30:34.096
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Steven.

00:30:34.096 --> 00:30:36.470
You talked a lot about sleep
and the importance of sleep.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:38.130
My happy place is right before--

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:39.110
BONITA STEWART:
Introduce yourself.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.830
AUDIENCE: Oh, I'm Steven.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.060
I work with DoubleClick.

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:45.390
And my happy place is
right before I fall asleep.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.450
So in the past I've
used some apps--

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:49.670
sleep cycle apps--
you give it a window

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:52.150
and it tries to wake you up
when you're in lighter sleep.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.070
Did you study any
of that, or have you

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.140
tried any of that
for waking up easier?

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.060
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
You mean to wake up

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.254
when you need to wake
up to start your day?

00:31:01.254 --> 00:31:02.170
Is that what you mean?

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:02.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.700
Well it works for naps too.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.640
But longer--

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.770
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Yeah.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:11.220
Well actually what
I recommend is

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:17.530
that you get enough sleep so
that you don't need an alarm.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:21.960
And really the science
shows that you can overeat,

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.400
but you cannot oversleep.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:30.410
So whatever the time is that
your body and your mind needs

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.060
is the time to give yourself.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.790
I mean, you know, it's not
going to happen every day.

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:37.460
I mean even with all the
evangelizing I'm doing,

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:42.060
I only get it done
about 90% of the time.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:44.160
And it doesn't matter
where you start.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.410
Maybe you'll get it
done 50% of the time.

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.105
There is no wrong
place to start.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:55.830
The important thing is that
where you want to end up in

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.380
is to be able to
wake up refreshed.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.380
And it's not really
as hard as you think,

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:08.200
because you are so much more
productive doing your day,

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.510
that you find that it
becomes easier and easier

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:14.320
to actually give
yourself that time.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:18.350
And you also learn
what to say no to.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:20.880
And in fact,
especially for women.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.950
I just want to remind you all
that no is a complete sentence.

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:30.270
And that again
helps you prioritize

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.930
what makes us more effective,
productive, and happier.

00:32:36.216 --> 00:32:37.090
AUDIENCE: Hi Arianna.

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:39.820
Let me bring this down since
I'm a little bit shorter

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.050
than other people commenting.

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:42.570
Thank you so much
for your comments.

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:43.390
I'm Ally Martucci.

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:46.180
I work on Bonita's team
on the DoubleClick.org

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.740
on the south side.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.500
And I think this is
incredibly time appropriate,

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.340
and it's just so refreshing
to hear an executive

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.420
at your level talking
about things like this.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:59.810
The idea that lean in is
not diametrically opposed

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.589
to this concept that you have to
lean back in order to lean in.

00:33:02.589 --> 00:33:03.380
I think it's great.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.150
I had a conversation this
morning with a colleague--

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.424
another Googler-- who
said that he actually

00:33:08.424 --> 00:33:09.840
spent a weekend
away with friends,

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.229
and they all put their phones
in boxes for the weekend.

00:33:12.229 --> 00:33:13.520
And I was like, that's amazing!

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.760
I'm going to do that,
and implement that.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.260
And I've already feel like a
few things you mentioned today,

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.000
not using your phone
in your bedroom.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.380
I use my phone as
my alarm clock,

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.305
which is clearly
not a great thing.

00:33:24.305 --> 00:33:28.540
But I'm curious about the wisdom
piece of what you talk about.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.460
Do you feel like you
actively seek out wisdom?

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:32.780
Is it a byproduct
of other things

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.237
that you do to seek out well
being and those quiet spaces

00:33:36.237 --> 00:33:38.570
in your life where you can
reflect and be more creative?

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:42.530
Or are you actively seeking
out people, places, things

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:45.547
that will drive more wisdom
into your life in general?

00:33:45.547 --> 00:33:46.630
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Great.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:49.230
First of all on the
alarm clock, you know,

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:52.935
Pottery Barn has some great
vintage-looking alarm clocks.

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:57.990
They cost $32.

00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:59.860
But they look great
on your nightstand.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:03.220
So anyway, if you wanted another
way to make sure you wake up,

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.020
take a look at that.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.260
Or you can put your
phone in another room

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.020
where you can still hear it.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.600
In terms of wisdom, yes.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:17.330
I feel that first of
all, if we recognize

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:22.560
that we have a place of wisdom
in us, every major religion

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.929
and many scientists have
talked about that place.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:29.190
I mean, Archimedes, the
Greek mathematician, said,

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:32.480
"Give me a place to stand,
and I can move the world."

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.198
And so we all have that place.

00:34:35.198 --> 00:34:37.239
It's just that most of
the time we are completely

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.330
disconnected from it.

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.550
So the first thing is that
we have our own inner wisdom.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:43.929
And we all are aware of it.

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:50.070
When we pay attention,
how much wiser

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:52.460
we will become about
people, about what we should

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.580
be doing next, then
when we're just

00:34:55.580 --> 00:35:00.070
rushing through and reacting
to what is happening.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:04.300
But also, I do
love reading books

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.810
of spirituality,
philosophy, poetry.

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:11.510
In fact, these are the
only books I read at night.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.810
And I read books at night.

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:15.180
I really like books.

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.670
I like learning them,
and underlining them,

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:21.220
and I like the
physicality of it.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:25.090
And also I like not bringing
screens to bed with me.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:27.790
So basically my bedroom
is a device-free zone.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.600
And also conversations
with people, absolutely.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:40.140
I particularly love talking to
scientists because for me it's

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.680
just really exciting that we
are living at this intersection

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.700
where modern science is
validating ancient wisdom.

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.440
Like somebody-- I
highly recommend

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.780
his work-- is Richard
Davidson, a professor

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:55.540
of neuroscience at the
University of Wisconsin, who

00:35:55.540 --> 00:36:01.370
has examined the brains of
meditating Buddhist monks,

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:04.110
and literally has put them
through MRI's, has put

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:06.790
electrodes on their
brains, and has seen

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:10.540
incredible amounts
of delta waves

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.400
that have to do with
creativity, happiness.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.020
So again, we have
a lot of data that

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:21.137
can help validate a
certain way of living.

00:36:21.137 --> 00:36:21.970
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:24.644 --> 00:36:25.560
AUDIENCE: Hi, Arianna.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.200
I'm Chalmers.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.100
I've been at Google
for about two years.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.350
I work on our hiring systems.

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:33.780
And my sacred space
is family game night.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:37.130
I don't let any electronics
intrude on family game night.

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:40.400
So what I was wondering was, we
talked a lot about all of this

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.580
in the context of our
professional lives.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.600
But Bonita shared with us
that you're also a mother.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.340
And I was wondering
what you've done

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:54.110
in terms of implementing this
in your own life as a parent,

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:57.380
and also in terms of
educational policy, right?

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:01.270
Because much of this
is very contra to what

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:04.700
we see in childhood
education today.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:05.700
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Yes.

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.860
First of all, my
youngest daughter--

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.970
I have two
daughters-- 23 and 25.

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:13.150
My youngest just
graduated in art history.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:17.632
But before they went to
college, and whenever

00:37:17.632 --> 00:37:19.590
we would have a meal when
they were in college,

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:24.040
we definitely had a policy
of no devices during meals.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.530
And I think it's
really important

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:28.200
to institute with your
children, the younger they are,

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.270
the better.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.940
Because we see
what's happening now.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.790
We go to restaurants and
we see children, really

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:36.700
being with other
children, and they

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.270
start texting across the table.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:41.800
And that is a lot
of consequences

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.030
in how their brain develops,
how empathy develops,

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.740
so that's really important.

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.600
What has happened
with my own daughters

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.240
is that they have become real
kind of for believers now.

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:57.250
And we are each other's
set of support buddies when

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:00.030
it comes to
sleeping, meditating,

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.290
taking time for renewal.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:05.350
And it's really
fascinating to see

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:08.330
how-- if anybody here has
been through AA, you know,

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:12.720
you have your sponsors-- so we
are like each other's sponsors.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:18.180
Like the other day, my
daughter was kind of

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:23.240
tempted to binge-watch
House of Cards.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.340
So she called me up,
and I talked her down.

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:34.650
It's actually good to find-- we
call them also thrive buddies.

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:36.860
It's good to find
a thrive buddy,

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:39.150
when you decide to
make any change.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:43.450
And I recommend starting with
small, microscopic changes,

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:46.160
whatever you choose
of the twelve steps.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:50.200
And whenever you begin on a
change, partner with somebody.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.990
And then it's easier
to support each other,

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:54.940
to celebrate when
you're doing it,

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.780
and to not judge yourselves,
but help each other

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.285
when you backtrack.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.870
BONITA STEWART: Thank you.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:06.040
AUDIENCE: Hi Arianna.

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.260
I'm Holly.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.600
And I'm based here in New York
for at least another couple

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.196
of days.

00:39:11.196 --> 00:39:12.820
I'm working on the
agency team, but I'm

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.730
headed to Mountain
View for a new role

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.014
next week, working on
the marketing team.

00:39:18.014 --> 00:39:18.930
Thanks for being here.

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:20.820
You're a major inspiration.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:23.650
And I have a question
about vacation.

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:26.080
And I worked for a couple
of years in the UK,

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:30.850
where I realized that they
have a standard of taking

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:31.760
a month off.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.690
They'll take the whole
month of August off,

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:36.680
and it's just kind of
par for the course.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:40.300
And that was just so foreign to
me, literally and figuratively.

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.160
And then coming back
here to the states,

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.740
it's kind of an adjustment.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.740
Like we apologize for taking
two weeks-- a whole two weeks--

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.850
we feel guilty.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:51.970
We stay connected
to our devices.

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.500
Are we taking enough
vacation time here?

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.180
And this is not kind of
a Google-- sort of like,

00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:01.920
I'm not angling for
anything here at the moment.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:05.760
I don't know if anyone
from HR is in the room.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:10.450
But really, are we giving
ourselves enough away time?

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:13.560
And those little moments
that we're taking,

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:16.520
obviously so important,
walk in Central Park or time

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.330
with a book.

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:19.580
But how about just
a change of scene?

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:22.190
Do the Europeans know
something we don't know?

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:24.560
And do you think that
the winds of change

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.790
are blowing here into
the states eventually?

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:28.172
Or are we getting enough?

00:40:28.172 --> 00:40:29.630
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Great question.

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.790
And in fact, I wrote a
blog post about it today

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:34.940
that is on the Huffington Post.

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:39.100
And the title is Lincoln,
FDR, and the Power

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.800
of a Good Vacation.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:50.054
Because FDR, after he was
elected for the third time,

00:40:50.054 --> 00:40:51.470
there was a lot
of pressure on him

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:55.150
to make a decision on
what would the states do

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:56.880
regarding the second World War.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.510
There was a lot of
pressure from Churchill,

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:03.340
from England for
states to intervene.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.830
The American public was
completely opposed to it.

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:10.420
So he had this very big,
difficult decision to make.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.930
And everybody wanted
him to make it

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:13.440
right away after the election.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:18.880
Instead, he took 10 days off
and went to the Caribbean.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:23.000
And during that time, he
came up with what turned out

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.540
to be a brilliant idea
of a land lease policy,

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:29.200
whereby America
would enter the war,

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.770
but basically it
would be a lease

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.290
in terms of the
funding from the UK.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:38.640
Anyway, a complicated idea which
the American public bought,

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:43.560
and allowed America
to enter the war.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.750
And this would be
really difficult now.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:50.710
It would be really
difficult for a president

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:53.504
to take two days off.

00:41:53.504 --> 00:41:55.170
I mean, you see
immediately, immediately

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:59.700
it was announced the President
is going to Martha's Vineyard,

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.290
the criticism starts.

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:07.650
And there is a very
big truth to the need

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:10.380
for completely
disconnecting, and what

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:14.060
that does to our health,
our mental clarity,

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.980
our ability to come
up with great ideas.

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:18.430
And I agree with you.

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:20.300
I think it's very
important first

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:24.330
of all, that everybody
takes their full vacation.

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:29.440
Because Americans are at the
bottom of the list in terms

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:33.520
of actually taking the
vacation that people are due.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.050
I don't know what you have here.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:38.310
We give three weeks vacation.

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:41.490
And we tell people
they have to take it.

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:43.650
And that it's really
important when

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:46.750
you take a vacation,
to really disconnect.

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:50.680
And I set an example of a
Christmas when I was away.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.280
I got together with two
friends-- Mika Brzezinski

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.150
and Cindy Lieber.

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:56.600
We were in different
parts vacationing.

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.980
But we all agreed to
do a digital detox

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:04.360
for a week, where I checked
in with the office just twice

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.000
a day.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.430
And other than that, I
was completely off email.

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:11.730
So whatever you
need to do to have

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:14.160
as much complete
disconnection as possible,

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:18.030
because 56% of people return
from vacation more exhausted

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:20.610
than before.

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:22.670
Because they tried
to be on vacation,

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:26.840
be with their families, and
stay connected to their office.

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.510
So absolutely, we need
to rethink vacations

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:37.450
and how important they are to
the way we function in our work

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:39.415
as well as in our lives.

00:43:39.415 --> 00:43:42.410
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:44.170
AUDIENCE: Hi, Arianna.

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:45.460
My name is Jason Vee.

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:49.220
I work under Bonita's org in
the entertainment and music

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:51.360
partnerships team.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.720
My question to you
is about gender.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:59.210
In terms of the tips that
you've outlined for thriving,

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:01.630
do you think that there are
any fundamental differences

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:08.110
or tweaks for a man
looking at leaning back

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:10.830
to be able to lean in further
and become successful,

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:12.799
or are all these
concepts that you're

00:44:12.799 --> 00:44:14.590
talking about from a
scientific perspective

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:17.580
and your own perspectives,
complete gender neutral?

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.000
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Completely gender neutral.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.970
Absolutely no difference.

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:27.560
I think men and women need this.

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.600
I mean every sex needs
them as much as the other.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:31.660
How many sexes are there?

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:34.570
Only two.

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.290
It doesn't matter
what sex you are.

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:40.550
The problem is that sleep
deprivation and burnout

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:44.800
have become a kind of
macho badge of honor.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.000
So sometimes men
have a harder time

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.180
incorporating these new ideas.

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.960
But if any man has a
hard time incorporating,

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:55.040
they should look at athletes.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:00.970
They should look at what
LeBron James or Richard Sherman

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:05.090
from the Seattle Seahawks are
doing around sleep, meditation,

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:08.320
and all these things, and how
they actually consider them

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.630
performance enhancement tools.

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:14.300
And just one of the
image for the men who

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:21.500
have a harder time disconnecting
and allowing themselves to have

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:27.910
time for renewal, is to watch an
interview that Charlie Rose did

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:30.830
with Andy Murray, you
know, the tennis player.

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.310
And Andy Murray was
talking about how

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:37.070
when he's fully
recharged and rested,

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:41.510
the ball is coming at
him in slow motion.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:44.930
So he's in a place where
he can deal with it,

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:48.010
and have the clarity of
thought to make a decision,

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:50.670
because it's not coming
at him like that.

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:52.850
And I think it's a great
metaphor, because I

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:54.740
know when I'm
exhausted, everything

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:59.100
is coming at me all at
once, and it's overwhelming.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:01.070
And I get reactive.

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:06.520
And I'm not as able to
operate from my best, kind

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.818
of wiser self.

00:46:08.818 --> 00:46:11.500
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.680
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Jenna.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.263
I've been with Google
for three years,

00:46:14.263 --> 00:46:15.877
based in our Singapore office.

00:46:15.877 --> 00:46:18.210
And I've been tasked with
running around countries where

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:19.876
we don't have offices
in Southeast Asia,

00:46:19.876 --> 00:46:21.460
to figure out what
to do for Google.

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:23.840
So I spent most of my time
in Pakistan, Sri Lanka,

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.490
and Bangladesh.

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:27.850
These are some of the
most highly repressive,

00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:30.000
volatile, corrupt
countries in the world.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.440
I recently moved back to
join Jared Cohen's team.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.940
You mentioned the
Google Ideas team.

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:35.481
So I'm still operating
in that space.

00:46:35.481 --> 00:46:38.270
But I'm experiencing some
reverse culture shock.

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:40.640
We're noticing as I watch
the news, how frequently we

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:43.650
complain about first world
problems-- quote, unquote--

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:46.510
and how we can get overly
consumed with these issues

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:47.640
that only we face.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.920
Be it in New York or
in the United States.

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.790
And I'm wondering in your life,
as you've grown and developed

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:56.120
your wisdom and kept
yourself grounded, how do you

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.830
maintain this perspective?

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:00.830
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Well
maintaining perspective

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:05.990
is actually one of the best ways
to connect to our own wisdom.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:10.250
And looking at what's happening
in the rest of the world

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:13.880
is a great way to
maintain perspective.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:18.370
In the same way we talked
about death recently,

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:21.530
Socrates said
practice death daily.

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:23.910
He didn't mean it
in a morbid sense,

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:26.520
but he meant it in
the sense that when

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.520
we remember that
death is part of life.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.910
And when you go to
Pakistan or Sri Lanka,

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:38.610
and you see that death is much
more present in everyday life,

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:41.210
because of the
level of violence,

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:45.530
because of the level
of poverty, again, it

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:47.650
does put everything
in perspective.

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:53.490
And I think the amount
of worry that we

00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:59.390
bring to everyday issues that
don't deserve worry diminishes

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:01.510
when we have that
kind of perspective.

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:03.440
Let me just say one
other thing, which

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:08.150
is that everything we discussed
today, and everything in Thrive

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:12.620
applies just as much to
people in extreme adversity.

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:16.680
Because in fact, the more
adverse the circumstance

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:21.980
of your life, the more you need
to tap into your own resilience

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:26.120
to be able to survive,
and even thrive,

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.110
and transcend your
circumstances.

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:30.310
That's why in the
book I even include

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:33.850
examples of people in
concentration camps.

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:36.050
Because there are
people who are able to

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:40.850
transcend even the most
horrific circumstances.

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:48.360
And there are others who fall
apart when they lose a job.

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.470
In fact, there is a
very interesting study

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:53.320
in the book by the
University of Chicago,

00:48:53.320 --> 00:49:01.050
that tracked what happened
to thousands of people who

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:04.390
were fired by the
Illinois Bell Company.

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:08.140
One of the biggest corporate
downsizings in history.

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:14.210
And they followed them,
and 2/3 of them fell apart.

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:19.390
They became alcoholics,
they became depressed.

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:23.100
And 1/3 thrived and
went on to bigger jobs,

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.510
started their own company.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:32.470
So the same thing has a very
dramatically different impact

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:35.640
on different people depending
on how resilient and connected

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.620
with their own inner
strength and wisdom they are.

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:39.819
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:39.819 --> 00:49:42.110
BONITA STEWART: I think this
will be our last question.

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:42.760
Oh we have one more.

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:43.260
OK.

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.970
So these will be our
last two questions.

00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:47.940
And then we'll leave
a little bit of time

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:50.120
for you if you'd like
to have a book signed.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:50.953
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:50.953 --> 00:49:51.920
I'll make this quick.

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.060
My name is Justine.

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:54.560
I'm a community
manager for Google.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.268
I'm actually visiting
from Mountain View,

00:49:56.268 --> 00:49:58.100
so this is perfect
timing for me.

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:00.670
I'm curious-- you
just spoke about folks

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:02.951
who might be in
adverse circumstances,

00:50:02.951 --> 00:50:05.200
or need to be resilient, a
lot of people who might not

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.655
be connected to technology.

00:50:06.655 --> 00:50:08.280
I noticed a lot of
your advice revolves

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:10.140
around disconnecting
and unplugging.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.604
A lot of not using your
phone or closing a laptop

00:50:12.604 --> 00:50:13.270
during meetings.

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:15.492
So I'm curious to hear
what type of advice

00:50:15.492 --> 00:50:17.700
you have that doesn't
necessarily do with technology.

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.390
Something that might resonate
with someone who again, may not

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:22.780
have access to
internet or smartphone.

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.780
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Who
may not have access to--

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:25.700
AUDIENCE: Internet
or smartphone,

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.990
or other forms of technology
that sort of speaks

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:29.740
to a lot of the advice
that you're giving.

00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:30.440
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Absolutely.

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.490
So you're right.

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:36.920
I mean, technology is just
one aspect of our modern lives

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.700
that makes it harder to
connect with ourselves.

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:45.290
But we can have absolutely
no technology and still not

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:46.330
connect with ourselves.

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:49.930
We can find out other
avoidance measures.

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:56.630
And that's why I think leaving
aside technology, prioritizing

00:50:56.630 --> 00:51:00.240
sort of time when we
can have stillness

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:03.250
and silence in our lives,
even if it is five or 10

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:05.420
minutes that we
want to start with,

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:08.510
helps us connect with
that part of ourselves

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:11.490
that so often we are
disconnected from.

00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:14.410
And if you think
of human evolution,

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:17.490
we continue to evolve in
terms of our consciousness,

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:20.420
in terms of our thoughts,
in terms of our feelings.

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:26.200
And when we allow ourselves to
have that space in our lives,

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.130
it just dramatically
affects how we

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:32.070
respond to everything
that happens to us.

00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:35.100
And that's the same
in every culture.

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.825
In Japanese culture-- we just
launched the Huffington Post

00:51:37.825 --> 00:51:41.000
in Japan-- and
the concept of ma,

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.920
which literally
means pause, is just

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.600
an essential part
of the culture.

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.510
That's why you have
the tea ceremony, which

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:52.950
is a time where you pause from
whatever it is you're doing,

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:58.827
and just really allow that
sacred space in your day.

00:51:58.827 --> 00:51:59.660
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:00.070
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Thank you.

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:01.950
BONITA STEWART: And
our last question.

00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:03.130
AUDIENCE: Hi, Arianna.

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:04.720
Thank you for being here today.

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:07.170
You're a big
inspiration of mine.

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:09.160
I was very excited
to see that Bonita

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.400
had arranged this talk today.

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:12.590
So my name is Sophie.

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:18.540
I work in the agency
team for DoubleClick.

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:19.630
I come from France.

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:23.260
And in France the standards
are very different.

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:25.640
I thought that coming
over to the US-- I

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.620
really admired
Americans, because they

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:30.540
seem to be so much more
energized than we are.

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:32.160
They are on all the time.

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.220
And I just maybe I'm
not ambitious enough,

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:37.490
or maybe I'm not driven enough,
but I just think this is crazy.

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.520
And so I'm also part of
the Google Guides Taskforce

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:53.260
for our organization
within Google.

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:56.190
And basically
well-being and the fact

00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:57.770
that we are plugged
in all the time

00:52:57.770 --> 00:53:00.960
is one of our biggest concerns
across the board of our team.

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.440
And so we want to find ways
to basically change that.

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.350
But I find it although
at very high level,

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:08.660
like DT's, everybody
understands that.

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:11.970
I feel like when you drill down,
managers and directors, some

00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:13.970
of them really
don't see the point.

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:15.570
They think that it's
about being lazy,

00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:17.032
they think it's about you know--

00:53:17.032 --> 00:53:19.140
So I was wondering,
have you encountered

00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:20.990
this sort of resistance?

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:23.272
And how did you overcome it?

00:53:23.272 --> 00:53:24.980
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Great final question.

00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:27.646
First of all, let me
just say that the way we

00:53:27.646 --> 00:53:30.810
are living and working is crazy.

00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:32.530
So there's no
question about that.

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:34.750
It's like, I think
that as we are now

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:37.920
in a period of
transition, which I think

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.240
is going to be as
big when we look back

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:44.300
as moving from the Middle
Ages to the Renaissance.

00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:46.490
In the Middle Ages,
remember, people actually

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:51.630
did believe that the whole
world revolved around the Earth.

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:52.880
And they really believed that.

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:55.450
Now if somebody's
a flat-Earther,

00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:58.850
we don't think very
highly of them, right?

00:53:58.850 --> 00:54:01.430
So I think there
will come a day--

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:06.280
I hope soon-- when actually
the collective delusion

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.540
that burnout is the
only way to succeed

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:15.000
will be seen as completely
barbaric and completely also

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.700
unscientific.

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:20.960
But right now, we
see everything.

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:24.110
We see the resistance
that you're talking about.

00:54:24.110 --> 00:54:28.869
And we see early
adopters changing

00:54:28.869 --> 00:54:30.910
the way they are living,
not just for themselves,

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:33.600
but for their teams,
or their companies.

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.920
So we are living in this
period of transition,

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:39.612
where the reason for my
really wanting to be here,

00:54:39.612 --> 00:54:41.820
wanting to be speaking and
writing about these things

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:45.580
that I believe we can accelerate
the transition by sharing

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:47.970
our stories, and
by making people

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:50.570
realize that it's not laziness.

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:52.180
On the contrary,
the people who are

00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:54.305
going to be the most
creative, the people who

00:54:54.305 --> 00:54:57.500
are going to bring about
the most fundamental changes

00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:02.340
are people who learn to
disconnect, and reconnect

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:04.770
with themselves, their
wisdom, and strength.

00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:09.190
And so we need new role models.

00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:11.320
That's why for
example, I always talk

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:15.689
about people who are
successful, running big teams,

00:55:15.689 --> 00:55:16.730
but doing it differently.

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:18.840
And let me just
mention one of them.

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:20.530
Padmasree Warrior.

00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:23.500
She's the chief technology
officer of Cisco.

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.930
She oversees tens of
thousands of engineers.

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:29.790
We had her speak at
our Thrive conference.

00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:32.680
And she said, "I
sleep for eight hours.

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:34.430
I meditate every day.

00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:35.630
I paint.

00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:37.130
I do haiku.

00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:40.770
And every Saturday I
do a digital detox."

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:42.270
And it was amazing.

00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:43.970
She's an engineer.

00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:47.320
She's not lazy.

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.370
She's super successful.

00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:52.140
And she's doing it
a different way.

00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:55.600
So I think especially for
all the young people here,

00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:59.380
those still in college, we need
to publicize these role models.

00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:01.620
I've been talking about
her so much on my book

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:03.060
tour, that she
emailed me and said

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.550
Random House wants
her to do a book.

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:06.430
I said, great.

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:08.200
That's really what we need.

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:12.130
We need more and more people
to hear that there are new ways

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:15.170
to accomplish, to
achieve, to excel

00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:18.560
without burnout, and
without sacrificing

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:22.110
your health, your
relationships, and your life.

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:22.910
Thank you so much.

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:24.480
BONITA STEWART: Thank you.

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.530
[APPLAUSE]
