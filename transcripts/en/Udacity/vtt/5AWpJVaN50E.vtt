00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.313
All right.

00:00:01.313 --> 00:00:02.016
Hi, everyone,

00:00:02.016 --> 00:00:05.293
welcome to this week's introduction
of Programming Nanodegree webcasts.

00:00:05.293 --> 00:00:08.389
My name is Jonah,
I'm a co-chair at Udacity and

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.039
then over there in
mountain view we have.

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:17.885
&gt;&gt; Hi I'm Anthony also co-chair here.

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:22.860
Yeah, cool, so we're talking about
HTML validations, CSS validation.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.935
Why I should care about it and
how to do it?

00:00:26.935 --> 00:00:30.700
So first off, what is HTML validation?

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.390
So when people first thought of HTML,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.910
way back in the dark ages of the 90s,
like we can just write web pages.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.430
But the thing is everyone wrote web
pages maybe slightly differently.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.590
There was a general idea
of like using HTML tags but

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.140
then there are certain conventions and
things that not everyone follows.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.960
So people came together and
they decided on a set of rules and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.780
if your web page met all these
requirements rules it was validated and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.230
if it didn't than it
didn't need validation.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.300
Maybe your website still worked but
it had to meet all

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.403
the standards in order to be validated,
so why does that matter?

00:01:15.403 --> 00:01:18.236
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:18.236 --> 00:01:24.703
Why do you think HTML validation matters
Anthony, what's your perspective?

00:01:24.703 --> 00:01:28.599
&gt;&gt; Well I think it
matters the same way that

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:33.098
programming style
matters in any language.

00:01:33.098 --> 00:01:35.044
Why do you have to indent where
you have to indent Python?

00:01:35.044 --> 00:01:40.870
In Python, you have to indent where

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.800
you have to indent because
the code won't work.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.780
But that's born out of a convention
that came from C programming,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.820
Java programming lots of other
languages that say you have

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.469
an if statement you indent, you have
a function definition you indent.

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.330
&gt;&gt; Right.
Ultimately those sorts of rules

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.010
that maybe don't change
what a piece of code does.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.710
Those rules keep things consistent,
and it makes code more readable for

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.580
people regardless of whether it
says the same thing to a computer.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.880
I think an important thing to keep in
mind is that you're always writing code

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.830
for other people as well as you're
writing code for a future degree.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.520
&gt;&gt; Definitely.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.380
Yeah, so that's actually
a huge part of it is that

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.460
making things easier to
read is important and

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.672
also like professionalism is
also a really important thing.

00:02:32.672 --> 00:02:38.200
Imagine your website is like resident or
something, you send it into some line

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.670
and you know if you're applying
to a technical position,

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.830
they may look at your source code and
you're like!

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.180
Your indentation is all off.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.940
You have tags that
aren't closed properly.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.840
Maybe your website looks fine, but
if you have these little errors here and

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.350
there, it shows that you're
not careful about your code.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.740
So it's really important for
those type of situations as well.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.930
So I have a couple questions.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.154
And Peter, yes you are in the right
spot for HTML validations,

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:11.750
CSS validations we're
going to talk about today.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.640
And then for Abeegeef,
hope I'm pronouncing that right.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.790
And I think he just works.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.840
You go through the course
on you ask your website.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.823
You'll be submitting projects.

00:03:27.823 --> 00:03:32.605
If you want to interact with the course
instructors you can schedule one

00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:37.000
on one's through our website and
we'll talk with you one on one.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.594
And help you through
reviewing your code,

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:43.992
answering confusing questions and
whenever you submit your projects,

00:03:43.992 --> 00:03:47.832
you'll get feedback on whether
you meet requirements or not.

00:03:47.832 --> 00:03:53.510
If you have any further questions
you can ask us in a side window.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.600
So let's dive in and
then I think the best, sorry?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.744
&gt;&gt; I said let's do some HTML.

00:04:01.744 --> 00:04:05.365
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
actually I used one that you've created.

00:04:05.365 --> 00:04:07.196
I'm going to start sharing my screen.

00:04:07.196 --> 00:04:09.932
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:04:09.932 --> 00:04:10.851
Okay.

00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:14.472
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:04:14.472 --> 00:04:16.325
Where is it?

00:04:16.325 --> 00:04:17.605
Cool there you are.

00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:26.197
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:04:26.197 --> 00:04:32.640
Create can everybody see my screen?

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.832
&gt;&gt; In just black right
now the second but

00:04:37.832 --> 00:04:42.363
you were just there in a second.

00:04:42.363 --> 00:04:44.545
Nope I'm just seeing a black screen.

00:04:44.545 --> 00:04:52.205
&gt;&gt; Black screen, okay.

00:04:52.205 --> 00:04:54.161
Let me stop screen sharing and
start again.

00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:57.059
All right.
You see me?

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:00.271
No you don't.

00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:05.147
A lot a
&gt;&gt; No just a black screen over here.

00:05:05.147 --> 00:05:07.236
&gt;&gt; Let me try showing the whole screen.

00:05:07.236 --> 00:05:08.423
&gt;&gt; Yeah I looked at that.

00:05:08.423 --> 00:05:10.318
I'm not finicky.

00:05:10.318 --> 00:05:13.095
I'm also not seeing you when
you stop screen sharing.

00:05:13.095 --> 00:05:15.006
&gt;&gt; That's weird.

00:05:15.006 --> 00:05:18.218
&gt;&gt; Yeah I've never seen that before.

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:22.473
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:05:22.473 --> 00:05:25.316
You see me now?

00:05:25.316 --> 00:05:26.918
&gt;&gt; Nope.

00:05:26.918 --> 00:05:29.671
&gt;&gt; See my screen now?
&gt;&gt; Nope

00:05:29.671 --> 00:05:32.175
&gt;&gt; Can anyone who is watching see my

00:05:32.175 --> 00:05:32.924
screen?

00:05:32.924 --> 00:05:34.475
That's not Anthony.

00:05:34.475 --> 00:05:43.265
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:05:43.265 --> 00:05:45.663
Well, that's an issue.

00:05:45.663 --> 00:05:47.201
&gt;&gt; What happens if you do it live?

00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:48.809
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; All right, Anthony.

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:51.225
I'm going to close out this window.

00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:54.260
In the mean time you can entertain
our students I'll be right back.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:04.260
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:43.669
All right you're back.

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.251
That's weird.

00:06:47.251 --> 00:06:48.445
We can't hear you.

00:06:48.445 --> 00:06:58.445
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:07:01.825 --> 00:07:08.424
That's very good we'll hang here
by the week It's getting bad

00:07:08.424 --> 00:07:18.424
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.559
&gt;&gt; All right, how about now?

00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:36.712
&gt;&gt; Yep, I can hear you.

00:07:36.712 --> 00:07:40.003
&gt;&gt; All right, I guess there's two of us.

00:07:40.003 --> 00:07:40.903
That's weird.

00:07:40.903 --> 00:07:44.577
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
your evil clone decided to join too.

00:07:44.577 --> 00:07:46.395
&gt;&gt; Yeah, he's probably what's
causing this whole thing.

00:07:46.395 --> 00:07:49.585
&gt;&gt; All right, You see my screen now.

00:07:49.585 --> 00:07:50.438
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:07:50.438 --> 00:07:53.171
&gt;&gt; Yeah all right cool.

00:07:53.171 --> 00:07:55.299
So.

00:07:55.299 --> 00:07:59.472
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:07:59.472 --> 00:08:00.923
There it is.

00:08:00.923 --> 00:08:05.023
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:08:05.023 --> 00:08:07.823
Turn the notification off.

00:08:07.823 --> 00:08:12.653
All right so we have this HTML,
which, Anthony,

00:08:12.653 --> 00:08:18.180
you might recognize, and
actually it looks fine so far.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.540
All the colors are showing up.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:30.464
Tags like mostly right but
it's a different story in reality.

00:08:30.464 --> 00:08:34.871
So, it's pretty simple to do so

00:08:34.871 --> 00:08:39.607
if you want to validate some HTML you

00:08:39.607 --> 00:08:44.996
want to just select
everything copy it so

00:08:44.996 --> 00:08:50.219
copy and then we go to our best friend,

00:08:50.219 --> 00:08:53.184
the W3C validator.

00:08:53.184 --> 00:08:58.171
We will validate it by direct input
which means we're just going to type

00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:03.595
directly in less typing in just copy and
paste everything and I'll check it.

00:09:03.595 --> 00:09:08.885
So actually went through and
completely messed this

00:09:08.885 --> 00:09:15.267
up I noticed that when we validate it,
we have bunch of errors.

00:09:15.267 --> 00:09:16.730
&gt;&gt; On 23 of them.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's really nice.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:25.060
You can go through this and you'll see
that every error gets highlighted here.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:30.306
And we're going to go through and
explain what these are one by one.

00:09:30.306 --> 00:09:33.890
So the first one is,

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.450
the element ul is not allowed as
child element of ul in this context.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:44.944
So, this means you have this
tag which is an ordered list.

00:09:44.944 --> 00:09:51.717
&gt;&gt; So, bulleted list doesn't
have a number un ordered.

00:09:51.717 --> 00:09:57.594
&gt;&gt; Exactly so if you want to create
a list, you do this and then and

00:09:57.594 --> 00:10:04.390
you do like li and elements of that
list and then sometimes I see a slide.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.980
So, I'll try to create
a list within a list.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:14.050
That's fine but
you have to create it as child of li.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:21.160
So, let's go to our,
so this is on line 24.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:26.763
So go to line, actually let's do this.

00:10:26.763 --> 00:10:29.200
And it's cool.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.010
Actually that's not good.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.477
Let's not do that.

00:10:33.477 --> 00:10:35.959
&gt;&gt; Hide back to review.

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:38.525
&gt;&gt; To review, all right.

00:10:38.525 --> 00:10:39.168
How do I hide that?

00:10:39.168 --> 00:10:45.962
&gt;&gt; Then back to the review
you can hide the side bar.

00:10:45.962 --> 00:10:50.370
That helps, that's enough, cool.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:56.660
So let's look at line 24 and we see
this ul here and that's the culprit.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.470
But if we want to create another
unordered list within the list element,

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.870
we have to do it within
another list element.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:12.180
We'll create li and ul here,
it really helps to be to invent things.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:20.407
Then you want to create
another list in there

00:11:20.407 --> 00:11:24.970
like this is deeper level inception and

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:31.898
then close those tags that's
how you get list within list.

00:11:31.898 --> 00:11:37.271
You don't want to just
throw uls really in there

00:11:37.271 --> 00:11:42.100
because you'll end up having problems.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.268
So that fixes that one,
hopefully I think.

00:11:46.268 --> 00:11:51.795
&gt;&gt; I think it only but
I think it sort of makes sense when

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:57.850
you think that a lists only
children could be list elements.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:58.350
Right?

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.950
&gt;&gt; And then just remember that
those list elements could contain

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.000
whatever you want.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.761
&gt;&gt; Right.
Exactly.

00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:09.430
Yeah that's good way of putting
it because these on our list.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:14.530
The children unless they're on
our list as very it's children.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:20.650
It can't be anything but otherwise
elements it's a really mean step

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:29.190
parent and yeah but if you have
another list inside the list element.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.280
They'll take whatever,
you put like images in here,

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.140
don't do that but you can.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:41.830
So, for line 28,
we have another issue here.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.326
Actually I messed everything up
because I've put some new lines and so

00:12:45.326 --> 00:12:47.112
I'm going to re-validate this stuff

00:12:47.112 --> 00:12:54.804
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:12:54.804 --> 00:12:56.050
And okay, cool.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.210
So now I have a bunch of different ones.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.379
So I fixed all those, and
we have some new areas popping up.

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:01.680
You'll see this happen.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.950
You'll fix one error, and
maybe something that was depending on it

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:11.760
goes wrong or something goes right,
and it will end up fixing itself.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:18.829
But now we see you don't have
any errors until line 116.

00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:22.556
And says [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; The weird thing about like,

00:13:22.556 --> 00:13:26.499
the logic of code and
especially, a validation like,

00:13:26.499 --> 00:13:29.680
things can depend on
your unintended bugs.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.350
Which.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.870
&gt;&gt; Can cause further bugs.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:34.640
So it's a weird phenomenon.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.194
&gt;&gt; So
I think we have some questions here.

00:13:38.194 --> 00:13:39.865
Or are those from before?

00:13:39.865 --> 00:13:40.581
&gt;&gt; Those are before.

00:13:40.581 --> 00:13:43.875
That's just David and
Peter saying they couldn't see you.

00:13:43.875 --> 00:13:45.701
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.

00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:46.653
Let me just throw that out.

00:13:46.653 --> 00:13:48.448
All right.

00:13:48.448 --> 00:13:52.807
So now, let's angle bracket
when expecting attribute

00:13:52.807 --> 00:13:56.711
name probable cause using
right angle brackets.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:14:01.412
So, sometimes they'll give you
suggestions of what's going wrong and

00:14:01.412 --> 00:14:06.480
that looks like that is an issue we
are missing a right angle bracket here.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.940
So, .HTML is really unique.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.880
You need to make sure that everything
has angle brackets properly put in.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:19.970
And make sure that every tag
that you open is closed,

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:23.320
unless it's the kind of element
that doesn't need to be closed.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.069
What's an an example of an element?

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.102
I guess images tags.

00:14:31.102 --> 00:14:33.470
&gt;&gt; Image tags, the language tag.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:40.965
I mean those are the common lines.

00:14:40.965 --> 00:14:45.727
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's about it so
we fixed that, then on line 16,

00:14:45.727 --> 00:14:51.280
we have slash is not immediately
followed by a right angle bracket.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.252
That was probably
the same error as before.

00:14:56.252 --> 00:15:00.450
And then we have this error,
end tag had attributes.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:04.726
We don't really understand what's
going on at this point, but

00:15:04.726 --> 00:15:09.887
we can assume that all the errors were
fixed by that one little angle bracket.

00:15:09.887 --> 00:15:15.136
Cool, so line 172.

00:15:15.136 --> 00:15:19.656
We have element angle not allowed as

00:15:19.656 --> 00:15:24.182
child of element p in this context.

00:15:24.182 --> 00:15:29.710
So down here, cool, so
right here I made some mistakes.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.160
It's pretty common.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:38.060
You can't use angle
brackets as notation.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:42.891
If you want to talk about div
tags specifically in your code,

00:15:42.891 --> 00:15:44.703
you can't use these.

00:15:44.703 --> 00:15:46.521
You have to use escaping characters.

00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:51.779
Do you happen to know what escaping
characters are off the top of your head,

00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:52.286
is it?

00:15:52.286 --> 00:15:58.704
&gt;&gt; It's &lt; for the less-than symbol.

00:15:58.704 --> 00:16:01.981
And a semicolon after the lt.

00:16:01.981 --> 00:16:04.120
&gt;&gt; There we go, so
you can see it light up.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.560
And then ampersand gt for
the greater than symbol.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.464
&gt;&gt; That's how you want to talk
about angle brackets even if you

00:16:13.464 --> 00:16:17.550
do just one it's going
to mess everything up.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.210
So don't do that.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:23.900
&gt;&gt; You notice when Jonah types that less
than symbol the colors kind of mess up,

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:29.840
and that's because you've heard of
interpreting that using as a tag name,

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.840
and that the others that
there is an attribute.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:36.700
And weird things happen.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.470
because those last integrated
greater than symbols have special

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.860
meanings in the language.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.050
If we want to write them explicitly
as a lesser or greater than symbol,

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.330
we need to write it differently.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:55.040
And you see this sort of thing a lot
in programming for various [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.830
called special meaning
in different languages.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:04.280
&gt;&gt; Yep, so
HTML's its own second language.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:10.819
One of my favorite escape
characters is the backslash and

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:13.780
a lot of languages has
a special meaning and

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.540
if you're to actually write
a backslash you're a backslash.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.520
Because the backslash
special meaning says

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.250
interpret the next character literally.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.410
So you're right, the backslash just say
interpret the next character literally.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.990
And then the second
backslash is the backslash

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.000
of what you want to interpret literally.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.905
It's weird.
So you can have one, very confusing.

00:17:39.905 --> 00:17:45.060
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm glad I don't have
to work in those languages.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:55.191
Neat all right so let's keep going we
have a bunch of errors left to go.

00:17:55.191 --> 00:18:00.584
Cool so on 9 we have an error

00:18:00.584 --> 00:18:04.339
on 192 so okay.

00:18:04.339 --> 00:18:09.099
So it looks like I says, saw,
quotes when expecting an attribute name,

00:18:09.099 --> 00:18:12.800
probable cause equals
missing immediately before.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:18.140
That's not clay right here,
because we just made a different error.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.760
Are attribute isn't close.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.360
So we want to have our.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:25.790
Am I getting the terminology right?

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:29.230
This is the attribute and
this is the value?

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.650
Right, cool.

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:38.070
So you want to have your attribute,
no quotes, just as a word.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.590
And have it equals and
then the value in quotes.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.150
It can get kind of
frustrating sometimes.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.590
Like, it's hard to remember.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:50.040
But once you do these a few times
the coloring helps you, too.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.880
So if you notice this was yellow.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.090
You want to have your attributes be
green and your values be yellow.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.780
The more you do this [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; I get an error message where

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.200
&gt;&gt; The probable cause is not correct.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.908
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Which can happen with various error

00:19:08.908 --> 00:19:11.402
messages.

00:19:11.402 --> 00:19:19.045
Determining an error, programatically,
is actually quite a difficult problem.

00:19:19.045 --> 00:19:21.140
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.380
The validater, or
even in other languages

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.790
the trace back can make assumptions
about what's causing the error.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:31.050
That just might turn out to be wrong.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:34.490
Sort of like when spell check
is wrong in Microsoft Word.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.850
It is ultimately,
you take the advice but, like,

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:43.470
it's up to you to like,
actually determine the cause yet.

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.610
&gt;&gt; That's a really good point.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:49.830
The most valuable information
here is the line number.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:53.400
Beyond that the best guess of
the software is probably wrong.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.160
Sometimes it's right but

00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.805
you have really have to think for
yourself in order to make these fixes.

00:20:00.805 --> 00:20:03.110
Just one of the fun parts of debugging.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.820
&gt;&gt; This makes probable cause,
not 100% cause.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.690
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.540
Probably cause.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:17.130
It's not like police probable cause,
where,

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.520
I don't know where that
metaphor was going.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.360
192.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.090
So I think this is the same issue.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.115
This is the same issue.

00:20:30.115 --> 00:20:30.710
This is the same issue.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.275
So it seems like we have four errors.

00:20:33.275 --> 00:20:36.285
Coming from just a couple of typos

00:20:37.965 --> 00:20:40.675
these errors can cascade and
blow up, and it's often.

00:20:40.675 --> 00:20:43.265
&gt;&gt; Does it seem like a good
time to revalidate and

00:20:43.265 --> 00:20:45.045
maybe see what we fixed at all?

00:20:45.045 --> 00:20:51.525
&gt;&gt; That's probably a good idea,
definitely yeah.

00:20:51.525 --> 00:20:54.625
&gt;&gt; It's usually a good idea I
think if you fix one problem

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.490
&gt;&gt; Run things again see what's going on.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:02.950
Reveal new information or information
that you didn't notice before.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:05.120
&gt;&gt; Yep cool.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:10.323
So we only have five areas now,

00:21:10.323 --> 00:21:13.670
which is great.

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:18.780
So on line 239 says stray end tag is.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:26.170
So this looks like it is just a stray,
bracket or slash.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:31.140
So you want to have all your forward
sashes come before your tags

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.420
in order to close the tags,
so take that out.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:39.020
And we say end tag for body C but
there are un closed elements.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:43.040
So this is just means that
we end our whole page.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.361
But there is some divs or
some other elements

00:21:47.361 --> 00:21:51.937
that hadn't been properly close,
and those come later on here.

00:21:51.937 --> 00:21:57.907
We have an un closed div on line 219 and

00:21:57.907 --> 00:22:02.472
these are kind of hard cause you

00:22:02.472 --> 00:22:06.685
kind of know whats in here and

00:22:06.685 --> 00:22:12.129
it's important to indent your stuff

00:22:12.129 --> 00:22:18.290
because if this was
all the way over here.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:22.590
Then you don't know if it's
part of the upper div, or

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.600
if it's part of the lower div.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.810
And you can sort of go through and
search it.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.770
But it's really easy to look at
it if it's visually indented.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.005
So we look at, what was it?

00:22:33.005 --> 00:22:34.230
219?

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:38.270
So as concepts you want to look
toward where the concept ends,

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:39.990
so it's here I think.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:44.820
So I think we're just missing
a div at this indentation level.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.680
You'll notice that I just filled in,
sorry go ahead.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.830
&gt;&gt; You'll be able to see that, but now
that you write that in you can see how

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:59.430
each closing div is coming back and
indenting, sort of like the final level.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:03.580
And there was that, between where
you had that missing closing tag.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.990
That was a nice clue as to,
where the issue was.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:14.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so keeping your code clean and
indented can, and they just

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:20.010
saw that without even analyzing it
that there was something missing.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:28.914
And something you can do
that really helps is Tools,&gt;

00:23:28.914 --> 00:23:37.020
Selection,&gt; Edit.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:42.268
Then you go to Edit, wow, I'm
completely blanking on how to do this,

00:23:42.268 --> 00:23:47.380
Line &gt; Indent.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.400
So, is that right?

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.250
No that's not right that just
indents everything one time.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.077
There's something to do auto indent.

00:23:55.077 --> 00:24:05.077
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:24:10.798 --> 00:24:16.780
There's a point indent
doing your code better.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:23.270
&gt;&gt; Someone came with indenting tool.

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:24.440
Maybe I'm wrong.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.270
&gt;&gt; I've been using one
if you're using ADAM.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:36.220
There's a cool package
called ADAM Beautify.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.590
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:42.020
&gt;&gt; If you apply that to your code,
it just indents it all very nicely.

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.880
It's another case,
these auto-indenters of like,

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:52.710
take their advice with a grain of salt
because if you have got a missing tag or

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:57.720
something it can indent your code
incorrectly which could be misleading.

00:25:01.705 --> 00:25:03.930
&gt;&gt; Re-indent.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:04.830
Yeah, that's it.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.670
Let's say I mess up on my tags here.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.629
And then I want to put them back.

00:25:14.629 --> 00:25:17.440
A lot of times it'll do it right.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.500
Maybe it will, maybe it won't.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.120
That's okay.
Use your eyes, use your brain.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:29.850
And you'll notice Spline is pretty cool
in that if you have open div and want to

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:36.070
close it if I just type bracket and then
this forward slash it'll fill it in.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.720
And I don't even have to do it.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.330
So I know that there
are some open div's.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:45.250
Now, it looks like there's
another open div on line 191.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:51.820
Or is that the one we just did?

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.450
No, we did 219.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.330
191 is this div class lesson.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.420
So I think.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.770
So concepts within lesson so

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:12.350
ones all the concepts I think there's
just an extra missing div here.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:20.910
Now line 30 we have another lesson so
I'll go down

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:29.360
until his concepts are over here
are missing missing and if.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:32.490
Cool.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.430
So I think that's about right and
it's free and it's.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:45.760
Cool everything stacks up nice I think
if we copy and paste this into here.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.010
&gt;&gt; We might have one
extra there at the end.

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:51.370
Let's see what the validator says.

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:55.000
&gt;&gt; Yep, yep, stray untag,
all right, too many divs.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.780
&gt;&gt; You can see how the indentation
kind of revealed that.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:26:59.470
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Which-

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:00.650
&gt;&gt; Good point.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:01.590
&gt;&gt; Was the big p.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:09.190
So it's not actually something weird.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:16.895
So there's no errors we're also
missing a closing HTML tag.

00:27:16.895 --> 00:27:19.367
&gt;&gt; Where you are missing an HTML,

00:27:19.367 --> 00:27:24.800
an opening HTML tag too I don't think
you had one up at the top there.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
I guess [INAUDIBLE] everything so-

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.390
&gt;&gt; I think that I have HTML5.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:33.618
Maybe the HTML tag is not necessary.

00:27:33.618 --> 00:27:34.982
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:27:34.982 --> 00:27:37.477
Interesting.

00:27:37.477 --> 00:27:39.320
&gt;&gt; That might be possible.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:46.980
The DOC type HTML and the HTML tag
are kind of an artifact of an older age.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:54.430
You might notice that pretty much
any HTML page you write will

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:58.740
format this exact same way regardless
of whether you declare the doctype or

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:05.530
whether you have those surrounding HTML
tags will still be like prior to HTML5.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:07.950
Which is the current version of HTML.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:15.820
There are many different flavors of HTML
and depending on which one you specified

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:20.190
the browser could interpret
your page very differently.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:24.090
So if you look at some much
older web pages you'll

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:26.809
see doc types that aren't just
the standard straight HTML.

00:28:26.809 --> 00:28:27.624
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:28:27.624 --> 00:28:33.130
&gt;&gt; If you don't define a doc type and
your browser is relatively new,

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:37.516
you're not working on like
Internet Explorer 6 or something.

00:28:37.516 --> 00:28:38.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I hope not.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:43.570
&gt;&gt; The browser will assume your page
is HTML 5 and display it correctly.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.630
That being said, usually a good
idea to put in a doc type.

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:52.980
At least partly because who knows when
the standards will change in the future.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:53.850
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:59.211
&gt;&gt; And that can at least kind of
future-proof your webpage a little bit.

00:28:59.211 --> 00:29:01.281
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:02.546
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:29:02.546 --> 00:29:06.010
Cool.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:08.130
I think that's about it.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.840
Validate early, validate often.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:18.430
And if you need some help post in the
forums ask one of us in a one on one.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:19.960
Thanks so much for coming guys.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:20.480
Cool.
See you soon.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.550
&gt;&gt; Thanks man.
See you later.

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:23.050
&gt;&gt; Bye.
