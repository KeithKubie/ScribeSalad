1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,940
You are listening to radio lab radio lab

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,820
from W N Y s t e

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,430
n n p. R on file. Could you, uh,

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,080
could you introduce yourself,
who you are? Uh, uh,

5
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:22,590
my name is Paul Auster. And
what do you do? What do I do?

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,280
I sit here and talk to
people like you and Nissa.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,850
He's Paul Auster is one of the
most prolific writers we have.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,170
I do the best I can,

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,200
but I went to see him because
anytime you open a Paul Auster book,

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,900
you notice that he is
noticing that in the world.

11
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,840
There are lots of strange repeats.

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,420
He calls them rhymes, rhyming
events. What is it? A rhyming event?

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,480
Well, arriving event would be
something. For example, uh,

14
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,940
the girlfriend I had when I was
very young, college, freshman,

15
00:00:56,941 --> 00:01:01,941
sophomores had a piano in her apartment
and the f above middle seat was broken,

16
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,160
was the only note that
didn't work on the piano.

17
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,040
That summer we got together and
we went out to Maine Way, way out,

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,310
uh, in the wilds of Maine there Eastport.

19
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,030
And we were walking through a pretty
much an abandoned town and we walked into

20
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,000
what looked like an old
elks lodge or Moose Lodge.

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,560
And we walked up to the piano that was
sitting in the room and my girlfriend

22
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,870
could play very well. And
she tested out two piano.

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,940
One key was broken f above middle c.
So that to me is a rhyming events.

24
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,300
The F's always break. But

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,770
if that doesn't impress you and I, you
know, I'm going to give you another one.

26
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,990
This is a no, this is a
true story by the way.

27
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:50,610
The one you're about to hear and it's a
lopper. This is too weird. Well, it is,

28
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,140
um, the room. Um, so just, uh,

29
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,560
five pages in during the war,

30
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,540
m's father and hidden out from the Nazis
for several months in a Paris Shambo

31
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,690
the bun. Eventually he managed to escape.

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,730
Let's say Shambu did button a maid's room.

33
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,780
It's a small room on the top floor
of a Paris apartment building.

34
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,250
Shamba Dibon eventually
he managed to escape,

35
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,040
made his way to America
and began a new life.

36
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,010
Years past more than 20
years, m had been born.

37
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,160
I'd grown up and was now
going off to study in Paris.

38
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,113
[inaudible]

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,050
once there, he spent several difficult
weeks looking for a place to live.

40
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,100
Just when he was about to give up in
despair, he found a small Shambo to bun.

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,420
Immediately upon moving in, he
wrote a letter to his father

42
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,440
to tell them the good news, but we
could still later he received a reply.

43
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,780
Your address wrote Emma's father.

44
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,810
That is the same building
I hid out in during the war

45
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,450
and then went on to describe
the details of the room.

46
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,110
It turned out to be the same
room his son had rented.

47
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,880
Wait a second. So then father flees.

48
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:16,650
The Nazis stays in this room in
Paris, leaves 20 years go by.

49
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:21,030
The Sun happens to be in Paris, needs
a room. He finds a little vines.

50
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:25,590
So you're saying the same room,
the same exact same room. Yes.

51
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,420
Where his [inaudible] really happened.
You're not sorry. It didn't happen, Paul.

52
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:31,570
It happened to a friend of
Paul's. Wow. That is weird. Yeah.

53
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,690
And what do you make of that? Well, hi,

54
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,490
I'm not sure what to make of it except
that it gives you a funny sense that

55
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:43,491
sometimes in your life when something
happens and then weirdly it happens again,

56
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,790
that maybe that's intentional and maybe
like descriptives already been written

57
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:52,200
somehow. Exactly right. But you know,
it's interesting you see people, um,

58
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,620
there are people, it seems
to me who attract bad luck.

59
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,000
We know these people, we've
all known them. Absolutely.

60
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,030
And there are people who are
accident prone also. Yeah.

61
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,570
They're always breaking their
toe or breaking their leg. Yeah.

62
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,820
Well speaking of which, let me get,
uh, our producer Pat Walters in here.

63
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,180
Maybe before you do that you should
do, she just mentioned that this,

64
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,310
this is the, it's a radio lab. The pod.
We haven't done that yet. Oh, right.

65
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,270
This is radio lab. The podcast.
Right. I'm Jad Abumrad.

66
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:25,750
I'm Robert Krulwich and uh, our
subject is fate. Really? Yes.

67
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,060
We always seem to talk about the,
it's funny, I mean like we, we,

68
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,100
we'll have sometimes scientists on
the show when we talked to them about

69
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:33,180
whatever it is that they study,

70
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,920
but it always ends up being the case
of the real topic of conversation is

71
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,040
destiny. Like is it there?
Yeah, if it is, can you beat it?

72
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,220
[inaudible] we could be talking about
flowers and somehow this would come up and

73
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,340
said, we thought, uh, today we would, uh,

74
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,740
attack it a little more playfully and pat,

75
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,670
our producer got kind of obsessed with
something to do with fate and bad luck

76
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:56,760
and I don't really know about pat. Do
you want to just roll the tape? Yeah.

77
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,750
Just one second here. You live
in Arkansas, is that right?

78
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,310
That's correct. Yup. Yup.

79
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,300
I don't think you ever rode
renders down there, do you?

80
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,980
No, they're were, I think,

81
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:09,210
I don't think they've maybe gotten
into the far western part of the state.

82
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,450
Do you need me?

83
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,810
No. What that is jad hate that freaking
bird. Exactly. The road runner.

84
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,050
And who is this? This dude.
This is Mike Barrier, right?

85
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,750
I'm the author of a book
called Hollywood cartoons,

86
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:24,340
American animation in its golden age.

87
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:29,010
He's basically the guy you call if you
have like a big profound question about

88
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,270
looney tunes. Looney tunes.
Yeah. A few months ago,

89
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,450
Lulu and I started wondering like
in the Miller, our former producer,

90
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,900
why is road runner so good?
Because I am at least in the camp.

91
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,650
To answer your question, yeah.
But before we get to the answer,

92
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:46,020
I just want to give you a little
background on the cartoon. All right.

93
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,620
Go for it. It's 1949 when you're
at the movies with your wife,

94
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,130
you go in and you take a seat
and when the movie starts,

95
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,370
one of the very first things
you see is the cartoon.

96
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,730
And in the forties and
50s, most of these cartoons

97
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,160
chase cartoons. Tom and Jerry [inaudible]
Bank lady was a prime example.

98
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,810
[inaudible] problem was this
chase thing was a formula.

99
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:15,770
It was rigid and uh, it got a lot
of cartoonists kind of bored. Yeah.

100
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,530
So one day this kind of famous
cartoonist named Chuck Jones,

101
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,720
sitting around with his
buddy, Mike Martinez,

102
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,410
just talking about what the oddball
combinations of characters that could be

103
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:25,280
chasing each other.

104
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,030
Are they all to youth ball about having
an aardvark chasing a good new or

105
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:29,660
something like that.

106
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,190
But once again, you don't even know what
I can do is, but just cut to the chase.

107
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,110
Eventually they decided
let's make a cartoon about

108
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,480
coyote chasing a roadrunner

109
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,550
and when this cartoon came
out it was huge. It was a hit.

110
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,250
What does it mean for a cartoon
to be a hit? Like in those days,

111
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:46,580
cartoons usually only ran one
time, but this one was different.

112
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,690
Six months after it came out,
they started making another one,

113
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,340
which was almost completely unheard of.
Which brings us back to Lula's question.

114
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,860
Why is road runner so good?

115
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:59,060
Because I am at least in the camp that
it's way better than Tom and Jerry and

116
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:01,220
Mike says it's actually all about

117
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,073
the coyote.

118
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,280
He's an extraordinarily human animal

119
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,360
and not just like in the
facial expressions that he
made and the ways they look

120
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:10,440
at the camera. A lot,

121
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,610
but actually it kind of was about the
predicaments that he found himself in.

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,120
Meaning take for example, this
one really famous cartoon,

123
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,200
like always coyote has got a plan.

124
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,590
He has made a painting of the road

125
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,790
showing the road,
continuing over a casual,

126
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,360
put this painting right
at the edge of the cliff.

127
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,840
[inaudible] the roadrunner would
run through the painting, right?

128
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,060
He would take hold of him and
he was plunged into the chasm.

129
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,560
Roadrunner comes flying down the
highway and gets the painting,

130
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,520
but it doesn't fall. [inaudible]

131
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,480
instead of the road, water runs into
the painting as if it were the road.

132
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,500
We're actually continuing,

133
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,320
but then when the Coyote Trust [inaudible]
follow the road runner into the

134
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:55,330
painting, he runs through the painting

135
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,373
[inaudible]

136
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,720
he looks up at the camera and
he shrugged and he's like,

137
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,960
why did the bird gets run
into the painting and not me?

138
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,580
Gravity. Isn't this a
uniform in different force?

139
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,870
It's a malignant force that actually
comes in in an adult play is according to

140
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,150
how inconvenient it can be for the coyote.

141
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,020
That's interesting thing that the road
runner isn't his real opponent at all.

142
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:23,280
It's, it's the universe,

143
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,430
right? Oh yeah. No, he's chasing the
road and about the universes as opponent.

144
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:27,264
Absolutely.

145
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,100
And that's kind of what
makes the KOD seems so human.

146
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,430
He's in that situation that all of
us feel like we're in some times,

147
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,190
like the very laws of
physics are against us.

148
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,690
Yeah. Yeah. It's almost almost
a primitive way of thinking,

149
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,450
but [inaudible] I think all of us
lapsed endo does. You know that.

150
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,440
How can this happen?

151
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,740
The Universe is out to get me, like

152
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,910
you can't be human and not feel that way.

153
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,560
On the other hand, even though
the universe is screwing you,

154
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,000
at least it's noticing you.

155
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,360
It's got a flatter and get away.

156
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,010
It's totally flattering. Yeah, and this

157
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,780
makes sense. It's why the cartoon works.

158
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,840
Like on the one hand it
confirms our paranoia's and
then the other kind of plays

159
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:03,804
to our vanity

160
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,810
flattering. Is that really, I mean
when you said fluttering a second ago,

161
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:12,830
is that, is that really what it is? You
don't see it that way? I don't know.

162
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,400
I've never liked this cartoon
because he never wins.

163
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,780
It's like what's more flattering to live
in a world that actively screws you at

164
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:25,740
every turn or one that just doesn't
care about you like a Nietzschean void?

165
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,290
Um, I don't really know.

166
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,390
That's Kinda tough. I
go with the void. No.

167
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,290
What do you mean no really
ignored by the university? Yes.

168
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,920
The worst as opposed to being actively,
actively screwed by Russ. Yeah, sure.

169
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:43,270
Ignore me. You don't know
what you don't know. I,

170
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,400
I'll let me tell you this story.

171
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,510
I went to ABC News and I did
a story that went very well.

172
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:52,050
And then the next week I did a story
which went very badly and the head of the

173
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:55,950
place Roone Arledge called me into his
office. I think there's a Roone Arledge,

174
00:09:55,951 --> 00:10:00,720
a legend in broadcasting. And then he
put his face right in front of my face,

175
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,490
his nose almost touching my nose
and said to me, I hated this.

176
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:07,240
I hated that. What's wrong
with you? And I'll say,

177
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:12,150
and instead of being sad and upset inside
my head, like Wiley, coyote himself,

178
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:16,410
I said, wow, he knows my
name. He watched my story.

179
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,360
But if rune had said that to you
every single day, he didn't do it.

180
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:25,560
Every single I know in cartoon form,
that's essentially what's happening. Yes.

181
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,820
[inaudible] yelling. But I, the reason
I like Wiley Coyote is because I,

182
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,650
I admire the guy.

183
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,450
He has no evidence at all that
anything good will ever happen to him.

184
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,400
And yet he wakes up every day with hope.

185
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,103
Hmm.

186
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,000
D

187
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,940
but some people really are what
we call losers. And uh, and it's,

188
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,990
it's fascinating to try to understand
why that person's always getting fired

189
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,450
from his job or,

190
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,460
or is unlucky in love all the time or
just can't seem to make it go of it,

191
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,850
but not now. Let's suppose
that unlike Mr Coyote,

192
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:06,260
you can't really be sure whether the
script that's been written for you,

193
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:08,500
if indeed there is one, is, um,

194
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,410
is going to get you deeper and deeper
into Doodoo or whether it's going to make

195
00:11:12,411 --> 00:11:14,270
you a star or what.

196
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,090
Yeah. And when those moments
come along, you know,

197
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:20,980
when you feel like you're getting a peak
at the script maybe and then you think,

198
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:25,450
well we'll a is this real? And if it is,

199
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,010
what do you do? Yeah.

200
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,860
In fact, ah, Paul got to
one more story, which uh,

201
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,830
do you want to read it? Yeah,

202
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:37,310
why don't I read it cause I know
I know where it is. Okay. Yeah,

203
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,360
it's the last one in um, the red notebook.

204
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,070
It is a very strange story. Um,

205
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,430
my first novel was
inspired by a wrong number.

206
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,310
I was alone in my apartment in Brooklyn
one afternoon at my desk and trying to

207
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:57,910
work when the telephone
rang, if I'm not mistaken.

208
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,470
It was the spring of 1980.

209
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,450
I picked up the receiver and the man on
the other end as to if he was talking to

210
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:08,470
the Pinkerton Agency, I told him no, he
had dialed the wrong number and hung up.

211
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,320
Then I went back to work and
promptly forgot about the call.

212
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,650
The next afternoon the
telephone rang again.

213
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,400
It turned out to be the same person
asking the same question I had been asked

214
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:23,020
the day before, is this the Pinkerton
Agency again? I said, no, and again,

215
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:25,120
I hung up this time. However,

216
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:27,910
I started thinking about what would
have happened if I had said yes.

217
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,420
What if I had pretended to be a
detective from the Pinkerton Agency?

218
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:36,280
I wondered what if I had actually
taken on the case to tell the truth.

219
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,750
I felt that I had squandered
a rare opportunity, but
the men ever called again.

220
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:44,260
I told myself I would at least talk to
them a little bit and try to find out

221
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:47,920
what was going on. I waited for
the telephone to ring again,

222
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,930
but the third call never came.

223
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,460
After that wheels started turning
in my head, and little by little,

224
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:56,860
an entire world of
possibilities opened up to me.

225
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,280
When I sat down to write
city of glass a year later,

226
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,970
the wrong number had been transformed
into the crucial events of the book.

227
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,700
The mistake that sets the
whole story in motion.

228
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:11,470
A man named Quinn receives a phone call
from someone who wants to talk to Paul

229
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,680
Auster, the private
detective just as I did.

230
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,440
Quinn tells the caller is
dialed the wrong number.

231
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:22,120
That happens again on the next night
and again, Quinn hangs up unlike me.

232
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:22,954
However,

233
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,340
Quinn has given another chance when the
phone rings again on the third night,

234
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,880
he plays along with the caller and
takes on the case. Yes, he says,

235
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:31,740
I'm Paul Year,

236
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,740
and at that moment the madness begins
and not just for the character in the

237
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:39,310
story, but for Paul Auster himself
because when he wrote this book,

238
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,750
the city of glass,

239
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,080
it became a normal success and this
is now I'm writing in 1992 here.

240
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,770
I finished the book 10 years ago and
since then I've gone on to occupy myself

241
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:54,580
with other projects, other ideas,
other books, less than two months ago.

242
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:56,950
However, I learned that
books are never finished,

243
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,180
that it is possible for stories to go
on writing themselves without an author.

244
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,930
I was alone in my apartment
in Brooklyn. Then afternoon,

245
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,140
sitting at my desk and trying
to work when the telephone rang.

246
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,370
This was a different department from
the one I had in 1980 a different

247
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,290
department with a
different telephone number.

248
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:19,120
I picked up the receiver and the man on
the other end asked if he could speak to

249
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:23,740
Mr. Quinn clean. Remember is the name of
the man in the story who got the call.

250
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,240
You had a Spanish accent and I did
not recognize the voice for a moment.

251
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,290
I thought it might be one of my friends
trying to pull my leg. Mr. Quinn.

252
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,520
I said, is this some kind of joke
or what? No, it wasn't a joke.

253
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,160
The man wasn't dead earnest.
He had to talk to Mr. Quinn.

254
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,400
Would I please put him on
the line just to make sure.

255
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,930
Asked him to spell out the name.

256
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,850
The color's accent was quite thick and I
was hoping that he wanted to talk to Mr

257
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:53,240
Queen, but no such luck. Q. U. I. N. N.

258
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,200
The man answered.

259
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:59,030
I suddenly grew scared and for a moment
or two I couldn't get any words out of

260
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:03,080
my mouth. I'm sorry. I said it
last. There's no Mr. Quinn here.

261
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,830
You've dialed the wrong number. The
man apologize for disturbing me.

262
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,500
And then we both hung up. This
really happens like everything else.

263
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:14,480
I have sat down in this red
notebook. It is a true story.

264
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,710
So it really did it really. Then
I can get into you. Did you,

265
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,580
did you at the moment when he said,
uh, when you could have said, well,

266
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,810
this is Mr. Quinn. You could
have said that I was shaking.

267
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,830
I have to say I wasn't in F I was
not in full possession of myself.

268
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,810
It really disturbed me.

269
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,800
And to take a while to settle down and
you have this cause it's such a weird,

270
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,860
yes, it's inexplicable.

271
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:44,910
[inaudible]

272
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,790
but interesting because of them.

273
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,570
[inaudible] Paul Auster is the
author of the Red Notebook,

274
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:58,050
which these meetings are from the New
York trilogy, of course, which is the,

275
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,910
contains the city of glass, also man
in the dark, invisible sunset park.

276
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:05,790
He writes book after book after
book fourth. We should be off.

277
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:09,420
Thanks for listening. [inaudible] I
remembered Krulwich we'll see you later.

278
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:12,920
[inaudible].
