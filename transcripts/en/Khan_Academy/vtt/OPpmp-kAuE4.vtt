00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.655
- [Voiceover] So, we
have blank plus one-16th

00:00:03.655 --> 00:00:06.451
is equal to three halves.

00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:08.658
So, I encourage you to pause
the video and just figure out

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:09.841
what blank is.

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:14.033
What plus one-16th is
equal to three-halves?

00:00:14.793 --> 00:00:15.300
All right.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.844
Now, let's work through this together.

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:18.864
One thing that might make
it a little bit simpler

00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:21.882
for our brains is if we
were to express one-16th

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:24.958
and three-halves with
a common denominator.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.746
When we think about a common denominator,

00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:28.302
we will look at a common multiple

00:00:28.302 --> 00:00:29.788
of the denominators here.

00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:33.340
And lucky for us, 16 is
already divisible by 2.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.707
It's divisible by 16 as well,
so it is the common multiple,

00:00:36.707 --> 00:00:39.330
or it is the least common
multiple of 16 and 2.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.304
There are other common
multiples, but the smallest one

00:00:41.304 --> 00:00:45.124
is going to be 16 times 1,
which is also divisible by 2.

00:00:45.124 --> 00:00:47.504
So, let's try both of
these, let's try both

00:00:47.504 --> 00:00:48.455
of these fractions.

00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:51.138
Let's rewrite this equation
where both of these fractions

00:00:51.138 --> 00:00:52.983
have 16 as their denominators.

00:00:52.983 --> 00:00:54.503
This one obviously already has it.

00:00:54.503 --> 00:00:56.060
So, let's write that.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.218
So, we're going to have,
we're going to have

00:00:58.218 --> 00:01:02.152
blank plus one-16th,

00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:05.210
one-16th,

00:01:05.355 --> 00:01:08.815
is equal to, is equal to, let's see,

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:12.297
let's write three-halves
as something over 16.

00:01:12.297 --> 00:01:15.037
Well, to get our denominator from 2 to 16,

00:01:15.037 --> 00:01:18.310
we have to multiply by 8.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.073
So, we have to multiply
the numerator by 8 as well.

00:01:21.073 --> 00:01:25.135
So, 3 times 8 is going to be 24.

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:27.551
Now, at this point, you might
be able to do it in your head.

00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:31.370
Blank plus one-16th is equal to 24-16ths.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.261
We could say, okay, this
could, this could...

00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:35.828
We could do this as a
certain number of 16ths.

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:38.789
So, how many 16ths plus one-16th is going

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.110
to be 24-16ths?

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.931
Well, 23-16ths.

00:01:43.931 --> 00:01:47.565
That's 23-16ths, and I add one more 16th,

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:50.153
I'm going to have 24-16ths.

00:01:50.153 --> 00:01:52.034
Another way that you could
have thought about it,

00:01:52.034 --> 00:01:52.869
when we...

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:53.973
Actually, you could have
even thought about it

00:01:53.973 --> 00:01:56.005
from the first step, is you could say,

00:01:56.005 --> 00:01:59.731
look, if blank plus one-16th
is equal to three-halves,

00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:01.775
then you could say that blank,

00:02:01.775 --> 00:02:06.355
you could say that blank
is going to be equal to

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.133
three-halves, three-halves

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:14.370
minus one-16th, minus one-16th.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.006
This is another way that
you could have tackled it.

00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:19.466
If blank plus one-16th is three-halves,

00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:21.928
then blank is going to
be equal to three-halves

00:02:21.928 --> 00:02:24.250
minus one-16th.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.487
And we know that this is
going to be equal to...

00:02:28.487 --> 00:02:30.031
Three-halves, we already
know, it's the same thing

00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:31.691
as 24-16ths.

00:02:31.691 --> 00:02:36.573
So, 24 over 16 minus one-16th,

00:02:37.402 --> 00:02:41.002
minus one-16th, which we figured out

00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:44.931
is 23/16ths, which is equal to...

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:49.099
I'll just rewrite it again, 23 over 16.

00:02:49.604 --> 00:02:51.421
Let's do another example.

00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:54.189
So, here, this is a little bit different.

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.712
I have blank minus three-fourths
is equal to two-thirds.

00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:00.725
And there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:04.058
If blank minus three-fourths
is equal to two-thirds,

00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:06.263
that, one way to think
about it, you can say,

00:03:06.263 --> 00:03:11.162
blank, that means that blank
is going to be the same thing

00:03:11.162 --> 00:03:14.146
as two-thirds plus three-fourths.

00:03:15.186 --> 00:03:19.541
Two-thirds plus three-fourths.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.755
Plus three-fourths.

00:03:24.224 --> 00:03:26.262
And what is this going to be?

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:28.404
Well, once again, I could
rewrite both of these fractions

00:03:28.404 --> 00:03:30.309
so they have a common denominator.

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:33.593
Well, what's the least
common multiple of 3 and 4?

00:03:33.593 --> 00:03:36.774
Well, we could look at the
multiples of 4 and keep,

00:03:36.774 --> 00:03:38.829
and, and keep increasing
them until we find one

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.651
that's perfectly divisible by 3.

00:03:40.651 --> 00:03:42.544
4 isn't divisible by 3.

00:03:42.544 --> 00:03:44.308
8 isn't divisible by 3.

00:03:44.308 --> 00:03:46.074
12 is divisible by 3.

00:03:46.074 --> 00:03:48.453
In fact, it's 3 times 4 is 12.

00:03:48.453 --> 00:03:51.192
So, we can rewrite both of
these as something over 12.

00:03:51.192 --> 00:03:53.474
So, this is going to
be the same thing as...

00:03:53.793 --> 00:03:56.625
So, to go from 3 to 12,
we multiply it by 4.

00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:58.587
So, you have to multiply
the numerator by 4 as well.

00:03:58.587 --> 00:04:00.712
So, 2 times 4 is 8.

00:04:00.712 --> 00:04:03.464
Two-thirds is the same
thing as eight-12ths.

00:04:03.464 --> 00:04:07.225
This is going to be equal
to eight-12ths plus,

00:04:07.225 --> 00:04:09.569
and then three-fourths is the same thing

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.566
as what over 12?

00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:14.410
Well, to go from 4 to 12,
you have to multiply it by 3,

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.349
so you have to multiply
the numerator by 3 as well.

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.671
3 times 3 is 9.

00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:20.760
And what's that going to be equal to?

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.582
So, it's equal to this, which is equal to

00:04:23.582 --> 00:04:26.565
eight-12ths plus
nine-12ths is going to be,

00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:28.562
8 plus 9 is 17.

00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:30.744
17-12ths.

00:04:30.744 --> 00:04:34.459
So, you get 17-12ths minus three-fourths

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:36.688
is equal to two-thirds.

00:04:36.688 --> 00:04:38.325
Now, another way that
you could have done it

00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:39.985
is you could have just kept it the same

00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:42.760
and could have said,
okay, let me just rewrite,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.848
let me just rewrite this,
but I'm going to rewrite

00:04:45.848 --> 00:04:48.448
the fractions so that they
have a common denominator.

00:04:48.448 --> 00:04:50.247
We already said, well,
our common denominator

00:04:50.247 --> 00:04:52.141
we want to use is 12, at least.

00:04:52.141 --> 00:04:55.564
We could use 24 or
something larger than that.

00:04:55.564 --> 00:04:57.283
But this would have been
the least common multiple,

00:04:57.283 --> 00:04:59.140
so this keeps things a little bit simpler.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.765
And three-fourths, we're
going to rewrite this

00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:02.309
as nine-12ths.

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.878
9 over 12 is equal to.

00:05:07.232 --> 00:05:10.558
And two-thirds, we can
rewrite as 8 over 12.

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.315
And you could assume
that this is going to be

00:05:13.315 --> 00:05:14.998
a certain number of 12ths.

00:05:15.688 --> 00:05:20.402
So, blank-12ths minus nine-12ths
is equal to eight-12ths.

00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:24.076
So, if I have blank of something
minus nine of something,

00:05:24.076 --> 00:05:26.328
and I'm left with eight of that something,

00:05:26.328 --> 00:05:29.428
that means that I had 17 of
that something to begin with.

00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:33.352
17-12ths minus nine-12ths
is equal to eight-12ths.

00:05:33.352 --> 00:05:37.584
But either way, you get
17-12ths for our blank.
