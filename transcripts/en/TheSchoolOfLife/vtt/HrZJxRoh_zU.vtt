00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:09.200
It took ages to pull away from the dragnet
of suburban houses, industrial parks and warehouses..

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:19.199
Now, at last, the open road, 120 more miles
of it. They'll be asleep when we finally pull

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.639
up, and fumble in the darkness for the key
below the old earthenware jar.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.800
It takes only a miniscule pressure for the
machine to surge forward.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.140
The hidden world of technicians that made it possible: the cylinders fashioned somewhere in industrial

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:44.769
Japan, the oil in the tank from the Arabian
deserts.

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:53.029
Every mile took two weeks to build. The base
layer, the limestone, the precast slabs, the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:59.679
jet black asphalt, the perfect white and yellow
lines. And the band of men from from Lublin

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:04.070
or Madjanek who put it together so well that
you’d never have to give them or their work

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.890
a moment’s thought.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:17.400
Alongside in other lanes, trucks carry massed
parts of the nation's needs: scissors, lampshades,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.640
biscuits, things that will be part of someone's
bedroom, accompaniments to a meal.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:34.200
As children we could be curious and wave.
Now we must stare ahead,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.980
pretending not to care.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:52.950
Neglected parts of one’s inner life emerge
on the road. Ideas, associations, feelings.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.650
Driving is an unexpected tool for thinking.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.960
Out here it becomes less frightening to look
inside us. One can always draw away, to the

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:12.440
clouds and the vast horizon.
Out here we're readier to forgive, to feel love

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.560
 and to dare to hope again.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.200
With the stereo, we can put on extraordinary
sound-and-image shows: symphonies, requiems,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.380
and love songs choreographed to the beauty
of the fugitive landscape.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.480
In the service station in the gathering darkness,
it feels easier to love humanity.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.400
Everyone is a stranger here. We can guess
at the sorrows that brought them to this place.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.590
- perhaps a father who sees them only once
a month.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.310
- a disappointed participant in a meeting
hastily arranged online.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.310
The sadness is not necessarily depressing.
Everybody is a little dislocated.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.420
The loneliness we carry about inside us meets with the loneliness
of others - and is redeemed.

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.069
Then back out to the car, hours still to go.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.130
The instruments will glow in the darkness,
stars will appear over head while peculiar,

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:28.130
valuable ideas emerge in the cocoon of the
cabin and we are surreptitiously returned

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.840
a little to ourselves.
