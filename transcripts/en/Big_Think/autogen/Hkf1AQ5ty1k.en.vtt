we're all pretty rational it's quite a

we're all pretty rational it's quite a
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.190
we're all pretty rational it's quite a
robust thinking system that we've got

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200
robust thinking system that we've got
 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.380
robust thinking system that we've got
between our ears but what's going to

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
between our ears but what's going to
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.060
between our ears but what's going to
happen and has been happening for

happen and has been happening for
 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.640
happen and has been happening for
several millennia now is we're going to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650
several millennia now is we're going to
 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.440
several millennia now is we're going to
develop more and better thinking tools

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.450
develop more and better thinking tools
 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.179
develop more and better thinking tools
and we're going to identify more

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189
and we're going to identify more
 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.940
and we're going to identify more
weaknesses in our rationality and a

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
weaknesses in our rationality and a
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.270
weaknesses in our rationality and a
weakness identified is at least

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280
weakness identified is at least
 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.950
weakness identified is at least
something that can be avoided to some

something that can be avoided to some
 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.190
something that can be avoided to some
degree we can learn workarounds we can

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200
degree we can learn workarounds we can

degree we can learn workarounds we can
we can recognize that we're suckers for

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
we can recognize that we're suckers for
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.160
we can recognize that we're suckers for
certain sorts of bad ideas and alerted

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170
certain sorts of bad ideas and alerted
 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.040
certain sorts of bad ideas and alerted
to that we can we can flag them when

purification of reasoning processes will
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.639
purification of reasoning processes will
will continue slowly to to develop so
