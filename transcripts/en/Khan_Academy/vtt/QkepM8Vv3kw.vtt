00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.840
So I've got four Cartesian
coordinates here.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.770
This first one is minus 1, 0.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.440
I tried to draw them
ahead of time.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.230
So minus 1, 0 is this
point right there.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.510
Doing this in these
new colors.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.360
The next point is
a 0, 1, which is

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.000
that point right there.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.840
Then the next point is
1, 2, which is that

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.320
point right up there.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.240
And then the last point is 2, 1,
which is that point there.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.310
Now my goal in this video is to
find some line, y equals mx

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.040
plus v, that goes through
these points.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.690
Now the first thing I'd say
is, hey Sal, there is not

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.670
going to be any line that goes
through these points, and you

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.920
can see that immediately.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.550
You could find a line that
maybe goes through these

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.630
points, but it's not
going to go through

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.540
this point over here.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.960
If you try to make a line to
goes through these two points,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.580
it's not going to go through
those points there.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.820
So you're not going to be able
to find a solution that goes

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.180
through those points.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.580
Let's set up the equation that
we know we can't find the

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.350
solution to and maybe we can
use our least squares

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.690
approximation to find a line
that almost goes through all

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.370
these points.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.780
Or it's at least the best
approximation for a line that

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.420
goes through those points.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.200
So this first one, I can
express my line, y

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.980
equals mx plus b.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.430
Let me just express it as f of
x is equal to mx plus b, or y

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.740
is equal to f of x.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.480
We can write it that way.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.710
So our first point right there
-- let me do it in that color,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.340
that orange -- that tells us
that f of minus 1, which is

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.760
equal to m times -- let me just
write this way -- minus 1

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.160
times m, it's minus m plus
b, that that is going

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.180
to be equal to 0.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.550
That's what that first
equation tells us.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.530
The second equation tells us
that f of 0, which is equal to

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.210
0 times m, which is just
0 plus b is equal to 1.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.530
f of 0 is 1.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.050
This is f of x.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.380
The next one -- let me do it in
this yellow color -- tells

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:18.160
us that f of 1, which is equal
to 1 times m, or just m, plus

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.400
b, is going to be equal to 2.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.820
And then this last one down
here tells us that f of 2,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.420
which is of course 2 times m
plus b, that that is going to

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.150
be equal to 1.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.260
These are the constraints.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.570
If we assume that our line can
go through all of these

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.690
points, then all of these
things must be true.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.680
Now you could immediately, if
you wish, try to solve this

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.050
equation, but you'll find that
you won't find a solution.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.420
We want to find some m's
and b's that satisfy

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.570
all of these equations.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.820
Or another way of writing this
-- We want to write it as a

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.600
matrix vector or a
matrix equation .

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.530
We could write it like this.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:19.900
Minus 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1,
times the vector mv has got to

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.340
be equal to the vector
0, 1, 2, 1.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.330
These two systems, this system
and this system right here,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.780
are equivalent statements,
right?

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.060
Minus 1 times m plus 1 times b
has got to be equal to that 0.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.390
0 times m plus 1 times b has
got to be equal to that 1

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.710
That's equivalent to that
statement right here.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.630
And this isn't going
to have a solution.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.680
The solution would have to go
through all of those points.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.870
So let's at least try to find
a least squares solution.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.880
So if we call this a, if we call
that x, and let's call

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:07.780
this b, there is no solution
to ax is equal to b.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.250
Now maybe we can find a least
-- Well, we can definitely

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.490
find a least squares solution.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:20.750
So let's find our least squares
solution such that a

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.870
transpose a times our least
squares solution is equal to a

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.900
transpose times b.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.800
Our least squares solution
is the one that

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.020
satisfies this equation.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.400
We proved it two videos ago.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.550
So let's figure out what a
transpose a is and what a

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.400
transpose b is, and
then we can solve.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.700
So a transpose will
look like this.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:51.670
b minus 1, 1, 0, 1, 1,
1, and then 2, 1.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.920
This first column becomes this
first row; this second column

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.850
becomes this second row.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.270
So we're going to take the
product of a transpose and

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.870
then a-- a is that thing right
there --minus 1, 0, 1, 2, and

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.270
we just get a bunch of 1's.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.500
So what does this equal to?

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.250
We have a 2 by 4
times a 4 by 2.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.860
So we're going to have
a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.220
So this is going to be --
Let's do it this way.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.390
Well, we're going to have minus
1 times minus 1, which

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.940
is 1, plus 0 times 0, which is
0 -- so we're at 1 right now

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.520
--plus 1 times 1.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.230
So that's 1 plus the other
1 up there, so that's 2,

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.180
plus 2 times 2.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.170
2 times 2 is 4, so we get 6.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.340
That's that row, dotted with
that column, was equal to 6.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.030
Now let's take this row dotted
with this column.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.143
So it's going to be negative 1
times 1, plus 0 times 1, so

00:05:54.143 --> 00:05:55.910
all of these guys times
1 plus each other.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.350
So minus 1 plus 0 plus 1 --
that's all 0's --plus 2.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.700
So it's going to get a 2.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.600
I just dotted that guy
with that guy.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.170
Now I need to take the dot of
this guy with this column.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.890
So it's just going to be 1 times
minus 1 plus 1 times 0

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.580
plus 1 times 1 plus 1 times 2.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.090
Well, these are all 1 times
everything, so it's minus 1

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.185
plus 0 plus 1, which
is 0 plus 2.

00:06:20.185 --> 00:06:22.160
It's going to be 2.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.300
And then finally -- Well.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.360
I mean, I think you see
some symmetry here.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.040
We're going to have to take the
dot of this guy and this

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.340
guy over here.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.900
So what is that?

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.930
That's 1 times 1, which is 1,
plus 1 times 1, which is 2,

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.400
plus 1 times 1.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.450
So we're going to have 1
plus itself four times.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.900
So we're going to get that
it's equal to 4.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.650
So this is a transpose a.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.270
And let's figure out what a
transpose b looks like.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.970
Scroll down a little bit.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:55.220
So a transpose is this matrix
again-- let me switch colors

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.900
--minus 1, 0, 1, 2.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.160
We get all of our 1's
just like that.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:07.530
And then the matrix
b is 0, 1, 2, 1.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.490
We have a 2 by 4 times a 4 by 1,
so we're just going to get

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.890
a 2 by 1 matrix.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:21.510
So this is going to be equal
to a 2 by 1 matrix.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.030
We have here, let's see, minus 1
times 0 is 0, plus 0 times 1

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.440
is still 0.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.100
Plus 1 times 2, which
is 2, plus 2 times

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.590
1, which is 4, right?

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.560
This is 2 plus 2, so it's going
to be 4 right there.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.510
And then we have 1 times 0, plus
1 times 2, plus-- So 1

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.240
times all of these
guys added up.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.630
So 0 plus 1 is 1, 1 plus
2 is 3, 3 plus 1 is 4.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.400
So this right here
is a transpose b.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.800
So just like that, we know
that the least squares

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.080
solution will be the solution
to this system.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:08.460
6, 2, 2, 4, times our least
squares solution, is going to

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.830
be equal to 4, 4.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.300
Or we could write it this way.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:19.250
We could write it 6, 2, 2, 4,
times our least squares

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.020
solution, which I'll write--
Remember, the

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.310
first entry was m .

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.620
I'll write it as m star.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:28.130
That's our least square m, and
this is our least square b, is

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.220
equal to 4, 4.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.159
And I can do this as an
augmented matrix or I could

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:36.110
just write this as a system
of two unknowns, which is

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.760
actually probably easier.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.700
So let's do it that way.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.200
So this, if I were to write it
as a system of equations, is 6

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:51.540
times m star plus 2 times
b star, is equal to 4.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:09:00.120
And then I get 2 times m star
plus 4 times b star is

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.830
equal to this 4.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.950
So let me solve for my m
stars and my b stars.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.320
So let's multiply this second
equation, actually let's

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.570
multiply that top
equation by 2.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.280
This is just straight
Algebra 1.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.300
So times 2, what do we get?

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:23.970
We get 12m star plus 4b
star is equal to 8.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.560
We just multiplied that
top guy by 2.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:35.930
Now let's multiply this magenta
1 by negative 1.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:40.200
So this becomes a minus, this
becomes a minus, that becomes

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.370
a minus, and now we can add
these two equations.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:49.490
So we get minus 2 plus 12m
star, that's 10m star.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:54.700
And then the minus 4b and the 4b
cancel out, is equal to 4,

00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:01.000
or m star is equal to 4 over
10, which is equal to 2/5.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.320
Now we can just go and
back-substitute into this.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.450
We can say 6 times m
star-- This is just

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.990
straight Algebra 1.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:13.430
So 6 times our m star, so 6
times 2 over 5, plus 2 times

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.410
our b star is equal to 4.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:19.170
Enough white, let
me use yellow.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:27.760
So we get 12 over 5 plus 2b
star is equal to 4, or we

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:33.050
could say 2b star-- let me
scroll down a little bit --2b

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.580
star is equal to 4.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:41.350
Which is the same thing as 20
over 5, minus 12 over 5, which

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.970
is equal to-- I'm just
subtracting the 12 over 5 from

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.180
both sides --which is
equal to 8 over 5.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.160
And you divide both sides of the
equation by 2, you get b

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.220
star is equal to 4/5.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.940
And just like that, we got our
m star and our b star.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:07.770
Our least squares solution
is equal to 2/5 and 4/5.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.900
So m is equal to 2/5 and
b is equal to 4/5.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.030
And remember, the whole point
of this was to find an

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.810
equation of the line.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.890
y is equal to mx plus b.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.500
Now we can't find a line that
went through all of those

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.240
points up there, but this
is going to be our

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.610
least squares solution.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:33.580
This is the one that minimizes
the distance between a times

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.490
our vector and b.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.580
No vector, when you multiply
times that matrix a-- that's

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:45.610
not a, that's transpose a --no
other solution is going to

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.880
give us a closer solution to
b than when we put our

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.600
newly-found x star into
this equation.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.660
This is going to give us
our best solution.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.800
It's going to minimize
the distance to b.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.880
So let's write it out.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.640
y is equal to mx plus b.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.870
So y is equal to
2/5 x plus 2/5.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.590
Let's graph that out.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.650
y is equal to 2/5 x plus 2/5.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:20.130
So its y-intercept is 2/5,
which is about there .

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.200
This is at 1.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.320
2/5 is right about there.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.020
And then its slope is 2/5.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.110
Let's think of it this way: for
every 2 and 1/2 you go to

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.510
the right, you're going
to go up 1.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:39.170
So if you go 1, 2 and 1/2,
we're going to go up 1.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.590
We're going to go
up 1 like that.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.920
So our line-- and obviously this
isn't precise --but our

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.720
line is going to look
something like this.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.520
I want to do my best shot
at drawing it because

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.260
this is the fun part.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.820
It's going to look something
like that.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.440
And that right there is my least
squares estimate for a

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.260
line that goes through
all of those points.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.360
And you're not going to find a
line that minimizes the error

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.690
in a better way, at least when
you measure the error as the

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:20.150
distance between this vector
and the vector a times our

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.180
least squares estimate.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.740
Anyway, thought you would
find that neat.
