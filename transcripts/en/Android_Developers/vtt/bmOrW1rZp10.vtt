SAM SHANK: Hi, I'm Sam Shank,
and I'm CEO and co-founder.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.610
And I try and keep everything
nice and clear for Justin to

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.020
do great coding.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.270
JUSTIN SCHULTZ: Yeah,
I'm Justin Schultz.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.350
I'm the Android lead
at HotelTonight.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.430
I am responsible for building
the phone app, the tablet app.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.170
I manage our Android team and
interact with our design team

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.640
and our various teams to make
sure that the Android app is

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.950
beautiful and working
perfectly.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.760
SAM SHANK: This is my third
online travel start-up, and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.760
the idea for HotelTonight
started when I was doing the

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.759
second one.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.650
And I found out I was on my
mobile phone more than I was

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.250
on my computer at home.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.230
And I said, why isn't there a
good way to book a hotel on

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.980
your smartphone?

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.000
And so I thought about what the
mobile use case is, and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.580
it's about last minute, and
it's about booking in the

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.400
moment, and so we came
up with HotelTonight.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.900
JUSTIN SCHULTZ: I started at
HotelTonight in February of

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.300
2012, and I think that there
were something like 400,000

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.280
downloads at that point.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.090
I think we're at around
1.6 million now.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.820
So we've seen, obviously,
explosive

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.560
growth in the last year.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.610
We've also completely
redesigned the app.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.130
Really since we've implemented
things like the action bar and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.540
the fragments and really adhered
to a lot of the Google

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.790
design guidelines, we've seen
that growth certainly

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.330
exponentially--

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.700
we've seen exponential growth,
really, since really adhering

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.430
to a lot of those
good practices.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.860
SAM SHANK: So with Android, it
was just a matter of time

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.970
until we had the resources to
be able to invest in the

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.040
tablet support.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.300
We're really pleased with
the results both in the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.250
performance of it as well as
the uptake from our users.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.040
JUSTIN SCHULTZ: As you can see,
just right here, we've

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.170
got our market list.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.860
It lists the various markets
in which we sell hotels.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.730
You can see we've got these big

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.560
beautiful photos in a grid.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.330
We've got a country selector
here that quickly allows folks

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.410
to jump to a particular country
and see inventory in

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.400
that country.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.430
And as I mentioned, we also use
the drawer pattern here.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.010
So this is something that I
actually took from last year's

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.860
Google I/O. The sliding drawer
pattern is very slick.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.000
And so we stole that.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.120
And we're-- you can tell that
we're using the action bar

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.100
paradigm here as well.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.950
And I'll actually just scroll
down to San Francisco here.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.720
I think we've got
some inventory.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.920
San Francisco will list a kind
of a similar grid interface.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.030
And again we're using fragments
here that allow us

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.510
to very easily modify things
like the layouts.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.530
And in fact, one of my favorite
features is we

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.800
recently implemented expandable
notifications with

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.670
the ability to like or
dislike a hotel.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.100
So it's just a very
quick action.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.425
After you've stayed at a hotel,
the next day at 2

00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:28.410
o'clock, you'll receive an
expandable notification that

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.120
just quickly asks, did
you like the hotel?

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.310
Did you not like the hotel?

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.730
And upon tapping on that
notification, you have the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.200
opportunity to actually add
some additional comments.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.270
That's an optional step.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.940
But that's a really
slick feature.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.950
And it definitely improved our
conversion rate on getting

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.500
those reviews from customers
because it's just so fast and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.740
easy for them.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.680
So we've got--

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.990
again leveraging these
big beautiful

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.990
photos for the hotels.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.480
I think the photos are one
of the features that our

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.050
customers like most
about the app.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.790
We've got these really rich,
really nice photos of the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.760
room, of the lobby, of
the bar very often.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.640
And so folks tend to really
enjoy these big photos.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.920
And we leverage this on both the
phone and the tablet app.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.830
We've also implemented this
great new map using the new

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.730
Maps v2 API.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.020
And this map has some great
features like the ability to

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.540
tilt, the ability to rotate.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.530
And in fact, once we get to a
particular zoom level, we'll

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.370
even see a 3D rendering of the
buildings, so that's been a

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.360
really fun feature
on the phone.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.380
So since launching our tablet
app a couple of months ago,

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.420
we've actually seen some
enormous growth.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.100
Greater than 50% of our recent
growth, since launching the

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.160
app, has actually come
from tablets.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.380
And our fourth most frequently
used device now is actually

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.250
the Nexus 7 device.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.360
So that's been great.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.570
We're seeing a lot of
momentum in the

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.590
tablet market, obviously.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.650
And we wanted to stay ahead of
the bell curve technically and

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.390
really build an app that worked
great on all devices,

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.620
and especially some of the
newer, nicer tablets like the

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.170
Nexus 7 and the Nexus 10.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.010
SAM SHANK: We're really
excited about

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.960
what's next for Android.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.760
Justin and his team have some
really exciting things coming

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.030
next that we can't tell
you about now.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.080
But stay tuned, and in the
meantime, get the free

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.970
HotelTonight app.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.050
And I hope you guys find a way
to book a hotel tonight soon.
