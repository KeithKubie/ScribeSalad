00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.700
- If this shit ain't
makin' your dick hard,

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.840
I don't know what's wrong with you!

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.366
And everyone's like, what?

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.538
(heavy music)

00:00:06.538 --> 00:00:07.800
(fire crackling)

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.830
Our guest is a fuckin' huge get.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.090
Shout out to Black Lou, I
mean, the guy, super producer.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.090
- Making a world of fans in
the campers community here

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.313
with The Bonfire, you
know, (laughs) there it is.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.140
You know him, you love
him, I've been on the road,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.850
they've been asking about
him, a lot of people

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.390
thank me for bringing this in their life.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.057
On the phone, all the way
from, am I correct, Brazil?

00:00:34.057 --> 00:00:35.036
- Brazil!

00:00:35.036 --> 00:00:35.869
- Brazil!

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:36.940
- [Sean] You got it.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.180
- It's Sean Fury, everybody,
- That's right.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.910
- Sean Fury, on The Bonfire,
how you doin' Sean Fury?

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.870
- [Male] Yeah!

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.460
- [Sean] Alright, how you guys doin'?

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.430
- We're doin' pretty good man,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.880
usually there's a whole applause thing,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.580
but our engineer decided to go away

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.309
and left a confused
young man on the board.

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.142
(chuckling)

00:00:51.142 --> 00:00:53.971
- Yeah, we got our backup
quarterback on the board today.

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:56.530
- [Sean] That's alright,
I guess he's better

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.193
than the quarterbacks the Jets
have had the last five years.

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:00.914
- Oh, is there any Jets fans in here?

00:01:00.914 --> 00:01:02.139
- [Sean] Not tryin' to diss!

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:04.639
- No, it's okay, no one
here is a fan of the Jets.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.540
- [Sean] You know, I know the feeling.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.380
You know, I'm a New York, New Jersey guy,

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.090
but the Steelers have always been my team.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.923
- Got it, yeah.

00:01:14.923 --> 00:01:17.053
- Elizabeth, New Jersey
your stompin' grounds?

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.010
- [Sean] Well, I was born and raised,

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.090
educated in New York, but, you know,

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.970
most New Jerseyans are former
New Yorkers who can't escape.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:28.960
- Yeah, you just can't leave it.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.350
- [Sean] So I got
smuggled out the country.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.276
- Yeah.

00:01:31.276 --> 00:01:34.410
- Now, we've been going
through your catalog

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.410
here on the show for a few weeks now.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.570
- Yeah, I think we first
started with Bi-Racial?

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.130
The video our friend Des
- It was showed to us.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.870
- showed us the video Bi-Racial,

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.410
and then we found a live performance,

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.320
and then we found our way
to your YouTube channel,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.450
and we just went real deep.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.410
We had a whole Sean Fury day, you know?

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.620
We got into it, and that's
why you're such a big get,

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.503
'cause our fans love
ya, and we got into it.

00:01:56.503 --> 00:01:57.533
- [Sean] Thank you!

00:01:57.533 --> 00:01:58.851
Thank you.

00:01:58.851 --> 00:01:59.790
- I mean, there's some questions.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.070
We definitely have some questions,

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.280
because as I said, we went in deep.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.732
- Now I can't help but notice
- Go for it!

00:02:05.732 --> 00:02:10.732
- the video for the song,
it's She Said No, No, No.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.790
Is this have anything
to do with the reason

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.298
you're out of the country right now?

00:02:14.298 --> 00:02:15.300
(chuckling)

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.508
- [Sean] (laughing) No, no...no.

00:02:19.508 --> 00:02:21.900
They wouldn't let the
brothers get on the plane

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.620
if that was to happen,
especially if, you know.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.350
You know the history of our country, so.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.840
You know, black man, white
woman, he's not gonna make it.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.080
You know, that's why I guess
Cos is going to jail, right?

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.630
- Well, yeah, I mean there's
many reasons (laughs).

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.010
So wait, you doled out
justice yourself though,

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.318
in the She Said No, No, No
video, at the end of it.

00:02:44.318 --> 00:02:47.800
- [Sean] Actually,
whenever I do my videos,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.110
I always try to keep it real.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.020
Just like any time I write my
music, they're real stories.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.560
They're, you know, this
is the people next door,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.520
people you know, people
you're seeing on the bus,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.830
the train, the people you
gave the middle finger to

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.630
while you're driving in the car.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.187
You know, these are
real things that happen

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:10.330
and I always try to keep things real.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.883
- So you do dole out
vigilante justice on rapists?

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.360
- [Sean] I would, if it was
a situation and I saw it,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.751
and I'm right there,
I'm gonna do somethin'.

00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:25.584
- Okay.

00:03:25.584 --> 00:03:27.020
- [Sean] Sometimes you
have to be hesitant,

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.460
because I've seen in experience,

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.420
where a guy was smackin' up
his girlfriend in the street,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.730
and I'm like four or five blocks away,

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.390
and I have on this big bomber

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.210
so it makes me look like
I'm hulking, you know?

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.900
And so, he's smackin' her up,
and as I'm getting closer,

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.770
I'm hearing the conversation, you know,

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.030
'cause you have to be careful,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.620
'cause you might beat up the boyfriend

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.377
and she turns around,
starts cuttin' you up,

00:03:53.377 --> 00:03:56.380
and you're the one going to
jail and everybody's going home

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.410
and you're the idiot, you know?

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.480
- I think that's a song, I
think you just wrote a new song,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.863
right there, in that story.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.661
- [Sean] Yep, so this
guy is gettin' smacked,

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:08.507
this woman is gettin' smacked
up and her friend is like,

00:04:08.507 --> 00:04:11.340
"Yeah, girl! Don't take this from him!"

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.990
And he's smackin' up,
slammin' her face under there,

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.300
and there's police across the street.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.440
Nobody's doing anything, and
then as I'm getting closer,

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.937
and then I hear him speak, and he says,

00:04:22.937 --> 00:04:25.390
"And you cheated on me
for what, you slut?"

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.100
And I was like, uh-oh, wait a minute,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.040
I can't get into this right now.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.837
This is a little bit deep for me.

00:04:31.837 --> 00:04:34.040
But the girlfriend, her girlfriend,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.537
is still provoking this man, just like,

00:04:36.537 --> 00:04:37.650
"You don't do this!"

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.870
And I'm looking, and I'm like,

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.006
at what point does this guy turn around

00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:45.400
and realize that his girlfriend
is not doing anything,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.640
but the one that's
talking is provoking him.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.973
He should just leave, you know?

00:04:50.973 --> 00:04:51.806
- Yeah.

00:04:51.806 --> 00:04:55.120
- [Sean] And so, by the
time I got up there,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.450
'cause then I start to
run, to get over there,

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.550
it's all broken up, they jump in the car,

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.280
and I'm sayin', this is real stuff!

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.710
You know, people don't write
about stuff like this anymore.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.270
- Yep, you are Mark Vengeance.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.740
Sean, if I could ask you
a question, Mr. Fury?

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.340
- [Sean] Mhm, mhm.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.760
- Black Lou, who you spoke
with on the phone, I know,

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.800
Black Lou will tell you
his Stairway to Heaven

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.433
will always be the song Snow
you wrote on your album.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.830
My favorite titles
maybe, on any album ever.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.058
If you could bring that up, Christine.

00:05:27.058 --> 00:05:28.780
- Ladies of Color album.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.330
- Ladies of Color, yes.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.240
- I mean, writing a song for every shade

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.640
of woman in the beautiful rainbow.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.200
- Now, the balls.
- Of course.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.870
- The balls, Mr. Fury,
that I believe you showed

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.530
in the writing in the titling of song

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.420
Indian Slash Arabic Girl, my
favorite part in the song being

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.510
when you say, when you
sing the word slash,

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.770
you say my Indian slash Arabic girl,

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.360
is one of the most fun
lyrics I've ever heard

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.237
in my entire life, I enjoyed that so.

00:06:01.237 --> 00:06:03.450
(Sean laughs)

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.900
- [Sean] Well, actually,
I sat down years ago,

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.700
and I always try to be
different from everyone else.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.700
And, when I realized that I
was dating all types of women,

00:06:16.995 --> 00:06:17.828
(muffled laughter)

00:06:17.828 --> 00:06:20.270
I was collecting notes in my head.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.713
And I wanted to see, and share,

00:06:22.713 --> 00:06:23.546
(stifled chuckling)

00:06:23.546 --> 00:06:26.690
that they all have some of
the same needs and desires

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.570
but they just do things
just a little bit different.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.630
It's not too much of a difference,

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.210
if they can't stand their boyfriend

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.640
or their husband, they let ya know.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.780
- It's all the same,
- Ya know?

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.270
- Just different smells.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.379
- Yeah, was it--

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:41.630
- [Sean] It's a universal thing.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.010
I mean, I don't care, the
meekest woman that you can find,

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.746
if you leave that toilet seat up,

00:06:48.746 --> 00:06:49.701
- Cut your nuts off!

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.479
- [Sean] she will have a problem, okay?

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:55.643
- Would you consider Ladies
of Color a concept album?

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.065
- [Sean] Yes.

00:06:58.065 --> 00:07:00.173
Let's put it this way.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.563
For the guys who have a
hard time speaking to women,

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.940
what they should do, for example,

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.827
a guy he says, "Oh! I'm in to these type

00:07:09.827 --> 00:07:12.113
"but I don't know what to
say!", don't say anything.

00:07:12.113 --> 00:07:13.610
- What if I meet a girl
in my neighborhood,

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.515
and I'm like, she's Indian or Arabic,

00:07:15.515 --> 00:07:16.660
what song do I listen to
- Throw it on!

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.961
- to get a better clue?

00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:20.020
- [Sean] Throw it on. Throw the record on.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.587
- Black Lou said, "Ladies of Color

00:07:21.587 --> 00:07:23.450
"is this generation's The Wall."

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.858
- Yeah. I call it Purple Rain.

00:07:25.858 --> 00:07:27.207
(chuckling)

00:07:27.207 --> 00:07:28.040
- [Sean] Ah.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.850
- The songs are so entertaining,

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.090
I love that you're featured in the videos.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:36.000
Can you, if you can, I don't
know if you can be honest here,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.190
but these girls in the
videos, what percentage of 'em

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.173
do you say you broke off in real life?

00:07:43.288 --> 00:07:45.126
- [Sean] Uh...

00:07:45.126 --> 00:07:47.793
(muffled snort)

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.418
- You think he's counting on his hands?

00:07:50.418 --> 00:07:51.251
(laughing)

00:07:51.251 --> 00:07:52.414
- Yeah, I think he's doing a run-through.

00:07:52.414 --> 00:07:53.247
- [Jay] (laughing) He is.

00:07:53.247 --> 00:07:54.748
- He hung up?

00:07:54.748 --> 00:07:55.581
- [Male] Yeah.

00:07:55.581 --> 00:07:56.414
- He's gone?
- He's not on?

00:07:56.414 --> 00:07:57.247
- [Male] He definitely hung up.

00:07:57.247 --> 00:07:58.120
I'll call him back.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.170
- That's hilarious.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.210
- He goes, "Oh sorry man."

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.980
- [Bert] He had to have fucked
this one, there's no way.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.880
- Yeah, I mean.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.259
- [Bert] What if he's listening
to SiriusXM right now?

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:05.609
- In Brazil?
- In Brazil?

00:08:05.609 --> 00:08:06.442
- [Bert] In Brazil.

00:08:06.442 --> 00:08:07.275
(chuckling)

00:08:07.275 --> 00:08:08.226
- He's just on a, he's just on--

00:08:08.226 --> 00:08:10.160
- (Jokingly announces radio
show in foreign language)

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.893
- But do you think his
real last name's Fury?

00:08:11.893 --> 00:08:15.160
- (snorting) Yeah, I believe
it comes from feral stain.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.170
- Follow the money,
follow the paper trail,

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.486
let's find out this guy's real name.

00:08:18.486 --> 00:08:20.620
It's also Mark Vengeance, is possible.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.530
- Yeah, let's keep digging.
- (laughing) Mark Vengeance.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.040
- Yeah, that's his alter ego.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.510
Let's keep digging 'til we hit bedrock.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.710
- Yeah, I wanna apologize to you, Bert.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.746
We brought you into this,
I guess not as informed,

00:08:30.746 --> 00:08:32.210
as I thought.
- Not as well-versed.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.880
- Yeah, so Sean Fury was a guy
where we found out one video.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.667
- Dude, that lady got
straight-up raped in that video.

00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:38.820
- [Jay] It's the most graphic--

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.090
- It's the most graphic--

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.710
- It makes The Accused
look like a kid's movie.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:42.860
- [Dan] It really does.
- Yeah.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.980
- I would almost show that
at like, to scare teenagers,

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.978
you show that video and
go, "This what happens."

00:08:47.978 --> 00:08:49.430
And they're like, "I don't like this."

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.456
- [Jay] Bert did you want--

00:08:50.456 --> 00:08:51.450
- Yeah yeah yeah, I might
as well do a cocktail.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.650
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.335
- I feel fuckin' like I'm, I feel like I'm

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:56.860
(clicks tongue loudly
three times) firing hot.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:57.710
- [Dan] Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:58.543
- [Dan] Hell yeah.

00:08:58.543 --> 00:08:59.480
Come on, I mean.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.704
- What's he doing in Brazil?

00:09:00.704 --> 00:09:01.861
- [Dan] (sighs) Well, maybe--

00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:02.860
- [Jay] Running from the law.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.460
- [Dan] That's why he
asked about this video.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.230
'Cause it could be because of this video,

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.400
or it could be he's just
going to see some butts.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.470
Is he on the phone?

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.303
Did he pick back up?

00:09:10.303 --> 00:09:11.700
Or did he just hang up,
because he doesn't like Jay's

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.350
inappropriate questions for an artiste?

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:15.960
You don't say if they broke 'em off, Jay.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.045
You ask how many of these women are his--

00:09:18.045 --> 00:09:18.878
- [Producer] Okay, we're back on.

00:09:18.878 --> 00:09:19.730
- Did he bed down?

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.790
- Did he bed? Hey, Sean, we
lost you now you're back.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:23.900
We're just watching the video for Snow.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.050
- [Sean] Sorry about that.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.754
You know, it's like,
it's like my comeback.

00:09:26.754 --> 00:09:29.000
So you know, I'm here,
boom, then I'm gone.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.833
- But now you're back.

00:09:29.833 --> 00:09:30.957
- [Sean] But let me
finish what I was saying,

00:09:30.957 --> 00:09:32.543
I'm gonna address that.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.380
No, the girls in Bi-Racial, no.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.920
Snow, that's actually my
wife, and she was pregnant

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.169
with our twins when I did that.

00:09:44.169 --> 00:09:47.090
So, I can't be breaking off anybody.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.507
- I was gonna say, that
just killed the legend.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.480
The legend of Sean Fury there, really.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.460
You gotta keep that hidden
away from the world, man.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.930
- Yeah, you can't, I
mean when you're a sexpot

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.144
you gotta hide it.
- You're a sex symbol.

00:09:59.144 --> 00:10:02.310
- [Sean] Not really, cause when you hear

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.637
what I'm writing on the new
stuff when it comes out,

00:10:05.637 --> 00:10:08.310
you know, and all these guys
cheatin' on their wives,

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.078
you know I got more stories to tell.

00:10:11.078 --> 00:10:11.911
- Yeah.
- So, you know.

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.533
- Does it count as cheating
if you do it in Brazil?

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.393
- [Sean] Huh?

00:10:16.393 --> 00:10:18.403
- Does it count as cheating
if you do it in Brazil?

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.960
- [Sean] Well...

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.357
Cheating is cheating, wherever you do it.

00:10:27.357 --> 00:10:28.190
- But...
- But.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:29.023
(laughing)

00:10:29.023 --> 00:10:30.450
- [Sean] But if you're
keeping a scorecard,

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.430
then you have to look at
what your real focus is.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:38.530
Do you really wanna go out
there and cheat on your spouse?

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:42.377
I mean, for years, for example,
you've heard people say,

00:10:42.377 --> 00:10:45.910
"Oh, practice safe sex!" Well,
if you have to practice it,

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.490
you're not good at it.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:48.323
Okay?

00:10:48.323 --> 00:10:51.820
So, if you have to practice being safe,

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.240
you're not good at it!

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.860
So, be a professional.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.397
- Just live dangerously,
- You know, protect yourself.

00:10:56.397 --> 00:10:58.055
- is that what you're saying?

00:10:58.055 --> 00:10:59.300
- [Sean] (laughing) You
know what I'm saying?

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.167
So.
- No.

00:11:00.167 --> 00:11:01.980
- [Sean] Let me answer one more question,

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.640
'cause I try to address everything.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.553
I always try to keep it
real and not real phony.

00:11:07.632 --> 00:11:11.920
She Said No, No, No
whenever I do my videos,

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.270
I'm an equal opportunist.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.394
I try to bring together everybody,

00:11:15.394 --> 00:11:19.858
all the different types, and
what goes on in communities.

00:11:19.858 --> 00:11:24.858
Originally, the cast was
supposed to be all Latino,

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.740
and I was supposed to come in
and still do my hero thing.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.573
- Yeah.

00:11:29.573 --> 00:11:30.530
- [Sean] The funny thing about it is

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.660
I always kept backups for my videos.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.007
So I said, "If these people don't show up

00:11:35.007 --> 00:11:39.897
"at this certain time, then
you got the job and let's go."

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.937
You know? So.

00:11:41.937 --> 00:11:45.800
- You offered Latinos jobs
and they didn't take it?

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.040
- [Sean] Well, they do it!

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.495
They didn't show up, you know?

00:11:48.495 --> 00:11:49.870
- Ay yi yi.
- It's Latinos, you know

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:50.810
how it is.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:54.640
You know, so now, 'cause
I always tell them,

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.070
I always tell them,
you know, in the video,

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.970
from the start, I said,
"You're gonna be famous."

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.680
'Cause I like to keep real people,

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.910
it's easy to get supermodels
who are starving to death,

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:05.743
you know,
(whispering)

00:12:05.743 --> 00:12:07.277
and they look all hot, and you're like,

00:12:07.277 --> 00:12:10.517
"Aw man! Yeah, but that's the
same guy, that's the same girl

00:12:10.517 --> 00:12:12.800
"that was in so-and-so's video!"

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.900
No, people, I like to use real people,

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.640
doing real things, telling real stories.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.682
- [Jay] No shit.

00:12:19.682 --> 00:12:20.515
- [Sean] For example,

00:12:20.515 --> 00:12:23.022
- I gotta, what I find interesting about

00:12:23.022 --> 00:12:26.606
the video is quite graphic.

00:12:26.606 --> 00:12:27.439
(snickering)

00:12:27.439 --> 00:12:28.272
- [Sean] Uh-huh.

00:12:28.272 --> 00:12:31.220
- And the song has such a,
like a bubbly tone to it.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.010
- Yeah, almost like a beach tune,

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.610
but it's then scored on top of a video

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.160
that's very dramatic and very graphic.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.140
- [Sean] Yeah, well here's--

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.410
- I mean, you give a real DeNiro level

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.537
of Goodfellas beating at the end of this.

00:12:42.537 --> 00:12:44.891
- Yeah, that's a real stompin'.

00:12:44.891 --> 00:12:48.048
- And I love the choice of
throwing the shirt to him.

00:12:48.048 --> 00:12:49.530
- [Dan] Yeah, like, clean yourself up.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.363
- Yeah.

00:12:50.363 --> 00:12:53.863
- [Sean] Well, here's the thing
with that, with the video.

00:12:53.863 --> 00:12:57.810
I mean, most people expect
a heavy song like that

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.610
to be a ballad.
- Yeah.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.785
- [Sean] I mean, do you
really wanna be romanced

00:13:01.785 --> 00:13:05.220
by a song, "Oh it sounds so, so sexual!"

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.970
But it's a horrible act.
- Yep.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.930
- [Sean] But, when you hear it bouncing,

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.337
it's grabbing your
attention, and you're saying,

00:13:12.337 --> 00:13:15.020
"Wait a minute, he's really
going into detail with this."

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:15.853
- Mhm.

00:13:15.853 --> 00:13:18.836
- [Sean] And at that point, now you're in,

00:13:18.836 --> 00:13:20.840
you're really getting the message,

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.247
'cause I'm not endorsing it.

00:13:22.247 --> 00:13:24.100
I keep telling you this is
- No, not at all.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.989
- [Sean] you know, what happens.

00:13:24.989 --> 00:13:27.640
- That song's anti-rape?

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.473
- [Jay] Yeah.

00:13:28.473 --> 00:13:29.306
- [Dan] Yeah.
- Exactly!

00:13:29.306 --> 00:13:30.730
- Yeah, Sean shows up at the end, and.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.468
- Oh yeah, okay, I'm sorry, yep!

00:13:32.468 --> 00:13:33.660
Hey, (clears throat) did--

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.810
- [Sean] If you read some
of the stuff people say,

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:40.810
you would think, "Oh my god," what was it?

00:13:41.047 --> 00:13:44.713
"He's probably fantasizing
about this, oh my god!

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:48.961
"He probably masturbates
to this, oh my god!"

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:49.895
(laughter)

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:50.810
No, I do fine without that.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:52.720
I was doin' fine before I was married,

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.068
I'm doin' fine while
I'm married, you know?

00:13:56.068 --> 00:13:59.277
The funny thing about
it, it's a serious topic

00:13:59.277 --> 00:14:01.840
and most people don't realize the emails

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.870
that I have received.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.970
- That's what I'm curious
about is the pushback.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:06.803
Yeah, give me more.

00:14:06.803 --> 00:14:09.327
- You probably get emails that go like,

00:14:09.327 --> 00:14:11.220
"I'm walking to the store."

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.420
- Oh man, I can't believe,
yeah, probably stuff like,

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.093
"What is he doing in
that abandoned apartment?

00:14:17.093 --> 00:14:19.477
"That apartment looks condemned."

00:14:19.477 --> 00:14:20.730
- "Where is his furniture?"

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:21.563
- Yeah.

00:14:21.563 --> 00:14:22.767
- [Sean] Yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:14:22.767 --> 00:14:23.600
- "Who is this girl?

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.097
"Why does she look so,
actually frightened?"

00:14:26.097 --> 00:14:29.347
- "Why is it gotta be a
black guy and a white girl?"

00:14:30.786 --> 00:14:32.957
- "What bone deficiency
does this villain have?

00:14:32.957 --> 00:14:34.979
"Why does he have bird chest?"

00:14:34.979 --> 00:14:36.250
(giggling)

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:39.457
- [Sean] And you know,
and this is the reality,

00:14:39.457 --> 00:14:44.260
that when this thing came out,
a lot of women wrote to me

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.569
and they said, "I never
thought about that!"

00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:48.570
And I said, "Yeah!"
(laughing)

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.680
- Thought about what, being raped?

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.800
(muffled laughing)

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.507
- [Sean] No, they never thought about,

00:14:53.507 --> 00:14:55.404
some of them wrote to me and said,

00:14:55.404 --> 00:14:58.747
"Ah, I've been to trap houses
with some of my friends,

00:14:58.747 --> 00:15:00.277
"and I never thought about that!

00:15:00.277 --> 00:15:04.040
"I've been to frat houses,
I never thought about that!"

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.820
And I'm like, "Well, it's
usually a guy ya know!"

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.045
You know?
- Yeah.

00:15:08.045 --> 00:15:12.020
- [Sean] And you have
these preconceived notions.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.330
And then, when it came down to,

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.980
just happened to be a black
man, and a white woman...

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:17.840
- Well.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.920
- [Sean] God did that one.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.550
I was just the guy pullin' the trigger.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:23.193
God did that (laughs) because I knew,

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.451
from the black community, I'm like,

00:15:25.451 --> 00:15:27.877
"Oh my god! Man, why's it always

00:15:27.877 --> 00:15:30.137
"got to be the brothers
doing this, going there?"

00:15:30.137 --> 00:15:32.497
And from the white community, I got,

00:15:32.497 --> 00:15:35.087
"See, I know! I knew
my neighbor next door,

00:15:35.087 --> 00:15:36.830
"he wants to F me, I knew it!"

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:38.169
That's all I would admit was,
- Yeah.

00:15:38.169 --> 00:15:40.469
- [Sean] You know, it's crazy.

00:15:40.469 --> 00:15:42.130
- Especially if you
live in a predominantly

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.067
white neighborhood, they're
always lookin' at you like,

00:15:44.067 --> 00:15:46.137
"Oh, look they're out
there watering their lawn,

00:15:46.137 --> 00:15:48.097
"just like us, sir, everything is fine."

00:15:48.097 --> 00:15:50.374
- "They have secrets, we all do!

00:15:50.374 --> 00:15:52.020
"Rabble rabble rabble!"
- You know, I mean.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:52.948
(laughing)

00:15:52.948 --> 00:15:56.010
- [Sean] See, for me,
I've always been blessed

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.960
to experience a lot of people.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.497
I grew, if you ever get ahold,

00:16:01.497 --> 00:16:03.570
and I'm pretty sure
people who grew up with me

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.610
are gonna start sending pictures in.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:08.120
And when I went to school
in my elementary school,

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.913
it looked like a UNICEF poster.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:15.770
So, I've (laughs) I've heard
every kinda ethnic slur

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.260
and name coming across to everybody.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.140
So, knowing what their hang-ups,

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.650
knowing how they felt, how
they dealt with it and--

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.870
- Well you know what's
funny, people have different

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.120
reactions to things, I think, because,

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.010
like Black Lou who works
here in the studio with us,

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:33.210
will tell us that, you know,
white kids growin' up used to

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.956
get time-out when they got in trouble.

00:16:34.956 --> 00:16:39.822
But, black kids got time-out
from whoppin' that ass.

00:16:39.822 --> 00:16:41.313
- Yeah.

00:16:41.313 --> 00:16:42.896
Absolutely.
- Oh yeah, that's real!

00:16:42.896 --> 00:16:43.729
- That is real.
- That's real.

00:16:43.729 --> 00:16:44.620
- Yeah, you know what else is real,

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.640
is like our producer Christine,

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.570
and you know, it's not only just race,

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:49.930
it's also gender, because like,

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.307
our producer Christine'll
always tell us like, you know,

00:16:52.307 --> 00:16:56.470
"Women be shoppin'! You can't
stop a woman from shoppin'!"

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:57.452
- [Sean] That's right.

00:16:57.452 --> 00:16:58.285
(stifled laughter)

00:16:58.285 --> 00:17:00.324
And it's, it's, and you know...

00:17:00.324 --> 00:17:01.897
- (stifled chuckling) I can't do this.

00:17:01.897 --> 00:17:03.170
- [Sean] It's just like
listenin' to the conversations

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:04.930
when people, when people are talking.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:09.040
I've had many of experiences,
different parts of the planet,

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.957
and the interactions, and they say,

00:17:10.957 --> 00:17:15.130
"Well, you speak with good diction."

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.783
I said, "I'm not that type
of guy, I'm not into dicks."

00:17:17.783 --> 00:17:19.987
And they're like, "What! Did
you just say that to me?"

00:17:19.987 --> 00:17:21.980
And you're like, "No."

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.390
Then I have to say, "I'll
translate it to you."

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:25.223
- Oh, yeah.

00:17:25.223 --> 00:17:27.717
- [Sean] "I speak this way,
because ten minutes ago,

00:17:27.717 --> 00:17:29.607
"I was just eating a white woman, so,

00:17:30.577 --> 00:17:32.657
"I haven't quite digested her."

00:17:32.657 --> 00:17:33.490
(chuckling)

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.970
And all the stereotypes will come out,

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.358
in the next five minutes
so you'll be fine.

00:17:37.358 --> 00:17:38.967
- And then they tell their
friends, and they're like,

00:17:38.967 --> 00:17:40.887
"Becky, Chad, come over here!"

00:17:40.887 --> 00:17:43.067
- They go, "Hey, everybody, get around!

00:17:43.067 --> 00:17:44.908
"Stop playing Frisbee, we gotta talk about

00:17:44.908 --> 00:17:47.877
"this black guy that's
eating white women!"

00:17:47.877 --> 00:17:48.710
- [Sean] Yep!

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:49.925
- This is my favorite
thing to worry about.

00:17:49.925 --> 00:17:50.758
- [Sean] And that's how real it is.

00:17:50.758 --> 00:17:53.310
But then again, a lot of my white friends

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.988
are more, some of them were more blacker

00:17:55.988 --> 00:17:57.704
than black people
- They'll be like,

00:17:57.704 --> 00:17:58.537
- [Sean] you know what I'm saying?

00:17:58.537 --> 00:18:00.727
- They'll be like, "Yo, I know you think

00:18:00.727 --> 00:18:03.696
"I smell like wet dog, right? Right?"

00:18:03.696 --> 00:18:06.986
- [Sean] Na, they wouldn't
even say that, they would say

00:18:06.986 --> 00:18:07.819
(snorting)

00:18:07.819 --> 00:18:09.413
you would think, I would not say anything.

00:18:09.413 --> 00:18:12.910
Because in the neighborhood
I grew up in, okay,

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.680
we were so tight and so close,

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.290
that anybody coming in from the outside,

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:20.350
you know, we could call each other names,

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.810
but nobody from the outside
could come in and do that.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.067
They'd be like, "Oh,
somebody's cousin came in,

00:18:26.067 --> 00:18:27.950
"and he starts calling somebody this."

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.658
And they say, "Hey man,
- Is anybody else having the

00:18:29.658 --> 00:18:30.491
- [Sean] "keep that in check.
- best time of their lives

00:18:30.491 --> 00:18:31.324
right now?

00:18:31.324 --> 00:18:32.157
- [Sean] "Because that's my friend."

00:18:32.157 --> 00:18:32.990
And, you know.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.823
- Yeah.

00:18:33.823 --> 00:18:35.510
- [Sean] You call some
Asian guy somethin',

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.090
and some Puerto Rican guy comes out

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.195
and starts whoppin' his ass.

00:18:38.195 --> 00:18:39.730
- Yeah, you never know
where it's gonna catch it.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:42.550
Sean, have you ever thought
about putting this all

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:45.640
together in one one-man show,

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.470
to hit the stage with it?
- Yes, I've actually thought

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.137
- [Bert] Because your voices are amazing.

00:18:49.137 --> 00:18:51.887
- [Sean] about producing a movie.

00:18:51.887 --> 00:18:55.940
So everybody can see the road I took.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.900
'Cause it's not easy, the gatekeepers

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.220
don't let somebody in like me.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.180
What they want, they want a Sean Fury,

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.701
and that's not my ego talkin'.

00:19:04.701 --> 00:19:06.383
- But they want that bullshit.

00:19:06.383 --> 00:19:09.310
- [Sean] Yeah, but they
want somebody who's a dummy.

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:10.411
- Yeah, they want you to play the game.

00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:12.303
They want you to be their, you know.

00:19:13.387 --> 00:19:14.810
- "Sign here, do this."

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.257
And before you know it,
all your money's gone.

00:19:16.257 --> 00:19:17.670
- "Hey, gimme all your black magic,

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.430
I'm gonna turn it into green gold."

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:21.740
- [Sean] Yeah, they show you the door.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:26.027
They're like, "This door,
some of your favorite people,

00:19:26.027 --> 00:19:28.930
"are under these, doing
things you don't wanna see."

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.910
Well, and there and then
it's this door, the exit.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:32.960
The get the hell outta here.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.040
- Yeah, let's, I mean let's
really do the voice right.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.357
They're like, "This door
has all the people inside

00:19:37.357 --> 00:19:39.758
"doing bad stuff. This door is the exit."

00:19:39.758 --> 00:19:41.350
- [Sean] Yeah.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:44.720
I've always been the type
of guy to stand on my own,

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:49.570
do it myself, and I have the persistence,

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.130
and I teach my kids the same thing.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.407
I say, "Listen, you wanna be successful,

00:19:53.407 --> 00:19:54.937
"you only need two things.

00:19:54.937 --> 00:19:57.697
"That's desire, and determination.

00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:01.147
"You have those two things,
you're gonna go places.

00:20:01.147 --> 00:20:04.557
"It'll take you longer,
tryin' to do it the right way,

00:20:04.557 --> 00:20:07.430
"but, you'll get there and it'll last."

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.030
- Sean Fury, I 100%
agree with you on that.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.150
- Hell yeah buddy.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:12.200
We really appreciate you callin' in, man.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.110
We're big fans, you are
next-level pop locker.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.150
I really think you should be doing, like,

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.200
putting this together in stage.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.150
Are you doing shows
while you're in Brazil?

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.800
You have anything you wanna plug?

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.720
- [Sean] Yeah, I'm actually doing some.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.120
We're working on some other things because

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:32.120
in the Sean Fury story, I
actually recorded some stuff.

00:20:33.589 --> 00:20:38.589
I sent LJ some music,
'cause a lot of people say,

00:20:38.837 --> 00:20:41.110
"Oh, he's trying to do Michael Jackson."

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.740
Or, "He's trying to do that."

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.573
- No.

00:20:43.573 --> 00:20:44.634
- [Sean] You know, I'm
a fan of everybody who's

00:20:44.634 --> 00:20:45.890
- (laughing) No.
- touched the mic before me,

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.480
during me, and after me.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.760
And it hasn't been released,
it's an homage to Michael,

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.949
'cause I actually wrote a couple of songs,

00:20:54.949 --> 00:20:58.010
if you've seen the video Thriller,

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.730
I actually wrote that
to perform with Michael,

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:01.590
but then he died.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.410
And then, I did a song--
- Wait, you said,

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:05.048
wait, wait, hold on, Sean, I'm sorry.

00:21:05.048 --> 00:21:05.881
(laughter)

00:21:05.881 --> 00:21:07.977
Did you just say you wrote Thriller?

00:21:07.977 --> 00:21:10.170
- [Sean] No, not Thriller.
- No, not the Thriller.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:13.213
- [Sean] My song was called A Thriller.

00:21:13.213 --> 00:21:14.920
- So you could see how I
could misconceive (laughing)

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.030
you could see how I
could misperceive that.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.240
- [Sean] Dan, do you know
what kinda controversy

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.850
you just caused from that statement?

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:23.355
I will get hate mail in the mail--

00:21:23.355 --> 00:21:24.188
- I am so sorry.
- Did you write the song

00:21:24.188 --> 00:21:25.304
Billy Jean King?

00:21:25.304 --> 00:21:26.142
(laughter)

00:21:26.142 --> 00:21:27.894
- Yeah (chuckles), I
wrote the song Beat It,

00:21:27.894 --> 00:21:29.406
and Get Outta Here (laughs).

00:21:29.406 --> 00:21:30.676
- [Jay] Beat It, seriously.

00:21:30.676 --> 00:21:32.970
- Beat It with an explanation point.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.580
- [Sean] I could hear them now.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.230
I could hear them now,
they're like, "Wait a minute!"

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.910
Check this out, I've got stories

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:41.837
that you guys wouldn't even believe.

00:21:41.837 --> 00:21:43.170
And the people that were there

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:44.983
will tell you that it's hilarious.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.630
I'll tell you a quick, quick story.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.750
It won't be a Bill Cosby-like lesson.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.683
It'll be like, I almost had
a fight with Mike Tyson.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.659
And this was fresh after
he broke up with Robin,

00:21:56.659 --> 00:21:57.596
(laughter)

00:21:57.596 --> 00:21:59.917
so you know he was a little,
a little different then.

00:21:59.917 --> 00:22:00.750
- [Bert] Is this real?

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:01.583
- Not Mike Tyson now.
- Oh yeah, he was ready to go.

00:22:01.583 --> 00:22:02.416
He was ready to rock.

00:22:02.416 --> 00:22:03.885
- He was champ then, remember.
- Yeah.

00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:06.197
He was droppin' everyone,
including Robin, hello.

00:22:06.197 --> 00:22:07.570
- I with he would get in my way.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.500
- [Sean] I met him at a Bobby Brown party.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.305
And, this chick was screamin' at him,

00:22:13.305 --> 00:22:16.410
at the top of her lungs,
'cause he was messin' around

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.720
with some other chicks in the VIP room.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.553
- Okay, yeah.

00:22:19.553 --> 00:22:20.563
- [Sean] And here I am.

00:22:21.464 --> 00:22:25.350
Here I am, I see him earlier,
'cause I'm in the VIP room.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:26.890
I used to get into these clubs,

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.420
people thought I was Ralph
Tresvant from New Edition.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.210
I used to get into a lotta
clubs, I used to get guys

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.730
wanna beat me up thinkin'
I was Ralph Tresvant

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:39.020
from New Edition, if I show
you some earlier photos,

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.900
and you put him and
me, you'll say, "What!"

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:42.746
- I see it.
- Even when I met all of these

00:22:42.746 --> 00:22:44.310
guys, they were sayin'
- I see it, oh yeah, Bert.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:45.869
- the same thing.
- Oh yeah, I see it.

00:22:45.869 --> 00:22:46.790
- [Sean] And, so.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.885
- Yeah, Bert and I definitely see it.

00:22:48.885 --> 00:22:53.885
- [Sean] And so, he, to
make a long story short,

00:22:55.164 --> 00:22:57.450
I ran into him later on that night,

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:00.330
and this chick was makin'
this man's face contort

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:03.380
into five different
pieces, and he looked at me

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.016
like he wanted to put a hole
in my chest wit his fist.

00:23:06.016 --> 00:23:11.016
And I told the man, you
know how it is in the VIP,

00:23:11.065 --> 00:23:13.975
if you're in the VIP
room, you can't be soft,

00:23:13.975 --> 00:23:16.400
because people start treatin'
you like you're soft,

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.360
and, you know,
- It's like prison rules

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.193
up there.
- You become somebody's bitch!

00:23:19.193 --> 00:23:20.089
- Like the yard.

00:23:20.089 --> 00:23:22.060
- [Sean] You know what goes on, alright.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.152
- I set the rules, what
happens in VIP stays in VIP.

00:23:25.152 --> 00:23:28.240
- [Sean] You damn right, but
this story is so hilarious,

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.217
if you see, you'd be like,

00:23:29.217 --> 00:23:32.060
"No, it could not have happened that way."

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:36.370
And so, I'm standin' there,
and me bein' from New York,

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:38.370
you know New Yorkers,
they have an attitude,

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.005
they have a we don't
play that shit, you know?

00:23:41.005 --> 00:23:41.838
- Straight-up.

00:23:41.838 --> 00:23:42.671
- [Sean] He's from New York, I'm New York.

00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:44.930
I don't play that shit, you
don't play that shit, so.

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:48.081
I turned around, and this man grabbed my,

00:23:48.081 --> 00:23:51.738
I told him, because
everybody's watchin' me,

00:23:51.738 --> 00:23:54.340
and they're watchin' him, they
gonna see how this reacts.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.470
He probably gonna remember this.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:59.040
And he says, and I said to
him, I said, "Calm down, baby!

00:23:59.040 --> 00:23:59.885
(alcohol gurgles)

00:23:59.885 --> 00:24:01.430
"If you lose 200 pounds,
I will bust your ass!"

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:02.263
(laughter)

00:24:02.263 --> 00:24:03.895
I tried to walk off like
I was Bruce Lee, you know?

00:24:03.895 --> 00:24:04.728
And everybody's lookin' at me like, wow,

00:24:04.728 --> 00:24:05.561
he said that shit and he's still livin'?

00:24:05.561 --> 00:24:06.394
- Yeah.

00:24:06.394 --> 00:24:07.227
- [Sean] So I turned
my back, and my friends

00:24:07.227 --> 00:24:08.060
stepped away from me when I said that.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:08.893
I had friends, one of my
friends looked like Will Smith,

00:24:08.893 --> 00:24:09.726
he was tall, and everybody
just said, "Excuse me."

00:24:09.726 --> 00:24:10.559
And they moved outta the
way, to let this man decide

00:24:10.559 --> 00:24:11.392
whether he wants to
put me in the hospital.

00:24:11.392 --> 00:24:12.225
But I'm cool, I'm turnin' 'round like,

00:24:12.225 --> 00:24:13.058
I'll whoop everybody's ass in here.

00:24:13.058 --> 00:24:13.891
Now, quite naturally,
if he lost 200 pounds,

00:24:13.891 --> 00:24:14.724
I would've outweighed
him, and in that day,

00:24:14.724 --> 00:24:15.557
I wasn't fat then, alright?

00:24:15.557 --> 00:24:16.390
I'm not like Martin, fat
Martin and skinny Martin.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:17.223
So, I turned around, and this man came,

00:24:17.223 --> 00:24:18.056
took up all of my forearm,
and he grabbed me,

00:24:18.056 --> 00:24:21.400
and I'm looking, and he can't see my face,

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.233
and I said, "Aw, shit,
he's gonna hit me in here,

00:24:22.233 --> 00:24:23.066
"and everybody's gonna
say I started the fight,

00:24:23.066 --> 00:24:23.899
"I'll be on the news."

00:24:23.899 --> 00:24:24.732
I turned back around, and I
put my baddest face on, like,

00:24:24.732 --> 00:24:25.565
Huh!

00:24:25.565 --> 00:24:26.398
Huhyulh, huh!

00:24:26.398 --> 00:24:27.231
And he gave me a pound and he
was like, "Alright, we cool."

00:24:27.231 --> 00:24:28.064
I was like, "Phew! This
coulda got ugly, man."

00:24:28.064 --> 00:24:33.064
- (laughing) Mike Tyson goes,
"Your mouth works out a bit."

00:24:33.064 --> 00:24:33.897
(chuckling)

00:24:33.897 --> 00:24:38.730
- Yeah, he goes, "You know
what? I just did it in my head.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:39.563
"You're right."

00:24:39.563 --> 00:24:40.396
- You're right.

00:24:40.396 --> 00:24:41.229
- He goes, "Huh, hah, huh?"
- Yeah.

00:24:41.229 --> 00:24:42.062
- "Escue me, are you
saying my current weight,

00:24:42.062 --> 00:24:42.895
"or the heaviest I've ever been?"

00:24:42.895 --> 00:24:43.728
- Those are the noises that shut him off.

00:24:43.728 --> 00:24:44.561
- [Sean] I'm tellin' you.

00:24:44.561 --> 00:24:45.394
(bleeping decrescendo)

00:24:45.394 --> 00:24:46.227
(cackling)

00:24:46.227 --> 00:24:47.060
- [Sean] All kinds, man
like I said, story after

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:47.893
(robotic whoosh)

00:24:47.893 --> 00:24:48.726
story after story.
(robotic whoosh)

00:24:48.726 --> 00:24:49.559
- Well Sean, thank you
very much for callin' in,

00:24:49.559 --> 00:24:50.392
we appreciate it.
- Hey Sean, can I

00:24:50.392 --> 00:24:51.225
plant one seed?

00:24:51.225 --> 00:24:52.058
Your next music video, I know two guys

00:24:52.058 --> 00:24:52.891
who would love to be the actors in it.

00:24:52.891 --> 00:24:53.724
- This is Bert Kreischer, Secret Time's,

00:24:53.724 --> 00:24:54.557
new special's out on Netflix
right now, comedy special.

00:24:54.557 --> 00:24:55.390
- So he ain't bullshittin'.

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:56.223
- Um, yeah.

00:24:56.223 --> 00:24:57.056
- [Sean] Well, you guys, hey.

00:24:57.056 --> 00:24:57.889
You guys set it up, hey,
I'll put up, you know,

00:24:57.889 --> 00:24:58.722
I'd love to do a comedy
show and some movies

00:24:58.722 --> 00:24:59.555
and everything like that.

00:24:59.555 --> 00:25:00.388
You guys are connected there, you know?

00:25:00.388 --> 00:25:01.221
I mean, you guys could,
it's Comedy Central, hey.

00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:02.054
- I'll be dead serious, I'll pay for,

00:25:02.054 --> 00:25:02.887
we'll pick the song, and
we want you to direct it

00:25:02.887 --> 00:25:03.720
like you normally do, your artistic view,

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.553
and we'll be the actors,
we've got a big cast here.

00:25:04.553 --> 00:25:05.386
- Perfect, we got seven
cast members already.

00:25:05.386 --> 00:25:06.219
- [Sean] Hey, we can put
that together, you know,

00:25:06.219 --> 00:25:11.052
I'm very grateful, this comes
from the bottom of my heart,

00:25:11.052 --> 00:25:13.650
that you guys, you know, are pushing me.

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.443
'Cause, you know, sometimes
I still get people emailin'

00:25:15.443 --> 00:25:16.276
and all kinds of stuff,
- Oh, just like, "Sean Fury,

00:25:16.276 --> 00:25:17.109
- I get hate and like...
- "what's up with your fuckin'

00:25:17.109 --> 00:25:17.942
"music, it's."

00:25:17.942 --> 00:25:18.775
- It's crazy, it's like--

00:25:18.775 --> 00:25:19.608
- You can't, haters are gonna
hate, Sean, you know that.

00:25:19.608 --> 00:25:20.441
- You know what you should tell 'em?

00:25:20.441 --> 00:25:21.274
Lose 200 pounds, I'll fuck you up.

00:25:21.274 --> 00:25:22.107
- [Dan] Boom!
- Yeah.

00:25:22.107 --> 00:25:22.940
That should be the title of a song,

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:23.773
(lauging)

00:25:23.773 --> 00:25:24.606
Lose 200 Pounds I'll Fuck You Up.

00:25:24.606 --> 00:25:25.439
- [Sean] That's right, there it is.

00:25:25.439 --> 00:25:26.272
- Sean, you have a great time in Brazil.

00:25:26.272 --> 00:25:27.105
Be careful, some of the
prettiest chicks there are dudes.

00:25:27.105 --> 00:25:27.938
But that really could be
a whole new concept album,

00:25:27.938 --> 00:25:28.771
my friend.
- Hell yeah.

00:25:28.771 --> 00:25:29.604
- Sean Fury, joining us
on The Bonfire everybody.

00:25:29.604 --> 00:25:30.437

- Well let's call, but let's--

we'll talk with Bert Kreischer.

00:25:35.435 --> 00:25:36.268
And I got a feeling this
next hour's gonna fly.

00:25:36.268 --> 00:25:37.101
- Yeah, I gotta pee.
- Alright.

00:25:37.101 --> 00:25:37.934
- I gotta pee, because it's
- Yeah.

00:25:37.934 --> 00:25:38.767

00:25:38.767 --> 00:25:39.600
Let's go.
- Yeah. Alright.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.433
You know we'll be back
everybody, it's The Bonfire.

00:25:40.433 --> 00:25:41.266
(fire crackling)

00:25:41.266 --> 00:25:42.099
- Bam, endless hits.

00:25:42.099 --> 00:25:47.099
- (singing) My girl.
- (singing) My girl!

00:25:47.099 --> 00:25:47.932
- Oh, by the way, that wasn't
The Temptations My Girl,

00:25:47.932 --> 00:25:48.765
his song is called My Girl is For Me.

00:25:48.765 --> 00:25:49.598
He ain't sayin' he wrote
The Temptations My Girl.

00:25:49.598 --> 00:25:50.431
- Brilliant.

00:25:50.431 --> 00:25:51.264
Have you ever heard his
song Welcome to the Jungle?

00:25:51.264 --> 00:25:52.097
(laughter)

00:25:52.097 --> 00:25:57.014
- Oh, dude, yeah, I mean, he
wrote one of my favorite songs

00:25:57.014 --> 00:25:57.847
Comfortably Numb, goddamnit.

00:25:57.847 --> 00:25:58.680
- Not that one, though.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.513
- Yeah, man, it like--

00:25:59.513 --> 00:26:00.346
- Not that Comfortably Numb.

00:26:00.346 --> 00:26:01.179
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:26:01.179 --> 00:26:02.012
He misspelled numb.

00:26:02.012 --> 00:26:02.845
- I can only say, probably
the best interview

00:26:02.845 --> 00:26:03.678
we've ever done.

00:26:03.678 --> 00:26:04.511
I mean, gripping, riveting.
- Never had more fun

00:26:04.511 --> 00:26:05.344
on the radio.

00:26:05.344 --> 00:26:10.344
- When he said, "I wrote
Thriller," I fucking looked at you.

00:26:10.344 --> 00:26:11.177
(laughter)

00:26:11.177 --> 00:26:12.010
- Yeah, and that's when I was like,

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:12.843
"Are you saying you wrote Thriller?"

00:26:12.843 --> 00:26:13.676
And he's like, "Fuck".

00:26:13.676 --> 00:26:14.509
And he's like, "No."

00:26:14.509 --> 00:26:15.342
Like I was the asshole.

00:26:15.342 --> 00:26:16.175
I go, "You just said you wrote Thriller."

00:26:16.175 --> 00:26:17.008
He goes, "Aw, well you just,"

00:26:17.008 --> 00:26:17.841
by the way, I don't know--

00:26:17.841 --> 00:26:18.674
- (laughing) No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:26:18.674 --> 00:26:19.507
All need to better by, I
had a lot of girls watching

00:26:19.507 --> 00:26:20.340
that video and go, "I
never thought about that!"

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.173
(laughing)

00:26:21.173 --> 00:26:22.006
- Yeah, he goes, I could be--

00:26:22.006 --> 00:26:27.006
- That I could be
brutally raped (cackling).

00:26:27.006 --> 00:26:27.839
- Yeah, in a frat house, and at first

00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:28.672
I thought he said a trap house.

00:26:28.672 --> 00:26:29.505
- [Jay] He did, he did.
- I go,

00:26:29.505 --> 00:26:30.338
you're in a, he did?
- He did say it, he did

00:26:30.338 --> 00:26:31.171
he said trap and then frat.
- You're in a crack house,

00:26:31.171 --> 00:26:32.004
and you didn't think, you don't
think they're selling drugs

00:26:32.004 --> 00:26:32.837
and there might be some
rape going on occasionally?

00:26:32.837 --> 00:26:33.670
- People ain't willing to
talk about the real shit.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:34.503
- Dude.
- Oh, fuck.

00:26:34.503 --> 00:26:35.336
- Can I just tell you right now,

00:26:35.336 --> 00:26:36.169
I was blown away by that interview.

00:26:36.169 --> 00:26:37.002
At multiple points in the interview was I,

00:26:37.002 --> 00:26:37.835
was I a little like, "Oh
shit, this really got,

00:26:37.835 --> 00:26:38.668
"this guy is who he really is."

00:26:38.668 --> 00:26:39.501
- Blown away by what just
happened in this room.

00:26:39.501 --> 00:26:40.334
- But then I realized, the
delusion comes because,

00:26:40.334 --> 00:26:41.167
I don't think he knows
how large our audience is.

00:26:41.167 --> 00:26:42.000
I love the size of our
audience, but he was like,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:42.833
"Guys gettin' the blogs after me."

00:26:42.833 --> 00:26:43.666
I'm like, "No, that's not gonna happen."

00:26:43.666 --> 00:26:48.499
- Dude, it's got nothing to
do with the value of our show.

00:26:48.499 --> 00:26:49.332
- Not the value of our audience, the size.

00:26:49.332 --> 00:26:50.165
- We've had a bunch of blogs written

00:26:50.165 --> 00:26:50.998
about things on the show,
good or bad, you know?

00:26:50.998 --> 00:26:51.831
- Yeah.

00:26:51.831 --> 00:26:52.664
- But, I don't know if
they're gonna write one

00:26:52.664 --> 00:26:53.497
about Sean Fury, a blog about this?

00:26:53.497 --> 00:26:54.330
- Well that's what he said, he's like,

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:55.163
"Oh, you guys are gonna
get the press all over me."

00:26:55.163 --> 00:26:55.996
- [Jay] Oh man, that's all I need.

00:26:55.996 --> 00:26:56.829
- Now all I need.
- That's all I need again.

00:26:56.829 --> 00:27:01.746
- I'm in here in Brazil, tryin'
to get back with my family.

00:27:01.746 --> 00:27:02.579
By the way, every time you
asked him a funny question,

00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:03.412
there was a five minute wait to rebuttal.

00:27:03.412 --> 00:27:04.245
(chuckling)

00:27:04.245 --> 00:27:05.078
And there was always just a sidestep.

00:27:05.078 --> 00:27:05.911
- He'd always go, "Yeah,
you know it." You know?

00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:06.744
- Yeah, that was, great job LJ.

00:27:06.744 --> 00:27:07.577
- [LJ] (laughing) Oh, no.

00:27:07.577 --> 00:27:08.410
- No, that was good.
- Yeah you're no longer

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:09.243
Black Lou.

00:27:09.243 --> 00:27:10.076
- [Jay] LJ!
- LJ!

00:27:10.076 --> 00:27:10.909
- LJ, fuck Larry Johnson,
you're no longer Black Lou.

00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:11.742
- Can I simply say one thing?

00:27:11.742 --> 00:27:12.575
- Hell yeah.

00:27:12.575 --> 00:27:13.408
- I don't think he's in Brazil.

00:27:13.408 --> 00:27:14.241
- [Dan] You think he's just
in Patterson, New Jersey?`

00:27:14.241 --> 00:27:15.074
- Yeah.

00:27:15.074 --> 00:27:15.907
- Just takin' a call in the back?

00:27:15.907 --> 00:27:16.740
- [Jay] Well, say what?

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:17.573
- And by the way, that might
be the most brilliant thing

00:27:17.573 --> 00:27:18.406
I'll start doing when I do call-ins.

00:27:18.406 --> 00:27:19.239
- [Dan] Call in from an international?

00:27:19.239 --> 00:27:20.072
- I'm in Hong Kong.

00:27:20.072 --> 00:27:20.905
- [Dan] International Bert Kreischer?

00:27:20.905 --> 00:27:21.738
- Why wouldn't you be?
- Dude that's so great.

00:27:21.738 --> 00:27:22.571
- I'll tell you, Lou had to call him

00:27:22.571 --> 00:27:23.404
on one of those like, zero, zero, zero,

00:27:23.404 --> 00:27:24.237
something one, four,
eight, five, six, one.

00:27:24.237 --> 00:27:25.070
- [Bert] I'm gonna start
telling people I'm in Brazil.

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.903
- Do it. I like it. And you know what?

00:27:25.903 --> 00:27:26.736
Besides us, and the
listeners that are listening

00:27:26.736 --> 00:27:27.569
right now, I won't blow it for ya.

00:27:27.569 --> 00:27:32.402
I'll go, "Did you talk to Bert?
Where in the world is he?"

00:27:32.402 --> 00:27:33.235
- Oh, hey guys, it's Bert, I'm in Paris.

00:27:33.235 --> 00:27:34.068
It's like a Scott Peterson thing.

00:27:34.068 --> 00:27:34.901
- Yeah, yeah.

00:27:34.901 --> 00:27:39.901
- (laughing) Do you remember
when Scott Peterson did that?

00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:40.734
- Yeah, he's like, I'm in Thailand.

00:27:40.734 --> 00:27:41.567
I'm in Bangkok right now for the weekend.

00:27:41.567 --> 00:27:42.400
- I'm in a hot air
balloon over Deutschland.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.233
- I'm at the Reykjavík funny bone.

00:27:43.233 --> 00:27:44.066
- Oh my god.

00:27:44.066 --> 00:27:44.899
- For Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

00:27:44.899 --> 00:27:45.732
- How fucking funny, oh my god.

00:27:45.732 --> 00:27:46.565
I'm gonna set up a press tour, on phone,

00:27:46.565 --> 00:27:47.398
and just get sound effects.

00:27:47.398 --> 00:27:48.231
- Yeah. Just like stream balloons.

00:27:48.231 --> 00:27:53.231
- I'm in a hot air balloon
(loud whirly gurgle).

00:27:53.231 --> 00:27:54.064
(laughing)

00:27:54.064 --> 00:27:58.981
- They go, "Bert you're living
a very," it's the interviews

00:27:58.981 --> 00:27:59.814
you could tell they don't
give a shit about you.

00:27:59.814 --> 00:28:00.647
Where they're like, "What are
you up to, Bert Kreischer?"

00:28:00.647 --> 00:28:05.647
- In the background you hear
(singing) "come with me, and"

00:28:05.647 --> 00:28:06.480
you go, "'Scuse me for a
second, guys, 'Shut up, Wonka!'"

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.313
(laughing)

00:28:07.313 --> 00:28:08.146
- I'm on the phone.
- Sorry.

00:28:08.146 --> 00:28:08.979
What were you saying, scooter in the buzz?

00:28:08.979 --> 00:28:09.812
Mornings on
- I'm on the phone with,

00:28:09.812 --> 00:28:10.645
- Akron, Ohio's number one rock station.

00:28:10.645 --> 00:28:11.478
- with the bone.

00:28:11.478 --> 00:28:16.478
- (laughing) Up next,
we got Bert Kreischer.

00:28:16.478 --> 00:28:17.311
Bert Kresicher, how you doing?

00:28:17.311 --> 00:28:18.144
"First rule of fight club!"

00:28:18.144 --> 00:28:18.977
"I'm sorry, I'm at my
fight club." (laughing)

00:28:18.977 --> 00:28:19.810
- Yeah, yeah.

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:24.810
- Bert Kreischer callin'
in (screams in Russian).

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:25.643
He's in Siberia, I forgot
he's doing a weekend there.

00:28:25.643 --> 00:28:30.643
- (laughing) I like how he goes,
"First rule of fight club!"

00:28:30.643 --> 00:28:31.476
He goes, "Oh, sorry, I
can't talk about Fight Club.

00:28:31.476 --> 00:28:36.143
(laughing) "Wait, no I can't, nothin'."

00:28:36.143 --> 00:28:36.976
- Oh, you know what?
- I'm nowhere.

00:28:36.976 --> 00:28:37.809
- He just told me again, he does it

00:28:37.809 --> 00:28:38.642
like he's hearing rule two,
"Yeah, they just said it again.

00:28:38.642 --> 00:28:39.475
"I can't talk about it."

00:28:39.475 --> 00:28:40.308
- I heard Zach Galifianakis
do a call-in on time,

00:28:40.308 --> 00:28:41.141
and he had a chainsaw with him
- That is awesome.

00:28:41.141 --> 00:28:41.974
- and he called in, and they're like,

00:28:41.974 --> 00:28:42.807
"We got Zach on the phone,
Zach are you there?"

00:28:42.807 --> 00:28:43.640
He goes, "Yeah, hold on (vrooming)."

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.640
And you just hear the chainsaw
(buzzing) and he's like,

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.473
"Stop it! Sorry, we're building
a tree house." (laughs)

00:28:49.473 --> 00:28:50.306
- Yeah, that's great.

00:28:50.306 --> 00:28:51.139
I think you should go
international full-on lock.

00:28:51.139 --> 00:28:51.972
- Why wouldn't you have
more fun with your call-ins?

00:28:51.972 --> 00:28:52.805
- I mean, Sean Fury's just
straight-up international.

00:28:52.805 --> 00:28:53.638
- He was wonderful.
- Yeah.

00:28:53.638 --> 00:28:54.471
- [Bert] What do you
think production costs

00:28:54.471 --> 00:28:55.304
on one of his videos, five grand?

00:28:55.304 --> 00:28:56.137
- $200.

00:28:56.137 --> 00:28:56.970
- What? (laughs)

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:57.803
- Are you talking about for catering?

00:28:57.803 --> 00:28:58.636
If you're talking about
catering for everyone

00:28:58.636 --> 00:28:59.469
that was involved, $135.

00:28:59.469 --> 00:29:00.302
- I'll tell you right now, alright,

00:29:00.302 --> 00:29:01.135
as God as my witness, I would pay,

00:29:01.135 --> 00:29:01.968
I'll pay five thousand dollars,

00:29:01.968 --> 00:29:02.801
if I can put it on my YouTube channel?

00:29:02.801 --> 00:29:03.634
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:29:03.634 --> 00:29:04.467
- To produce a Sean Fury
video with all of us in it.

00:29:04.467 --> 00:29:05.300
(excited sigh)

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.133
Sean doin' the singing to the camera,

00:29:06.133 --> 00:29:06.966
and all of us are acting
out the scene behind him.

00:29:06.966 --> 00:29:07.799
- [Dan] Can we write?

00:29:07.799 --> 00:29:08.632
- I'll pay five thousand dollars.

00:29:08.632 --> 00:29:09.465
- Can we write the story, of the video?

00:29:09.465 --> 00:29:10.298
- [Bert] Nu-uh, I want Sean to do it.

00:29:10.298 --> 00:29:15.215
- You're right, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, I want Sean to do it.

00:29:15.215 --> 00:29:16.048
- Can I just apologize?
- What do you think?

00:29:16.048 --> 00:29:16.881
This is his vision, man.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:29:16.881 --> 00:29:17.714
- [Bert] Yeah.

00:29:17.714 --> 00:29:18.547
(heavy guitar chords)

00:29:18.547 --> 00:29:19.380
(fire crackling)

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.713
(loud boom)

00:29:27.124 --> 00:29:29.291
(beeping)
