What is reddit?

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:05.570
For much of The Internet reddit is the gateway
to everything interesting going on in the

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.910
world.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.090
Checking reddit.com is like reading the daily
newspaper except that reddit is

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.200
- timely
- interactive

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.490
- personalized
- participatory

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.769
- horrifilying absorbing at times

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.150
...basically, *good*.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.060
The way it works is that people submit links
to reddit (blog posts or images or videos)

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.169
and other people vote those links up or down.
It's a simple idea but it makes reddit into

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.739
a list of the best stuff that people are reading
or watching on The Internet right now.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.339
The name is a contraction of 'Read It' as
in: I already read it on Reddit, which if

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.239
you spend significant time on the site, is
what you'll say to everyone who tries to show

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.190
you anything. It's a kind of awesome curse.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.230
Because there are no editors on reddit you
never know what you're going to find but you

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.920
can bet it's going to be funny or interesting
or enranging because 1,000s of other people

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.460
have already voted that it's something to
see.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.730
Think of it this way: if Google is where you
go to search for things, then reddit is where

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.289
you go to see the things that people have
found.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.320
But reddit is not just one list of stuff:
reddit is a beautiful fractal with sections,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.440
called subreddits.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.820
If you just like politics or programming or
funny image captions or sports or world news

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.870
there are subreddits that list only that stuff.
And there's going to be a subreddit for your

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.900
city or country or region.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.330
Love a TV show that ended years ago? There's
a subreddit where people are still talking

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.010
about it as though it just aired.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.100
Tech have geeks their technology and flag
geeks have their vexillology and -- and on

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.250
the off chance you're interested in something
the doesn't yet exist, just press a button

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.060
and a new subreddit is born.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.720
Each subreddit works just like the main page:
an updating list of interesting stuff according

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.390
to the people interested in that stuff.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.880
And when a subreddit grows large it can be
terrifyingly good at this: for example AWW,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.950
a section devoted to adorableness, is a GLOBAL
24-HOUR-A-DAY BATTLE TO FIND THE CUTEST IMAGES

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.680
EVAR!

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.310
Turns out if you give people with baby animal
photos a place to have their baby animal photos

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.530
compete the result is the highest density
of cuteness human civilization has yet created.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.020
But without editors running the site, how
does that sorting process work? There's no

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.670
time to get into the code, but you can think
of it like this:

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.440
Links people sumbit are balloons floating
up and down the list. When someone votes up

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.800
a link it adds a bit of helium and a down
votes sucks out little bit of helium. Periodically

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.240
reddit puts weights on all of the balloons
-- giving newer links that show up later a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.380
chance to compete against the ones that have
been around longer.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.530
This method is shockingly good at sorting
stuff, be it international politics or pictures

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.400
of computer setups.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.150
Of course, when a website covers the whole
of human endeavor things get weird: like subreddits

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.980
for only photos of birds... with arms or only
photos of hitler... with socks and then there

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.970
are always the other kinds of photos humans
like to look at and sometimes collections

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.080
of horrifying things that cannot be unseen.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.480
So yeah, this has taken a turn for the worse.
But remember reddit can be weird not because

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.310
reddit is weird but because humans are weird.
And the great thing about reddit is that it

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.480
changes to suite you: as you join subreddits
you like and leave those you don't the main

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.410
page becomes *yours*: listing all the best
stuff from all the subreddits you follow and

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.710
leaving out stuff from the ones you don't.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.030
So reddit is lot like life: it is what you
make it.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.819
But links are only the tip of the redditberg,
because people can discuss the links and this

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.030
is where the true heart of reddit lies.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.990
Most forums on The Internet are hideous, but
Reddit ain't your grandma's bulletin board.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.060
Just as that baloon sort method finds the
best links there's some math that's more complicated

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.260
(and less explainable) that finds the most
interesting comments in a discussion and brings

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.780
them to the top. And reddit displays comments
in a way that encourages back-and-forth discussions.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.080
(Unlike some *other* comment systems).

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.240
This sorting and threading means that the
discussion of a link on reddit is always more

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.030
interesting than the link itself.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.930
So there are subreddits that are nothing *but*
discussion: such as Change My View for debates

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.060
or Ask A Scientist where experts answer questions.
Or there1s 'IamA' where people say what they

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.340
are "I am a fireman" or "I am an Escort" or
"I am a prison guard" and answer questions

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.340
from the comments.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.040
And because people on reddit are anonymous,
discussions are way more interesting and open

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.670
than if people were forced to use their real
names. ::cough:: YouTube &amp; Google+ Integration ::cough::

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.920
 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.930
Though, with anonymity you'll find that not
everyone's private thoughts exposed are beautiful.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.959
And sometimes it can be uncomfortable to see
what the faceless group thinks about a topic.

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.470
But luckily reddit has a way to deal with
comments you think are unhelpful. And despite

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.110
people who act badly it's clear that reddit
can only exist because the majority of people,

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.150
even when anonymous, are good.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.489
But this anonymity isn't required, however
so you'll also find Actors and Authors, Presidents

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.840
and prime ministers all on reddit answering
questions from the community.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.440
And reddit really is a community with it's
own culture and history and that increasingly

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.420
has an effect on the physical world with things
like: meeting up in person and raising money

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.579
for charity and defending the Internet and
helping a family be with their sick child

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.169
and holding the word's largest secret santa
and sending teachers the supplies they need.

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.189
With its rapid-fire democracy and shocking
quick reactions, reddit can sometimes makes

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:32.490
you feel more like a citizen of the Internet
than a citizen of your own country.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.939
But in the end it's hard to understand reddit
without just jumping in and commenting and

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:40.300
voting, which you really should. And once
you get the hang of the place, you'll wonder

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.900
how you ever Internetted before.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.289
[After credits]

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:58.289
P.S. If you are already a user of reddit and
love the site, you should consider buying

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.949
some reddit gold to support it. I was surprised
to learn while making this video that despite

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.370
its increasing popularity reddit still isn't
profitable. So if, like me, you use reddit

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.219
*all day* it's more than worth a couple bucks
a month.
