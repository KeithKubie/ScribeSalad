00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.300
Kyle Hebert: Last time on Nostalgia Critic Z...

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.680
Critic was confronting the worst anime adaptation of all time.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.360
No, the other one.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.780
There ya go.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.160
NC: So, shitty movie, you think you can piss off a legion of fans with your misunderstanding of source material?

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.280
Your silence only enables your guiltiness! Now I will show you the meaning of pain!

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.240
???: You can't fight this evil alone!

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.800
Kyle Hebert: MasakoX from TeamFourStar joins Nostalgia Critic's fight.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.980
NC: MasakoX from TeamFourStar! You've come to join my fight?

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.180
Kyle Hebert: I totally just said that.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.100
MasakoX: You need a true Dragon Ball fan to understand this outrage!

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.320
NC: What do you know about Dragon Ball that I don't?

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.180
MasakoX: Plenty, like how we cut to the extreme wide shots to save on lip animation,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.400
and your anger over this will be represented by zoom-out, combined with grunting and clenching your teeth with your eye twitching.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.320
NC: Grunt! Grunt!

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.920
MasakoX: Now I will fight you by doing the same move repeatedly and you doing the same dodge repeatedly!

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.660
???: You fools are missing the real enemy!

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.820
Kyle Hebert: LittleKuriboh comes to talk sense into the feuding heroes.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.560
MasakoX: So, LittleKuriboh, you've come to talk sense to us, the feuding heroes?

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.020
Kyle Hebert: Am I just not here, or-

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.860
NC: Get out of here, Yu-Gi-Blow! You're not even from the right anime!

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.620
LittleKuriboh: Maybe, but I'm smart enough to know that while you two were bitching like pansies, your opponent is building his power!

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.600
NC: My God, he's going Stupid Saiyan!

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.940
MasakoX: It's OK, this usually lasts 10 minutes.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.240
There's surprisingly little fighting in the show. It's mostly us screaming while rocks rise up.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.300
LittleKuriboh: But he's using his Stupid Saiyan power to make stupid people say his movie is good!

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.960
MasakoX: What?

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.420
NC: IMPOSSIBLE!

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.280
LittleKuriboh: Just check out its critical score!

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.500
IT'S OVER 9%!

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.380
NC: What? 9%? There's no way that can be right, CAN IT?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.640
LittleKuriboh: People who don't know the show are being duped into thinking it's good!

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.240
MasakoX: We can't let it get away with that!

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.640
LittleKuriboh: Agreed! Let dueling sides join forces just this once!

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.840
MasakoX: And by once, we mean probably many times!

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.060
NC: ATTACK!

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.560
NC: ATTACK!
MasakoX: AAAHHH!

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.300
NC: ATTACK!
MasakoX: AAAHHH!
LittleKuriboh: AAAHHH!

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.800
NC: In a long line of botched live action anime adaptations, Dragonball Evolution is arguably the most infamous.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.060
For years, I've gotten fan requests to talk about this cinematic ballbuster,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.820
but sadly, even though I'm a fan of some anime shows and films,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.460
Dragon Ball is not one I know a great deal about.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.440
MasakoX and LittleKuriboh: That's where we come in!

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.700
MasakoX: MasakoX from Dragon Ball Z: Abridged...

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.820
LittleKuriboh: And LittleKuriboh from Yu-Gi-Oh!: Abridged.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.780
NC: That's right, a Japanese anime dubbed by Americans now analyzed by two Brits.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.960
LittleKuriboh: It makes as much sense as anything else in this movie.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.120
MaskaoX: The Dragon Ball franchise is one of the most popular animes ever made.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:28.160
Taking place in a parallel dimension, it follows the adventures of Goku and his friends defending Earth against intergalactic aliens, androids, and other various evils who really like to yell.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.760
LittleKuriboh: With spinoffs including Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball Z Kai, Dragon Ball GT, and Dragon Ball Super,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.100
there's over 700 episodes of this franchise and it's still going.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.160
So naturally, it made sense for Hollywood to try and capitalize on it and make a movie for Americans.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.320
How did it go?

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.580
NC: Did Ghost in the Shell do bad?

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.080
LittleKuriboh: Yes.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.440
NC: Then this did really bad.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.920
MasakoX: Fans of the show and newcomers hated this adaptation,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
claiming it not only missed what Dragon Ball is about, but dumbed it down so much that no average moviegoer would be able to enjoy it.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.640
LittleKuriboh: It's said by many to be the worst anime adaptation of all time.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.660
Don't believe me?

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.140
How many people thought the low-budget sketch that we just did was more faithful?

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.240
NC: That sounds about right.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.060
MasakoX: So let's not put it off any longer.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.740
NC: Let's take a look at this Dragon Ball suck with Dragonball Evolution.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.040
MasakoX: I hope you're ready for an intro that's frontloaded as shit.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.660
NC: I think I am.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.360
MasakoX: No, you're not.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.280
Gohan: A warlord named Piccolo came from beyond the stars.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.700
A group of brave warriors created the Ma Fu Ba, a powerful enchantment that-

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.440
NC: Wow, I'm both lost and bored.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.420
MasakoX and LittleKuriboh: Get used to that.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.460
Gohan: Aided by his disciple Oozaru, the evil pair brought the human race to the brink of annihilation.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.420
NC: OK, shot in the dark. A great evil tried to take over, is defeated, and now he's trying to come back.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.080
MasakoX: Wow, it's almost like you've seen a movie at some point in your life.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.520
NC: Enough to know when to fast-forward.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.760
[Who gives a shit?!]

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.440
We see our main character played by Justin Chatwin named...

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.940
Goku?

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.220
Um...

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.020
I don't know a ton about the anime, but that really doesn't look like a Goku.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.080
LittleKuriboh: Well, as a white man, I'm offended!

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.980
NC: You are?

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.280
LittleKuriboh: Yes, stereotyping like that!

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.040
MasakoX: I, for one, embrace culturally diverse names that in no way raise any questions or seem distracting.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.160
NC: Wow, I really didn't think this was the angle you guys would lean.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.980
LittleKuriboh: Of course!

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.880
John Shaft would be so much better if he was called...

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.380
MasakoX: James Bond would be more culturally sensitive if he was named...

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.060
LittleKuriboh: And Ariel from The Little Mermaid would be lightyears ahead of her time if she was called...

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.700
NC: Oh, I see what you're saying. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.480
MasakoX: But, if you name that rose...

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.920
LittleKuriboh: You might wanna change something.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.260
NC: Goku is trying his hardest to master his epic nose sweat.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.960
MasakoX: This movie clearly understands what to shoot in slow-mo.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.500
NC: As his grandpa states what we know this adaptation took to heart.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.120
Gohan: The first rule is...

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.440
there are no rules.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.480
LittleKuriboh: Well, we've given an excuse not to follow these.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.380
Gohan: First one to touch the ground loses.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.340
NC: That's the second rule after the first rule of there being no rules.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.240
MasakoX: Crouching Tiger, not-so-hidden greenscreen.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.240
LittleKuriboh: And now, a brief recreation of the audience reaction to this first 2 minutes.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.800
NC: This movie does know the difference between an anime and a Donald Duck cartoon, right?

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.540
Slimy, yet seething with anger-filled disappointment!

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.920
MasakoX: Next, we'll fight without the wires.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.360
Kyle Hebert: Next time on...

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:49.200
LittleKuriboh: So in the original show, Goku was a young, naive fighter obsessed with perfecting his gift and honoring the art of combat, fighting when he needs to.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.660
Here, he's a whiny little pissant who just wants to be cool and get laid.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.100
Goku: Everybody at school treats me like I'm nothing, Grandpa.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.000
Teach me how to get the girl.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.740
NC: To be fair, though, that is a lot of episodes of a character's life to fit into one movie.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.860
MasakoX: Don't worry, that's why there is the Slumming It Fairy.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.660
NC: The what?

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.800
LittleKuriboh: The Slumming It Fairy.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.880
She magically provides stock lines when you don't want to put real work into a character.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.040
Slumming It Fairy: Yeah, what?

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.080
MasakoX: Well, we don't want to put any effort in one of Japan's most beloved characters.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
LittleKuriboh: But we still want a paycheck for it.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.340
MasakoX: Can you supply us with some dated angst?

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.200
Slumming It Fairy: Yeah, sure.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.520
NC: Ooh, here's a tired classic!

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.900
"I'm different."

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.380
Goku: I'm different.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.160
LittleKuriboh: Here's one with no effort. "I wanna explode."

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.820
Goku: I wanna explode.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.920
MasakoX: And who can forget the popular "Teach me to be normal."?

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.340
Goku: Teach me to be normal.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.300
NC: Ooh, and don't forget "What friends?"

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.160
Goku: What friends?

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:47.980
NC: We did it! We reduced someone so special to so many to someone not the least bit special in any way!

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.120
Slumming It Fairy: Yeah, don't forget, you get stock parental advice for no additional charge.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.600
NC: Ooh, she's right!

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.840
Including, "You're special."

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.020
Gohan: You're special.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.740
LittleKuriboh: "Normal is overrated."

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.480
Gohan: Normal is overrated.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.600
MasakoX: And "Have faith in who you are."

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.920
Gohan: Have faith in who you are.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:10.180
NC: Thanks, Slumming It Fairy. You took from other source material even though we have plenty of source material to already take from.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.880
Slumming It Fairy: Whatever. Can I get high on your couch?

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.380
NC: Sure.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:12.880
Slumming It Fairy: Sick.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.360
NC: This is only gonna get worse, isn't it?

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.140
LittleKuriboh: Yes, it is.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.500
NC: Save some room on that couch.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:25.900
MasakoX: Goku's grandpa gives him a present for his birthday: a Dragon Ball, which when combined with the other six will grant a perfect wish.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.560
NC: Well we know they're never found because this film is still here.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.940
Gohan: In all the world there are only six others. Susinchu means "four stars."

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.220
LittleKuriboh: You know, something this film will never see.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.560
Goku: Thanks, Grandpa.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:45.000
MasakoX: So the Dragon Ball universe that seemed to magically take place in the past, present, AND future, expanding the world-building possibilities of the imagination...

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.760
...is now just the future.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.760
NC: Apocalyptic? Utopian? Techno?

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.580
MasakoX: Bland.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.080
NC: Oh...

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:57.720
Again, having not seen much of the anime, I can still pick up that the movie's environment looks practically nothing like the show's environment.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:05.040
LittleKuriboh: Even the environment in the film is not very well-defined. It would take a while to even realize we were IN the future unless we were told.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:11.440
This could be the set to any random film, where with the show,  just one image could tell you immediately you're watching Dragon Ball!

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.940
NC: Yeah, but at least the film's bullies...

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.020
Bully: Make...me pay, Geeko.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.920
NC: ...are generic too.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.760
Bully: C'mon, Geeko. Show me what you got.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.080
[Bully laughter]

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:28.960
MasakoX: Yes, you'll realize very quickly that the facial expressions that Goku has range from "violent farting" to "trying-to-project-himself-off-the-ground farting."

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.600
NC: Don't a lot of people do fart jokes when talking about this movie?

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.980
LittleKuriboh: Didn't you hear rule number one? There are no rules!

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.060
[Fart]

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.540
[Fart]

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.120
[Fart]

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.120
[Fart]

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.580
[Fart]

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.160
[Lifting himself off the ground with the power of Fart]

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.100
[Fart]

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.940
Kyle Hebert: Next time on...

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.440
NC: Oh, um...

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:05.500
Meanwhile on Bowser's Airship, a villain named Piccolo is wondering why being hundreds of feet in the air gets him surprisingly little wind resistance.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:11.160
MasakoX: In the show, Piccolo is complex and had interesting reasons for why he wanted ultimate power.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.360
He was so interesting that even his offspring would eventually become friends with our main hero.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:16.960
NC: Here?

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.460
MasakoX: Just a colossal twat.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:18.960
NC: Right.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:26.740
LittleKuriboh: He wants to take over the world because, you know, evil and stuff. And sends out his minions to find the Dragon Balls to achieve his goal.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.900
NC: "Do you like my assassin uniform? It makes sure you know that I have breasts."

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.500
MasakoX: Enough of that shit. We gotta cut to horny Goku.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.000
LittleKuriboh: To be fair, Goku in the show was awkwardly horny too.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.180
MasakoX: Yeah, but he'd never seen a girl before, so he didn't know he was horny.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.880
LittleKuriboh: Does that make it better?

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.320
NC: Better than this.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:02.980
MasakoX: I'll agree to that.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:03.480
LittleKuriboh: Yeah.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.500
Teacher: What might our ancestors say about the upcoming solar eclipse?

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.180
Goku: Well, my grandfather would say beware of the Nameks.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.000
Teacher: Nameks?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.040
Goku: Yeah, they're an alien race that nearly destroyed Earth over 2000 years ago.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.300
NC: Well we have no idea how this future works, so we have no idea how crazy this is supposed to sound.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.660
Teacher: Well... Let's hope it doesn't happen again, hm?

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.580
[Class laughter]

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.340
MasakoX: "Keep it in Scientology."

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.380
NC: But it looks like Goku's help with the lockers might have earned him some tail.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.640
Not actual tail. That'd be like the show.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.580
Chi-Chi: Hey! Goku, right?

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.720
NC: Pfft, like anyone would cast me as a Goku-- oh-uh-I mean, uh, yes! That's my character.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.880
Chi-Chi: You used your ki.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.620
Goku: Wait, you know about ki?

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.980
Chi-Chi: Just because my name is Chi-Chi doesn't make me a complete idiot.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:43.660
Goku: Right...

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.800
NC, MasakoX, and LittleKuriboh: Yeah.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.660
What?

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.780
Chi-Chi: I'm having a party tonight at my house.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.600
Goku: I'll be there.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.700
LittleKuriboh: Oh, that's a pretty shot.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.780
Well, back to shit.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.780
Goku: Beauty... awaits.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:04.320
NC: Is there a Film Theory that he's just the pain in the ass he played in War of the Worlds after the aliens invaded?

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.560
MasakoX: Nobody wasted any theories on this film.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.880
Goku sneaks out of his house to go to Chi-Chi's party where the bullies who literally have no reason to mock him mock him.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.360
Goku: I was invited. I'm not looking for any trouble.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:21.540
Bully: Trouble found you, freak. So listen, why don't you turn around, walk away, and no one will even know you were here.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:28.760
LittleKuriboh: Yeah, you freak, with your good looks and your-your nice hair and your fancy clothes, and--

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:29.860
What are we doing?

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.420
NC: [Whispering] I dunno.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.680
Goku: I'm not doing that anymore.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.220
NC, MasakoX, and LittleKuriboh: [Singsong] The dorks are gonna rumble, tonight.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.100
NC: Thank God we all know really bad kung fu!

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.200
LittleKuriboh: Especially this guy! How far away was that punch?

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.760
NC: I've been Snydered!

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.940
LittleKuriboh: Did he just slide across the car with his head?

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.560
MasakoX: Ugh, come on. Even Krillin wouldn't do that.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.880
By the way, is he even in this?

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.380
LittleKuriboh: No.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.680
MasakoX: Ugh, piece of shit film...

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.600
NC: Should I be angry at that?

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.100
LittleKuriboh: Yeah.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.060
NC: I'm really angry!

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:14.820
MasakoX: So the original Goku who hated fighting and only did it when he had to is now tossing one-liners like an unfunny James Bond.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.360
NC: And fart faces too.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.460
[Fart]

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.860
MasakoX: Nevertheless, he defeats the bullies and gets friendly with Chi-Chi.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.440
Chi-Chi: What happened to your parents?

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.260
Goku: Uh, I don't know. But my grandpa said everything will be explained to me when I turn 18.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.240
LittleKuriboh: My grandpa's kind of a dick.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:34.080
MasakoX: But he might not get his wish, as Grandpa is attacked by Piccolo who is literally dressed like a piccolo.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:41.240
LittleKuriboh: He destroys the house because apparently Piccolo can do that now, and Goku comes home to his dying mentor.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:47.540
Gohan: Find Master Roshi in Paozu... Tell him... Piccolo has returned.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:54.480
NC: Now if you'll excuse me, there's a dead mentor poker game with Obi Wan Kenobi, Uncle Ben, Dumbledore, and Mickey I need to attend.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.800
And I better hurry. I hear Gandalf might drop by briefly.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:02.980
MasakoX: After searching the house, Goku finds, I think, a second present he was going to give him.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.320
Goku: Grandpa...

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.180
[Gohan laughs]

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.860
LittleKuriboh: Even his dead grandpa laughs at how stupid that looks.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.240
[Gohan laughs]

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.820
NC: But he quickly discovers he's not alone.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.520
Bulma: Where is it? I know it's here.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.020
Goku: Are you Piccolo?

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.920
MasakoX: The casting's so bad, she could be.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.040
LittleKuriboh: Actually, this is Bulma, played by Emmy Rossum.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:23.540
NC: Singing?

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.040
LittleKuriboh: No.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:24.540
NC: Good.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:31.140
LittleKuriboh: They originally met when Goku was a little boy, but now in this they're the same age. It works because- wait, no it doesn't.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.180
Bulma: If I was a Piccolo, whatever that is, I wouldn't tell you.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.040
Somebody stole my promethium orb, and I'm here to get it back.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.860
MasakoX: You know this movie has enough whitewashing. Do we really have to dubwash too?

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.700
Bulma: Ph.D. in Applied Dynamics.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.420
They're gonna make me famous.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.800
NC: What a story, Mark.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.720
Bulma: Somebody hacked the vault, killed the guards and stole the Dragon Ball.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.960
LittleKuriboh: What is this, Spy Kids? I've seen toy commercials with more realistic technology.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.840
Bulma: This can detect and locate the signature wavelengths emitted by the Dragon Balls.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.400
NC: Thank God they talk about the important stuff that really matters in this film.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.740
Goku: Wait, you made a Dragon Ball energy locator?

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.440
Bulma: Dragon Ball energy. DBE. Catchy name.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.460
Malcolm: Son of a bitch!

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.860
Malcolm: I'll kill you! I'l kill you, you son of a-! I'll kill you!
NC: No no no no! It's okay! It's okay! Malcolm! Malcolm! It's okay!

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:14.400
NC: No no no no! It's okay! It's okay! Malcolm! Malcolm! It's okay!

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.820
NC: It's okay. We're gonna get through this. Alright? Give me the gun. Give me the gun.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:24.860
You're okay. You're okay. Just...back over there. You're doing, you're doing good. Better than last time, yeah.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.140
He's a big fan.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.620
LittleKuriboh: They agree to join forces to find the other Dragon Balls, and they ride on her...

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.380
NC: My God! The bullshit levels are through the roof!

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.780
MasakoX: They go to find Roshi as his grandpa instructed and locate him in the house from Up.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.860
Kyle Hebert: Next time on...

00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:01.920
LittleKuriboh: Goku wakes up Roshi and makes the sad discovery that Chow Yun-Fat found a film worse than Pirates 3 to appear in.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.020
Bulma: Stop!

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.580
NC: The CGI is atrocious!

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.880
Roshi: I am Muten Roshi the Invincible!

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.940
[Laughs]

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.800
MasakoX: To be fair, Chow Yun-Fat, while certainly different, is not that bad a choice for this role.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.700
He's a wisecracker, a little pervy, and energetically full of himself.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.620
But then, there's scenes like this:

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.380
Goku: My grandfather is dead.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.560
NC: It doesn't get rid of the pain.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.100
LittleKuriboh: But it does make it hurt a little less.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.140
NC: So after Goku gives his most heartfelt, powerhouse performance...

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:23.380
Goku: I will avenge him. But before he...he died, he asked me to find you.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.000
NC: What do you think the directing for that scene was like?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.080
MasakoX: Nonexistent.

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:31.780
NC: Roshi gives them his Dragon Ball and says he'll join them to find the others.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.700
Shitter was full!

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.280
Roshi: I will take you to a secret place.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:42.220
LittleKuriboh: He takes them to a training temple that looks more like Mortal Kombat high school where, what a surprise, Chi-Chi happens to be training there.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:48.260
Chi-Chi: Nobody at home knows this, but I'm a fighter too. They just wouldn't understand.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.360
NC: What does that even mean? Fighting for money?

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.740
MasakoX: Fighting for justice?

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.920
LittleKuriboh: Fighting for fun?

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.520
NC: Nothing else in this world makes sense, so why should this mean shit?

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.920
After that seemingly pointless scene...

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.540
LittleKuriboh: Seemingly?

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.260
NC: Entirely.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.460
They fall down a hole and get trapped by a guy named Yamcha.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:10.520
Bulma: Let me handle this. I'd be, uh...so grateful if you could just help me and my friends out.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:11.960
Yamcha: I'm gonna need some payment.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:13.460
Bulma: Payment?

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:19.220
NC: Let me try. I'd be, uh, so grateful if you would just help me and my friends out.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.560
Yamcha: Just think it over, 'cause after the sun comes out it's gonna be hot, hot, hot!

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.160
Heh. Hot.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.860
MasakoX: Just because you can improvise doesn't mean you should.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:35.180
LittleKuriboh: They build a fire as it gets late in the night and Roshi literally tells the same story we heard in the opening.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:40.880
But Bulma finds out, only now for some reason, that the Dragon Ball is buried beneath them. That's lucky.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.620
Roshi: Enough games.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.300
Everybody: WHY DIDN'T HE DO THAT BEFORE?!

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:48.880
Malcolm: Ass!

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:56.460
NC: They offer to pay Yamcha if he helps them dig, which is weird because that means they could have paid him before anyway.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.180
How many hours did they waste down there?

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.200
MasakoX: So digging through a hole somehow leads them to the top of a volcano...

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.860
...where Piccolo sends his Putties, I mean minions, to stop them.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:14.960
LittleKuriboh: In doing so, though, he only provides a way for them to get to the Dragon Ball. Our evil strategist, everybody.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.420
NC: The floor is literally lava!

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:27.460
Goku gets the Ball, but is pretty easily defeated by Piccolo's assassin, only to have her easily defeated a second later.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.320
Look at this. He talks in the next scene like he doesn't even notice her.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.100
Goku: There's this demon...

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:32.900
Roshi: Oozaru.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.260
Goku: He will kill you.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:40.620
NC: Oh, there's a lady, too. She got a swing in. Just pointing her out in case she was supposed to be a powerful second-in-command, or...

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:48.120
LittleKuriboh: So Chew the Fat, Harmony Star, Surf Ninja, and Elijah Wooden all travel to the temple of underappreciated Ghostbusters.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.300
Norris: How is my favorite skeptic?

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.100
Roshi: I need another containment vessel.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.120
NC: I mean we saw what happened to the last one.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.480
MasakoX: You done?

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.060
NC and LittleKuriboh: Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.760
MasakoX: So even though in the show the focus is on mastering energy, here it's mastering...

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:03.900
[Sigh]

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:04.840
airbending.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.760
NC: They do not call it that!

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.180
MasakoX: Oh, but they do.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.620
Roshi:...the most basic of all the airbending techniques.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.520
NC: Do they know the difference between animes, non-animes, and abominations of God?!

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.520
LittleKuriboh: I'm honestly surprised Sailor Moon isn't in this.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:17.660
Kyle Hebert: Next time on...

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.580
Oh, forget it.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.420
NC: Hey Kyle, where are you going? Get back here you coward!

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:30.480
Kyle Hebert: I'm sorry guys. You know, Dragonball Evolution is one thing, but throwing Shyamalan in there too? I still have my shame to hold on to.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.620
NC: Bastard! You'll never "Next time on Dragon Ball Z..." again! Wave fists, wave fists!

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:41.620
LittleKuriboh: Funny, by the way, how in the show Goku was a child prodigy, and here he can't even light a goddamn candle.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.040
NC: Well, that's because he's not properly horny-vated.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:49.040
Chi-Chi: Every time you light a torch, you get to take one step closer to me.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.640
MasakoX: "No, I swear. That happens to all guys."

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.920
Goku: It doesn't feel right. it feels-I must be missing something.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.980
Chi-Chi: You have to make every move your own.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.720
LittleKuriboh: You've stolen from like a million other films. SOMETHING has to be original!

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:09.180
NC: He finally gets it, but Piccolo's assassin breaks in disguised as Chi-Chi, stealing the Dragon Balls.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.340
MasakoX: Rossum has a look that says, "Wow. Howard the Duck's effects are way more convincing right now."

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.440
Roshi: He's alive. But barely.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:27.820
NC: Goku has a near-acting experience where he sees his grandpa, and...you know. "It's not your time." "Have faith in who you are." Blah blah blah blah blah.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.480
Gohan: It's not your time, Goku. Always have faith in who you are.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.640
NC: Oh, c'mon! That was just a generalization! He actually says that?!

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.260
LittleKuriboh: Why not just have him say, "Plenty of fish in the sea."

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.800
MasakoX: "Remember to drink your milk."

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.900
LittleKuriboh: "Meow meow meow meow, meow meow meow meow."

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.760
MasakoX: "#PopularPhrase"

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.740
Malcolm: Asshole!

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:49.140
[Chaos erupts]

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:57.400
LittleKuriboh: Grandpa brings Goku back to life because he's only half-dead, and they go to stop Piccolo after apologizing to Ernie Hudson for having him for only two minutes.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.100
Norris: Pray it is enough to contain Piccolo.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.200
Roshi: Namaste.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.240
NC: "I spent three hours in makeup for this?"

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:11.540
MasakoX: Thankfully their car is Shitty Shitty Bang Bang, and can fly fast enough to stop Piccolo's monologuing.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.640
Piccolo: Imagine...

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.800
...being shackled so tightly...

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.860
...that every atom in your body...

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.700
...stood compacted.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.560
With this Dragon Ball...

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.800
...I take my vengeance...

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.780
...upon the Earth.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:32.780
MasakoX: You know, just because your underacting is way better than their overacting doesn't mean it's not underacting.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.660
NC: They get there at the start of the eclipse and try to stop him from taking over the world.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.400
MasakoX: Look! He even has the outfit on! It's totally Dragon Ball now, guys!

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.680
Goku: I will defeat Oozaru, and I'm here to destroy you.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.340
Piccolo: Heh. Defeat Oozaru?

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.640
NC: "You can barely act!"

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:57.720
LittleKuriboh: But in a bizarre twist, Goku, it turns out, IS Oozaru, turning into a monster. Would have been nice if someone prepared him for that.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.400
Goku: My grandpa said everything will be explained to me when I turn 18.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.060
Piccolo: Goku is a shell.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.380
This is who you are.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.180
MasakoX: The fart faces must flow!

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.480
[Biggest fart yet]

Oozaru!Goku: [Roars]

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.800
Piccolo: Oozaru. They have a Dragon Ball.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.980
LittleKuriboh: "Don't make my voice sound even more disinterested."

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.100
NC: Goku kills Roshi but remembers who he is and turns back.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.600
Piccolo: Impossible.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.600
Goku: Something my grandfather taught me.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.200
First rule is...

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.040
NC, LittleKuriboh, and MasakoX: Always read the script?

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.980
Goku: ...there are no rules.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.620
LittleKuriboh: Then how is that the first rule? That's just dumb!

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:50.400
MasakoX: Piccolo and Goku finally face off, and for a movie adapted for a show KNOWN for its fighting, this fighting sucks some harsh balls.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.920
Bibleman had better effects!

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:04.480
LittleKuriboh: Look at this. Most of the fighting is just Goku trying not to get his ass kicked.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.080
NC: Now that's not true. He hit him once...

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.360
Twice...

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.960
Oh my God. I think that's it.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:15.100
MasakoX: One of the most famous fighters in anime, and he gets two hits.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.840
NC: Well, look at it this way:

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.700
[.]

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.660
[..]

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:19.520
[...]

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.400
LittleKuriboh: We should just live here.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.700
NC: Goku realizes he has to be both himself and Oozaru...

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.620
...whatever that means.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.140
And he unleashes the ultimate power.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.380
MasakoX: That's right. The Kamehameha.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:40.380
In the show, this is always the highlight. An incredible display of power blowing everyone figuratively and literally away.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.520
Here, I think he turns into a screensaver.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:49.800
LittleKuriboh: Oh no. He's turned into 3D Pipes!

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.280
NC: Actually, can we just watch that? They are more convincing.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.260
MasakoX: I truly believe that they're pipes.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:25:00.760
LittleKuriboh: The eclipse wraps up, but nothing compares to the shade this movie has given to the Dragon Ball franchise.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:06.500
NC: But hey. Now that Goku has the Dragon Balls and has one perfect wish, what's he gonna use it on?

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:16.420
Goku: Dragon! The Test of Seven has been fulfilled! I compel you to come forth and grant my wish!

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.520
MasakoX: Not until you say it like you give a shit! Christ!

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.980
NC: *Sigh* That putrid pus looks so fake you could have Sean Connery voicing it.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.140
Goku: Give life...

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.580
...to Muten Roshi.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.440
NC: Funny, he could have used that wish to grant world peace.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.380
LittleKuriboh: Or bring back his grandpa, the person who raised him.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.560
MasakoX: Oh. Maybe have the power to grant back anyone he wants whenever he wants?

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.360
NC: How long was this journey? They had plenty of time to talk about this!

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.040
But the Dragon Balls are gone and they have to find them again.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:54.500
Oh no. As if this film didn't already repeat shit we've seen a million times.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:26:00.580
MasakoX: But it's cool, because Goku reunites with Chi-Chi, who...stayed behind while everyone else fought.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.860
LittleKuriboh: Yeah. Where was her lazy ass?

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.560
Chi-Chi: Aaah!

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.340
Goku: [Yells]

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.800
Goku: [Yells]
Chi-Chi: [Yells]

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:13.840
MasakoX: Because that's what Dragon Ball is all about. Goku punching Chi-Chi's heel in midair.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.800
NC: Oh, and just when you think it's over...

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.560
LittleKuriboh: Well the pain never really stops, Critic.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:27.480
NC: I know. But in terms of the movie's ending, it turns out they have a mid-credits stinger.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.900
It's revealed that Piccolo is still alive and he's being tended to by a woman.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:35.620
Okay, that should only take five seconds to reveal. Big whoop.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:41.900
MasakoX: Well they do apparently think that it IS a big whoop, because they spend about a minute and a half dragging this reveal out.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:45.620
NC: A minute and a half? What the hell can you show in that amount of time?

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.440
LittleKuriboh: Well, the suspenseful buildup of picking plants...

NC: Whether you're an average moviegoer...

MasakoX: Or a die-hard fan...

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.340
NC, LittleKuriboh: and MasakoX: It blows!

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:24.380
NC: It's visually disjointed, it has little to no world-building, the acting is awkward, the effects are lame,... It's pretty laughably bad.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:29.460
MasakoX: Fans that have waited years for a faithful live-action movie are gonna have to keep waiting.

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.780
Because this has no idea of what Dragon Ball was about, or what made it so special.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:41.280
LittleKuriboh: It doesn't work in any way, and any newcomers that are introduced to Dragon Ball this way risk losing a fan for life.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.420
It's just one big disrespectful mess.

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:51.900

Doug: Hello, Doug Walker here doing the charity shout-out, and this week we are doing the American Refugee Committee.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:54.960
This is an international NGO that responds to crisis and helps refugees build lives of dignity and self-sufficiency.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:04.680
They work in 11 countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, bringing more than 35 years of expertise and services, such as health and sanitation,

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.280
to empower refugees around the world.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:14.920
Refugees share with them what they need, and they work together to create programs that make the most sense for that particular community,

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:19.420
pursuing new and better solutions to enduring humanitarian challenges.

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:29.280
By supporting and co-creating with local organizations, they've been able to reach around the globe and reach a unique and sustainable impact on communities.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:36.900
Both their site and their YouTube channel show the incredible work that they do, and they even earned an A+ on Charitywatch.org.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.820
Give them a look, and see how you can help these people continue their amazing achievements.
