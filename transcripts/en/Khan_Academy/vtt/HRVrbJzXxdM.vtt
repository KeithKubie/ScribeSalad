00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.175
- [Voiceover] We're
asked, which value for D,

00:00:02.175 --> 00:00:03.924
and we see D in this equation here,

00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:08.677
makes X equals negative
three an extraneous solution

00:00:08.677 --> 00:00:10.377
for this radical equation?

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:14.954
Squared of 3x plus 25
is equal to D plus 2x.

00:00:15.564 --> 00:00:17.609
And I encourage you to
pause the video and try to

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.099
think about it on your own before we work

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.499
through it together.

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:23.930
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.868
So the first thing that
just to remind ourselves

00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:27.720
is what is an extraneous solution?

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.829
Well that's a solution that
we get or we think we get

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.489
but it's really just a
by-product of how we solved it

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.780
but isn't going to be an actual solution

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.596
of our original equation.

00:00:37.596 --> 00:00:41.236
Now how do these extraneous
solutions pop up?

00:00:41.236 --> 00:00:44.759
Well, it pops up when you
take the square of both sides.

00:00:45.288 --> 00:00:47.333
So for this equation right
over here, to get rid

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.919
of the radical, I'd want
to square both sides of it.

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:52.731
If I square both sides, the
lefthand side will become

00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:57.345
3x plus 25 and the righthand
side, if I square this,

00:00:57.725 --> 00:00:59.113
is going to be, what?

00:00:59.113 --> 00:01:04.113
It's going to be D squared
plus 4, 4dx plus X squared.

00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:08.787
So that's just squaring
both sides of this,

00:01:08.887 --> 00:01:11.862
but notice, there's actually
a different equation than

00:01:11.862 --> 00:01:13.786
this one that if you squared
both sides, you would also

00:01:13.786 --> 00:01:14.772
get this.

00:01:14.772 --> 00:01:16.692
What is that different equation?

00:01:16.692 --> 00:01:18.753
Well the different equation
is if you took the negative

00:01:18.753 --> 00:01:20.549
of one of these sides.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.544
So for example, if you had,
if you started the original

00:01:22.544 --> 00:01:27.425
equation, the negative
square root of 3x plus 25

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.035
plus 25, is equal to D plus 2x.

00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:35.508
You square both sides of this,
you still get this purple

00:01:35.668 --> 00:01:37.922
equation because you square a negative,

00:01:37.922 --> 00:01:39.765
you get a positive.

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:42.471
So both of them, when
you square both sides,

00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:44.485
get us over here.

00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:47.021
And so when you solve
this purple equation,

00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:49.185
this is a quadratic right over here.

00:01:49.185 --> 00:01:50.252
You just rearrange it a little bit.

00:01:50.252 --> 00:01:52.103
You get into standard quadratic form,

00:01:52.103 --> 00:01:53.702
you'll get two solutions.

00:01:53.702 --> 00:01:55.259
And it turns out, one of
the solutions is going to be

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.284
for this yellow equation
and one of the solutions

00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:58.788
is going to be for the purple equation.

00:01:59.344 --> 00:02:04.184
And if the solution that
is for the purple equation,

00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:06.425
is going to be an extraneous solution

00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:07.817
for the yellow equation.

00:02:07.817 --> 00:02:09.087
This is actually not
going to be a solution

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:10.744
for the yellow equation.

00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:13.242
So when they say, "Which
value for D makes X equals

00:02:13.242 --> 00:02:15.314
"negative three and extraneous solution

00:02:15.314 --> 00:02:16.726
"for this yellow equation?"

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.201
That's the same thing as saying,

00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:20.658
"What value of D makes
X equals negative three

00:02:20.658 --> 00:02:23.285
"a solution for this?"

00:02:24.105 --> 00:02:28.196
So a solution for this.

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:32.990
If it's a solution for this,
it's going to be an extraneous

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.442
solution for that 'cause these
are two different equations.

00:02:36.902 --> 00:02:38.255
We're taking the negative of just one side

00:02:38.255 --> 00:02:39.864
of this equation to get this one.

00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:41.588
If you took the negative
of both sides of this

00:02:41.588 --> 00:02:42.964
and that becomes the same
thing 'cause you could

00:02:42.964 --> 00:02:45.342
multiply both sides of an
equation times a negative value.

00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:49.128
So a solution for this, which
is equivalently a solution

00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:51.643
which is equivalent to a
solution, if I, instead of putting

00:02:51.643 --> 00:02:53.723
the negative on the lefthand
side, if I multiply the

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:54.937
righthand side by the negative.

00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:57.711
But anyway, let's think
about which value for D

00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:02.232
makes X equals negative
three a solution for this?

00:03:03.111 --> 00:03:05.286
Well, let's substitute X
equals negative three here

00:03:05.286 --> 00:03:07.180
and then we just have to solve for D.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.468
If X equals negative three,
this is going to be negative

00:03:09.468 --> 00:03:12.791
the square root of three
times negative three

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:17.287
is negative nine, plus 25 is equal to D.

00:03:18.445 --> 00:03:21.022
Two times negative three is negative six.

00:03:21.444 --> 00:03:26.444
So D minus 6, and so now we can

00:03:26.932 --> 00:03:31.387
square both sides of, we can square,

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:32.485
actually let's do it this way.

00:03:32.485 --> 00:03:34.172
We can, I don't wanna
square both sides 'cause

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:35.486
we lose some information.

00:03:35.486 --> 00:03:38.237
It's going to be the negative
square root of negative nine

00:03:38.237 --> 00:03:42.392
plus 25 is 16, is equal to D minus 6,

00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:46.983
so this is going to be
equal to negative four.

00:03:47.392 --> 00:03:48.549
Principle over 16 is four.

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:49.982
We have the negative out front,

00:03:49.982 --> 00:03:54.029
is equal to D minus six and
then add six to both sides.

00:03:54.763 --> 00:03:58.894
You get two is equal
to, two is equal to D.

00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:01.816
So if D is equal to two here,

00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:05.179
if D is equal to two, then
a solution to this purple

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:08.041
equation is going to be
X equals negative three.

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:10.454
And so that would be an
extraneous solution because

00:04:10.624 --> 00:04:13.612
if X equals negative three
satisfies this over here,

00:04:13.612 --> 00:04:16.280
it's definitely gonna
satisfy this over here,

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.240
but it's not going to
satisfy this up here.

00:04:19.401 --> 00:04:21.205
And you could verify this if this is equal

00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:25.856
to two, try out X equals negative three.

00:04:25.856 --> 00:04:27.848
You're gonna get on the lefthand side,

00:04:27.848 --> 00:04:30.816
you're going to get 16
and on the righthand side,

00:04:30.816 --> 00:04:34.625
you're gonna get two minus six which is

00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:36.355
equal to negative four.

00:04:37.574 --> 00:04:39.209
Two minus six which is negative four,

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:40.520
so this does not work out.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.776
X equals negative three
is not a solution to this,

00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:45.639
but it is a solution for
this and it is a solution

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.570
to this quadratic right over here.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.662
So D equals two makes
X equal negative three,

00:04:50.662 --> 00:04:54.172
an extraneous solution for this equation.
