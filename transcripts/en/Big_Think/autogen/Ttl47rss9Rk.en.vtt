00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.210
in the early 1990s it was clear that

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220
in the early 1990s it was clear that
 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.020
in the early 1990s it was clear that
there was a new DNA for things that we

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030
there was a new DNA for things that we
 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.640
there was a new DNA for things that we
thought were real like print or movies

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650
thought were real like print or movies
 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.340
thought were real like print or movies
and we didn't understand until roughly

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350
and we didn't understand until roughly
 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.189
and we didn't understand until roughly
1990 that actually the fundamental

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199
1990 that actually the fundamental
 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.009
1990 that actually the fundamental
representation was digital and then

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019
representation was digital and then
 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.179
representation was digital and then
you'd map that into a movie or a book or

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189
you'd map that into a movie or a book or
 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.790
you'd map that into a movie or a book or
writing you know signs in the sky with

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800
writing you know signs in the sky with
 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.190
writing you know signs in the sky with
smoke signals or carving something into

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200
smoke signals or carving something into
 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.400
smoke signals or carving something into
metal or whatever but but the

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410
metal or whatever but but the
 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.810
metal or whatever but but the
fundamental element was digital and

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820
fundamental element was digital and
 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.540
fundamental element was digital and
because it was digital the medium was

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550
because it was digital the medium was
 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.709
because it was digital the medium was
not the message you could actually take

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719
not the message you could actually take
 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.799
not the message you could actually take
any message and map it into media of one

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
any message and map it into media of one
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.450
any message and map it into media of one
sort or another because the message was

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460
sort or another because the message was
 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.869
sort or another because the message was
digital and then you started to realize

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879
digital and then you started to realize
 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.910
digital and then you started to realize
that a lot of things that were

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
that a lot of things that were
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.670
that a lot of things that were
previously physical were in fact

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680
previously physical were in fact
 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.170
previously physical were in fact
potentially virtual and they lived in

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
potentially virtual and they lived in
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.899
potentially virtual and they lived in
cyberspace and they lived in ways that

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
cyberspace and they lived in ways that
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.789
cyberspace and they lived in ways that
are today taken for granted to be

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799
are today taken for granted to be
 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.440
are today taken for granted to be
digital so the world of bits and atoms

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450
digital so the world of bits and atoms
 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.770
digital so the world of bits and atoms
emerged where just how much of our lives

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780
emerged where just how much of our lives
 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.499
emerged where just how much of our lives
was made of bits and most people don't

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509
was made of bits and most people don't
 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.020
was made of bits and most people don't
realize that the word bits didn't even

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030
realize that the word bits didn't even
 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.980
realize that the word bits didn't even
exist in 1949 nobody knew it did hadn't

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.219

been invented as a word and so in the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229
been invented as a word and so in the
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.480
been invented as a word and so in the
space of 60 plus years it's gone to

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
space of 60 plus years it's gone to
 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.060
space of 60 plus years it's gone to
being sort of kind of the basic element

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070
being sort of kind of the basic element
 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.190
being sort of kind of the basic element
and we never thought of bits and atoms

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
and we never thought of bits and atoms
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.069
and we never thought of bits and atoms
as related that you could convert

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079
as related that you could convert
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.660
as related that you could convert
something from one to the other and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
something from one to the other and
 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.210
something from one to the other and
there was a transformation and now with

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
there was a transformation and now with
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.539
there was a transformation and now with
some of the modern maker movement things

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
some of the modern maker movement things
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.850
some of the modern maker movement things
where you do manufacturing at home and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860
where you do manufacturing at home and
 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.370
where you do manufacturing at home and
you transmit apart as bits and then it

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
you transmit apart as bits and then it
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.039
you transmit apart as bits and then it
gets created it's just again part of

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.190
gets created it's just again part of
that same chain that has to do with the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
that same chain that has to do with the
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.980
that same chain that has to do with the
mixture of bits and atoms and the

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990
mixture of bits and atoms and the
 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.630
mixture of bits and atoms and the
transition from a world dominated by

transition from a world dominated by
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.570
transition from a world dominated by
atoms to a world dominated by bits and

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580
atoms to a world dominated by bits and
 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.680
atoms to a world dominated by bits and
country-by-country it happens at

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
country-by-country it happens at
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.080
country-by-country it happens at
different speeds but it's interesting to

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
different speeds but it's interesting to
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.700
different speeds but it's interesting to
note that even the concept of

it came from the world of atoms and so
 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.450
it came from the world of atoms and so
in some sense to argue that this country

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460
in some sense to argue that this country
 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.700
in some sense to argue that this country
is more digital than that country is

period of time the term net neutrality
 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.700
period of time the term net neutrality
has a little bit of a pejorative ring

how would you want something not to be

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840
how would you want something not to be
 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.870
how would you want something not to be
neutral in other words neutrality seems

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880
neutral in other words neutrality seems
 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.370
neutral in other words neutrality seems
to be a feature of good and so yeah you

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380
to be a feature of good and so yeah you
 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.900
to be a feature of good and so yeah you
kind of want this to be net neutral but

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910
kind of want this to be net neutral but
 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.750
kind of want this to be net neutral but
the truth is all bits are not created

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760
the truth is all bits are not created

book a normal novel is about a megabyte
 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.520
book a normal novel is about a megabyte
and yet a second of video is more than a

and yet a second of video is more than a
banker byte so when you look at video

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370
banker byte so when you look at video
 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.880
banker byte so when you look at video
for a couple of hours it's the

for a couple of hours it's the
 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.600
for a couple of hours it's the
equivalent of hundreds of books and then

bits of your heart data are you know a
 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.670
bits of your heart data are you know a
small fraction of a book so you have

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680
small fraction of a book so you have
 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.220
small fraction of a book so you have
bits that represent your heart bits that

all equal is crazy so how do you

all equal is crazy so how do you
reconcile that and still say new

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690
reconcile that and still say new
