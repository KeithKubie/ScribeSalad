00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
At the low level--I count as low-level things like the roll of a die,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the implementation of scores,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the implementation of the players and of the player to move,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the goal--so these are all things that we're going to have to represent.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And then at the high level, I'm going to have a function play-pig, that

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
plays a game between two players,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and I have the notion of a strategy--a strategy that a player is taking

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in order to play the game.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now let's think about how to implement these things,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and when I'm doing the implementation,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm going to move top-down.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So I started sort of middle-out saying these are the kinds of things I think I'm going to need;

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
now I have a good enough feel for them that I feel confident in moving top-down.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I don't see any difficulties in implementing any of these pieces.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If I start at the top, then I'll be able to make choices later on without feeling constrained.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If I thought there was something down here that was difficult to deal with,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I might spend more time now, at the low level, trying to resolve

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
what the right representation is for one of these difficult pieces,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and that would inform my high-level decisions.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But since I don't see any difficulty, I'm going to jump to the high level.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now, what's play-pig?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Well, I think that's going to be a function,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and let's just say that its input is two players, A and B,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and we haven't decided yet how we're going to represent those.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And its output is--let's say it's going to be the winner of the game.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Maybe A is the winner.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And we'll have to make a choice of how we represent these players.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Now what's a strategy?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Well, a strategy--people sometimes use the word "policy" for that.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We can also represent that as a function.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And it takes as input a state, and it returns an action or a move in the game.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In this game we said that the actions are roll and hold.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
We're starting to move down.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Let's just say now how are we going to represent these actions?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Well, we can call the actions just by strings,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
so we use the strings "roll" and "hold"

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and that could be what the strategy returns.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
But then we'll also need something that implements these actions,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
so we'll have to have something that's a function that says--let's say--

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the function "roll" takes a state and returns a new state;

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
function "hold" takes a state and returns a new state.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
But that doesn't seem quite right; there's a problem here.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
What about the die? That seems to take and effect

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
that roll by itself is not a function from state to state.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Rather, roll--if we wanted to specify it--would be a function from a state to a set of states,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and that represents the fundamental uncertainty.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
That's why we need probability to deal with it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
That's why we have an uncertain or a nondeterministic domain

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
is because an action doesn't have a single result;

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
rather, it can have a set of possible results.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And, in some cases it makes sense to go ahead and implement these actions as functions

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
that look like that, that return sets of states.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And I considered that as a possibility, but I ended up with an implementation

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
where I talk about the different possibilities for the dice.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So the dice can come up as D, one of the numbers 1 to 6,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and now roll, from a particular state with the particular die roll,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
that is going to return a single state rather than a set of states.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And I just think it's easier to deal this way, although in other applications

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
you might want to deal that way.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Now the rest seems to be pretty easy.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
The die can be represented as an integer.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Scores can be represented as integers.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Likewise the goal.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
The player to move--we can represent that as an index, 0 or 1,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
into an array of players.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And the players themselves?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Well, the simplest way to do it is just to represent the player by their strategy.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
The strategy is a function, and that could represent the player.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
We could have something more complex,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
but it seems like we don't need anything more than that.

00:04:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So players will be strategy functions.
