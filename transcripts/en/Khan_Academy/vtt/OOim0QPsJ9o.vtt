00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.639
For a given input value b, the function

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:09.420
f outputs a value a to satisfy the
following equation 4a plus 7b

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.870
is equal to negative 52. So for a given input b,

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.460
the function f, the function f
will

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.359
output an a that satisfies this
relationship right over here for the a

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.519
and the b. Write a formula for f of b

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.720
in terms of b. So we want to do,
we just want to solve for --

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.570
if we're given a "b", what "a" does that
imply that we have to

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.290
output? Or another way to think about it is
-- let's just solve for

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.950
a, or we could think about a as being a
function of

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.100
b. So let's write this. So we have 4a

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.129
plus 7b -- is equal to

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.379
negative 52. So I can solve for a

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.719
in terms of b, that any b that I have --
Let's say these b's are on the right hand side I

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:56.020
can

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.949
put it in. I can substitute that value
for b and I can just solve for a.

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.239
I can solve for a that needs to be
outputted.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.090
So let's do that. Let's solve for a. 
So I want to get all the a on

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.490
I wanna just have an a leftover on the
left hand side, and have everything else on

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.119
the right hand side including the b's.

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.310
So let's get rid of this b on the left hand
side. And

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.720
I can do that by subtracting 7b.
Of course I wanna do that to both sides.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.049
I can't just do an equation and

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.340
do an operation only on one side like
that. So

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.240
let's subtract, and we are left with
we are left with --

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.909
the 7b's add up to zero. 7b minus 7b.
We're left with

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.470
4a is equal to negative 52

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.670
minus 7b, minus

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.570
7b. Now, to isolate the a here,
just to have an a here instead of 4a,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.399
we can divide both sides by 4. We can
divide both sides by 4. So I'm gonna

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:50.479
divide everything

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.549
by 4. And on the left hand side, we got
our goal.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.119
We are left with an a is equal to -- Now
what's negative 54 divided by --

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.229
What is the negative 52 divided by 4?
So let's think about it.

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.039
52 is 40 plus 12. 40 divided by
4 is 10. 12 divided by

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.910
4 is 3. So it's gonna be 13. Negative 13.
So it's negative

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.280
13 minus 7/4 b

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.190
minus 7/4 b. So

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.120
given a "b", if you give me a "b", I can put
that value right over here,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.470
and I can calculate what the
corresponding a needs to be

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.550
in order to satisfy this relationship.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.530
So if I want a formula for f of b in
terms of b, I can say, look,

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.910
you give me a "b", the output of our
function, which is

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.980
f of a. The output of our function is
going to be --

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.510
is going to be negative 13 minus

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.180
7/4 b, because the output of our
function needs to be an

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.460
"a" that will satisfy -- that will satisfy

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.570
this equation up here.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.420
So hopefully that helped.
