00:00:07.016 --> 00:00:13.859
In a Moment of Vision...

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:15.297
It's the 1920s.

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:17.234
Flapper fashion prevails.

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:19.830
Woman conceal their figures
in straight-sided gowns

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.045
and restrictive bandeaus.

00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:25.205
A dressmaker named Ida Rosenthal
is frustrated by the way

00:00:25.205 --> 00:00:28.686
falsely flat chests look
beneath her structured dresses

00:00:28.686 --> 00:00:32.450
so she, her husband William,
and business partner Enid Bissett

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.982
develop a line of intimate apparel 
that accentuates the curves.

00:00:36.982 --> 00:00:39.109
The design consists of two cups,

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:40.204
shoulder straps,

00:00:40.204 --> 00:00:43.733
and a chest band that clasps in back.

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.982
At first, the bras are included
with the sale of a dress,

00:00:46.982 --> 00:00:51.834
but the popularity of the undergarment
soon outstrips that of the garment itself.

00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:55.868
The three establish a business
selling exclusively bras

00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:58.018
and call it Maidenform.

00:00:58.018 --> 00:01:00.263
William, in a moment of vision,

00:01:00.263 --> 00:01:04.241
invents a graduated, standardized
cup-sizing system

00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:09.303
that accommodates women
of all ages and all shapes.

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:12.833
During the female liberation
bra-burning era of the 1960s,

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:18.262
Ida Rosenthal is asked to comment
on the downfall of the brassiere industry.

00:01:18.262 --> 00:01:19.450
She answers simply,

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.828
"After age 35, a woman hasn't got
the figure to wear no support.

00:01:23.828 --> 00:01:26.544
Time is on my side."
