[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.840
- All right.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.640
So today I'm here to talk
about Learning Deeply at Scale:

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.560
the Challenge of our Times.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.309
So this comes out of a
five-year research project

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.280
that my doctoral colleague
at the ed school, Sarah Fine,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.570
and I have been conducting.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.080
It's a study of
ambitious instruction--

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.290
instruction which is rigorous,
challenging, engaging--

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.090
in American high schools.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.960
We did essentially a sort
of tour, a national tour,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.570
of American high schools--

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.180
comprehensive schools, public
schools, charter schools,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.070
those no excuses
schools you read

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.160
about in the paper,
project-based schools, schools

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.660
that do international
baccalaureate,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.210
schools that do AP, schools
that are rich, poor, et cetera.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.470
To just sort of get
a sense, as Judy

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.350
said, in a sort of broad
sense of what does instruction

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.920
in high schools look like?

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.600
Where is it better?

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.712
What can we do about it?

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:04.670
We oversampled schools
serving poor and working

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.490
class students, but this is a
book about schools as a whole.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.730
There are a lot of middle class,
affluent schools in our book

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.080
and in our writing.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.980
Our methods were mainly to
observe and to talk to people.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.760
We spent a lot of time
in classes and meetings,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.560
on fields, in theaters.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.780
And we interviewed
a lot of folks.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.620
And there is a book, thanks
in no part to all the time

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.260
I had at Radcliffe this year,
coming out on this next year.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.070
OK.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.580
So just provisionally, we'll be
talking about deeper learning.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.286
So let me just give you this
definition from Hewlett.

00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:40.340
The Hewlett Foundation put
forward a big stream of money

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.260
around deeper learning.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.480
Of course, he who has
the gold makes the rules

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.650
and gets to name, sort of the
new version of the Golden Rule.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.510
And they say that
deeper learning

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.150
entails mastering core academic
content, critical thinking

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.070
and problem solving,
collaboration,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.806
and self-directed learning.

00:01:56.806 --> 00:01:58.430
Less formally, I
would just think of it

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.310
as being able to see beyond
the surface of an issue

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.105
and being able to
understand its deeper roots.

00:02:04.105 --> 00:02:05.980
So we're going to talk
a lot more about this.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.449
I just wanted to give you a
definition just to get started.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.169
OK.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.170
So why should we
care about this?

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.880
The most often-cited
reason is economic.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.960
That 50 years ago
you could graduate

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.850
with a mediocre high
school education,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.680
get a job at the
factory down the road

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.020
if you were a
white man, and that

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.970
would lead to a
decent middle-class

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.640
income with which you could
buy a house where you could

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.550
put your 2 and 1/2
kids and reproduce

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.570
to the next generation.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.350
That's obviously
no longer possible.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.340
If you asked
employers in 1970 what

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.020
the top skills they wanted,
they would say reading, writing,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.887
and arithmetic.

00:02:40.887 --> 00:02:42.470
If you ask them
today, they say things

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.130
like teamwork, problem
spotting instead

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.790
of problem solving-- like,
can you identify problems?

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.180
So the economy, the requirements
of the economy have increased.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.510
Second reason is equity.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.720
So to the degree that this
learning already exists,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.180
it's mostly existed in elite
publics and in privates.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.550
The Lab School in Chicago--
the school Dewey founded--

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.040
at one point their slogan
was "21st century skills

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.720
since the 19th century."

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.810
So what I'm talking
about is not exactly new,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.460
but the demand for lots of
people to be able to do it

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.300
is new.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.060
And in particular the
idea that all students,

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.670
particularly students of color
and high-poverty students,

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.956
would have access
to this as new.

00:03:24.956 --> 00:03:26.330
And if that doesn't
convince you,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.200
there's always this sort
of societal rationale.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.750
I first made this slide
before the election,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.080
arguing that people's
ability to be discerning

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.060
in their choice of
political candidates

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.240
and being able to read
statistics, decipher

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.730
evidence, penetrate
real news and fake news

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.690
was really important.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.300
And nothing since the
election has shaken me

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.740
of the importance of that view.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.360
As my dad said to
me once, you think

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.240
that you're sort of trying to
solve poverty and mobility,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.410
but really the fate of
the country is at stake.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.370
And I think that there's
some truth to that.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.480
And then the last point is just
interpersonal contexts are also

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.040
very complicated.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.320
I pulled this photo
from the internet.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.960
Looks like a nice Latino family.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.470
Who knows what dark secrets
are lurking below the surface?

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.730
I'll just give one example.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.269
In my house, my
older son is six.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.150
And I wanted him to pick up
stuff when he messes things up,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.240
and in my mind this was
sort of Kantian duty.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.780
Like, if you create the problem
you should fix the problem.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.690
And I tried to explain
to him that living

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.580
in a communal society
meant that you had

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.194
to take your part and so on.

00:04:39.194 --> 00:04:40.610
And then I went
to work and I came

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.482
home and things were picked up.

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:43.565
And I said, what happened?

00:04:43.565 --> 00:04:47.720
And he said, oh Grandmom,
his mother-in-law, paid me.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.840
In dollars.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.870
And I thought, oh.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.920
And my wife's-- and my
mother-in-law does some portion

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.990
of our childcare-- and my
wife just looked at me,

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.270
and she's like,
don't rock the boat.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.260
So, you know, as Judy said, I
have several advanced degrees

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.510
and have spent a lot
of time thinking.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.290
And it really took every
ounce of all of that thinking

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.817
and ability to manage
emotions to try to figure out

00:05:19.817 --> 00:05:21.900
sort of how to navigate
the situation, which might

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.761
be familiar to some of you.

00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:25.260
All right.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.980
So the challenge is there,
and the question is,

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.051
could schools do their part?

00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:32.550
All this-- you know,
a lot of things

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.008
you learn for life you're going
to learn outside of school.

00:05:35.008 --> 00:05:39.220
But could school do its
part in helping equip us?

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.020
So that's what I want
to talk about today.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.530
What does it mean to
understand something deeply?

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.780
How do you teach
for deeper learning?

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.610
Why are these
experiences relatively

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.365
rare in American schools?

00:05:49.365 --> 00:05:51.240
And what would it take
to build a system that

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.022
would more consistently
support good experiences?

00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:57.480
In the teaching part, while
I'm talking about high schools,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.310
a lot of it might be relevant
to university teaching.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.570
So there may be things,
for those of you

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.778
who teach at that level,
that might be useful to you.

00:06:02.778 --> 00:06:04.200
Definitely doing
this project has

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.730
helped me revise
some of the things

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.430
that I do in my own teaching.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.970
OK.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.170
Oh, and I should
also say that this

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.880
is going to be an interactive
talk, because there's no way

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.380
I can talk about deeper
learning and just

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.270
stand here and lecture
at you for 45 minutes.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.640
So just be prepared
that you're going to do

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.890
a little bit of mental work.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:21.390
OK.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.250
So what does it mean to
understand something deeply?

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.631
Let's think about this
together a little bit.

00:06:28.631 --> 00:06:29.130
OK.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.360
So this is a cell.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.060
You may remember this from
middle school or high school

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.560
biology.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.579
How many people in here
have significant experience

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:41.120
with biology?

00:06:43.675 --> 00:06:44.390
All right.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:49.400
So more than in a public
audience, but still most of us,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.230
this doesn't look too
familiar, myself included.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.730
OK.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.980
So you don't need to know a
lot about biology to play.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.540
If you don't remember
all the parts of the cell

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.230
you can just sort of make it up.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.120
For the moment.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.050
For the moment I'm
going to talk about why

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.460
that's a bad idea in
schools and all of that.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.960
All right.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.490
So here's I want you to do.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.310
So imagine that
you were a teacher,

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.280
and imagine that you
were trying to design

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.860
a deep lesson around the cell.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.522
Anybody can do a deep
lesson around oral history

00:07:18.522 --> 00:07:19.730
of the civil rights movement.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.890
Like, the material
just writes itself.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:27.080
But let's say that you needed
to do it around this cell.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.910
You wanted students
to sort of understand

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.970
some key aspects of the cell.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.470
So just take a minute
or two, and then confer

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.780
with a person or two around you.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.780
And try to tell
each other what you

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:47.710
would do if you were trying to
teach deeply about this cell.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.190
OK, go for it.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.660
[AUDIENCE CHATTER]

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.520
All right.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.360
OK.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.761
So who has an idea.

00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:06.260
Let's start first
with the folks who

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.380
don't do biology for a living.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.080
Or don't have-- just
folks who are just

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.050
treating this sort of
from a lay perspective.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.740
Give us an idea.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.674
Go for it.

00:08:18.674 --> 00:08:19.802
- Make a story out of it.

00:08:19.802 --> 00:08:21.260
Say, what is the
cell trying to do?

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.160
How are these parts
going to help do it?

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.605
And also, my brother
was a biology professor,

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:28.050
and if he had to talk on this,
he did not give a handout.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.109
He put it on the board
and they had to copy it

00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:30.984
into their notebooks.

00:08:30.984 --> 00:08:32.460
And he said they learned
it better that way.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.179
- All right.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.429
So there were two ideas there.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:37.110
One, if they copied it
they would remember it.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.559
And two, if they needed
to know something

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.895
about what the cell
did, that would

00:08:42.895 --> 00:08:44.020
help them make sense of it.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.780
OK.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.635
- Our idea was to have groups
of them, each sort of--

00:08:49.635 --> 00:08:51.060
if you think about
it as a system,

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.768
each person remove a
piece of the system.

00:08:52.768 --> 00:08:56.520
And then play out [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.025
- Why-- tell us more about
why you hit on that idea.

00:09:00.025 --> 00:09:02.274
- Because it would help them
understand how each piece

00:09:02.274 --> 00:09:04.880
functioned within the cell.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.104
And in every case, each
piece is necessary.

00:09:08.104 --> 00:09:11.420
So if you take one out,
the cell will likely

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.210
die but in a different way.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:14.710
- Hm.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:15.820
Interesting.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.540
Other ideas.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.190
Go ahead.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:26.530
- There's one word that occurs
twice, and that's membrane.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.113
So I think it must be important.

00:09:30.113 --> 00:09:31.502
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:32.891 --> 00:09:36.490
It must be important
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.550
For keeping in as a barrier.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:43.220
Keeping out some things,
letting other things go in.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.400
Mode to the cell as a whole.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.884
And the other place it
occurs is around the nucleus,

00:09:48.884 --> 00:09:52.835
and I have no idea why--

00:09:52.835 --> 00:09:55.210
what's special
about the nucleus.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.600
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.884
But membrane, obviously, has
to have it's own membrane.

00:10:00.884 --> 00:10:01.532
- Huh.

00:10:01.532 --> 00:10:02.740
So that's interesting, right?

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.470
Even without detailed
biological knowledge,

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.315
you can reason just from what's
written on the slides, right?

00:10:09.315 --> 00:10:11.690
You can start to understand
something about the functions

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.920
just by noticing that two of
the things share the same term

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.730
and thus must be
playing the same role.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:18.280
OK.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.140
One more.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.310
Stephanie, go ahead.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.332
- I was thinking
when you were talking

00:10:22.332 --> 00:10:24.040
about the possibility
of showing the cell

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.780
under some sort of duress.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.545
So the cell affected by some
kind of disease, infection,

00:10:30.545 --> 00:10:33.520
would the functioning
be different?

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.770
Would the story be different?

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:40.600
- So sort of the Garfinkle,
ethnomethodological approach.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.580
Like, if you put
it under stress,

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.910
you'll get some sense of why it
works and why it doesn't work.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:46.960
All right.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.050
So those are great ideas.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:53.140
And the reason that they're
great ideas and a number of you

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.030
hit on them, is
that they don't just

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.010
ask you to think about
what the parts are.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:01.540
They ask you to think about
how the system functions.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.490
And another way that
you could do it is you

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.610
could ask them to
make an analogy.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.520
So, say, to sort
of create a city

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.440
and have the city
serve out-- have

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.990
the parts of the city do the
same functions of the cell.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.380
And if you can transfer
the principles of what's

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.090
happening in the cell
to another context,

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:23.020
that demonstrates that you
understand how they work.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.730
All right.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:25.980
OK, good.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.540
Oh, and I should say that this
is too cultured an audience.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.210
Sometimes people say
things like, well,

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.070
what if you just made
every kid-- like,

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.200
gave every kid a role,
and one dressed up

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.647
as the nucleus and one
dressed up, and so forth.

00:11:37.647 --> 00:11:39.980
And they're like, you know,
it would be really engaging.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.790
And it might be
engaging, depending

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.710
on how you pitched it.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.650
But it wouldn't get
at the function.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:51.410
So about a sixth of
us are biologists.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.696
How many people have
listened to "Car Talk"?

00:11:53.696 --> 00:11:55.510
Aha.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.010
OK.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:56.220
All right.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:56.980
This is my kind of crowd.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:57.480
OK.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.905
So if you--

00:11:58.905 --> 00:12:01.740
I think the "Car Talk"
really brings it home, right?

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:06.210
So when someone calls
"Car Talk" and they say,

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.810
my thing is my car
sputters every 50 feet

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.600
and then it shuts down,
and it makes these sounds.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.920
[SQUEAKING SOUND]

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.670
And then the guys are like, does
that happen more when it rains?

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.380
There you see someone
who understands

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.250
the symptoms talking to someone
who understands the underlying

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.090
system.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.060
And so the questions are from
a diagnostic point of view

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.730
from the perspective of someone
who understands the system.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:30.230
OK.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.010
So this is the cognitive
side of deeper learning.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:43.020
It connects to research on
expertise, pattern recognition.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:47.250
And one way of looking at
the cognitive side of deeper

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.980
learning in the classroom
is to use a very old tool,

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.470
Bloom's Revised Taxonomy,
which was created in the '50s.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.930
And anyone who's taught
is familiar with this.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:59.650
Basically distinguishes six
levels of classroom tasks--

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.620
remembering, understanding,
applying, analyzing,

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.270
evaluating, and creating.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.680
And so when we went into
classrooms, just very simply,

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.960
we just said, what
are the kids doing?

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.539
And which level
across these things

00:13:12.539 --> 00:13:14.330
are they-- what are
they being asked to do?

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.230
So if they're copying
something from the board,

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.070
they're remembering and maybe
potentially understanding.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.280
For example, if they're
applying an algorithm in math--

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.870
so they've been
given the algorithm.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.245
They're working
out the problems.

00:13:26.245 --> 00:13:27.177
That's applying.

00:13:27.177 --> 00:13:29.010
And then analyzing,
evaluating, and creating

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.180
is more sophisticated.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.450
So the Gates Measures
of Effective Teaching

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.370
study classified tasks this way.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.616
This is the largest
ever study of--

00:13:38.616 --> 00:13:40.740
videotape study of classrooms
in the United States.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.340
And they found that about
four in five classrooms

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.080
were in this bottom half.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.010
And about one in five classrooms
were in this top half.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.530
And that was pretty
consistent with our experience

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:53.820
going into classrooms.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.000
Another way to put it is,
if I stapled myself to a kid

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.520
and followed that kid
through their day,

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.940
we would likely hit upon
one, and sometimes two,

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.030
classrooms where teachers
were asking students to think,

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.960
to put it in really
simple terms.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.360
There were sort of good news
and bad news in our study

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.790
in that a number of the
schools that we went to

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.395
were recommended schools.

00:14:16.395 --> 00:14:17.960
So Someone said,
if you really want

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.910
to understand deeper
learning, 21st century skills,

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.500
go to this school.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.590
And the bad news was
that in those schools

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.800
there was often much
less than met the eye.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.360
What was on the web site
far outran what was actually

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.980
happening in the classroom.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.400
The good news was, just
in regular public schools

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.840
down the street, this one
in five pattern prevailed.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.340
So I gave a talk once somewhere,
and I was talking about one

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.080
in five, and I was
putting it out there

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.550
as a sort of fairly
pessimistic number.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.910
And someone came up to
me afterwards and said,

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.130
if there's 3 and 1/2
million teachers in America

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.590
and 700,000 of them
are doing this,

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.110
then you have a really large
group of people who are already

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.700
doing the things that you want.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:57.870
Couldn't you build on that?

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.300
And so that was interesting.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.440
OK.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.481
So then the second part is the
sort of affective dimension,

00:15:04.481 --> 00:15:04.980
right?

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.479
Which is like, why
would anyone want

00:15:06.479 --> 00:15:08.640
to learn about the cell
in the first place?

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.880
Those of us who are my age-- who
are sort of sandwich generation

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.610
folks who have parents and
aunts and uncles who are getting

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:15.420
older--

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.460
all of a sudden
biology is becoming

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.440
a lot more interesting,
because people

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.222
are getting sick in
a variety of ways

00:15:21.222 --> 00:15:23.430
and sort of understanding
how the body can break down

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.888
seems a lot more relevant than
it did even a few years ago,

00:15:25.888 --> 00:15:27.270
say for me.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:31.249
So the question is, what's
the purpose of the learning.

00:15:31.249 --> 00:15:33.540
And so the other thing that
we looked for in classrooms

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.450
was engagement, which is,
were kids watching the clock,

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:38.760
waiting for the class to end?

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:44.040
Were they full-throated involved
in whatever was happening?

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.380
And so here's a quote from
a teacher about her best

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:46.920
classroom.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.840
This was actually one
of these really strict,

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.310
no excuses schools.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.377
And we said, so what
happens on your best day?

00:15:52.377 --> 00:15:54.210
And she says, I mean
there's just a feeling.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.627
Kind of a buzz or a sense of
investment and engagement.

00:15:56.627 --> 00:15:58.710
It's really hard to quantify
that and describe it,

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.219
because it's kind of an
aura that fills the room.

00:16:01.219 --> 00:16:03.510
So I feel like my best day
is when everyone is not just

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.718
focused-- because I think
our kids are always focused

00:16:05.718 --> 00:16:07.180
because they have
to be focused--

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.640
but invested in what
they're learning.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.350
That there's something
motivating them beyond just

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.433
that they have to do this.

00:16:11.433 --> 00:16:14.130
They're experiencing a level
of intellectual engagement,

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.350
even if English is not their
favorite subject or one

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.120
that they feel
particularly good at.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.100
But they feel the lesson
is exciting and worthy

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.060
of their mental space.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.700
So all of us have
taught, and all of us

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.824
have had classes that have
taken off, and all of us

00:16:25.824 --> 00:16:27.829
have had classes that fall flat.

00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:30.120
So there's no world where
every class is going to soar.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.661
But the question is, could you
create the elements that would

00:16:32.661 --> 00:16:34.650
make them soar more often?

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.180
And can you get to the
center of the Venn diagram?

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:37.680
All right.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.530
So here's some national
data from the student Gallup

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.150
poll on engagement.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.830
This is actually a
composite of a number

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.880
of more specific indicators that
measure engagement in school.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.310
And fifth graders, about
75%, say that they--

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.140
so self-report--

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.710
75% say that they're
engaged in school.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:59.760
And by 12th grade it's
down to about 32%.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.410
And you have to be in
school to take this poll.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.020
So all the kids
who are dropped out

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.762
are not represented
in this sample.

00:17:06.762 --> 00:17:08.970
And presumably the most
disengaged kids aren't there.

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:12.000
So the real numbers
are actually worse.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.619
And I would challenge you
to think about engagement,

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.780
not as a sort of
frilly side effect,

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.400
like oh they're adolescents.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.219
They're bored.

00:17:21.219 --> 00:17:22.760
Adolescents always
say they're bored.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.920
But to think of it more like
a precondition for learning.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.510
That until you
engage in a subject

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.180
you can't really take it up.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.570
So long story short,
our tour of schools

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.780
convinced us that there are
sort of two big challenges

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:37.980
facing American schooling.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.260
One is about the
level of challenge,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.570
and the other is about
the level of engagement.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.420
And if we could make some
progress on those two things,

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.240
our students would have--
there would be much less wasted

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.890
potential in
schools, and we would

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:52.320
have much more capable adults.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.300
All right.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.490
So just to sort of
illustrate this,

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.500
just wanted to talk
about two classes

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.290
from an affluent public
high school in New England.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.360
This is a picture of
Wayland public high school.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.859
That wasn't the
school in our study,

00:18:04.859 --> 00:18:06.660
but it just gives you a sense.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.790
This is not a school where
everything's breaking down,

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.370
where there's no money, where
the teachers have no experience

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.030
level.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.860
This is the kind
of place where you

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:22.300
would pay money for a house to
send your kids to this school.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.500
And so kind of the
average class--

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.410
OK, so again, this is
not a disastrous class.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.850
This is not kids--

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:33.540
as a book on schools
opens with kids

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.844
peeing into the plant
in the classroom.

00:18:36.844 --> 00:18:38.010
It's not it's not like that.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.841
This is just sort
of normal school.

00:18:40.841 --> 00:18:41.340
OK.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.756
So the teacher's
standing in front

00:18:42.756 --> 00:18:44.280
of the class, AP
psychology class,

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.760
reviewing for an upcoming
unit test on different types

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.070
of conditioning.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.520
What is overjustification,
she asks.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.490
And Eliza says,
people do things when

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.650
they expect to get the reward.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.870
What is food aversion, she asks?

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.460
Adam says, if you
eat something that

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.890
makes you feel sick you
won't want to eat it.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.140
She reminds them of an
acronym that Mr. Chen,

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.360
another psychology
teacher, came up with.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.150
V.O.I.C.E.-- voluntary,
operant, involuntary, classical.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.060
But it's a bad acronym,
because the E doesn't

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.950
stand for anything, she says.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.346
The kids laugh.

00:19:15.346 --> 00:19:17.970
She gives a few minutes in small
groups to talk about the terms

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:18.886
they are unsure about.

00:19:18.886 --> 00:19:21.150
She passes out an
open note quiz.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.590
The questions are
pretty similar.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.870
Like, what is stimulus response?

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.250
They go through the answers.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.890
She asks students to
volunteer the answers.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:30.960
She says, Connie, what
did you get on this?

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.120
And Connie says A, and
she says, that wouldn't

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.324
be the best choice.

00:19:34.324 --> 00:19:36.240
And she turns to someone
else, and they say B,

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.454
and she says yes,
that is correct.

00:19:38.454 --> 00:19:40.620
And after that she gives
them some advice about what

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.830
the AP is looking for on their
short answers, and then class

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.550
is dismissed.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.800
So this is kind of average.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.930
Not terrible, not incompetently
managed, but just sort

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:53.160
of average.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.380
And then compare this to another
class in the same school.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:03.630
So Philosophy as
Literature class.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.240
This is an elective class, which
is important in that students

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.460
had chosen to take this class.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.010
And when I come in, they're
sitting in a sort of semicircle

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:13.110
and they're
discussing Descartes.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:17.580
And they're discussing this
idea about, is the fact

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.770
that we know--

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.510
how do we know what we know?

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:25.080
Does the fact that I could
think that everything out here,

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.670
you all could be a dream.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:27.940
This podium could be a dream.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.190
These chairs could be a dream.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.689
But the fact that I'm thinking
it means that I exist, right?

00:20:31.689 --> 00:20:35.970
And so they're sort of unpacking
this idea from Descartes.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.920
The students are doing
most of the talking.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.216
Mike is interjecting
things occasionally.

00:20:40.216 --> 00:20:42.090
And then the students
are saying things like,

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.280
what about computers?

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.260
Computers seem to
think, but do they

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.900
exist in the same
sense as humans?

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.430
Or what about vegetables?

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.080
Like humans as vegetables.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.580
They can't think,
but don't they exist?

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.330
And so the class just sort
of went around like this.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.232
Pondering different examples
and counter-examples

00:21:00.232 --> 00:21:02.190
and trying to think about,
what would Descartes

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:02.939
have made of that?

00:21:02.939 --> 00:21:04.800
What would they have
made of Descartes?

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.050
And then towards
the end, the teacher

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.770
tries to do this teacherly
thing of saying, all right, well

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:14.520
tomorrow we're going to
talk about how Descartes--

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.867
Descartes' views on God
and why God must exist.

00:21:16.867 --> 00:21:18.450
And the students are
like, wait, wait.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:19.440
How would he know that?

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.640
And what's the logic?

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.960
And where is it coming from?

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.710
And he's just trying
to wrap up the class.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.040
But once you let
out of skepticism

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.890
you can't bottle it back up.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:30.510
One of the students
in that class

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.810
told us that he had tried to
explain what Descartes thought

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.150
about free will to his carpool.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.040
So I that that's
kind of how it went.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.490
And so part of the
question is how could we--

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.890
what's different about
these two classes,

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.350
and how could we generate
more of the second and less

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.150
of the first?

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.570
And as we started to look
across these teachers,

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:55.004
we noticed some differences
between most teachers

00:21:55.004 --> 00:21:57.170
and what we might call these
sort of deeper learning

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:58.280
teachers.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.080
The first point
was just the goal.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.840
That the goal of most teachers
was to cover the material.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.090
And the goal of these teachers--

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.160
if you really sort of
put a point on it--

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.530
they were trying to
basically inspire people

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.687
to become members of a field.

00:22:11.687 --> 00:22:13.520
They knew that understanding
Descartes would

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.760
take a long time,
many years of study,

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.260
but what they were
just trying to do

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.380
was just get kids to begin
the practice of arguing

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.260
and thinking in
philosophical terms.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.270
Because of that, their
pedagogical priorities

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.640
focused on depth as
opposed to breadth.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.700
Their view of knowledge was
uncertain rather than certain,

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:33.200
right?

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.830
That knowledge, even
disciplinary knowledge,

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:38.150
is essentially provisional.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:42.140
It's an interpretation
created by a group of scholars

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.620
and verified through
certain conventions.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.370
And they were inviting
students into that,

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.860
and they were
essentially helping

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:49.900
students play with that.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.530
You could see that again
in the Descartes example.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.540
Like, what the students
did is this sort

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.120
of rudimentary version of what
philosophers would do around

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.490
the same question.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.890
Change the role of student
from a receiver of knowledge

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:02.810
to a creator of knowledge.

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.850
They had a different
view of failure,

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.950
not as something to be
avoided but as something

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.140
to be embraced.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.350
And these classes had
a different ethos.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:18.170
Less compliance, more what
I call purpose plus play.

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:19.130
OK.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.890
So what differentiated
these people?

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.230
A big part of it
was their stance.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.000
So they had a
different view of what

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.400
it is they were trying to do.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.260
A second part was
their knowledge.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.650
They were deeply knowledgeable
about their fields

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:36.710
and thus were not afraid of
venturing into places where

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:38.180
they might not know the answer.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.680
They welcomed
students saying things

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.221
that they hadn't
thought of, and that

00:23:41.221 --> 00:23:44.240
came from a certain
security with the content.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.480
They developed pedagogical
skill in a particular mode.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.770
The mode might vary.

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:51.460
In Mike's case it was sort of
leading a Socratic seminar.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.230
In another case it
might be project-based.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:55.130
In a third case it might
be competency-based.

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:57.830
At the university-level
and might be case teaching.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.330
The mode didn't
matter, but they had

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.220
developed enough
sophistication with the mode

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.740
that they sort of
knew how to use it.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.040
And then critically they'd had
experiences of what it was they

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.700
were trying to create.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.570
So whether those experiences
had happened in their own K-12

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:15.260
schooling, in higher ed,
or somewhere along the way,

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.960
as teachers, they'd
sort of become convinced

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.940
that the way that people
normally do education

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.648
wasn't really serving
their students well

00:24:21.648 --> 00:24:23.900
and that they wanted to
do something different.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.020
There was one woman
in our study who

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.080
taught a fabulous Theory of
Knowledge philosophy class

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.550
where the students
said, this class

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:33.905
makes my brain hurt every day.

00:24:33.905 --> 00:24:36.030
And I said, where did you
learn to teach like that?

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.030
And she's like oh
well the first time

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.850
I started teaching was on
a Fulbright in Indonesia.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:43.820
And October of the first year
this student came up to me

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.910
and tapped me on the
shoulder and said,

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:47.490
you seem like a
really nice lady,

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:48.970
but you've got to stop talking.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:55.160
And she just sort of saw that
as a signal moment, which

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.630
had started-- she
was probably 45

00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:00.200
when I talked to her-- but this
had started a long journey.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.430
Most of the teachers who are
in our deeper teacher sample

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.080
were over 35.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.050
It took a while to
get to this place.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:10.550
OK.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:12.570
So I want to switch
gears for a second.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.290
And I want to think
a little bit about,

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:21.080
how do people become deeply
knowledgeable about something?

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.230
Because you might think
that how people become

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:25.790
knowledgeable or
skilled at something

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:29.360
should inform how we think
about what happens in schools.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.950
Call me crazy.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:36.530
So just think of a domain--

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:38.990
could be a professional
domain, could be a hobby,

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:42.740
could be cooking, could
be whatever it might be--

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.749
where someone could
come to you, and they

00:25:45.749 --> 00:25:46.790
could ask you a question.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.623
And they could ask you
a follow-up question,

00:25:48.623 --> 00:25:51.740
and you would feel comfortable
having a really significant

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.180
conversation about it.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:53.680
OK.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.320
You got something
like that in mind?

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.746
All right.

00:25:57.746 --> 00:25:59.120
And now try to
think a little bit

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:07.640
about how you came to reach that
level of skill or expertise.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.310
Were there signal events?

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:10.760
Did it happen in
formal schooling?

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.660
Outside of schooling?

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:12.600
Et cetera.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.250
OK.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:16.040
So just turn to a neighbor
and take a couple minutes

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.160
and exchange stories.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.950
We've got about four minutes,
so take about two minutes

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.615
and then swap.

00:26:23.615 --> 00:26:24.120
Go for it.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.060
[CHATTER]

00:26:34.305 --> 00:26:36.405
All right.

00:26:36.405 --> 00:26:37.240
All right, great.

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:44.230
One of the perils of
student center teaching

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:49.400
is that people never want to
return to the person up front.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:49.900
OK.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:55.820
So who has a story that
they want to share with us?

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:56.800
Go for it.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:01.440
- My question is, can we ever
be knowledgeable [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.030
There's the saying that
says, I know one thing--

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.510
that I know nothing.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:09.220
I was just telling my neighbor
that yes, I studied something,

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.095
I learned things.

00:27:10.095 --> 00:27:12.640
But then the field
itself develops.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.525
And as time goes by I find
myself genuinely knowing less.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:20.990
- Interesting.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.490
All right.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:24.030
Let's pick that up
at the questions.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.030
That seems like--

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:27.196
- We could make a loaf of bread.

00:27:27.196 --> 00:27:29.090
- What's that?

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:33.380
We pose that as a question when
we get to that, the questions.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:36.270
Anybody have a story
they want to share?

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.550
Or would people like to let
me talk with you for a minute

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.550
or two about your skill?

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:42.050
Kristen.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:45.460
- So mine is vegetarian cooking.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.371
- Vegetarian cooking.

00:27:46.371 --> 00:27:46.870
OK.

00:27:49.879 --> 00:27:50.670
How did that start?

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:51.370
Like, were you--

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.453
- So I think it started
that I became a vegetarian

00:27:53.453 --> 00:27:55.570
in high school, and
my family was like,

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.420
well you're going to
cook your own food.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.634
And then realizing that I didn't
know anything about protein

00:28:01.634 --> 00:28:02.550
or anything like that.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.200
And it took me a long time.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.830
So I read a lot of magazines and
books and just practiced a lot.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.020
Trial and error.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.160
Made love terrible meals.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.330
Ate a lot of salads until I
couldn't eat salads anymore.

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:17.300
Really learned to cook
more through that.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.960
- What motivated you
to become a vegetarian?

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.080
- She knew she'll meet me.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.995
- That's right.

00:28:24.995 --> 00:28:27.340
- You're really sitting
in the right spot today.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.380
- I had an older sister
who had gone to college

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:32.110
and become a radical
feminist and a vegetarian,

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.945
and so she send me the book,
The Sexual Politics of Meat.

00:28:34.945 --> 00:28:35.895
- Aha.

00:28:35.895 --> 00:28:37.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:38.745 --> 00:28:40.145
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:40.145 --> 00:28:40.645
- Yeah.

00:28:40.645 --> 00:28:42.478
And I think it was sort
of shared opposition

00:28:42.478 --> 00:28:43.915
to Thanksgiving
with their family

00:28:43.915 --> 00:28:46.750
to be like, we're
not eating this.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.730
- Is there any
community in your story?

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:50.980
Did you ever find other
people who knew how to do it?

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.480
- Yeah.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.516
And I think that I've
gotten better by--

00:28:53.516 --> 00:28:54.890
like, I just think
I like to cook

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:58.310
with other people, particularly
other vegetarians or vegans.

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.694
And so that's something
that I do together a lot

00:29:00.694 --> 00:29:02.860
in learning different kinds
of techniques and things

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:03.359
like that.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.230
- Does anybody
have a second story

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:12.640
which is different, not just in
subject but in kind, somehow?

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.400
Nick.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.280
- I'm a master-ranked
chess player.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.359
I got strong by playing
[INAUDIBLE] games

00:29:20.359 --> 00:29:21.150
and getting beaten.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:22.150
I did a lot.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:23.920
And I didn't like it one bit.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.950
So I work hard.

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:32.180
[INAUDIBLE] and then you go up
a level and I got beaten again.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:33.419
- All right.

00:29:33.419 --> 00:29:34.960
Anybody have any
example of something

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.110
that's not so much a
skill, but a development,

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.790
a way of thinking,
a way of being.

00:29:43.855 --> 00:29:47.399
- So my mom's an
education degree holder.

00:29:47.399 --> 00:29:48.940
And when we were
growing up-- and I'm

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.648
the oldest in my
family-- she would often

00:29:50.648 --> 00:29:54.860
talk about why she was
parenting in certain ways

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.170
because of what kids do at
that developmental stage.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:00.150
Or explain what she was
doing as she was doing it.

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.980
And I think she also was reader
of a great deal of fiction.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.355
So there was was always kind
of a third person omniscient

00:30:05.355 --> 00:30:06.932
narrator going on in my house.

00:30:06.932 --> 00:30:09.875
It made me fear of the
"why" of dealing with kids.

00:30:09.875 --> 00:30:12.170
And it made me more
willing to then--

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:15.322
as I got older and was
babysitting and then

00:30:15.322 --> 00:30:17.870
being other roles with kids
and eventually parenting--

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.550
asking other people
who I saw having

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:21.050
really good
relationships with kids,

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:23.175
where kids would have a
lot of fun and learn a lot,

00:30:23.175 --> 00:30:24.310
why are you doing that?

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.295
Or what makes you do that?

00:30:26.295 --> 00:30:27.170
- That's interesting.

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:28.474
So it's sort of--

00:30:28.474 --> 00:30:30.140
normally when there's
parenting, there's

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.130
just the parent and the kid.

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:32.570
In this case, there was
the parent and the kid

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:35.300
and there was this sort of body
of thinking about parenting

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.120
that was in the conversation
between the three of you.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.100
And that sort of
sparked an interest

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.590
and as you became a parent,
especially, or a child

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.880
caretaker, you continued to--

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:46.460
OK.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:46.960
All right.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.790
So I would love to
continue to do this,

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:53.720
but maybe we can return
to it in the questions.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.680
So we think that
there's a model that

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.740
roughly captures some
of the kinds of things

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.310
that you all said.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:05.760
It has three elements-- mastery,
identity, and creativity.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.930
So mastery is developing
knowledge and skill

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:10.080
and a domain.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.940
So in chess that would be
learning the openings and--

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.180
And then there's an
identity dimension.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.410
It comes to matter to you.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:19.910
We heard that in
Kristen's example

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:22.940
of the sexual politics of meat.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.920
And then there's a
creativity example,

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.960
where you're not just
taking in things,

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.430
you're trying to do things.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:30.830
And how well you
do those things--

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.837
we heard this in
Nick's example--

00:31:32.837 --> 00:31:35.420
particularly when you're unable
to do the things that you wish

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.580
that you could do,
that pushes you back

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.130
towards the more
basic parts of study,

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.887
which is the mastery part.

00:31:42.887 --> 00:31:45.470
Benjamin Bloom, the same guy who
came up with Bloom's Taxonomy

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:48.420
did a study of swimmers--

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.750
Olympians and other
national swimmers-- and he

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:53.600
asked them and their parents how
they'd gotten to be that way.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.980
And they said,
well, when we were

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.352
four we just liked the water.

00:31:56.352 --> 00:31:58.310
We liked to play in the
pool and at the beach--

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:59.660
the water was our thing.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:03.920
And then we got some
coaching from our local Y

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.390
and so on and so forth.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.850
And somewhere between 8
and 12 there was a shift.

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:13.949
We went from I'm someone
who swims, to I'm a swimmer.

00:32:13.949 --> 00:32:15.740
And then when that
identity shift happened,

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.210
that motivated a
lot of practice.

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:18.626
So this is all
that stuff you hear

00:32:18.626 --> 00:32:22.010
about discipline, practice,
repetition, and all that.

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:24.250
There was a lot of that
between about 12 and 20.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.980
The coaching got
more sophisticated.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.490
So they went from the Y to
the state to the national.

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:31.980
So they were getting
more and better feedback.

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.170
And then they said at the end
they could play again, just

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:40.200
at a much more sophisticated
level than they could before.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.100
So you might think of these
cycles of mastery and identity

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.380
and creativity as a spiral.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.860
That over time, you do
this in communities.

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.010
And over time, each
community shapes you,

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:53.780
including Radcliffe.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:57.866
And the attributes of
that community move you,

00:32:57.866 --> 00:32:59.240
and where you are
in your journey

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.140
when you hit that community
affects what you take of it.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.590
OK.

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:05.090
All right.

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:11.060
So to tie this to bring
this back towards schools,

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.190
where are there opportunities
for deeper learning

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:15.860
in American schools?

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.370
And so we say we sort of
have three big observations

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:20.390
from our study.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.160
One, in all schools
opportunities

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.710
for deeper learning were
present but relatively rare.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:28.370
Two, the opportunities
that were there

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:31.730
were unequally distributed
by race, class, and track.

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:33.780
And three, that
peripheral spaces,

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.660
including electives
and extracurriculars,

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.610
were often more
promising platforms

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:40.310
for this kind of learning
than disciplinary classes.

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:42.111
So in the remainder
of my time I want

00:33:42.111 --> 00:33:44.360
to talk a little bit about
each of those three points.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.080
All right.

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:49.580
So the first point is that the
"Grammar" of Schooling, which

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:54.150
is a term developed
by my colleagues

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:58.460
David Tack and Larry Cuban, to
describe the sort of aspects

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:01.190
of schooling that are
so baked into schooling

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:03.440
that we don't even really
think about them being there

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.979
but have really significant
impacts in what happens

00:34:07.979 --> 00:34:09.020
with respect to learning.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.084
So I was particularly
interested in high schools.

00:34:11.084 --> 00:34:12.500
In most of the
high schools I went

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.460
to kids were taking seven things
for 45 to 50 minutes each.

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.889
Teachers said that basically
it took a few minutes

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:20.110
to get going.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:22.610
About the point where people
were starting to get interested

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.230
in things you had
to shut it down

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:26.210
if people were going
to wrap up their papers

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:27.560
and move on to the next thing.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.935
Kids said they were trying to
do homework in seven things

00:34:29.935 --> 00:34:31.139
each night.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:34.159
And so if you were trying to
design opportunities for people

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:37.230
to do things in depth you
wouldn't do it that way.

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:40.820
The second point is
breadth over depth.

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:44.770
The state standards and
the district pacing guides

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:48.485
emphasized, must
cover this thing

00:34:48.485 --> 00:34:50.110
that Newton did, this
thing that Darwin

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:53.080
found, this play that
Shakespeare wrote, et cetera.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.989
And that the march of
content and the pace

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:58.450
made it hard to go into depth.

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:00.460
The core test for
students in school

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:05.020
is to record what other people
have thought about things

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.570
and reflect that back.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:09.460
They have a lot of
practice at that.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.900
They do not have
a lot of practice

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.210
at creating knowledge or
thinking about where knowledge

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:15.880
comes from, which is why
I think that often they're

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.810
doing what you might think of as
facsimiles of disciplinary work

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.710
rather than actual
disciplinary work.

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:24.520
So in science, for
example, when you do a lab,

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.590
you're essentially
following a series of steps

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:30.460
to show to yourself a principle
that somebody else has already

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:31.390
discovered.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:33.250
And if the lab
doesn't show that,

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.780
then you did something wrong.

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.699
Like, something went
wrong in your lab.

00:35:36.699 --> 00:35:38.740
Whereas science, as
everybody in this room knows,

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.630
is basically the
opposite of that.

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.610
You're not showing
yourself the known,

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:45.850
you're exploring the unknown.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:47.832
There's little connection
to the outside world,

00:35:47.832 --> 00:35:50.290
and students did few things
that didn't just go to teachers

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:50.920
and come back.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.360
So the grammar was
sort of not promising.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.890
All right.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:57.317
A second point.

00:35:57.317 --> 00:35:58.900
So I just want to
tell you about a day

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:03.280
we spent at a traditional
public school in the Bronx.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.519
This was a high-poverty
school and had

00:36:05.519 --> 00:36:07.060
all the problems
you might associated

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.850
with a high-poverty school.

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:12.370
And my colleague and I,
Sarah, spent the morning

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:13.150
at the school.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:16.390
And I went to a
history class, and it

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:20.290
was one of the--
it was literally

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:23.530
one of the worst classes
we saw in our whole study.

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.450
The students were
sitting in rows.

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:28.750
The teacher was saying, and
then the Industrial Revolution

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:30.360
happened in--

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:37.710
and the kids were supposed to
say, 1900, 1880, like that.

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:39.430
And so that was my morning.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.530
I came to lunch rather dejected.

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:44.200
My colleague Sarah, with
whom I've done a lot of work,

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.680
also saw history classes
in this same school,

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:51.550
and in the classes
that she saw, kids

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:53.470
were examining
primary documents,

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:55.270
developing
interpretations, giving

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:58.124
each other feedback on each
other's interpretations.

00:36:58.124 --> 00:37:00.040
You know, they were doing
a sort of 11th grade

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.196
version of history.

00:37:01.196 --> 00:37:02.570
And so we come to
lunch and we're

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:05.050
reporting our various
mornings, and we're

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:08.350
sitting in this conference
room, and this woman walks in,

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:11.560
and we realize that we've seen
the same woman teach, just

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.620
in different tracks.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.870
And she said-- we talked
to her, and she said, well,

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:19.360
I tried to do this stuff
with these kids last year.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.490
And it didn't really take, and
they need to pass the Regents.

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:22.865
And for Regents
they need to know

00:37:22.865 --> 00:37:24.350
when the Industrial
Revolution is,

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:26.510
so this year I'm
doing it this way.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:29.440
So there's a big gap
in the field when

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:36.610
it comes to knowledge of
how to interest and engage

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:42.130
students who are not in the top
tracks in this kind of work.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.350
We tend to sort of
blame the people,

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:47.960
but I would sort of
tend to blame the field.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.457
They have ways of working
in certain contexts,

00:37:50.457 --> 00:37:52.540
but they don't know how
to work in other contexts.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.070
There were some
people in our study

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:57.244
who did it with students who
are not in the top track.

00:37:57.244 --> 00:37:59.410
And there's lots of people
in other people's studies

00:37:59.410 --> 00:37:59.980
that have done that.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:01.438
So it's not that
it's not possible,

00:38:01.438 --> 00:38:03.700
it's just that the
knowledge of how to do that

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.350
is not widely available.

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:08.440
There's also a belief gap.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.524
Teachers in more
affluent settings

00:38:10.524 --> 00:38:12.940
had much higher beliefs about
what their students could do

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:18.610
and that shared racial and class
backgrounds in those schools

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:22.750
had them treat students as sort
of capable, meaning makers.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:25.870
The famous line about this is,
upper/middle class students are

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.592
being prepared to
manage factories,

00:38:27.592 --> 00:38:29.050
and poor and working
class students

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:30.690
are being taught to
work in factories.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.580
And that's a very old
line of the literature,

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.300
but it's still true.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:35.800
OK.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:40.420
So basically we saw
different kinds of challenges

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:44.590
to deeper learning across
these different contexts.

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.750
So I've talked
about the challenges

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.670
for the poor and the
lower track students,

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.128
but I want to take
a minute to talk

00:38:50.128 --> 00:38:53.830
about the challenges in the
middle and upper track classes.

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:58.210
So in the AP track
classes, among students

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:02.260
who are trying to get into
top and selective colleges,

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.890
there was a different kind
of problem, which was--

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:07.810
scholars in education
have distinguished

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:09.850
between what they call
performance and learning

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:10.600
orientations.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.920
Performance-- some
of you may know this,

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.020
because it's sort of
filtered into the higher ed

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.603
how we should be
teaching literature--

00:39:15.603 --> 00:39:17.920
but performance
orientations emphasize

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.300
getting the right answer.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.630
Learning orientations
emphasize productive, struggle,

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:26.110
exploring, making
mistakes, et cetera.

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:27.610
And students,
particularly students

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:29.950
who wanted to-- who lived
in affluent communities

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:31.870
and wanted to go
to top colleges,

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:35.884
they were not having any of
this learning orientation.

00:39:35.884 --> 00:39:37.300
They wanted to
know that they were

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.210
going to get the good grade.

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:40.501
They wanted to know that they
were going to get the AP.

00:39:40.501 --> 00:39:42.790
The teachers were in turn
evaluated by the parents,

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.160
on the grades, by the
community, on the number of APs

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.420
the kids passed.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:51.520
And so all of this mitigated
against more powerful learning.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.310
In these communities teachers
frequently said, you know,

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:58.090
we do a lot of the interesting
stuff basically from now,

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:00.040
this point in the
year-- like May 15th--

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:04.900
to June 15, because that's
after the APs are over.

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.580
This is a pretty
complicated issue,

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:10.810
because AP is a way to
create some standardization

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:13.090
across a lot of schools.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:14.980
And so the same
teacher said, well, I

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.500
think AP might be a good
thing in another district

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:21.850
where they didn't have as high
expectations as we had here.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:22.720
But anyway.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.820
This performance versus
learning orientation thing

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.620
was a big problem.

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:29.620
This is a talk which is
covering a lot of ground,

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.870
so AP is a complicated subject.

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:33.910
There's variants across the APs.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:37.420
History is the worst in terms
of depth versus breadth.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.250
Other subjects, they've
made some changes.

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:43.390
We can talk about that
in the discussion.

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:47.110
Then there was this question
of the periphery and core.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:50.470
So when we started the study
we were focused on classes.

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:51.970
That's what people
at ed schools do.

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:55.990
They study English,
math, biology.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:58.870
And as we went to the
schools, we came to think,

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.700
this isn't really
where the action is.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:03.082
The places where kids
are building skills,

00:41:03.082 --> 00:41:05.290
where they're engaged, where
they're making mistakes,

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:08.150
look more like those
spaces around the edge--

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:11.190
choir, robotics club,
field hockey, debate--

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:14.340
then they do the core classes.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.870
So here was one day
in the same school.

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:19.870
So this has me walking
into an English class.

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:22.810
Students are Googling-- and
this is pretty well-off school--

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:25.630
which country has the
highest voting rates.

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:27.610
Turns out to be some
country in Eastern Europe.

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:28.930
Who knew.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:30.640
Then four minutes on me.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.790
I'm a Harvard
professor, Harvard blah.

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:36.550
Anything to not do whatever
we're supposed to be doing.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:39.750
Just provide some entertainment.

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:42.460
Then video clips from
three versions of Hamlet--

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.555
the Kenneth Branagh one, the
Mel Gibson one, and one other.

00:41:45.555 --> 00:41:46.930
And then they were
supposed to be

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:48.880
doing some sort of
discussion of the clips

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.580
and how he was
portraying the character,

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.990
but there was only about
four minutes for that.

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:55.926
And then there was
this matching game

00:41:55.926 --> 00:41:58.300
where they'd translated some
of the Shakespearean English

00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:59.440
into modern English,
and they were

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.523
supposed to sort of order
it in the same direction

00:42:01.523 --> 00:42:02.620
as the passages.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.570
And then there was
homework and exit music.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:07.000
And it turned out this was
actually a hip-hop elective,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.220
but all seniors
had to read Hamlet,

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:13.200
and so it was like Hamlet
in a hip-hop elective.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:18.530
So in theory they were supposed
to be emphasizing the identity

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:20.510
elements of Hamlet and so on.

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:22.580
Anyway, you can see what
it was actually like.

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.090
Anyway, so as I was
leaving, this girl, Rose,

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:26.090
comes up to the teacher.

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:31.130
And she says, Mr.
G, I'm not going

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:33.960
to be able to do the
reading for Thursday.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:34.850
And he says why not?

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.160
And she says, well I'm the
stage manager for "Servant

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.990
of Two Masters," and we have
a show going up next week,

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:40.610
and I'm going to be here
till 11:00 every night.

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:42.230
So I don't have time to read it.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:43.646
And he says, don't
worry about it.

00:42:43.646 --> 00:42:45.350
You know what's important.

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:48.110
And so an hour
later, I'm sitting

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:50.480
in rehearsal for this show.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.370
It's 3:30.

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:54.320
People are putting on costumes.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.820
People are sitting
in small groups

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.010
running lines with each other.

00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:59.900
They're socializing, bonding.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:03.100
You know, they haven't
seen their friends all day.

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:03.980
Rose is there.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.440
She has the stage
manager's notebook.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.300
She's going through
the plan for the day.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.270
Her demeanor is
totally different.

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:13.340
The director gathers the
troops, frames the day.

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:17.990
He says, forget your
quizzes, your tests.

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:20.210
It was almost like hypnosis.

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:23.840
Leave behind where you
were, and be present.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.900
And then gradually move
from you to your character.

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.660
Re-envision yourself
as your character.

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.840
And then students lead
a physical warm-up.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.067
So they warm up their mouths.

00:43:34.067 --> 00:43:35.150
They warm up their bodies.

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:38.600
They're trying to
increase their energy.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.390
And then there's rehearsal.

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:43.700
And students are rehearsing.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.250
The students who are
rehearsing are onstage.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.205
They get stopped occasionally
by the director for notes.

00:43:49.205 --> 00:43:51.080
The students who are
not in particular scenes

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.030
are sitting in the audience
doing their homework,

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.113
on their phones, whatever.

00:43:54.113 --> 00:43:55.580
But when they're
on stage they're

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:59.160
not doing their homework,
on their phones, et cetera.

00:43:59.160 --> 00:43:59.900
OK.

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:04.740
So what's different
about the two spaces?

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:09.220
So here are eight elements.

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:12.700
One, there's a purposeful arc
towards public performance.

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.470
Two, they chose to be there.

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:16.120
Three, they're part
of a community.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.870
Some of the students
said they didn't even

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:20.900
know the names of the
students in their classes

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.210
but that they definitely
knew the names of the people

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:23.990
in the show.

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:25.460
And the reason that
they knew that was they

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.168
were dependent upon
them, which brings us

00:44:27.168 --> 00:44:29.740
to this next point about
inter-dependent roles.

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:33.430
So if normal classes have
one teacher and 30 students,

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:37.010
this had students in
every conceivable realm

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.940
of leadership.

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.370
One running the lights,
one running the costumes,

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:41.960
one running the set design.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.060
And then-- those were
seniors-- and then juniors,

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.880
who are assistants to
all of those things.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.440
Which created a lot
of opportunities

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.290
for apprenticeship learning.

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:54.770
There were these spirals
of mastery, identity,

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:55.910
and creativity. i.e.

00:44:55.910 --> 00:45:00.050
They were developing
knowledge about their roles.

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:02.840
They were very invested
in what they were doing.

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:06.330
Over time, sweat shirts with
the show's name appeared.

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.000
And that sort of
marked them as having

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.920
collective identity, which they
started to wear around school.

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.630
Head, heart, and hands.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:16.700
This is an old
Pestalozzi notion.

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.670
So in most of school it was
just sort of students' brains

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:20.840
on sticks.

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.680
They were only using the
cognitive part of their brain.

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.570
In this they were
emotionally invested,

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:31.160
trying to stretch who they were
to become their characters.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.970
And that was quite
challenging, but also rewarding

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:36.177
when they succeeded.

00:45:36.177 --> 00:45:38.510
And then finally, they were
doing what my colleague Dave

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:41.930
Perkins calls playing the
whole game at the junior level.

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:44.420
So Dave's idea is that
when little kids learn

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:46.100
to play baseball,
they don't spend

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:48.380
one year throwing and
the next year catching

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.600
and the year after that batting.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.090
What they do is they
play baseball the way

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:54.800
that six-year-olds
can play baseball.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.830
And sure, you practice the
elements to get better at them.

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:00.290
But you do it in the
context of the whole game.

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:01.940
So my six-year-old plays chess.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:05.171
Not well, but we can work
on the specific pieces,

00:46:05.171 --> 00:46:07.670
but he at least understands the
purpose of the overall thing

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:09.140
that he's doing.

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:12.710
And school often
compartmentalizes the purpose

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:18.060
of the overall enterprise
from the specific task.

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.580
OK.

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:24.620
So to wrap up, what
might we do about this?

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:29.840
So one agenda is a kind
of, within the box,

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.700
how can we improve things?

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:34.490
So if we didn't change
the fundamental grammar

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:37.290
of schooling, how could
we improve things?

00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:39.410
And I think it would
look something like this.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:42.614
We would need higher standards
for teachers, particularly

00:46:42.614 --> 00:46:44.030
with respect to
content knowledge.

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:46.238
Because the content knowledge
is the basis from which

00:46:46.238 --> 00:46:47.990
the rest of it flows.

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:52.370
Teacher training would need to
socialize and give experiences

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:55.580
to people that showed them
that teaching as transmission

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:57.360
wasn't really what
they were trying to do,

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.360
and showed them what a
different mode of working

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.650
would look like.

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:04.940
External testing would have to
shift from emphasizing coverage

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:06.950
to emphasizing depth.

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:08.090
This is not undoable.

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:10.280
International
baccalaureate is one system

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.160
of assessments that
measures things

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:16.040
with more emphasis on
depth than breadth.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:20.120
So, for example, rather than
answering hundreds questions

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.610
about different things that
happened in American history,

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:25.880
you might write an essay
on a topic of your choosing

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.670
about things in
American history.

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.350
And that essay
might get evaluated

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:34.580
on level of argumentation,
use of supporting evidence,

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:35.320
things like that.

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:40.370
So you could change the
form of external assessment.

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:42.242
Symmetry.

00:47:42.242 --> 00:47:44.450
As I said, we came to think
that you couldn't do this

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:45.830
unless you'd experienced it.

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:47.930
So we'd have to create
these experiences

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:50.510
for a lot of adults.

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:52.820
And we did see some
examples of success

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:55.370
beyond the individual
teachers and schools,

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:56.870
and these often
happened where there

00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:59.690
was a sort of ongoing
effort to build

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:01.040
adult learning in the schools.

00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:06.400
But I don't know.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.040
The theater experience,
in particular,

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.700
made me think that even a
mediocre theater director was

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:16.240
working in a much more favorable
grammar than an average biology

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:16.990
teacher.

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:19.697
So sure, the quality
of the director

00:48:19.697 --> 00:48:22.030
and what they could see and
the nature of their feedback

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:23.830
made a huge difference
in the quality

00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:25.210
of the final production.

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:27.040
But a lot of the things
that they needed,

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.540
they didn't have
to persuade parents

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:31.930
that there was an authentic
performance to show up for.

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:35.140
They had long blocks
of time after school.

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:38.050
The idea of students had
seen shows in real life,

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:40.210
so they knew what they
were shooting for.

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:42.380
They had a lot to work from.

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:46.270
So, you know, what if
we re-imagined school

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:48.700
and we changed the
grammar of schooling

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.420
to follow the
grammar of learning?

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:56.920
And imagine that people got
put into vertically-- or people

00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:00.850
chose to become part of
vertically integrated

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:02.080
communities of learning.

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:07.570
So, take something like
quantitative reasoning.

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:11.260
Everyone from my
six-year-old, who's asking,

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.380
why does this food hurt my
stomach and not that food?

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:17.020
We're talking about
correlation and causation

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:20.000
to my psychometric
colleagues at the ed school.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.450
They're essentially
engaged in a common task

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:25.900
of quantitative
reasoning about social,

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:29.200
and in this case
biological, events.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.710
But in school,
those opportunities

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:34.480
are very cut off
from one another.

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.500
So we can imagine a world
where 9th through 12th graders

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.690
enrolled in some sort of
quantitative reasoning

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:43.510
about the world class,
and ninth graders

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:45.049
are doing bivariate
correlations,

00:49:45.049 --> 00:49:46.840
and the 12th graders
are doing regressions,

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:48.616
and the 9th graders get to see--

00:49:48.616 --> 00:49:49.990
they're all reading
the newspaper

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:51.573
and seeing whether
the inferences that

00:49:51.573 --> 00:49:53.560
are drawn commonly
really hold, which

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.060
might be interesting to them.

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:58.060
But they're doing it at
quite different levels

00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.369
of sophistication.

00:49:59.369 --> 00:50:00.910
Right now the 9th
grade students have

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:04.030
no access to what the 12th
grade students are doing

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:06.470
and vice versa.

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.970
All right.

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:10.240
So to conclude,
deeper learning is

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.930
hard to achieve but
worth striving for.

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.090
Once you move from black
and white to color,

00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:17.660
it's hard to go back.

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:20.050
Just a question of
how we can help people

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:23.100
make that transition.
