00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:02.249
- [Voiceover] So in previous videos,

00:00:02.249 --> 00:00:03.731
we worked out an expression

00:00:03.731 --> 00:00:07.326
for the current i in an
LC circuit like this,

00:00:07.326 --> 00:00:08.159
and what we found

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:12.326
was that i is square root of
capacitance over inductance,

00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:18.064
times the starting voltage, V knot,

00:00:18.064 --> 00:00:20.064
times sine omega knot t.

00:00:23.305 --> 00:00:26.119
And omega knot is the natural frequency,

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.838
and we say that omega knot

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:31.755
was equal to square root
of one over L times C.

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:38.709
And V knot is the starting
voltage on the capacitor.

00:00:40.947 --> 00:00:43.024
And our original assumption

00:00:43.024 --> 00:00:45.857
was that i was zero to begin with,

00:00:46.918 --> 00:00:50.418
and that's the expression for the current.

00:00:51.437 --> 00:00:53.993
So what I wanna do now
is a specific example,

00:00:53.993 --> 00:00:55.738
and we'll do that down here.

00:00:55.738 --> 00:00:58.405
First I'm gonna install a switch

00:01:01.063 --> 00:01:03.743
into our circuit so that
we can add some energy

00:01:03.743 --> 00:01:05.464
and it won't go anywhere.

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:09.631
Then for C, C is gonna be
equal to a quarter of a farad,

00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:15.608
and L is gonna be equal to one henry.

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:19.549
All right?

00:01:21.677 --> 00:01:26.460
And on the capacitor, I'm
gonna put enough charge

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.041
to bring this up to 10 volts
before we close the switch.

00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:35.208
And then at time equals
zero, we'll close the switch.

00:01:38.503 --> 00:01:42.003
And what we wanna find is, what is i of t?

00:01:44.255 --> 00:01:48.296
We have L, we have C, we
have a starting voltage,

00:01:48.296 --> 00:01:50.253
and so now we have everything we need

00:01:50.253 --> 00:01:52.022
to work out the current.

00:01:52.022 --> 00:01:53.302
Let's do that, okay?

00:01:53.302 --> 00:01:55.717
So first off we'll do omega knot.

00:01:55.717 --> 00:02:00.373
Omega knot equals one over
the square root of LC,

00:02:00.373 --> 00:02:01.540
so that equals

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:07.373
square root of one over one
henry times one quarter farad,

00:02:11.788 --> 00:02:14.538
which equals square root of four,

00:02:17.372 --> 00:02:18.984
or equals two,

00:02:18.984 --> 00:02:22.484
and that's in units of radians per second.

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:28.500
That's the natural frequency.

00:02:29.477 --> 00:02:31.697
We know the natural frequency right here,

00:02:31.697 --> 00:02:33.388
and now we can work out the rest of it.

00:02:33.388 --> 00:02:37.471
So we can just fill in i
equals square root of C,

00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:41.817
which is one quarter farad,

00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:44.758
divided by one henry,

00:02:46.487 --> 00:02:47.540
times V knot.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.457
V knot was was 10 volts

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.751
times sine omega knot t.

00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:55.918
Sine, omega knot is two t.

00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:01.108
And finally, i equals,

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:08.766
this is the square root of
one quarter or one half,

00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:09.881
so that's one half,

00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:13.298
times 10 is five, i equals five sine 2 t.

00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:25.318
So for this specific circuit,

00:03:25.318 --> 00:03:27.690
that's the answer for this current here.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.857
Now I wanna show you what
that actually looks like.

00:03:36.835 --> 00:03:41.002
So this is a plot of i of
t equals five sine two t.

00:03:47.678 --> 00:03:50.202
And this is what a sine
wave looks like with time,

00:03:50.202 --> 00:03:52.941
so the axes are time in seconds,

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:55.495
and this axis goes up to five amperes

00:03:55.495 --> 00:03:58.793
and then down to minus five amperes

00:03:58.793 --> 00:04:02.960
and continues on that way, and
it basically goes on forever.

00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:05.755
Now what I wanna do next is work out

00:04:05.755 --> 00:04:07.392
the voltage in the circuit.

00:04:07.392 --> 00:04:09.736
We didn't talk about the voltage yet.

00:04:09.736 --> 00:04:12.903
So I'll sketch the circuit again here.

00:04:17.576 --> 00:04:18.733
Here's L and C.

00:04:18.733 --> 00:04:20.290
And this is the voltage right here,

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.935
voltage across both guys.

00:04:22.935 --> 00:04:25.185
We've already worked out i.

00:04:26.502 --> 00:04:27.828
And now we wanna find v.

00:04:27.828 --> 00:04:29.411
What's v?

00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:31.463
That's what we're looking for.

00:04:31.463 --> 00:04:34.963
So, we know that i equals five sine two t,

00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:43.954
and to find v, one of
the easy ways to find v

00:04:43.954 --> 00:04:47.244
is to use the inductor equation.

00:04:47.244 --> 00:04:50.661
We know that v equals L di/dt.

00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:55.838
That's just the basic
inductor i v equation, right?

00:04:56.987 --> 00:04:59.798
And let's see what happens here.

00:04:59.798 --> 00:05:03.298
v equals L is one, times di/dt.

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:08.579
So that's d/dt of 5 sine two t.

00:05:14.063 --> 00:05:15.835
Now let's take that derivative, okay?

00:05:15.835 --> 00:05:17.317
I'll go up here.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:20.817
v equals five comes out of the derivative.

00:05:24.044 --> 00:05:25.030
Sine two t.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.257
The derivative of sine of two t

00:05:28.257 --> 00:05:30.674
is two times cosine of two t.

00:05:37.372 --> 00:05:38.205
All right?

00:05:38.205 --> 00:05:42.288
So our voltage solution
is 10 times cosine two t.

00:05:52.288 --> 00:05:54.311
So something interesting
just happened here.

00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:55.513
Let me show you.

00:05:55.513 --> 00:05:58.548
We started with the current
being a sine function,

00:05:58.548 --> 00:06:01.268
and we eventually took the
derivative of that sine function

00:06:01.268 --> 00:06:03.202
and now we have a cosine function.

00:06:03.202 --> 00:06:06.785
So we went from sine
to cosine for voltage.

00:06:08.049 --> 00:06:09.311
That means the voltage doesn't look

00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:12.050
quite exactly like the current, okay?

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.217
Let me show you a plot of the voltage.

00:06:18.747 --> 00:06:19.715
Here's the voltage here.

00:06:19.715 --> 00:06:20.965
This is v of t.

00:06:21.905 --> 00:06:25.988
And that we decided was
equal to 10 cosine two t.

00:06:28.031 --> 00:06:31.107
Starts at a value of 10,
the time equals zero,

00:06:31.107 --> 00:06:33.601
and then forms a cosine
wave that goes up and down

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:36.268
between plus and minus 10 volts.

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:38.863
Now let me show you what it looks like

00:06:38.863 --> 00:06:41.763
when we plot both i and
v on the same graph,

00:06:41.763 --> 00:06:46.421
and we can see the timing
relationship between them.

00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:49.421
So this is a plot of i of t in blue,

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:54.095
and v of t in orange.

00:06:57.331 --> 00:06:59.992
One them is a sine wave,
the current is a sine wave,

00:06:59.992 --> 00:07:02.409
and voltage is a cosine wave.

00:07:04.987 --> 00:07:06.817
So this is what we were going for.

00:07:06.817 --> 00:07:09.588
This is the natural
response of an LC circuit,

00:07:09.588 --> 00:07:12.028
and we had two specific
component values in it.

00:07:12.028 --> 00:07:14.819
We saw that we came out with
both current and voltage

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:17.319
looking like sinusoidal waves.

00:07:18.724 --> 00:07:19.662
This LC circuit,

00:07:19.662 --> 00:07:22.189
this is where sine waves
come from in electronics.

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:23.242
It's pretty cool.
