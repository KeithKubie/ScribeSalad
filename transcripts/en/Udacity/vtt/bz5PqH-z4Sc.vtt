00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.710
Okay, so we know about the first
idea in the acronym specs,

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.080
which is simplify code.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.820
Let's talk about another one.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.830
P stands for practicing kindness.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.420
While preparing for this course,
I interviewed Jacque who,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.770
as you've seen previously,
is an engineer at Udacity.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.720
He said to me that it is
always important to remember

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.770
that the review is being provided
to a student who has invested

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.820
several hours of their
life into the project.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.620
That is a sentiment we always want
to remember while writing reviews.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.400
By the way, Stack Overflow
has some excellent guidelines

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.910
on how to provide constructive
feedback and be nice at the same time.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.440
The link to that web page is
in the instructor notes and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.500
I recommend that you bookmark it.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.730
Now when you start doing reviews,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.400
you will notice that the software will
allow you to highlight your feedback in

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.030
one of three categories,
Nitpicks, Awesome and Critical.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.030
We strongly encourage that you
find areas in the students' code

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.410
that are awesome.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.450
Students need to know how to improve,
but

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.400
they also need to know what
they're doing well currently.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.860
So don't be shy to identify things
that are awesome as awesome.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.980
In the next section, we will see
an example of a review highlighting

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.320
an awesome piece of code and
practicing kindness at the same time.
