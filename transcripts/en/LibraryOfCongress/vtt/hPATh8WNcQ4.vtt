00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:08.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.190
&gt;&gt; Patrick Anderson: Good
afternoon, I'm Patrick Anderson.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.200
I review fiction for
the Washington Post.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.970
And, I have the pleasure
this afternoon

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.630
of introducing our next
speaker Justin Cronin.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.110 position:56%
I'll try to be brief, because I
suspect most of you are already fans

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.300
of his "Passage" trilogy.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.440
But, here are a few basic facts.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.730
Justin was born near Boston.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.070
Attended Harvard in the
Iowa writers workshop.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.060
Then taught writing and literature

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.010
at La Salle University
in Philadelphia.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.050
And, then at Rice University
at Houston where he

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.540
and his family still live.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:53.850
In 2001 and 2004 Justin published
two fine novels "Marian O'Neal"

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.620
and the "Summer Guest"
that won admiring reviews.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.960
Won some prizes.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.440
And, then quietly expired the
way that most literary novels do.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.320
But, a few years later
Justin was talking

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.620
to his eight-year-old daughter.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.880
Who gave him the idea for writing
a very different sort of novel.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.870 position:56%
I hope he'll tell you the full story
because it's a wonderful story.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.480
But, I'll just say that
his daughter's idea lead

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.710
to his great trilogy of
"The Passage", "The Twelve"

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.210
and "The City of Mirrors".

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.900
It also led to what I will
discretely call seven figure sales

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.730
of both his trilogy
and movie rights.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:44.870
Someone said that this story has
caused countless American novelists

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.200
to follow their children around
saying, sweetheart have you thought

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.710
up a really good idea for me yet?

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.310
But, the truth is that the
vast majority of writers,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.980
if we were given the
best idea in the world.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.680
Would not bring it off with
the incredible imagination

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.250
and the literary skill that
Justin brought to his trilogy.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.310
His books may begin as science
fiction but the transcend genre

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.020
and are simply great
American novels.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.510
It's a great pleasure to
introduce Justin Cronin.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:32.310
[ Applause ]

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.230
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: This is a
very big room with many people.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.290
The first thing I want to say is

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.390
that my first two books
did not quietly expire.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.930
They are in print.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.240
They are available in stores.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.210
I get royalty checks, for
like $100 every six months.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.560
Yeah, the story of my daughter
is kind of an interesting one.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.640
And, it's usually a good
place to start because.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.550
Sorry, that was my
Marco Rubio moment.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.470
Because, I'm very lucky.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.830
I was working on another book and
it wasn't going particularly well.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.140
This is in 2005 and my
daughter did indeed come to me

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.990
and expressed the fear,
the deep concern.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.500
And, she was eight.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.720
That my books were boring.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.850
And, that's, those were her words.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.590
And, which she got, she had
not read them, she was eight.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.850
But, she had looked at the
covers and read the flaps

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.640
and they didn't seem
so promising to her.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.990
So, I said that's fine
what should I write about?

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.690 position:56%
And, she said I should write a story
about a girl who saves the world.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.880
Which, of course, I think she just
pulled it off the top of her head.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.940
I mean it was, it struck me
as a little ambitious too.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.980
Like maybe I should write
something about the girl

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.910
who saves Westchester or something.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.110
But, I said great I'll do
that but you have to help me.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.850
And, so we spent 90 days together.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.680
I would meet her after
school, dressed to run.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.980
I would bring her bike.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.230
And, we would spend an hour
every afternoon floating

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.400
around the streets of
our Houston neighborhood.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.790
Just kind of spinning out a story.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.090
And, we had two rules.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.230
First rule everything in
it had to be interesting.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.320
Not a bad standard.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.570
That was the first thing
I learned from her.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.440
I kind of never thought
of that actually,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.490
I was sort of a truth
in beauty guy, right?

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.790
Interesting.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.470
And, the other was it had to
have a character with red hair.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.370
Because, my daughter
is a ginger, alright.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.780
And, if you've read
the books you know

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.870
that there is indeed a
red headed character.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.730
We did this for 90 days I
had no intention, whatsoever,

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.180
of turning this into a book.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.010
I was lying to my kid.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.080
We were all just getting in really
good shape and having some fun.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.930
But, after 90 days past and the
bicycle went into the garage.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.410
I decided I would take some notes.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.730
I thought maybe, you know, we've
come up with a lot of stuff here.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.420
Why don't I write it
down maybe for later use?

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.740
Because the book as I said, I was
writing, was kind of on oxygen.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.040
And, I looked up a
couple of days later

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.600
and I had 30 single
spaced pages of notes.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.990
Like every detail of
a very long novel

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.100
and then quick summaries
of books two and three.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.870
It was just an avalanche of stuff.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.530
And, you know, I can't really
account for it accept to say

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.000
that my daughter and I we
just had good chemistry.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.340
And, at some level she
silenced my inner critic.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.990
And, I also was, as a teacher
of creative writing one

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.720
of my best parlor tricks was just
kind of taking random information

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.040
and shaping it into a story.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.290
It was just something I had learned
to do to impress my students.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.650
So, they would know I was in the
front of the room for a reason.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.560
And, so low and behold I
had all this information

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.770
but information is not a book.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.730
A book is a story.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.210
And, a story needs a voice.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.350
So, I decided I would sit down
and just write the first chapter

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.170
of this book to see
if it had a voice.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.510
If it had an entry point.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.080
If it had a way of being told.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.380
And, it did.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.680
I mean like right away.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:13.850
And, you know, ten years went by
and 900,000 words later it's done.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.010
So, I gave my daughter a decade
based on this dare proving,

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.310
I guess once and for all.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.350
That the, every interesting
thing a man really does he does

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.650
to impress a woman.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.600
By the way the little girl is gone,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.650
you know the bicycle became a
used somewhat battered mini cooper

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.990
in which she drove
off into her life.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.090
She's a sophomore in college and
she hasn't read the third book.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.420
Because she's all busy
adulting I guess.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.140
What I like to do with
events like this

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.230
and any event really, is I don't.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.530
I just freestyle.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.210
I have no canned spiel.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.820
What I like to do is read
a little bit of the book

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.120
because it's fun to read.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.420
And, nice to be read to.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.960
It's not a very long excerpt.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.880
But, I think it's an
excerpt that sort

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.910
of captures what the book
is like, at some level.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.370
And, then I turn it over to
the room for questions, right?

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.550
It's I guess I don't have anything
to tell you that want to tell you.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.940
I want to know what
you're interested in.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.180
So, that sometimes
creates an awkward moment

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.870
when I say are there any questions.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.780
And, nobody does anything because
they don't want to be the first.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.380 position:56%
So, I used to tell the first person.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.460
I used to say to the first person
would get a Christmas card from me.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.950
But, we don't do Christmas
card anymore.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.250
Because nobody does.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.340
We didn't get any last year so.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.550
So, what I can offer you
is my love and admiration.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.030
Alright, so think of a question.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.690
Alright, I'm going
to read a little bit.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.950
Another Marco Rubio moment.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.650
Each of the books as those
of you who have read them,

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.630
which I hope is some
of you or many of you.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.930
Or all of you that would be great.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:00.700
Spend some time in what
I call the here and now.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.630
It's not quite the present, you
know there's some changes made

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:04.930
to the world.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.230
But, I think of it
as the here and now.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.380
In the first book that's the
story of Wolgast and Amy the kind

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.320
of father daughter story
where the whole thing began.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.740
Because of course this was made
up by a father and a daughter.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.200
The second book uses,
it's the story of Danny,

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.780
and Kittridge and April in the bus.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.980
In this book, I had a
very specific require.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.000
Which was of course I
had to tell this story

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.300
of the Oz behind the curtain.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.970
Which is Fanning the first person.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.210
In fact, it, what I decided to do,

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.640
was to do the one thing
I actually hadn't done.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.180
And, I mean I felt like
I had used everything

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.960
in my toolbox writing
this trilogy but,

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.550
I hadn't let a character
truly speak for themselves.

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.440
So, what I decided
to do was I was going

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.000
to let Fanning tell his own story.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.460
Which, I confess I
enjoyed immensely.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:51.680
And, when people ask me what
character I feel closest

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.300
to who is maybe the most like me.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.730
I'm sorry to say that except

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.500
for the whole destroying the world
thing it would have to be this guy.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.840
So, I'm going to just
read a few pages of his,

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.560
sort of his opening remarks.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:16.360
"Behind every great
hatred is a love story.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.990
For I am a man who is
known and tasted love.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.970
I say a man because that
is how I know myself.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.330
Look at me and what do you see?

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.750
Do I not take the form of a man?

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.630
Do I not feel as you do?

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.210
Suffer as you do?

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.510
Love as you do?

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.930
Mourn as you do?

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.160
What is the essence of a
man if not these things?

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.060
In life, I was a scientist
called Fanning.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.050 position:56%

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.200
in bio-chemical sciences
Columbia University.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.870
I was known and respected.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.120
A figure of my times.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.330
My opinions were sought
on many subjects.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.230
I walked the hallways of my
profession with my head held high.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:06.250
I was a man of connections.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:11.350
I shook hands, kissed cheeks,
made friends, took lovers.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.620
Fortune and treasure
flowed my way I supped

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.880
and the flower of the modern world.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.140
City apartments, country
houses, sleek automobiles,

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.120
good wine all of these
were things I had.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.670
I dined in fine restaurants.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.300
I slept in upscale hotels.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.010
My passport was fat with Visa's.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:36.700
Thrice I wooed and thrice I wed
and although these unions came

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:41.570
to naught each was, in its final
measure, no matter of regret.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.880
I worked and rested.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.060
Danced and wept.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.490
Hoped and remembered.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:52.560
Even from time to time prayed.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.110
I lived in sum a life.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:01.800 position:56%
Then, in a jungle in Bolivia I died.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:07.220
You will know me as
Zero such is the name

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.780
that history has bestowed upon me.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.100
Zero the destroyer, great
devourer of the world.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.570
That this history shall never
be written is a circumstance

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.010
of antilogical debate.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:21.750
What become of the past when
there is no man to record it?

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.700 position:56%
I died and then was brought to life.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.750
The oldest tale there is.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.770
I arose from the dead
and what did I behold?

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.640 position:56%
I was in a room of the bluest light.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.720
Pure blue, cerulean blue,
the blue the sky would be

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.980
if it were married to the sea.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.380
My arms, my legs even
my head were bound.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.060
I was a captive in that place.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.690
Scattered images lit my mind
flashes of light and color

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.100 position:56%
that refused to gather into meaning.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.710
My body was humming.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.270
That is the only word.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.060
I was to learn that
I had just emerged

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.420
from the final stages
of my transformation.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:06.550
I had yet to see my body
of course being inside it.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.210
Tim, can you hear me?

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:14.230
It was a voice coming from
everywhere and nowhere.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.540
Was I dead?

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.670
Was this the voice
of God addressing me?

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.680
Perhaps the life I had
lived had not been so worthy

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.510
and things had gone the other way.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.880
Tim if you can hear me lift a hand.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:37.030
This is did not seem too much
for God for any God to ask.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.920
That's it now the other one.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:45.280
Excellent, well done Tim.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.710
You knew this voice
I said to myself.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.880
You are not dead it is the voice
of a human being, like you.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.310
A man who calls you by
name who says, well done.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:13:00.900
That's it Tim just breathe.

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.200
You're doing fine.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.830
The nature of my situation
was becoming more clear.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.020
I had been ill in some manner.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.400
Perhaps I had suffered seizures.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.570
That would explain the restraints.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:18.160
I could not yet recall the
circumstances how I had come

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.870
to be in this place.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.910
The voice I thought was the key.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:27.790
If I could identify its
owner all would be revealed.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.620
Tim I'm going to undo
the straps now.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.960
I felt a release of
pressure triggered

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.490
by some remote mechanism my
binding surrendered their hold.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.360
Can you sit up Tim?

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.990
Can you do that for me?

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:50.390
It was also true that whatever my
ailment was the worst had past.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.060
I did not feel ill.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.890
Quite the contrary.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.120
The humming sensation which
originated in my chest had enlarged

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.400
to one orchestral whole body
vibrato as if all the molecules

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.550
of my anatomy were
playing a single note.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:09.870
The sensation was deeply
almost sexually pleasurable.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.810
My loins, the tips of
my toes, even the roots

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:17.790
of my hair never had I
experienced anything so exquisite.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:22.650
I heard a second voice
deeper than the first.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.940
Dr. Fanning, I'm colonial Sikes.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:31.770 position:56%
Sikes, did I know a man named Sikes?

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.420
Can you us Dr. Fanning?

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.620
Do you know where you are?

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.370
A hole had opened inside me.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.860
Not a hole a maul I was hungry.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.830
Deeply, madly hungry.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.020
Mine was the appetite not of a
human being but of an animal.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.410
A hunger of claws and
teeth of burrowing

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:58.950 position:56%
in of soft flesh beneath the jaws,
hot juices exploding on the palette.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.670
Tim, you got us pretty
worried in here.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.520
Talk to us buddy.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.750
And, just like that the
gates of memory opened.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.520
Releasing a flood.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.790
The rainforest with its steamy air

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:15.510
and dense green canopy
full of hooting animals.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.620
The stickiness of my skin and the
swarm of insects around my face.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:24.100
The soldiers scanning the trees
with their rifles as we walked.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.130
Their faces streaked
with jungle paint.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:31.800
The statues manlike figures of
monster's form warning us away,

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.320
even as they called us
forward summing us deeper

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.200
into the heart of that vial place.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:44.010
The bats. They would come at
night swarming our encampment bats

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.310
by the hundreds.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:49.020
The thousands, the ten
thousands of flapping multitude.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.860
They blotted out the heavens.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.040
They took the sky by storm.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.640
The gates of hell had opened
and this was its disgorgement.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.950
It's black vomitus.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:02.970
They seemed not to fly but to
swim moving in organized waves

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:05.650
like a school of air born fish.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.440
They fell upon us all
wings and teeth

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.950
and vicious little squeaks of joy.

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.330
I remembered the shots the screams.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.350
I was in a place of blue light
and a voice that knew my name.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:20.300
But, in my mind I was
running for the river.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:24.790
I saw a woman riding on the
banks her name was Claudia.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.360
She was one of us.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.010
The bats had covered
her like a cloak.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:34.080
Imagine it, the horror almost
no part of her was visible.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.440
In truth, my first instinct
was to do nothing for her.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.400
I did not possess the
heart of a hero.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.360
Yet, sometimes we discover things
about ourselves we never knew.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.630
I took two great leaps and tackled
her sending the two of us plunging

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.350
into the feted jungle water.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:54.910
I felt the hot stab of the bats
teeth in the flesh of my arms

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:59.230
and neck, the water around
us boiled with blood.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.830
Such was their furry that even
the water did not detour them.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.650
The bats would feed upon
us even as they drowned.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.970
I locked Claudia's neck
in my elbow and dove down,

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.710
although I knew this
would come to nothing.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.640
The woman was already dead.

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:20.110
I remembered all of these
things and then one more.

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:23.560
I remembered a man's face.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.160
It hovered above me
framed by jungle sky.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.240
I was in incensing
burning with fever.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.180
The air around me throbbed with
the den of the helicopters blades.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.900
The man was yelling something.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.450
I tried to focus on his mouth.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:43.170
It was alive.

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:47.690
He was saying, my friend
Jonas Leer was saying.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.110
It was alive.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.720
It was alive.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.720
It was alive.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.100
I lifted my head and looked.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.240
My room was barren like a cell.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.970
On the wide wall, across from me
a dark window showed my reflection

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.460
and I saw what I'd become.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:13.830
I did not rise, I launched.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.340
I rocketed across the room and
hit the window with a thud.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.170
Behind the glass the two
men lurched backward.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.870
Jonas and a second one Sikes.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:25.380
Their eyes were wide with fear.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.860
I pounded I roared.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.220 position:56%
I opened my jaws to display my teeth

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.080
so they would know the
measure of my rage.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.880
I wanted to kill them.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.940
No, not kill.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:40.490
Kill is to dull a word
for that which I desired.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.500
I wanted to annihilate them.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.170
I wanted to tear them
limb from limb.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:51.100
I wanted to crack their bones and
bury my face in the wet remains.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.520
I wanted to reach inside their
chest and yank out their hearts

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.880
and devour the bloody meat

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.050
as the last stray current
twitch the muscle.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.450
And, I wanted to watch
their faces as they died.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.930
They were yelling screaming.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:07.000
I was not what they
had bargained for.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.040
The glass was bowing
shuttering under my blows.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.800
A blast of white hot
brightness engulfed the room.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.400
I felt as if I had been
shot by 100 arrows.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.280
I stumbled backward, fell
curling to the floor.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:28.230
A clattering of gears above and
with a band the bars fell sealing

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.910
me away.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:34.390
Tim I'm sorry this was
never my intention.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.690
Forgive me.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:38.800
Forgive me.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.330
Perhaps Jonas was sorry.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.290
It made no difference.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:47.850
Even then huddled on
the floor I knew

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:52.610
that their advantage was
temporary it held no weight.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.980
The walls of my prison
could not help

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.960
but eventually yield to my power.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:03.640
I was the dark flower of mankind
ordained since time's beginning

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.790
to destroy a world that
had no God to love it."

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.590
There you go.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:21.040
[ Applause ]

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.970
What may surprise you is that
I'm a thoroughly nice person.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:27.400
Like extremely well
balanced I love my children.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.400
I take my son to tennis
lessons, you know.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.890
Just like you.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.650
Alright so, are we are
the question moment?

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.950
Are we at the question moment?

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.250
Okay, how are we going
to organize this?

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.650
People come up to the microphone?

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:42.810
Yes? Is that how that works?

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.470
Okay, we have a microphone here
and we have a microphone here?

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:46.770
And, are you a questioner?

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.070
&gt;&gt; I am.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.370
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Go for it.

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.180
&gt;&gt; I'm a Houstonian as well so.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.480
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Good for you.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.780
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.080
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: I
prefer the term Hou-stoner.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.660
I've been trying to get that
to catch on and it's really,

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.990
doesn't have a lot of traction.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:03.310
So, if y'all can help me with
that I'd be very, very grateful.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.610
&gt;&gt; I've got a young son.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.670 position:56%
So, he'll be all into that I'm sure.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:07.970
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Yeah.

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:11.880
&gt;&gt; I'm not real familiar with
your work, but I really definitely

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.810
after hearing your
story want to read it.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:20.010
But, I just have to say that your
ASL interpreter I watched him

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:21.370
throughout you reading that.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:22.880
And, he was absolutely great.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.180
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Yeah, fantastic.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.980
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:30.700
[ Applause ]

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.380
&gt;&gt; You need to travel with him.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.920
Or, he needs to travel with you.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.660
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Right on.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.960
Sir?

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.260
&gt;&gt; So, officially I'm
the first question.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.560
So, I guess love and admiration?

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.500
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Love and
admiration upon you my friend.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.800
&gt;&gt; So,

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.100
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: See me after.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.900
Then it all got weird.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.500
&gt;&gt; So, maybe, two questions.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.740
First, in the first book, I loved,

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:55.550
I thought it was very innovative
the story you told the part

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:58.340
in Bolivia via the emails.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:02.670
And, I was wondering, you
know, what made you do that?

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.110
It was, I thought it was
a great way to do it.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.410
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Yeah.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:12.120
I mean. I loved other, I wanted to
bring other forms of presentation

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:16.310
into the book because I
thought it would be interesting.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.910
But, it was also a lot of fun.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:20.550
And, the emails essentially
are an epistolary it's a one

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:21.850
sided epistolary.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.850
And, I've always like
that form of the novel.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.900
A novel made out of letters.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.990
And, I wanted a lot
of different things.

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.820
I have journals, I
have maps at the end

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:36.420
of the trilogy I have
a lot of illustrations.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:41.470
And, I have the proceedings of an
academic conference, in the future.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.890
And, what that, I mean the message
there of course is that I'm sorry

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:46.380
to report a 1,000 years
into the future,

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:50.010
academic conferences
will still be going on.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.310
[ Laughter ]

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.620
Everybody hanging around
the hotel bar.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.230
You know, talking about
who got tenure right?

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.710
But, that's part of like
the appetizing surface

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.010
that I wanted to create.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.000
You know, a book that kind of just
drew in lots of different elements.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.930
Because it was, it's 900,000 words.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.760
That's the length of about
nine conventional novels.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.190
And, so I was asking my readers,
this was not a one night stand.

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:12.070
I mean this was going steady.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:14.860
And so, you know, the
book had to kind

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.970
of constantly refresh
itself in some manner.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:19.660
So, that's why I chose
those other devices.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:20.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I thought it was great.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.260
I remember telling my wife.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.250
It's fantastic and she
doesn't read as much,

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.610
she's like yeah great shut up.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:28.210
I bragged about it.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:31.850
The second thing is in that
sequence you kind of hint that,

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:34.090
that this species has
been there before.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:35.390
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Right.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:36.690
&gt;&gt; On, you.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.750
Is there any commentary you
can give on that backstory?

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.050
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Nope.

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.610
[ Laughter ]

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:43.480
What I will say is this.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:48.550
Okay, I didn't want these books to
answer absolutely every question.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:50.540
I think that's bossy.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.510
I think a book needs to
breathe a little bit.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.550
In that it can have
mysteries that go unsolved.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:58.920
That are places for
the reader, right?

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.660
To construct their
own part of the story.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:09.080
And, that said, not
everything can fit into a story.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.290
Even one as long as 900,000 words.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:15.550
There are things that don't
quite fit in terms of the logic

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.390
of how the story is being told.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.830
And, I hear a lot from readers
about certain parts of the story.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.620
That they would like to know.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.580
And, that are not in the book.

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.150
And, so at some point and I can't
say exactly when it's a couple

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:30.450
of books down the road probably.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.710
Because, I want to get out of
Passage world for a little while.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.300
Just to refresh.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:40.760
But, I'm going to write probably
two books that have to do with some

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.410
of the these adjacent stories.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.880
The best example I can give you,
for those of you who know this.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.330
Is the story of the colonel, right?

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:52.420
Who, is remains and entirely
mythological figure throughout

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.720
the trilogy.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.210
And, since the great
project of the trilogy is

00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:01.650
to show you the reality behind the
legends, myths, even religions.

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:03.800
The colonel's story
needs to be told.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.340
I just never had a way of doing it.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.390
It just never fit, right?

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.700
So, I think that answers
your question.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.000
&gt;&gt; Okay so, do I have something to
look forward to in about ten years?

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.300
That you're going to

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.600
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Ten years!

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.900
&gt;&gt; Or whatever.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.200
I.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.500
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: In ten
years, I'll be 64 years old.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.800
I can't predict what
will be going on then.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.100
Probably a lot of napping.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.050
[ Laughter ]

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I was just throwing out a number.

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.300
But, is there is a chance you would
tell that backstory because I.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.600
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: A chance.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.900
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: I have to move on.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.500
Young lady on the right.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.800
My right your left.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:40.300
&gt;&gt; Hi, so the two characters
of Carter and Fanning.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:45.080
At first seem to be almost
juxtaposed the stereotypical good

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.380
and evil.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.680
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: They're
kind of in those slots.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.980
&gt;&gt; Right, right.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.490
Initially, and then as you tell
the story of Fanning and you sort

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:53.950
of get into his background.

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.870
It almost seems to
set up his resolution.

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.070
I don't want to give
anything away to people who

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.940
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Yeah,
yeah we have got

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.540
to be careful with
the spoiler thing.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.840
Right.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.830
&gt;&gt; But, it seems that at the end
both characters you have a type

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.130
of forgiveness.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:08.430
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Yeah.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:09.730
&gt;&gt; And, I was just
wondering if for you

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:12.320
when you're writing the
concept of forgiveness.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.650
Of intentions of actions
and you know,

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:19.070
understanding a person is
important to you as a writer.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.770
Who, you fundamentally
get to play God

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.580
and you were a very gracious one.

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:24.880
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Yeah.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.180
&gt;&gt; So, I was just wondering

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.480
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: I
hope God is gracious.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.510
You know, whoever she is.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:33.260
[ Laughter ]

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.380
I reached the point in
my life where I want

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.800
to send everybody to
heaven in the end.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:42.530
You know, and the purpose
of the Fanning narrative.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.470
I'll sort of put this in
the context of the book.

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:48.220
The purpose of the Fanning
narrative is to remind people.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.650
Well, now that sounds very, that
sounds bossy and petti logical, no.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:55.340
I wanted you to forget what
happened at the end of his life.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.870
I wanted you to hear a story
of a person living his life.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:02.870
Because, you know what, he was born
and innocent soul just like you.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:04.840
Just like everybody in the room.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.300
And, you know, I'm not a believer

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.500
in that some people
are fated to be evil.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.370
I think everything just comes
from human circumstances.

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:15.460
And, Fanning's circumstance,
let me put it this way.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.410
Only a broken heart could
end the world, you know?

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:20.980
And, that's the story
I wanted to tell.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:25.040
And, I believe that it's
important that when you write.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.010
If people are going to
care about the outcome.

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:30.130
If it's going to feel like, it
has to feel like the real world.

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:34.640
And, in the real world
nobody is just one thing.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.630 position:56%
If I had, you know if I got to, if
I was going to define a personality.

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:41.540
I would say it's a collection
mirror contradictions.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.890
Alright, whatever they are.

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:45.740
And, so I think it's really
important to shed some sunlight

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.890
on the villain whoever
plays that role in a story.

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:51.380
And, throw some dirt onto the hero.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.600
Otherwise, they just
don't seem real.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.200
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: All right.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.740
And, so the whole thing
is of no importance.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.860
Right? It's just puppets.

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:06.340
Right, and I didn't want
to write a puppet show.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.640
&gt;&gt; Well, you did a wonderful job.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.940
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Thank you.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.240
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.540
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Sir.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:15.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I actually just finished
reading "The City of Mirrors".

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:18.800
I had been waiting for
like years for that book.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.100
And.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.400
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Me too.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.290
&gt;&gt; And, I just want to commend you

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:28.500
on like what an amazing
accomplishment those three books

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.800
are together.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.980
And I cannot imagine the
amount of planning and work

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.340
that actually went into them.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.370
I'm a writer and editor myself.

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:39.460
And, so when I read books
I really take a lot of time

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.790
to analyze how they're written and.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Look at the wires.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:44.390
I do the same thing.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:45.760
I can't read a book without
seeing the wires, you know?

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And, it's fantastic
when you're reading something

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.600
as well written as
"The City of Mirrors"

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.500
and this last one and the question.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.730
You know, the primary question that
I had and I had so many questions.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:00.840
But, one of the biggest
questions that I have in terms

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.780
of the writing of the book.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:08.960
Once I had finished it was you have
three humongous set pieces and in

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.400
that sort of conclude the entire

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.700
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Right.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.000
&gt;&gt; Trilogy.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.300
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: You mean
like action set pieces.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:16.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.900
Kerrville, the ship and.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.200
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Shh.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.500
Shh. Shh. We all know.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.800
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.680
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: So,
large action set pieces.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.980
Yeah.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.280
&gt;&gt; Humungous.

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.580
They rival anything
in like "The Lord

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:31.030
of the Rings" trilogy
and I just wanted to.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:33.330
I wonder if you could
talk about the level.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.610
I just imagine you
like creating maps.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:36.910
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Yeah.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:38.960
&gt;&gt; And like diagrams and all sorts
of things and just keeping track

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.270
of all of the characters.

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:44.480
What there happening when these
like set pieces are going down.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.780
What, how did you do that?

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.900
And, how long did it take and.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.200
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: It
took a long time.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.070
That's the part of
the writing process

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.440
that I definitely like the least.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.740
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.040
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Which
is the part that feels

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.590
like a question on the LSAT.

00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:59.890
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.570
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: You know, it's
like you've got three canoes

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.900
and Barney will go with
Wilma on a Tuesday and.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.200
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.710
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: These
massive logical problems, right?

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.800
And, keeping track of all
this information, you know,

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.820
you can have maps and
graphs and so on.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:17.040
And, I do that sometimes but
for the most part you kind

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.600
of have to hold it in your head.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.880
Because, as somebody
just pointed out.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.370
You are the story's local God.

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:28.180 position:56%
And, as a consequence it's not just
information that you need to manage.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.710
Which is time, space and action.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:31.420
The old Aristotelian stuff.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:34.480
You also have to manage the
rhetoric with which this unfolds.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.910
And, that's actually the
hardest thing to do is

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:41.120
to manage this information
with language, right.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.160
In the second book the
section that field which is one

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.600
of the opening sections a group

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:50.000
of families are massacred
essentially on a picnic outing.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.920 position:56%
Right, and it's a lot of characters.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.630
Right, eleven families and
then some other individuals.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:00.290 position:56%
And, the one thing I do for action
sequences to which, basically I had.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:02.430
This is the thing I
had to learn to do.

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:05.530
Like the other sort of, you know,
personal relationships I had done

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:08.910
that in two books so I felt
pretty confident doing that.

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:12.100 position:56%
But, writing large action set pieces
was something I had never done

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:17.410
and I didn't see that many story
analogs for it in other books.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:21.340
Like I had invariably been
kind of disappointed by them.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.760
Right, and so I had to learn how

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.530
to manage this stuff
and what I did was.

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:30.670
I actually looked at movies as
a way, they do a better job,

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:32.730
in some ways of managing
that information.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:36.160
Because, what they do is they use
a kind of omniscience to do it.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.450
This is total writer nerd
stuff I apologize, okay right,

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:43.360
but what I'll say is I had
to learn how to do this.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:48.860 position:56%
When I wrote the field, I did indeed
draw a big picture and I quickly,

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.660
so I knew where everybody
was at the big moment.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.540
And, what the distances were,

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.740
how the shadows would
fall and all of that.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.700
So, that when I actually
rendered it on the page.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.670
It made intrinsic sense.

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:04.320
It would take somebody this
many seconds to run here.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.620
This is happening here.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.580
This is happening here
five seconds later.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.550
I mean I really wanted it to work.

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:13.030
And, as a consequence it
was completely observant

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.410
of the reality of that moment.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.460
Even though not all of it came up.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.760
Right, so many characters
were kind of unaccounted for,

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.590
their specific experience
was not in the story.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:25.670
But, I needed to know what
it was in order for the part

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.220
that I did include to make sense.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:32.800
Because like I said for better or
worse I was the story's local God.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.100
&gt;&gt; Right. Yeah.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.430
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: I got to move on.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:36.730
&gt;&gt; Sure. Yeah.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:38.030
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: I got just
I think we have ten left.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:39.510
So, I want to make sure
I get to some more folks.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:40.810
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:42.310 position:56%
I haven't read "The City of Mirrors"
yet it's in my pile I swear.

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:45.450
I just wanted to ask have
you embellished a little bit

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.770
on the story of how the,
story of "The Passage" came

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.070
into being with your daughter.

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:53.190
Because, one of the things that
struck me about "The Passage" was

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:58.050
that some of it is so horrifying
and creepy and you know.

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:01.280
Oogy. And, how do you, how does
that come out of an eight-year-old?

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.270
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Just don't
call the social workers on me.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:05.020
Is what I say.

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.500
No, here's the thing.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.680
Some of the material
did, I did indeed sort

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.380
of ratchet up the adult quality.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:12.990
You know, people say
like is this a YA novel

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.830
and I say I don't know a hooker
shots a John on page nineteen.

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.200
Right? So, there are some
things that are pretty grown

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.500
up that did kind of
come out in the wash.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.030
That said, when you come up
with a story and just write

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:26.330
down a lot of information.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:27.630
I mean, that's what I
did with my daughter.

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:28.930
I mean we just said this will
happen, this will happen,

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:30.600
this is logical, this
makes sense and so on.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:34.150 position:56%
And, none of that is actually scary.

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.320
Right, information is not scary.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.620
Story is.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.920
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.220
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: But
information is not.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.730
And so, a lot people say your books
were very frightening did you ever

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.030
get scared writing them?

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:46.760
And the answer was no because
there were no surprises.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.520
Right? I was making it up.

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.420
If I, I could do whatever
I wanted with it.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.160
So, I didn't have that
sense of suspense.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.070
I was managing it on
behalf of the reader.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:01.060 position:56%
Right, now as for some of the
really dark content I'll just say my

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.860
daughter is a dark soul.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.440
[ Laughter ]

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.990
But, she's an old soul.

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:09.290
That's what you should say.

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:13.220
My son is a completely new soul
brand spanking new he doesn't,

00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.520
complete innocent.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.820
And, my daughter was just born kind

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.510
of like she'd already watched
every episode of Law and Order SVU.

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:22.480
[ Laughter ]

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.780
Yeah?

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.280
&gt;&gt; Hi, can you hear me.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.580
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: I can, yeah.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:30.000
&gt;&gt; First of all, thank you so
very much for all of your work.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.300
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Oh,
you are very welcome.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.600
Thank you.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.900
&gt;&gt; So, more of a light-hearted
question.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.130
So, your books have been
optioned for a movie.

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:38.430
Yay!

00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:39.730
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Not, optioned.

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:41.030
They were purchased.

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:42.330
&gt;&gt; Purchased?

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:43.630
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Yeah, but
this was a long time ago.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:44.930
This was in like 2007.

00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:46.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:47.530
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: When
Fox bought it.

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:48.830
So, people ask about this a lot.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:50.130
So, your question is what the hell
is going on with the movies right?

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:51.430
&gt;&gt; No, no.

00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:52.730
I'm going to just put it out there.

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:55.030 position:56%
Whatever's going on with it will you
have some creative control and so

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.850
that they don't mess it up?

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:59.590
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: That's
a good question.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:00.890
The first thing I'll say is.

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:04.260
You know, I always knew
that turning these books

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.720
into movies was sort
of not possible.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:11.510
Because of theirs when they
take a book and they turn it

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.160 position:56%
into a movie the first thing they do

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.890
of course is they start
throwing characters

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:16.190
over the side of the boat.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.080 position:56%
Right? But, I hadn't written a story

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.620
that where you could
actually do that.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.780
In the sense that there aren't that
many minor characters in the story

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.920
and I structured the plot with
this sort of Dickensian model

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.840
where everything is kind
of connected at all times.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.910
And, if you pulled out Sara
the story would collapse.

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:36.070 position:56%
Right? You can't just thin the herd.

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:40.120
So, I knew this was sort of
a fool's errand for them.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.510
Never the less I cashed the check.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:46.200
[ Laughter ]

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.500
&gt;&gt; There you go.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.800
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Little
birdies in the nest.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.100
You know, I had to send
my kids to college.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.770
So, now but what I was
secretly hoping and I began

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:53.480
to hope more and more across.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.670
The and by the way if they made it
into a movie I would have no say.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:58.680
Right, the writers in
Hollywood you get zero.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.840 position:56%
Okay, like they pretend that you do.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.180
But, you really don't.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.980
Okay, for a number of reasons
that have to do with who's bigger.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.500
I mean it's playground
stuff basically.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.810 position:56%
But, the writer really has no clout.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:12.870
I would have been allowed to
go to one red carpet premier.

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.540
That was actually in the contract.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.110
Okay. Also, they were
not allowed to kill

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:20.460
or maim any character
I did not kill or maim.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.760
Okay.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.070
&gt;&gt; I want to.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:25.020
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: No
maiming okay fine.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.880
Now, what I was kind of hoping
along the length of this was that,

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:32.670
you know, there is a new
story telling that's going on.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:38.170
That's excellent as the movies have
become this sort of orgies of CGI

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.300
that to be honest bore
you senseless.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.640
Television has gotten great.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.970
Right? Television has gotten great.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:48.630
Television is sort of
teaching us to participate

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:50.160
in long distance narrative.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.180 position:56%
Especially, to read long novels that
are doled out to us in chapters.

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:57.110
In the same way that Dicken's
novels were all serialized, right?

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.410
So, everybody's sitting
there waiting

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:00.700
for the next chapter
little door or whatever.

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:04.560
So, as a consequence of that I
was looking more and more at.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.310
I was hoping more and
more for television.

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:10.440
It is extremely difficult to
move a project at a studio

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.530
from movies to television.

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.860
They are kind of different worlds.

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.860
Never the less it looks
like we may have done it.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.460
Okay? It looks like
we may have done it.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.760
But, keep your fingers crossed.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.170
And, I'm kind of waiting right now
to hear like if the ink is going

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:26.720
to dry and what the
ink is going to say.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.970
In terms of my involvement it would
be more in television certainly

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:31.270
than it would be in the movies.

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:32.570
Because, movies would be zero.

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:37.480
But, I'm the expert at the story.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.070
I can, you know I know a lot

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:43.480
and television has been
taken over by writers.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.780
Right.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:46.080
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.380
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: It's
been taken over by writers.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:48.680
I know all these great
writers who are either dabbling

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.470
or going just throwing themselves
into the pool of television.

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:54.620
And, that means that
writers are respected.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:58.900
And, so the fact that I know what
I know would be useful to them.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:02.330
So, I imagine I would have
more involvement, right.

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:05.050
That said I have no
specific ambitions personally

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:06.350
to work in Hollywood.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:07.650
I'm a novelist.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:08.950
I love the job.

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:11.680
I can wear my bathrobe, right.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.410
I just stumble up to my office
every morning with a cup

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:16.710
of coffee and just go to work.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:18.440 position:56%
It's works perfect suits me ideally.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.080
&gt;&gt; So, just a follow
up on that then.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:24.450
Do you have any plans what so
ever to maybe have a cameo?

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:25.750
In them?

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:27.050
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Oh, God no.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:30.560
&gt;&gt; No? Your personality?

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.860
Come on? Okay.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.160
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Shh.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.460
I'm really shy.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:35.760
Can't you tell?

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.200
I'm super shy I get really nervous
in front of groups of people too.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.070
It's really, what could
be more obvious?

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:42.780
I have to move on because we have
just a couple minutes left alright?

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.080
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.380
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Yeah?

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.430
&gt;&gt; So, I love taking the journey
throughout all of three books

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:50.570
and more so just the
story and the characters.

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:52.760
I love going all the
different places.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.360
From California, to
Iowa, to New York

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.170
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: I was really into
the whole North American continent.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:59.580
Yeah. Yeah.

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:00.880
&gt;&gt; So, I just wanted to get a sense

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.270
of like did you choose particular
locations for a certain reason?

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:05.570
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Uh, huh.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:06.870
&gt;&gt; Was there, have you
been to those places?

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:08.170
&gt;&gt; Justin Cronin: Yeah.

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:12.780
I was really, really devoted to an
actual geography in these books.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:15.760 position:56%
Some of that was simply because when
you use something, when you have,

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.520
when you put some rules
around something.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.910
A lot of the work's
been done for you.

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:21.690
Right? Because, you can't
violate those realities.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.470
I really only made up one place

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:25.800
in the entire books and
that's the homeland.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.900
Which is actually a combination of
two cities I couldn't get one city

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.950
to work, exactly the
way that I wanted it to.

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:32.250
So, I had to fudge.

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:34.630
Which bothered me a lot.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:40.100
Otherwise, I know and have
traveled every mile in the books.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:44.210
For instance, to write the first
book I traveled from Idyllwild,

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:46.980
California which is the
basis for first colony.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:50.660
I taught there in the summer
of 1990 at an arts academy.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:51.960
Right, again a place I know.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.840
I traveled to Telluride,
the way they did it.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.420
I did it the same time
of year, right?

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.520
Because, I wanted to know
what the weather was like.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.080 position:56%
And, how it felt when you come down
of the La Selle mountains and you go

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.690
into that broad grassland
like does that feel like?

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:08.220
Right? Memphis for the big scene.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.410
Here the story because there's
the big scene at the zoo for those

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:11.710
of you who know the passage.

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.010
So, here's the story.

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:17.830
I moved to Memphis in 1990 to go
teach at Memphis State which has

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:20.490
since renamed it very tonally
as the University of Memphis.

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:23.120
And, we moved in and we
lived right near the park

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.420
in which the zoo was located.

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:27.360
And, the first night we were
there the hollower monkey's

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.610
in their cages went bananas.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:33.280
Okay, which it turns out, they
did pretty much every evening

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.780
for the eighteen months
that we lived there.

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:38.040
You know, right at sunset whatever
button goes off in the brain

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.900
of a hollower monkey boom, right?

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:43.130
But, the first night it
happened my wife who was

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:44.430
at that time not my wife.

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:45.730
But, we were on the way.

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:47.030
She was like oh my god what's that?

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:48.330
Do you hear the monkey's?

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:50.490
And, I looked at her and
I said what monkey's?

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.390
Right? And, so for the entire
eighteen months I refused

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.690
to hear the monkey's.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:00.790
But, yeah, every place is something
real something I felt locked into.

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:02.550 position:56%
I went and I looked at it, you know.

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:05.220
I mean I really wanted to
do that all Texas stuff is

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:06.800
like right down to the mile marker.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.380
Right, right down to
the mile marker.

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.900
Yeah, I just really, I felt like
I wanted to capture something real

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:15.340
in the North American continent.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.940
Because, the novels
about the destruction

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:18.360
of the North American continent.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.470
So, I want to use the real one.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:24.450
I think that's it.

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:25.750
Right? Right?

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:29.510
Terrific. Thank you all.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:33.100
[ Applause ]

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:36.280
A few quick things.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.100
I'm going to hang around
and sign books.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.200 position:56%
I'm a real chatty Cathy in the line.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.450
So, if you have other questions
I will gladly answer them.

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:44.970
And, I believe Lauren
Graff is right?

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:48.870
Hang around for Lauren Graff
who is an amazing writer,

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:50.900
great person and I met her today.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.410
Surprisingly tall.

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:56.040
Who knew. Thanks so much.
