00:00:00.578 --> 00:00:01.258
Hey it's me Destin

00:00:01.258 --> 00:00:02.606
Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.606 --> 00:00:04.038
So in the last video we talked about what it

00:00:04.038 --> 00:00:06.058
was like to get a tattoo in slow motion.

00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:07.438
But this time we're gonna talk about the

00:00:07.438 --> 00:00:10.696
removal process. It's way more complicated.

00:00:10.696 --> 00:00:13.050
It involves physics like thermodynamics,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.562
optics, even biology and chemistry are involved.

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:17.350
So today on Smarter Every Day we're gonna go

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.294
get some ink and then go to a plastic surgeon

00:00:19.294 --> 00:00:22.117
and see if we can get it removed. Check it out.

00:00:22.117 --> 00:00:23.123
(Destin) Can I steal some ink?

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.539
- Yeah.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.469
- [laughs] Thanks. Yes.

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:28.399
So before we talk about how to get the ink

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.596
out of the body let's talk about what exactly

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:32.351
you're putting into it.

00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:34.550
Most people don't realize this but the bright

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.248
colors in tattoo inks are actually created from

00:00:37.248 --> 00:00:39.756
compounds that mostly use heavy metals.

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:41.418
I know, that's kind of crazy right?

00:00:41.418 --> 00:00:43.929
I mean, you go to all these great lengths at a

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:45.813
tattoo parlor to have a sterile field so no

00:00:45.813 --> 00:00:47.845
pathogens transfer, but if you think about it,

00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:50.358
they're essentially making a very clean way

00:00:50.358 --> 00:00:53.899
for you to inject heavy metals into your body.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.908
It's kind of crazy if you think about it.

00:00:55.908 --> 00:00:58.009
Anyway, let's go talk to a smart guy.

00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:00.239
OK, so we we want to know how to remove

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.819
a tattoo with a laser so we're here with Dr Lappert,

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:04.353
plastic surgeon.

00:01:04.353 --> 00:01:05.010
- Pleasure.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.798
- Yes, so I have some questions.

00:01:06.798 --> 00:01:08.899
You've got some big machines beside you here,

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:09.524
- Sure.

00:01:09.524 --> 00:01:10.714
- I'm assuming these are lasers?

00:01:10.714 --> 00:01:11.312
- Yes they are.

00:01:11.312 --> 00:01:14.136
This one over here is an ultra short pulse laser

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:16.143
that we use for the tattoo removal.

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:17.425
- We're talking nanosecond level?

00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:19.089
- No. Even shorter than that.

00:01:19.089 --> 00:01:19.684
- Really.

00:01:19.684 --> 00:01:20.938
- Picosecond level.

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:21.535
- Really.

00:01:21.535 --> 00:01:24.704
- So a decimal point, eleven zeroes, and then put a digit

00:01:24.704 --> 00:01:27.285
in there somewhere and you've got picosecond time scale.

00:01:27.285 --> 00:01:29.631
So this is.. this one here is an alexandrite laser,

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:33.465
and alexandrite lasers are sort of tuneable within a

00:01:33.465 --> 00:01:35.568
certain narrow frequency range but we're gonna

00:01:35.568 --> 00:01:38.510
be operating at about 755 nanometers with this thing.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.869
- Oh wow. So that's just in the infrared right?

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:41.588
- Right.

00:01:41.588 --> 00:01:43.273
- Alright before we start zapping stuff I want to

00:01:43.273 --> 00:01:45.343
know exactly what it is we're going to zap.

00:01:45.343 --> 00:01:47.888
I've got a little drop of tattoo ink here and

00:01:47.888 --> 00:01:49.765
I'm gonna put it on this slide and place

00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:51.594
it under my microscope in hopes that we can

00:01:51.594 --> 00:01:53.159
see those metals.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.857
When we zoom in you can see these little bitty

00:01:54.857 --> 00:01:56.424
ink particles moving around, and then there's

00:01:56.424 --> 00:01:58.227
these much bigger chunks.

00:01:58.227 --> 00:01:59.929
Take just a second before we go further

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.934
and remember what that slow motion tattooing

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:04.151
I recorded in the last episode looked like.

00:02:04.151 --> 00:02:06.576
[music]

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.969
Alright, now that we know what the ink looks

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.938
like mechanically, we can draw a better picture

00:02:33.938 --> 00:02:35.226
of what's happening.

00:02:35.226 --> 00:02:37.450
Multiple needles are puncturing your skin

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.748
and dragging both big and little ink particles

00:02:39.748 --> 00:02:42.850
down through the epidermis into the dermis.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.854
- From the moment the tattoo is placed however

00:02:44.854 --> 00:02:46.733
your body's trying to get rid of it.

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:49.283
Your body recognizes that it's foreign material

00:02:49.283 --> 00:02:51.069
as if you got a sliver under your skin.

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.137
So your immune system is coming over

00:02:53.137 --> 00:02:54.587
looking at this stuff going "hey this

00:02:54.587 --> 00:02:55.847
doesn't belong here".

00:02:55.847 --> 00:02:58.823
White blood cells come in to remove the pigment.

00:02:58.823 --> 00:03:03.049
Now the white blood cell is a very small little cell

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.285
whereas the pigment granule is a relatively large

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:07.723
structure if you looked at it under the microscope.

00:03:07.723 --> 00:03:09.357
That white blood cell actually comes over and

00:03:09.357 --> 00:03:12.027
tries to engulf the pigment granule, and because

00:03:12.027 --> 00:03:14.286
the white cell is so small and the pigment granule is

00:03:14.286 --> 00:03:17.989
so big, that munching away is a very difficult thing.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.723
It's like trying to take a bite out of an elephant.

00:03:21.723 --> 00:03:24.518
- Alright, so this is about to get weird but I have to do this.

00:03:24.518 --> 00:03:27.398
I want to know how big my blood cells are relative

00:03:27.398 --> 00:03:28.747
to the ink particles.

00:03:28.747 --> 00:03:31.314
So obviously we have to prick my finger and get some

00:03:31.314 --> 00:03:33.106
blood and put it in there with the ink.

00:03:33.106 --> 00:03:34.831
Alright here we go and we put the microscope

00:03:34.831 --> 00:03:38.503
slide in and it is more awesome than I

00:03:38.503 --> 00:03:39.603
thought it would be.

00:03:39.603 --> 00:03:40.639
It is, look at it.

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.157
So we've got blood cells interacting with ink

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.381
so we can see the relative scale of the two right?

00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:48.889
So we've got these little bitty ink particles

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.924
that are smaller than the blood cells

00:03:50.924 --> 00:03:52.744
and we have the larger ink particles that

00:03:52.744 --> 00:03:54.221
are larger than the blood cells.

00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:56.129
That means the small ones can be drug away

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.764
by the phagocytes or the white blood cells,

00:03:57.764 --> 00:03:59.771
but the larger ones can't.

00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:01.651
That's why tattoos are permanent,

00:04:01.651 --> 00:04:03.423
but that's also why they fade right,

00:04:03.423 --> 00:04:05.173
because part of the ink is drug away

00:04:05.173 --> 00:04:07.091
but part of the ink stays.

00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:08.091
That's awesome.

00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:09.093
That's like so awesome.

00:04:09.093 --> 00:04:10.788
- If you look at a freshly placed tattoo,

00:04:10.788 --> 00:04:13.455
it looks very sharp, it has very clean edges,

00:04:13.455 --> 00:04:15.281
very clear colors, very crisp.

00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:16.000
- Right.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.512
- If you look at a tattoo on a retired master gunnery sergeant

00:04:19.512 --> 00:04:21.550
from the marine corps, that tattoo's starting

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.616
to look faded.

00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:23.456
- Right.

00:04:23.456 --> 00:04:25.170
- Because what's happening is that pigment is being eaten

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.415
by those white blood cells and carried through

00:04:27.415 --> 00:04:30.120
the lymphatics of the skin, because it's headed for

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.236
your liver, and that process has been going on

00:04:32.236 --> 00:04:34.832
in the gunnery sergeant for 35-40 years.

00:04:34.832 --> 00:04:37.287
- I find that hilarious that you're picking on gunnys

00:04:37.287 --> 00:04:38.786
because I know a couple of gunnys.

00:04:38.786 --> 00:04:40.448
- Well I'm retired navy.

00:04:40.448 --> 00:04:41.390
- Oh so you're allowed to say it.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.238
- Oh yeah I served the marine corps for years.

00:04:43.238 --> 00:04:44.302
- OK good.

00:04:44.302 --> 00:04:46.559
- The problem is that the relative size of the

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:48.581
white blood cell and the pigment granule,

00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:51.282
big pigment granule, little white blood cell.

00:04:51.282 --> 00:04:53.894
So what the laser does, is if you have the

00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:56.279
right type of laser when you hit it with a pulse

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:58.376
of light, hit the pigment granule with a pulse of light,

00:04:58.376 --> 00:05:01.653
that pigment granule will shatter, OK.

00:05:01.653 --> 00:05:03.353
And so as you shatter the pigment granules

00:05:03.353 --> 00:05:05.172
you're making them smaller and more edible.

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:05.897
- Really.

00:05:05.897 --> 00:05:08.751
- So you're accelerating the speed with which

00:05:08.751 --> 00:05:10.731
the white blood cells, and the efficiency with

00:05:10.731 --> 00:05:12.607
which the white blood cells can remove the pigment.

00:05:12.607 --> 00:05:13.765
- So they're trying to take it to the liver.

00:05:13.765 --> 00:05:15.336
- Correct. That's the way out.

00:05:15.336 --> 00:05:19.103
- So you're gonna zap the ink with this laser.

00:05:19.103 --> 00:05:19.676
- Correct.

00:05:19.676 --> 00:05:21.232
- And then the white blood cells are gonna go

00:05:21.232 --> 00:05:23.651
grab the broken up ink particles and

00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:24.622
take it to the liver.

00:05:24.622 --> 00:05:25.877
- That is correct. Through the lymphatic

00:05:25.877 --> 00:05:28.036
channels of the skin, into the larger lymph

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:30.332
channels deeper down, and ultimately

00:05:30.332 --> 00:05:34.375
through the liver for cleaning up and excretion.

00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:36.134
- So how does an optical energy source

00:05:36.134 --> 00:05:38.613
shatter a mechanical ink particle?

00:05:38.613 --> 00:05:39.808
Think about this.

00:05:39.808 --> 00:05:41.814
Let's say we have a heat lamp, and we

00:05:41.814 --> 00:05:43.983
turn it on and we shine radiation energy

00:05:43.983 --> 00:05:45.740
on one side of an ink particle.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.557
What's gonna happen is it's gonna heat up

00:05:47.557 --> 00:05:49.556
that side and then the heat transfer

00:05:49.556 --> 00:05:51.411
coefficient is gonna cause the entire ink particle

00:05:51.411 --> 00:05:54.518
to heat up from this side towards this side right?

00:05:54.518 --> 00:05:55.707
There's gonna be a heat gradient.

00:05:55.707 --> 00:05:58.908
What if we had a really really really hot heating lamp

00:05:58.908 --> 00:06:00.163
and it was very very fast.

00:06:00.163 --> 00:06:02.265
Assuming the laser and the ink are the right color,

00:06:02.265 --> 00:06:04.489
this laser will shine on one side of the particle

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:07.220
and heat it up so fast that only that side grows

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.509
due to thermal expansion.

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.831
The other side however doesn't have time to catch up,

00:06:10.831 --> 00:06:13.149
so it's still cool which causes huge internal

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:15.536
stresses which rip apart the particle.

00:06:15.536 --> 00:06:17.484
That's why it's a time game.

00:06:17.484 --> 00:06:19.588
The faster you can heat up one side relative

00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:22.977
to the other, the more likely you can rip apart the ink.

00:06:22.977 --> 00:06:26.116
The more exposure time, the more tissue you affect.

00:06:26.116 --> 00:06:26.836
- Correct.

00:06:26.836 --> 00:06:28.775
- But the smaller exposure time, the more

00:06:28.775 --> 00:06:31.228
localized if you hit the right chromophore.

00:06:31.228 --> 00:06:31.762
- Correct.

00:06:31.762 --> 00:06:35.060
- I feel like I know the big words now. [laugh]

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.163
It's awesome.

00:06:36.163 --> 00:06:37.641
So once it's shattered, the white blood cells

00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:39.206
are gonna come get those little broken

00:06:39.206 --> 00:06:40.870
particles of ink, take it to the lymph nodes

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.440
then dump it off to the liver and then you're

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.417
eventually gonna poop out your tattoo.

00:06:44.417 --> 00:06:45.860
That's how it works.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.817
- The aiming beam is a helium neon laser,

00:06:49.817 --> 00:06:51.508
very low energy but it allows me to see where the

00:06:51.508 --> 00:06:54.013
actual pulse is gonna go.

00:06:54.013 --> 00:06:55.110
Alright you ready?

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.023
- I am now ready.

00:06:56.023 --> 00:06:57.374
- OK here we go.

00:06:57.374 --> 00:06:59.652
[clicking]

00:07:08.037 --> 00:07:09.702
I'm just gonna keep treating while you...

00:07:24.908 --> 00:07:26.090
You can see what I mean about the

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.909
frosting right?

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:29.783
- I do.

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.791
- How it elevates the top layer of skin there.

00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:33.457
- So there you go.

00:07:33.457 --> 00:07:34.717
That white effect that you're seeing

00:07:34.717 --> 00:07:36.534
is called frosting, and it only lasts for

00:07:36.534 --> 00:07:38.862
just a few seconds. It's basically a shock

00:07:38.862 --> 00:07:41.215
wave that's happening at the particle level.

00:07:41.215 --> 00:07:43.567
Dr Lappert says that depending on the color

00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:45.492
this could take just a few treatments

00:07:45.492 --> 00:07:48.034
before the body can fully process the ink.

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:49.984
Alright so I hope the take away from this

00:07:49.984 --> 00:07:51.961
episode was, if you're gonna get a tattoo,

00:07:51.961 --> 00:07:53.872
know exactly what you're doing.

00:07:53.872 --> 00:07:55.942
What are you getting tattooed into your body,

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:57.667
meaning chemically what are they putting

00:07:57.667 --> 00:07:59.845
into you, and also what is the design.

00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:02.033
Think it through because it's a lot harder

00:08:02.033 --> 00:08:04.440
to get a tattoo off than it is to put it on.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.607
Think about it.

00:08:05.607 --> 00:08:08.278
Alright, so if you enjoyed all the sciences

00:08:08.278 --> 00:08:10.398
in this episode, optics, thermodynamics,

00:08:10.398 --> 00:08:13.350
chemistry. You will enjoy this audio book

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.326
I'm about to recommend.

00:08:14.326 --> 00:08:15.612
Many of you know that Audible.com

sponsor Smarter Every Day, but you

00:08:17.758 --> 00:08:19.937
just need to listen to this book, I don't

00:08:19.937 --> 00:08:21.203
care how you do it. If you go to

00:08:21.203 --> 00:08:22.797
audible.com/smarter you can get

00:08:22.797 --> 00:08:24.512
this book for free. It's called

00:08:24.512 --> 00:08:26.709
The Martian by Andy Weir.

00:08:26.709 --> 00:08:28.116
This book is incredible.

00:08:28.116 --> 00:08:29.338
You just need to listen to it.

00:08:29.338 --> 00:08:30.439
I would love to be the guy that

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:31.848
introduced you to it, but you just

00:08:31.848 --> 00:08:33.003
need to experience it on your own

00:08:33.003 --> 00:08:34.323
because he's stranded on mars and he

00:08:34.323 --> 00:08:35.737
has to MacGyver himself off.

00:08:35.737 --> 00:08:37.181
Think about that.

00:08:37.181 --> 00:08:39.536
We're talking like radio electronics,

00:08:39.536 --> 00:08:42.071
orbital mechanics, rocket propulsion,

00:08:42.071 --> 00:08:44.082
chemistry, biochemistry, thermo.

00:08:44.082 --> 00:08:45.213
It's awesome!

00:08:45.213 --> 00:08:47.160
Anyway, The Martian by Andy Weir,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.728
I really really really enjoyed it.

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:49.887

thank me later. However don't do

00:08:56.228 --> 00:08:58.233
what I did and start the book with your

00:08:58.233 --> 00:08:59.578
two year old in the car because there's

00:08:59.578 --> 00:09:01.496
a little bit of cussing. I apologize about that

00:09:01.496 --> 00:09:02.972
but I think it's worth it.

00:09:02.972 --> 00:09:04.854
Anyway, audible.com/smarter.

00:09:04.854 --> 00:09:06.920

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.022
earned your subscription.

00:09:08.022 --> 00:09:09.615

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:11.092
I really appreciate that.

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.135
I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:14.545
Have a good one.

00:09:14.545 --> 00:09:17.577
If somebody's going to get a tattoo removed,

00:09:17.577 --> 00:09:19.063
what are the questions they need to ask,

00:09:19.063 --> 00:09:19.877
just briefly.

00:09:19.877 --> 00:09:21.855
- How long will it take me to drive to Dr Lappert's office.

00:09:21.855 --> 00:09:23.481
- [laugh]

00:09:23.481 --> 00:09:28.336
We will leave it with that. There's your doctor..

00:09:28.336 --> 00:09:31.383
Dr Lappert, plastic surgeon. There you go.

00:09:31.573 --> 00:09:33.493
You are something else man.
