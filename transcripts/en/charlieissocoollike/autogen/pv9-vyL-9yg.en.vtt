let's talk about the power of touch

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300
let's talk about the power of touch
 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.880

the information is sent to two different
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.720
the information is sent to two different
systems inside your brain the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730
systems inside your brain the
 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.060
systems inside your brain the
somatosensory cortex which deals with

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070
somatosensory cortex which deals with
 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.250

the facts of where and how you've been
 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.529
the facts of where and how you've been
touched and posterior insula which

as it were isn't the only way that your
 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.190
as it were isn't the only way that your
brain affects touch have you ever tried

tickling yourself not that easy is it
 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.279
tickling yourself not that easy is it
well that's because our brains are

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289
well that's because our brains are
 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.350
well that's because our brains are
hard-wired to ignore sensations of touch

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360
hard-wired to ignore sensations of touch
 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.240
hard-wired to ignore sensations of touch
that originate from our own motion

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250
that originate from our own motion
 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.980
that originate from our own motion
however when we receive those same

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990
however when we receive those same
 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.749
however when we receive those same
sensations from the outside world this

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759
sensations from the outside world this
 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.490
sensations from the outside world this
makes sense as from an evolutionary

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500
makes sense as from an evolutionary
 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.529
makes sense as from an evolutionary
standpoint there's no real benefit to

standpoint there's no real benefit to
 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.630

now that I've given you a basic idea of
 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.590
now that I've given you a basic idea of
how touch works what about some of its

researchers at Carnegie Mellon
 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.819
researchers at Carnegie Mellon
University found the people who received

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829
University found the people who received
 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:33.559
University found the people who received
more hug

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569
more hug
 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.179
more hug
are somewhat more protected from

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:35.189
are somewhat more protected from
 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:37.250
are somewhat more protected from
infection than those who received fewer

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260
infection than those who received fewer
 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.379

hoaxes so what could be happening here

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389
hoaxes so what could be happening here
 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.390
hoaxes so what could be happening here
well one of the effects of the release

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400
well one of the effects of the release
 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.580
well one of the effects of the release
of oxytocin is that it protects against

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590
of oxytocin is that it protects against
 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.069
of oxytocin is that it protects against
stress and when you have lower stress

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079
stress and when you have lower stress
 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.080
stress and when you have lower stress
your immune system functions better

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090
your immune system functions better
 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.149
your immune system functions better
which leaves you more equipped to fight

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159
which leaves you more equipped to fight
 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.000
which leaves you more equipped to fight
against infectious diseases however the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010
