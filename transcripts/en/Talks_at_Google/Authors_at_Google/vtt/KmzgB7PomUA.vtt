00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.600
&gt;&gt;female presenter: Michael is a linguist.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.330
And, like many linguists, I'm a linguist as
well, he claims to be monolingual.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.860
Now, what is a linguist?

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.830
If someone finds out you're a linguist, what's
the first question they ask?

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.500
"How many languages do you speak?"

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.749
And I always answer, "Well, I've studied,
I don't know, 5 maybe.

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.669
I've studied Spanish, Russian, German."

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:22.640
You have a list you start going like this.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.919
And you say, "But I don't speak any of them.

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.329
But I've studied them."

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:33.230
So when Michael's book came out about hyperpolyglots,
I thought, "How many can there possibly be?"

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.610
I think I met one in graduate school.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.430
My dissertation advisor.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.380
But it ended up not being a very interesting
question as I followed Michael through his

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.380
book.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.640
And you'll see it becomes far more interesting
than simply that question.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.510
Michael has advanced degrees in linguistics
and rhetoric.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.920
He's lived in South America and in Asia, where
he taught English as a second language.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.540
He joins us today to talk about his book Babel
No More.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.050
That's apparently the American version.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.020
The search for the world's most extraordinary
language learners.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.450
So please join me in welcoming Michael.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.450
[applause]

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.340
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: Thanks.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.060
And thanks to everyone for coming.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.719
Thanks to Anne for setting this up.

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.799
It's good to see some friends, old friends,
in the audience as well.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.119
So as she said, I'm trained as a linguist,
but for about the last decade, I've been writing

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.950
stories about language and languages and the
people who use and study them.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.499
The most recent story is Babel No More, which
is a book about hyperpolyglots.

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:46.960
So in the presentation, I want to run through
some of the high points from the book.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.279
Some stuff that characterizes this group of
people specifically, that you might know if

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:57.509
you are one of these people that you might
not know either way.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:05.319
I'll just second what Anne said, which is
that I am not a hyperpolyglot or a polyglot

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.750
in any regard.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.520
People I think have said, "How could a monoglot
write a book about this without really understanding?"

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.950
Once you get and spend a little bit of time
around the hyperpolyglot world and that community,

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.910
you realize how many people really have a
stake, a personal stake, in claiming and proving

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.400
that they have lots of languages.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.660
In some ways, this is a book that can only
be written by someone who doesn't have any

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.030
of those claims to make whatsoever.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.960
I have nothing to prove.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.960
Well, that's not true.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.280
I have a lot to prove, but not in that regard.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.930
[pause]
When you think of massive multilingual people

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.120
or entities, you might think of this guy.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.260
Anyone remember how many languages he has?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.100
&gt;&gt;audience member: Over 6 million.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.100
&gt;&gt; Michael Erard: Over 6 million, yeah.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.160
He claims.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.190
[laughter] And a lot of them were languages
of pumps, so how complex can that be?

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.030
But 6 million of them.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.540
This is another tool that is making people
much more multilingual out in the world.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.720
64 languages, now.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.920
Only 64 languages.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.180
But I hope that after my talk and after you
read the book that you will think of this

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.870
guy when you think of massive multilingualism.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.370
This is Cardinal Giuseppe Mezzofanti, an Italian
priest and cardinal who was born in 1774.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.480
He died in 1849.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:53.010
He spoke, what is commonly and usually attributed
to him, 72 languages or 114 languages, depending

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.870
on who you talk to.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.260
I love how I said "72 languages" and all the
chewing stopped.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.900
[laughter]
So with numbers like that, you want to go

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.300
check it out, right?

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.830
And see how much evidence there is, how much
contemporary evidence there is for actually

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.120
being able to do that in all those languages.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.700
So I went to his archive in Bologna, Italy,
and dug around and found a lot of stuff that

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.930
really demonstrates that he could do a lot
of pretty advanced things in quite a lot of

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.930
languages.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.930
Not 72 of them, however, but a lot of substantial
stuff.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.950
And a lot of really other interesting stuff,
such as this, which is from a legal document

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:43.950
that was written about 40 years after his
death when his body was disinterred from his

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.230
tomb because it was rumored to be a group
of foreign language enthusiasts who were trying

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.210
to get a hold of his skull.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.410
So they dug him up to make sure that his body
was intact.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.460
I think also because there might have been
a move to try to canonize Mezzofanti, and

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.060
the first step in the canonization process
in the Roman Catholic Church is to make sure

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.830
that the person's body has not been taken
for veneration by any other group.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.710
So this is what they found, or an artist's
rendering of what they found when they opened

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.210
up Mezzofanti's tomb.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.430
He was all there.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.430
The other thing that I found, or another interesting
thing that I found was in another box.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.540
Unlike the first box, I actually got to put
my hands on the inside of this one.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:38.090
This was a box of packets of paper of different
sizes.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.340
When I opened the box, the librarians were
like, "Wow, what is this stuff?"

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.560
They had apparently never seen it before.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.800
I don't know how many people had ever seen
it, because there was no record of people

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.240
having gone in this box.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.510
But you take apart the packets, and on each
slip-- there's collections of slips of paper,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:04.500
and on one side is written a word in one language,
and on the other side is written another word.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:10.220
I went, "My God, it's Mezzofanti's flashcards!"
[laughter]

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.290
So the common notion of the polyglot or the
hyperpolyglot or the talented person is that

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:21.360
they get this stuff by osmosis, but in his
case, anyway, it turns out to involve quite

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.060
a lot of hard work and repetitive work.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.810
A famous guy in his time.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:38.010
He was courted by Napoleon, visited by Russian
princesses and Texan colonels.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.730
Lord Byron came and had a famous swearing
contest with him.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:48.230
So it was a glamorous life for a 19th century
celibate man.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:56.340
But he was also going home and, before blowing
out his candle, working through his Persian

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.340
flashcards.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.840
And I think those two things, those two images,
of this person are really instructive.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.080
Holding them together is very instructive.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.010
Here's another person that I read about in
a book and who's very prominent in discussions

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.229
of hyperpolyglots.

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:15.919
His name is Emil Krebs, and he was a German
diplomat.

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:17.910
He died in 1930.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:25.260
When he died, he started out finishing law
school and going to the German diplomatic

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.060
school and saying, "I want to learn all of
the languages that you have."

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.510
And they said, "Well, you can't learn all
the languages."

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.889
He said, "Okay, I want to learn the hardest
one" which was Chinese.

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:39.479
So in three years he was certified as a Chinese
translator and was posted to the diplomatic

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:47.139
mission in Beijing where the empress dowager
would ask to have him come and speak Chinese

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:51.550
to her because, of all the foreigners, his
Chinese was the best.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:56.680
There's lots of stories about him as this
famously cranky, difficult person studying

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:05.530
languages all night long, parading around
his study naked, drunk on beer, which was--

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:10.810
and he only drank beer and he only ate meat
and nothing else.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:16.500
That kind of eccentricity is something that
shows up a lot, but not as much as you would

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.699
think it would.

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:24.410
When he died in 1930, his family donated his
brain to science.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:31.420
It's now housed in a collection of genius
brains in Duesseldorf.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.760
When I went to see it, I was really excited,
like "Oh, there's going to be a brain floating

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.760
in a jar."

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.760
But of course it wasn't.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.070
They had sliced and diced it a million ways.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:48.000
It was studied in 1931, but then 2002, 2003
two German neuroscientists got a hold of it

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:56.080
again and did an analysis of the structure
of his cortical cells.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.470
But the language dominant region of his brain,
which would have been the left side because

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.990
he was right-handed, but also on the corresponding
right side.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:10.210
And what they found was a surprising density
of cell structure and a symmetry in that density

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.940
on both left and right.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:18.710
They compared his brain to 11 control brains,
and that's how they made the determinations

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:19.710
of the density.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:25.960
So it's quite an unusual brain for that reason.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:31.630
But in the book, I really endeavored to try
to go meet living hyperpolyglots because the

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:35.660
Krebs is really interesting, and the Mezzofanti
character is really interesting.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.100
But what could they really do?

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.100
They're dead.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.050
We can't assess them, or whatever.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:44.210
So this is a woman named Helena Bozi who works
for the World Bank.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.750
She has studied 18 languages to intermediate
degree.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:53.990
On a regular basis, she uses all the languages
of the World Bank, which is 6.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.790
And she's a program evaluator for literacy
programs that the bank funds.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:04.230
So she'll go out to Cambodia, say, in order
to assess the progress of the mission and

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.950
see how her bank money is being spent and
stuff like that.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.300
Before she goes, she learns the language.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.870
Not because it gets her anything.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:19.940
She should just be able to use English or
some other major language or colonial language.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:27.149
But she really believes that knowing those
languages helps her talk to students, understand

00:10:27.149 --> 00:10:33.290
what students are doing, talk to teachers,
and get around the official story that the

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:36.270
officials would want to be telling her.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.570
She's interesting for a couple reasons.

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:45.860
One, she's 61 years old, so she's definitely
on the older end of the hyperpolyglot scale.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:51.790
She describes having to do a lot more repetitive
work in order to get the language stuff into

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:52.790
her head.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.120
She's also interesting because she is a she.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:01.290
There are very very few, relatively few women
who are hyperpolyglots, both historically

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.730
and contemporaneously.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:09.200
So doing research for the book, I did an online
survey of people who said that they know 6

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.660
or more languages, and only 30% of the people
who answered are women.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:20.810
There are lots of reasons, but we can speculate
about why that gap exists.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.350
This is somebody else that I wrote about in
the book.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:30.600
I posted a video on YouTube a while back of
him describing his daily polyglot workout

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.300
which starts at 2 o'clock in the morning when
he wakes up and starts working in English

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:42.459
and then goes through German, Russian, Hindi,
Persian, Arabic, Chinese in 15-20 minute chunks.

00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:46.360
He won't say how many languages he speaks.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:52.860
And I find that a pretty principled position
to take because one of the conclusions of

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:59.610
the book is how insufficient the notion of
a language is as a unitive measure.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:03.529
One language does not weigh-- It doesn't have
a cognitive weight, and they don't have the

00:12:03.529 --> 00:12:07.670
same cognitive weights as each other.

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:13.839
When he was a single assistant professor in
Korea, he would spend 16 hours a day working

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:17.870
on languages in 15-20 minute chunks, but now
he's married.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.950
Yes, he's married.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.910
And he has two kids.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.790
He speaks Korean at home and he speaks French
at home to his sons.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.420
He lives in Singapore.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.470
He has a job.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:33.660
So I assume that he's spending much less time
actually doing language learning than he used

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.850
to.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:41.950
[pause]
These are hyperpolyglots.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.430
Maybe not the prettiest word in the world.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:51.740
It was coined by linguist Dick Hudson at University
College London, who was looking for a term

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:56.820
to capture and characterize people who spoke
6 or more languages.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.620
And that's not an arbitrary number.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:06.810
His logic was that there are communities where
everyone speaks 5 languages, from the uneducated

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:10.230
person to the most educated person.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:13.019
It's not an extraordinary thing.

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:19.550
So the people who speak 6 or more must, in
those terms, be doing something that is fairly

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:20.740
unusual.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.890
As you'll see, I have a slide on this in a
bit.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.610
I think that that number should be revised
upwards to 11.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:33.399
I see another poly-11 in the audience here.

00:13:33.399 --> 00:13:36.630
So you're probably sitting there wondering,
"Okay, great.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.410
72 languages, whatever.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.990
What can these people actually do?"

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:48.050
[sighs] which was something that was really
important to me, too, because one of the goals

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:52.070
of the book was to try to get away from the
anecdote and get away from the exaggeration

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:55.870
and get away from the Guinness World Book
of Records, of Facts.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:00.300
So Guinness has somehow got itself into the
business of certifying language proficiency.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:07.839
If you ever need a certification, it's fairly
easy, I think, coming from Guinness.

00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:14.720
What I did for this part was I took the inter
agency language round table scale, which is

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:21.480
a US federal government scale for measuring
proficiency in a number of different language

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.180
areas: reading, writing, translating, listening,
and speaking of course.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:30.830
At the time that I was working on the book,
there were 3 of the scales that had been adapted

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:34.149
for a self-reporting scale.

00:14:34.149 --> 00:14:39.740
So you could take yourself: can you order
a meal, yes or no?

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.900
Can you order a taxi, yes or no?

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.960
And they increase with increasing functional
difficulty.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.649
And where 5, of course, is the educated native
speaker goal.

00:14:51.649 --> 00:14:56.080
So that's supposed to be a goal of language
learning.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:04.580
I gave this particular test to a guy named
Graham Cansdale, who was a European Commission

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.580
translator.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:06.580
He's 46 or 47.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:12.940
He translates in 13 languages, has studied
languages all his life.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.899
He agreed to play along.

00:15:15.899 --> 00:15:25.570
This is his proficiency in spoken language
and all of his languages.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:29.320
What's interesting is that it's not a very
high level across all of his languages.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.160
Some are fairly high, but a lot of them are
quite low.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.579
People often ask, "How do speaking and reading
differ from each other?"

00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:46.960
I gave him the reading test, and that's what
his reading proficiencies looks like.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.690
It's higher in a lot of languages, but it
also diminishes.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:56.670
What's interesting is that he's working in
3 scripts.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.260
It's not just a bunch of languages, it's 3
scripts.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.100
And that represents something like 8 language
families.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.410
So it's pretty considerable.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:09.740
And that higher distribution in the reading
than the speaking I think reflects a couple

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:10.740
things.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.750
One is his work as a translator, so he just
gets more practice with the reading than he

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.070
does in speaking.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:22.350
And also that reading in all those languages,
while a not insignificant task, also represents

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:26.450
less of a cognitive load than online, spoken
communication.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:30.600
So it's easier to do.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:40.700
Then this is his proficiency scores in the
three areas: speaking, listening, and reading

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.970
across all the languages that he has, arranged
in order of when he learned them.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.040
So on the far left English, his native language.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.810
French is the first one that he studied in
elementary school.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.890
And then over on the far left, you see Chinese.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.019
He's in Taiwan right now doing an intensive
Mandarin course.

00:16:58.019 --> 00:17:00.930
Not just speaking but also learning how to
read and write.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.240
And he reports that it is kicking his ass.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.270
Learning to read and write.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:10.480
Interestingly, Mezzofanti had a similar experience
with written Chinese.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:17.160
He always claimed that he could speak Chinese,
but Mezzofanti had a nervous breakdown when

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.860
he was faced with trying to learn how to read
and write Chinese.

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:27.750
There might have been typhoid or something
like that involved as well, 'cause he had

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:32.130
fevers and lived in a feverish state for a
while.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:36.870
And when he came out of it, he had forgotten
all of his languages, except for Bolognese,

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.710
which was his mother tongue.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:43.030
He apparently got the other languages back,
but I love that story.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.820
"Don't study Mandarin."

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:49.480
[laughter] Or don't learn to read or write
it.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:55.270
What's also interesting about this distribution
is in this foreign language acquisition world,

00:17:55.270 --> 00:18:06.100
there are some truisms, there are some theoretical
aspects that are reported with this graph.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.630
Earlier learned languages are typically stronger,
and then later learned languages are typically

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:11.630
not.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:15.880
But then you have that whole middle group
of languages which are surprisingly high.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:21.221
And I also find it's interesting how much
difference there is among all the languages

00:18:21.221 --> 00:18:27.220
stronger in one set of skills than the others.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:37.710
[pause]
[sighs] So this is the imagined polyglot proficiency

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:44.309
profile: that they must have very high abilities
in all of the languages that they speak.

00:18:44.309 --> 00:18:46.809
It's the additive view.

00:18:46.809 --> 00:18:51.419
This used to be the view, and maybe still
is in some corners of even bilinguals or trilinguals

00:18:51.419 --> 00:18:57.520
that each of those people possess a monolingual
native speaker's knowledge of a language just

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.140
glommed onto each other, and that the hyperpolyglot
is just a more extreme version of that.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:06.460
I've had conversations with people saying,
"Did Mezzofanti speak 72 languages like a

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.130
native speaker?"

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.890
The implication being that if he didn't like
a native speaker, then it's not a phenomenon

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:14.710
that's all that interesting.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:19.410
But I'm maintaining that it is really interesting,
but you need to go back and make some adjustments

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:26.250
to your expectations and to the way that you
count or describe success in foreign language

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.230
learning in order to make this significant.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:35.380
So people's profiles typically look more like
this, where you have a few very high languages

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:41.090
and then decreasing over the-- as the number
of languages increases and then this long

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:45.410
tail where there's hardly anything at all.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:53.070
But not that-- At a moment in time, this proficiency
profile is very dynamic.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:58.080
Those languages that are very low over on
the right hand side, they could conceivably,

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:03.950
if they had had very high levels proficiency
in the past, they claim to be able to activate

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:11.080
them or take them off ice, thaw them out a
little bit in order to be able to use them.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.020
I get asked a lot, "What are the hyperpolyglots
like?"

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.250
I think that, "What can you say about the
hyperpolyglots?"

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:24.840
I think that sometimes the question is trying
to get me to confess that they're also piano

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:34.710
geniuses or they're really good in bed, or
they're just odd, they're super super odd.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.520
But I can't say any of that.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:42.750
But I can say these things, these are pretty
safe generalizations to make about them: they've

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:48.020
learned how to learn, they've learned how
they learn and how they learn individually,

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:54.309
and as a result, they've discovered or invented
or swapped methods of learning that affect

00:20:54.309 --> 00:20:57.230
them, that fit them.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:59.840
They like and they crave repetition.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:06.049
The repetitive work of looking at the flashcards
or doing other things is something that they're

00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:07.750
drawn to and that they crave.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:14.840
The language of addiction comes up quite a
lot, that with people who don't do this, they

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.460
get a little agitated.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:21.340
Which suggests that there's a very strong
role for dopamine in this whole process, and

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:30.570
that these people are responding very strongly
to neurological, neuromodulatory reward.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:33.320
They remember what they learn.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.840
They have incredible memories.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.050
They have a feel for language.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:41.450
The structure of language is something that
they have at their fingertips.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:46.650
And actually, this gesture that I'm doing
is one that the hyperpolyglots would do a

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:53.510
lot as if they were connected to their brains,
and talking about the stuff they had in their

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:57.150
brains in this very textured way.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:04.240
They find or they make a social niche for
themselves.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:09.010
Individuals who are happiest are people who
have a place where learning languages and

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:15.929
having a lot of languages, even with that
stair step profile, is normal and even has

00:22:15.929 --> 00:22:18.010
a certain amount of social status.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:23.460
The ones who are unhappiest are the ones who
are out in the community who don't have a

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:29.180
place in that sort of institution or that
sort of organization.

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:33.980
And the last point is one that I just recently
added after thinking about it a little bit.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:38.070
What they're implicitly or explicitly what
they're doing is they're asserting a right

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.790
to not speak English.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:45.880
Some of them report some frustration or difficulties
trying to work on their languages out in the

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.050
world, particularly in places where the English
is pretty good.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:50.510
And they get frustrated.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:56.970
I think a lot of people have either heard
or had experiences trying to work on your

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:57.970
Dutch.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:59.370
In the Netherlands, it's really hard.

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:06.770
Or Swedish and things like that.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:11.299
So where did I start with hyperpolyglots?

00:23:11.299 --> 00:23:15.549
I've studied Spanish and studied Chinese and
always seen these people who were really much

00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:22.900
better than I was, and also interested in
the cultural ideal of the person who can speak

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.750
a lot of languages and the person for whom
it's very easy.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:33.700
I was interested in: what is the root of my
fascination?

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:40.429
What is the root of the cultural or historical
fascination with this group of people?

00:23:40.429 --> 00:23:47.260
And it's not just a monolingual society like
the US that finds polyglots, or the UK that

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.240
finds polyglots fascinating.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:55.169
I did some research for the book in South
Asia or South India where people are very

00:23:55.169 --> 00:23:56.630
multilingual.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.980
And I'd say, "I'm writing about this guy Mezzofanti
who spoke 72 languages."

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.690
And people'd go, "Wow, that's amazing.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.169
You've got to talk to my uncle.

00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:05.280
He was a diplomat and he spoke 20 languages.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.330
He's an incredible guy."

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:10.400
Or "You've got to talk to this other guy who
speaks 15 languages."

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:16.340
So there it was-- Even this place where people
were massively multilingual themselves, there

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:23.580
was also this very high regard for people
who could do things with a lot of other languages

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.360
and languages that were not Indian languages.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.890
That was the thing that was really amazing
to them.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:30.140
"Wow, he can speak Russian.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.170
He can speak Chinese.

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:32.760
That's really amazing."

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:39.810
So I was interested in exploring the relationship
that we have to that cultural ideal.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:46.299
The first book that I wrote, which came out
in 2007, is a natural history of slips of

00:24:46.299 --> 00:24:48.530
the tongue and speech disfluencies.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:52.059
The uhs and the ums and things like that.

00:24:52.059 --> 00:24:55.929
It's the search for the perfectly um-less
speaker.

00:24:55.929 --> 00:25:01.360
Where did we even get the notion that talking
without ums is to be highly regarded?

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.760
Where did that aesthetic come from?

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:10.520
Because clearly, those things are necessary
elements of human communication.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:15.390
If we didn't have them, we wouldn't be able
to communicate, or we would have some other

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:23.740
behavior that the toast masters in this alternate
universe would be trying to get rid of.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:27.620
[pause]
Oh, people know toast masters.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.929
Do you know what's interesting about toast
masters?

00:25:28.929 --> 00:25:33.490
They can be very very good at eliminating
uhs and ums from their speech, from their

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:41.120
public speeches, and that carries over into
their conversation, but what ends up happening

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.730
is they develop these other mechanisms for
pausing.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:48.990
They, they, they, they'll, they'll, they'll
do this.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:53.300
And they never get dinged according to toast
master rules because it's all about uhs and

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.470
ums, not about repetitions.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:03.210
And another reason-- I think in a lot of ways
a really big reason and a really big attraction

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:08.280
for me of the hyperpolyglots was just that
no one had ever taken them seriously.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:14.039
It was like this "That's a giant squid which
may or may not exist.

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:16.610
I guess there are people that are convinced
that it does."

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:25.580
But the hyperpolyglot was-- People had anecdotes
or folklore about high school teachers who

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:32.340
could speak 18 languages and uncles, or things
like that, but no one had ever assessed, "Okay,

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.559
what can they actually do?"

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:41.110
So I set out to write the book to not only
write some of the anecdotes, 'cause the stories

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:45.679
are really cool, but to try to actually put
some numbers on this.

00:26:45.679 --> 00:26:52.780
There's a funny moment when I'm in Italy and
I'm meeting with another guy that's an Italian

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.299
historian who's written a book about Mezzofanti
as a librarian.

00:26:55.299 --> 00:26:58.770
And I said, "I need to count stuff."

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:03.520
And he's like, "You're a positivist" and he
punches me in the shoulder.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.030
"You're a positivist."

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.030
"Well, yeah."

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:09.299
And he's like, "Yeah, you're a positivist."

00:27:09.299 --> 00:27:14.490
So another reason to pay attention to the
hyperpolyglots is that we need them.

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:20.029
We need to understand the cognitive capital
that they have and how they got it and how

00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:21.610
they wield it.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:28.210
In all of this, I'm really interested in the
question of how do you make more language

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.210
learners?

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:32.570
How do you make more better languages learners?

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:36.630
Not just in the US, but everywhere.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:40.950
Learning languages is the human condition
in a lot of ways right now.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:49.460
And not just learning human languages, but
learning machine languages as well.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:54.740
So the way that I tell that story in the book
is through this notion of the neural tribe.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:28:01.790
It's a way of starting with the notion that
human brains are all different from each other.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:05.390
That's actually an evolutionary asset of the
species.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:08.710
Because we have different brains, we learn
differently, we solve problems in different

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:09.940
ways.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:17.990
The people who are very good at learning languages
or doing some similar behavior is one of those

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:21.029
types of brains.

00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:28.020
They are selected by certain kinds of environments
in order to be able to wield the particular

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.220
neurology that they have.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:35.779
There are a number of ways to characterize
that neurology.

00:28:35.779 --> 00:28:44.200
In the book, I speculate a lot about directions
that that might take, including plasticity,

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:53.830
including particular memory function, so hippocampal,
something special about the hippocampus and

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.390
other things.

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:58.910
They're selected by the environment.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:00.630
It's a nondeterministic account.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:04.059
I'm not saying that if you have that brain,
you'll become a hyperpolyglot.

00:29:04.059 --> 00:29:09.620
You have to have that brain and you have to
have access to those resources, be living

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:13.690
in a culture where this is a given status,
or whatever.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:16.350
Those things start to feed back on each other.

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:20.929
And what that does is it creates an identity,
a sense of an "I", like, "Hey, I'm a language

00:29:20.929 --> 00:29:21.929
learner.

00:29:21.929 --> 00:29:22.929
This is what I do."

00:29:22.929 --> 00:29:27.180
And then a sense of a personal mission, like
"I'm going to start traveling to these places.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:31.960
I'm going to cook up a project that involves
lots of languages.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:36.620
I'm going to be on the lookout for native
speakers in those languages because I like

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:40.180
to practice that."

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:48.179
[pause]
Another thing that's crucial about the neural

00:29:48.179 --> 00:29:52.010
tribe is that they're these extra-institutional
or subnational.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:55.169
I mean, they are very tribal in that sense.

00:29:55.169 --> 00:29:59.260
The way that they learn languages and the
things that they use their languages for are

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.960
largely not things that institutions find
valuable.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.780
Doing research for the project, I went to
the Defense Language Institute and the Foreign

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.070
Service Institute, and said, "Hey, polyglots.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:12.340
You know any polyglots?"

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:16.520
And they're just not interested in the people
who can speak lots of languages to fairly

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:23.790
low levels of proficiency, because their whole
task is about taking adults, taking monolingual

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:29.440
English speaking adults and turning them into
bilinguals who can work as diplomats or spies,

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.660
people who can blend in to whatever the native
population is.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.900
This is a total different orient.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:42.620
According to those institutional rules, they
hyperpolyglot looks like a failed language

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.770
learner.

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:51.650
[pause] And being extra-institutional in this
way also gives them the freedom to basically

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:57.630
be experimenting on themselves cognitively
and pedagogically, inventing stuff, trying

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:02.460
stuff out that might work with them on their
brains.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.980
So these are some results from the survey
that I did.

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:11.750
On the left, you have people who know more
than 6 languages, and I left that however

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.900
they wanted to report that.

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:14.900
That was fine.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:20.789
On the left are people who reported that learning
languages was easier for them than for other

00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:22.070
people.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:25.230
In both groups, the number of men is 70%.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:33.471
They're not all that old, but I was surprised
to see that many people in the 25-40 year

00:31:33.471 --> 00:31:40.840
old range, 'cause I had thought that maybe,
if you have this neurology, that that would

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:45.990
have been something that was siphoned off
by access to programming environments and

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:50.230
programming professions and stuff like that.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:51.950
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:54.620
And I don't know how much of an overlap there
is.

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.980
I can talk about it a little bit.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:02.179
But I was surprised to see so many young people
in both groups.

00:32:02.179 --> 00:32:12.700
Multilingualism is not necessarily a precursor
to hyperpolyglotism.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.360
Some people start that way, but not all of
them do.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.260
Then, as far as IQ distribution, I mistrust
that.

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.780
These were self-reported IQs.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.950
That seems really high to me.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:26.649
But I just stick it here.

00:32:26.649 --> 00:32:28.450
They were from all over the world.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:29.630
The survey was in English.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:32.390
It was circulated on English language blogs.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:42.440
I don't think that it really got that far
into Asia or the non-English part of the internet.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:47.970
It's an unreliable sample in a lot of ways.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:55.360
This is that chart of repertoire size or collection
size that I was talking about before.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.470
I have a bunch of people with 60 languages
and then decreasing numbers, but it really

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:05.460
bottoms out at 11, so that for me is maybe
the new floor or what it means or what it

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:10.309
requires to be a hyperpolyglot: about 11 languages.

00:33:10.309 --> 00:33:18.510
Those two other graphs there are what's the
contribution of being or growing up with more

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:23.789
than one mother tongue, and then what's the
contribution of talent or something innate

00:33:23.789 --> 00:33:28.420
versus something else.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:32.440
The contribution of talent is much higher
than growing up with more than one mother

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:36.460
tongue.

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:41.539
These are some characteristics of that group
who had more than 11 languages.

00:33:41.539 --> 00:33:44.330
Overwhelmingly male.

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:46.779
They were an older group, which makes sense.

00:33:46.779 --> 00:33:52.880
I mean, it takes you a little more time to
accumulate all of the languages.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.010
But I'll just go back to this.

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:58.110
The highest number that I got reported was
26 languages, so the next time you meet somebody

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:07.740
who says, "Yeah, I speak 50 languages", keep
that into account.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:13.919
[pause]
I asked people to, this is a cross of the

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:17.799
two groups: of people with more than 6 languages
who said that learning is easier for them.

00:34:17.799 --> 00:34:19.179
There were 145 of them.

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:21.579
I asked them why they thought that was the
case.

00:34:21.579 --> 00:34:26.709
"Innate talent, I'm intelligent, I work harder,
I'm more motivated, it's part of my background,

00:34:26.709 --> 00:34:31.469
I have a good education, I like languages,
my parents are good language learners."

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:38.029
People were not giving very much credit to
their parents and giving a ton of credit to

00:34:38.029 --> 00:34:41.149
attitude, or what looks like attitude.

00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:42.369
"I like languages.

00:34:42.369 --> 00:34:43.369
I'm the 90%."

00:34:43.369 --> 00:34:48.859
But I'm really curious: what does "I like
languages" actually mean?

00:34:48.859 --> 00:34:53.509
It's "I like the way that my mouth sounds
or the way that my mouth feels when I speak

00:34:53.509 --> 00:34:54.639
Japanese."

00:34:54.639 --> 00:35:01.450
Or is it "I like the way that a member-- or
another attractive person looks at me when

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:02.930
I speak Japanese."

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:09.500
Or "I like the way that my brain feels when
I'm doing-- when I'm trying to speak Japanese

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.130
or when I'm learning Japanese" or things like
that.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:21.410
That high number doesn't surprise me, but
I wouldn't say that that is entirely all attitude,

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:27.710
positive attitude about foreign languages
or being multilingual necessarily.

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:34.960
One of the explanations that's been offered
for this particular neurology is called the

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.980
Geschwind-Galaburta Hypothesis.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:42.269
It was first developed in the '80s.

00:35:42.269 --> 00:35:52.069
The story goes like this: that at a particular
moment in the developing fetus, the presence

00:35:52.069 --> 00:36:00.259
of or exposure to a certain level of testosterone
changes and creates-- changes the migration

00:36:00.259 --> 00:36:07.219
of neural cells in the brain and creates these
patterns of impairments/gifts so that you

00:36:07.219 --> 00:36:14.430
can end up with someone who is visuo-spacialy
gifted but verbally impaired, or vice versa.

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:19.630
And that vice versa case could potentially
be the hyperpolyglot.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:30.579
It was originally formulated in order to try
to combine some of the insights or some observed

00:36:30.579 --> 00:36:37.680
correlations between things like left-handedness
and immune disorders, or left-handedness and

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.339
maleness, or maleness and dyslexia.

00:36:40.339 --> 00:36:47.200
It's an attempt to give a global explanation
to all of those phenomena.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:54.849
I asked Geschwind-Galaburta questions on the
survey and did not find anything interesting

00:36:54.849 --> 00:36:58.229
or significant statistically except in two
areas.

00:36:58.229 --> 00:37:03.309
One: people were reporting higher levels of
immune disorders, either for themselves or

00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:07.809
for their families, than was statistically
predicted.

00:37:07.809 --> 00:37:17.720
And also higher levels of homosexual identification,
behavior, or orientation than was predicted.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:22.529
It's a problematic set of questions, to be
sure, because measuring handedness turns out

00:37:22.529 --> 00:37:33.259
to not be [pause] all that straightforward.

00:37:33.259 --> 00:37:38.150
Certainly, asking the homosexuality question,
you've got to be really careful.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:46.079
So I'll just-- I should have prefaced that,
but I'll postface that and say-- I'm not saying

00:37:46.079 --> 00:37:50.539
that people who are hyperpolyglots are gay,
I'm saying-- or left-handed or anything, I'm

00:37:50.539 --> 00:37:58.309
saying that this particular theory says that,
predicts that it's about likelihood.

00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:59.460
It's about probability.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:08.589
And it's about not necessarily probability
in an individual but in the family.

00:38:08.589 --> 00:38:14.920
[pause]
So these are some of the implications, I think.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:18.950
Just some of the implications of some of this.

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:21.960
One of which is for language learning in general.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:28.630
Obviously I get a lot of questions about "What
is the hyperpolyglot secret?"

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:34.940
And the secret is, unfortunately, there is
no secret that is global or uniform.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:42.020
What you do have are secrets that are particular
to individuals, I think.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:46.749
One of the ways to find that out is to really
work on profiling yourself.

00:38:46.749 --> 00:38:47.940
What are your learner preferences?

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.359
What is your cognitive style?

00:38:49.359 --> 00:38:56.210
And then going out and finding methods that
work for you and prove your higher order cognitive

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:58.039
skills.

00:38:58.039 --> 00:39:04.200
Get working on that working memory trainer
and executive function trainer.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:12.170
You could be working on a language and doing
your dual end back iPhone app on the treadmill,

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:19.109
and the two things will arguably or theoretically
be enhancing each other.

00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:23.640
The federal government is working on research
exactly in this area and showing a very high

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:28.269
degree of correlation between language aptitude
and working memory skills.

00:39:28.269 --> 00:39:33.229
The degree to which you can get your working
memory stronger, your language learning will

00:39:33.229 --> 00:39:35.150
go better.

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:37.559
There's this cycle of emotional preparation.

00:39:37.559 --> 00:39:43.329
There's the neuromodulation, managing dopamine
and other kinds of things, thinking about--

00:39:43.329 --> 00:39:47.960
starting to think about the role of hormones
in the role of language learning.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:53.709
It can take an interesting spin on some language
learning folklore, so that the whole notion

00:39:53.709 --> 00:39:59.229
that the best way to learn a foreign language
is to get a lover who speaks the other language,

00:39:59.229 --> 00:40:05.619
which you think of as-- you want to impress
them.

00:40:05.619 --> 00:40:10.010
It's about access to certain kinds of native
performances and things like that.

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:12.829
It's also about oxytocin.

00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:18.619
It's also about maybe mimicking or jacking
up oxytocin levels as an adult that would

00:40:18.619 --> 00:40:22.660
have been present as a child learning a language.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:29.829
It's reduplicating that hormonal environment.

00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:32.119
And two other things build community.

00:40:32.119 --> 00:40:35.670
Learning languages is not just something that
individuals do or should undertake but something

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:39.339
that they're doing with other people.

00:40:39.339 --> 00:40:45.269
These are some, I think, broader policy questions.

00:40:45.269 --> 00:40:51.680
These are some questions more for the foreign
language learning group.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:55.049
Some theoretical things as well.

00:40:55.049 --> 00:41:01.729
I'll just close with this, which is a line
from the book: what are humans?

00:41:01.729 --> 00:41:12.420
Are we inherently multilingual, and has that
just been squashed by the monolingual nation-state?

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:21.740
Are we looking towards some sort of post-national
utopia where the monolingual nation-states'

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:28.400
boot is being lifted from people's brains
and we're expanding back into our multilingual

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.289
right?

00:41:30.289 --> 00:41:34.920
I think that's some of why or some of what
is so fascinating about the hyperpolyglot,

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:42.259
because they seem to be these fossils from
the past, but also contain or speak to what

00:41:42.259 --> 00:41:45.959
human potential actually is and the potential
that's coming.

00:41:45.959 --> 00:41:48.119
Thanks very much.

00:41:48.119 --> 00:41:49.499
That's the end of my talk.

00:41:49.499 --> 00:41:55.099
I know people always usually have really--
want to talk and have some interesting questions,

00:41:55.099 --> 00:41:56.320
so I'm going to leave some time for that too.

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.320
[applause]

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.320
Thanks.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.259
&gt;&gt;male #1: I wanted to ask, well, I wanted
to bring up: do you think with globalization

00:42:02.259 --> 00:42:14.910
that people are going to become more multilingual
or simply settle into a few combinations?

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:18.270
[inaudible]

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:27.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Erard: I think that, so my argument
would be that you're certainly going to see

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:34.279
more hyperpolyglots, because what you have
are the proliferation environments and the

00:42:34.279 --> 00:42:38.099
proliferation of resources that people have
access to.

00:42:38.099 --> 00:42:41.349
That would give that neurology something to
work on.

00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:50.009
&gt;&gt;male #2: I guess this is a related question,
but have you seen anything about the increase

00:42:50.009 --> 00:42:57.849
or decrease in the rates of polyglots recently
with the rise of the internet and all these

00:42:57.849 --> 00:43:02.369
technologies like Google Translate, Skype,
Google+ Hangouts, things like that where it's

00:43:02.369 --> 00:43:07.499
much, much easier to build communities with
people in other countries and other languages?

00:43:07.499 --> 00:43:10.279
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: Yeah, I think it's huge.

00:43:10.279 --> 00:43:11.559
I think it's exploding.

00:43:11.559 --> 00:43:17.569
These used to be people who were isolated
from their communities and where being a hyperpolyglot,

00:43:17.569 --> 00:43:21.630
even in a multilingual community, to add one
language, to add another language brings you

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:25.170
further away from your community.

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:31.290
But the internet gives people the power and
the license such that when they learn another

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:35.959
language, they're actually becoming part of
a community.

00:43:35.959 --> 00:43:38.009
It's a broader global community.

00:43:38.009 --> 00:43:42.779
It's still imagined, it's still not there.

00:43:42.779 --> 00:43:49.079
Sometimes, and increasingly, those communities
are polyglot communities or hyperpolyglot

00:43:49.079 --> 00:43:50.079
communities.

00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:53.359
You can go on YouTube and you can search for
polyglot videos.

00:43:53.359 --> 00:44:00.460
There's a whole set of rituals and performances
that they do for each other.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.839
Quite a lot of hazing that goes on.

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:08.009
I don't know if you saw the stuff about this
16 year old kid, Tim Doner, from New York

00:44:08.009 --> 00:44:12.269
City, who was profiled in March.

00:44:12.269 --> 00:44:16.190
He claims to speak 23 languages and had done
some stuff online.

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:23.280
And the kid just got criticized up and down
by the older folks who were part of the community.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:28.740
And really hazing him in a way was a fascinating
phenomena.

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:31.279
It looks like everything has settled down.

00:44:31.279 --> 00:44:35.480
But yeah, absolutely, there are more of them.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:41.229
&gt;&gt;male #3: I'm interested in what you found
out about the decay in ability.

00:44:41.229 --> 00:44:44.989
I used to lead a team of people who had to
speak a lot of languages.

00:44:44.989 --> 00:44:48.880
We had one guy who, on his resume, was 22.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:53.509
We actually tested him with native speakers,
and he could do 10 fluently according to native

00:44:53.509 --> 00:44:54.509
speakers.

00:44:54.509 --> 00:44:55.509
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: 10 fluently?

00:44:55.509 --> 00:44:56.509
&gt;&gt;male #3: Yes.

00:44:56.509 --> 00:44:57.509
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: Yeah, well.

00:44:57.509 --> 00:44:58.509
&gt;&gt;male #3: So it seems like there's a difference.

00:44:58.509 --> 00:45:00.690
Some people have this decay and some people
don't.

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:06.910
I'd be interested in what you saw in your
research.

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:07.910
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: Yes.

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:14.670
I mean, there is the decay, and it's connected
to practice, but it's also linked to that

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:21.400
issue that people have of feeling really confident
and being able to resuscitate or reactivate

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.079
the languages with just a little bit of time.

00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:27.430
For them, it was almost like they could introspect.

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:29.739
They could feel that the language was still
there.

00:45:29.739 --> 00:45:33.549
They could get it back very easily.

00:45:33.549 --> 00:45:41.479
&gt;&gt;male #3: So out of the ones that could speak
20, how many were fluent or close to fluent

00:45:41.479 --> 00:45:44.930
in all 20, and how many had some decay after,
say, 5?

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:50.220
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: The ability to speak, to
have lots of languages activated at the same

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:55.529
time is an executive function question and
a working memory question.

00:45:55.529 --> 00:46:00.489
There seems to be an architecture to executive
function such that it just caps that ability

00:46:00.489 --> 00:46:02.589
at a certain point.

00:46:02.589 --> 00:46:09.539
I think that it's 5-9, regardless of the overall
size of the repertoire that people were limited

00:46:09.539 --> 00:46:15.820
to just on a daily basis where they don't
have to do any active, any-- maybe this gets

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:21.609
to your question-- any active study in order
to be able to speak that number of languages.

00:46:21.609 --> 00:46:24.959
In the book, I write about these two contests
that were held in Belgium.

00:46:24.959 --> 00:46:31.430
One in 1987 and one in 1990, where people
were tested in all the languages they knew.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:37.749
The two guys who won both years had some amount
of 22 languages.

00:46:37.749 --> 00:46:40.170
When I first heard that, I was like, "Oh,
that's incredible."

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:45.059
To be able to just walk into a room, have
a 10 minute conversation, 5 minute break,

00:46:45.059 --> 00:46:48.529
10 minute conversation, 5 minute break, across
22 languages.

00:46:48.529 --> 00:46:53.150
But when I actually ended up speaking to them,
it was clear that they didn't live their lives

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:54.359
like that.

00:46:54.359 --> 00:46:57.260
They had 5 or 6 languages just on a regular
basis.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:03.519
For the purposes of the contest, they had
really revved their engines up, but the next

00:47:03.519 --> 00:47:06.200
day they went back to their regular lives.

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:15.049
&gt;&gt;male #4: So it seems like both you and some
of the hyperpolyglots that you interviewed

00:47:15.049 --> 00:47:19.779
place a really high emphasis on getting speech
sounds of the language right.

00:47:19.779 --> 00:47:22.689
You talked about shadowing with Alexander,
he's like, "Do it more Italian."

00:47:22.689 --> 00:47:25.199
So if I were learning a new language, I would
think that getting the accent right would

00:47:25.199 --> 00:47:26.199
be one of the last things that I would do.

00:47:26.199 --> 00:47:27.199
Because it needs to be functional, but still
have an accent.

00:47:27.199 --> 00:47:29.459
Especially if it was a language like English,
which has tons of different accents.

00:47:29.459 --> 00:47:36.739
Can you explain why you place such a high
value on getting that accent right as one

00:47:36.739 --> 00:47:38.789
of the first steps?

00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:41.200
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: Hmm.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.119
I don't know that I would necessarily say
that.

00:47:44.119 --> 00:47:49.440
What I found that was interesting about--
When I asked the people in the survey how

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:55.359
they defined knowing a language, when they
talked about world communication, they didn't

00:47:55.359 --> 00:47:59.900
say anything about doing anything like a native
does, including pronunciation.

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:05.650
A lot of them-- People like Alexander, he'll
say, "I want to be familiar with the sounds

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:08.900
of the language, but I'm not necessarily going
to be so focused.

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.349
So what if I have an accent?"

00:48:10.349 --> 00:48:15.599
There were a couple people that said, "Actually
sounding, getting the accent really, really

00:48:15.599 --> 00:48:22.509
right before the rest of your skills are really
good can get you in some dangerous situations."

00:48:22.509 --> 00:48:28.599
So you walk in-- I can say "Bonjour" pretty
well in Quebec, like "Bonjour."

00:48:28.599 --> 00:48:35.029
"Oh, bonjour!" and [mumbles gibberish] [laughter]
So you don't want to be too good too early.

00:48:35.029 --> 00:48:40.449
&gt;&gt;male #5: I had a question about the discrete
counting of individual languages.

00:48:40.449 --> 00:48:46.440
I remind of a story of a linguistic professor
at Columbia who was asked one time, "How many

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:47.559
languages do you speak?"

00:48:47.559 --> 00:48:51.069
Taken aback, he said, "I speak all languages
of Europe."

00:48:51.069 --> 00:48:57.099
This gave me the impression that once you
learn some number, especially with related

00:48:57.099 --> 00:49:03.999
verbs like languages of Europe, then you have
some sort of understanding, insight about

00:49:03.999 --> 00:49:06.699
the rest of the languages, and you might be
able to speak one even you've never even come

00:49:06.699 --> 00:49:07.699
across before.

00:49:07.699 --> 00:49:15.420
Is that really true or do you spend a lot
of time developing some particular words to

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:16.540
each language and then you switch to some
other line?

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:21.400
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: Research shows that people
who are bilingual or multilingual, on a community

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:25.319
basis or family basis, do acquire other languages
easier.

00:49:25.319 --> 00:49:27.449
There are reasons for that.

00:49:27.449 --> 00:49:31.819
The hyperpolyglots report the same sort of
thing.

00:49:31.819 --> 00:49:38.029
It took 5 or 6 languages for them to be able
to have the additional boost.

00:49:38.029 --> 00:49:47.430
It's a matter of, okay, given this grammatical
structure, what do I anticipate also being

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:48.430
true?

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:53.020
And then basically building a little hypothesis
in your head and confirming that or not.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:54.020
&gt;&gt;male #5: So when you can speak, say, 22
languages like you were talking about, does

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:55.020
that really have any meaning?

00:49:55.020 --> 00:50:09.499
Or is this really just about being able to
speak in 22 different accents of related languages?

00:50:09.499 --> 00:50:11.145
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: Can you ask that again, because
there's a couple ways that I take that.

00:50:11.145 --> 00:50:21.329
&gt;&gt;male #5: I was just wondering what does
it really mean to say, "I speak 22 languages"

00:50:21.329 --> 00:50:22.329
versus another couple that may be very,

00:50:22.329 --> 00:50:24.989
&gt;&gt;Versus 25 or "I have 27 languages and you
only have 25, so I'm smarter than you."

00:50:24.989 --> 00:50:29.469
&gt;&gt;male #5: You may only have 16, but the rest
of them are just different accents.

00:50:29.469 --> 00:50:32.160
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: That's an incredible question.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:37.559
What's interesting is you can back that down
to smaller numbers of languages.

00:50:37.559 --> 00:50:44.369
What does it mean to say that a monolingual
English speaker-- English is this huge language

00:50:44.369 --> 00:50:48.599
that so many people have access to and they
can reproduce lots of different dialects,

00:50:48.599 --> 00:50:54.779
they can understand them, they can move up,
they can reproduce, they can talk with a lot

00:50:54.779 --> 00:50:56.689
of registers.

00:50:56.689 --> 00:50:58.650
They only have one language, though.

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:00.519
"You puny little American."

00:51:00.519 --> 00:51:03.329
But there are people who, oh, they speak 6
languages.

00:51:03.329 --> 00:51:09.210
But then you dig into that 6 and the vocabularies
in those languages are pretty small and they

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:13.799
use them for these narrow things and they
have, the languages that they speak a lot

00:51:13.799 --> 00:51:19.099
and the other ones that they say that they
know, it's very receptive.

00:51:19.099 --> 00:51:21.229
Their abilities are more receptive.

00:51:21.229 --> 00:51:28.749
So unless you dig into the complexity of what,
that's why relying on the numbers of languages

00:51:28.749 --> 00:51:34.839
is this total convenience that's really inconvenient,
or the other way around.

00:51:34.839 --> 00:51:38.759
'Cause it hides a lot more than it actually
reveals about what people have in their heads

00:51:38.759 --> 00:51:39.910
and what they're able to do.

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:47.249
&gt;&gt;male #2 again: I thought another thing that
you said that was interesting was that people

00:51:47.249 --> 00:51:52.319
like the Foreign Service Institute, the Defense
Language Institute aren't interested in polyglots.

00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:57.891
Some of the language learning that I've seen
are things like Barry Farber's "How to Learn

00:51:57.891 --> 00:51:58.891
Any Language."

00:51:58.891 --> 00:51:59.930
It sounds like this guy's at least in some
sense a hyperpolyglot.

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:04.109
He teaches you all these techniques.

00:52:04.109 --> 00:52:13.420
Are the techniques that you use really only
going to give you-- are they tuned to hyperpolyglots

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:18.440
in getting a superficial understanding, or
are the techniques he uses to learn a language

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:21.719
the same techniques that the Defense Language
Institute uses?

00:52:21.719 --> 00:52:26.640
What are the differences in the two teaching
methodologies, learning pedagogies?

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:34.839
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: I think DLI in that approach
really imagines a more, a very uniform language

00:52:34.839 --> 00:52:35.849
acquisition process.

00:52:35.849 --> 00:52:40.749
&gt;&gt;male #2: But are they doing the same things,
or are they, because they have different--

00:52:40.749 --> 00:52:44.709
Do they have different targets or are they
actually using different techniques to learn

00:52:44.709 --> 00:52:45.709
the languages?

00:52:45.709 --> 00:52:47.339
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: different targets and different
techniques.

00:52:47.339 --> 00:52:48.339
[pause]

00:52:48.339 --> 00:52:54.039
&gt;&gt;female #1: I'm curious if there is any correlations
between if you're a hyperpolyglot, if you're

00:52:54.039 --> 00:53:05.599
more sensitive with culture issues, because
they're more easily, compared to us, they're

00:53:05.599 --> 00:53:08.489
more easily to access different cultures.

00:53:08.489 --> 00:53:14.309
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: It was a question about culture.

00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:21.309
You said, given their abilities in a lot of
different languages, do they also have the

00:53:21.309 --> 00:53:25.520
same or heightened knowledge of culture as
well?

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.719
This depends.

00:53:27.719 --> 00:53:30.890
It depends on who they are and what they're
interested in.

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:35.849
Some of them are really interested in the
culture of the language, and some of them

00:53:35.849 --> 00:53:39.630
it's just-- They're learning the structure.

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:41.609
They're learning the grammar and the sounds.

00:53:41.609 --> 00:53:49.700
&gt;&gt;male #6: So you had Esperanto in the mix,
which is an artificial language.

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:53.420
Why did you not have C++ in the mix?

00:53:53.420 --> 00:54:01.509
[laughter] Or, to say it differently, programming
languages, while they are less complex in

00:54:01.509 --> 00:54:07.420
some ways than natural language, they do involve
a lot of the same cognitive involvement to

00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:08.709
actually learn them.

00:54:08.709 --> 00:54:14.380
The same techniques that have worked for learning
French work actually for learning programming

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:15.380
languages.

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:18.319
Could you talk about that a little?

00:54:18.319 --> 00:54:21.329
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: That's my next book, really.

00:54:21.329 --> 00:54:29.420
I've seen some discussions about how many
languages can people program in and stuff

00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:31.950
like that.

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:36.140
I asked people who were hyperpolyglots if
they also programmed, if they played musical

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:39.609
instruments, and there was a little bit of
overlap.

00:54:39.609 --> 00:54:42.809
Some of those questions, I don't really talk
about them that much because it seemed like

00:54:42.809 --> 00:54:49.410
people were giving the socially acceptable
answer rather than the real answer, in some

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:50.440
ways.

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:55.790
If people wanted to-- I said, "How many languages
do you know?"

00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:59.420
And I didn't get anyone who reported a programming
language.

00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:04.089
If they had, I might have put it on the--
I might have included it, but it happened

00:55:04.089 --> 00:55:07.079
very, very rarely.

00:55:07.079 --> 00:55:08.410
So there's that issue.

00:55:08.410 --> 00:55:18.229
And I think what's also interesting is-- I
think the trend towards speaking a lot of

00:55:18.229 --> 00:55:24.960
languages to some level of proficiency in
order to be able to manage your Facebook feed

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:35.170
or to manage these emerging forms of interaction,
particularly online, is really analogous to

00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:40.130
the polyglot programming thing and those arguments.

00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:44.150
Is the hyperpolyglot programmer just someone
who doesn't have a lot of languages very,

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:45.410
very well?

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:54.329
Are they failed programmers or is there a
virtuosity in their multilinguistic skills?

00:55:54.329 --> 00:55:58.549
I'd be interested in finding out more and
writing some about polyglot programming.

00:55:58.549 --> 00:56:02.859
&gt;&gt;female #2: I have a question from one of
our BC rooms dialed in.

00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:14.890
They want you to talk a little bit more about
the relationship between a language and living

00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:18.339
at a particular place.

00:56:18.339 --> 00:56:22.219
Did you find that the hyperpolyglots lived
in the places where the countries whose languages

00:56:22.219 --> 00:56:23.219
that they spoke?

00:56:23.219 --> 00:56:30.539
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: I think there's a slide about
that.

00:56:30.539 --> 00:56:36.890
[pause] It really varied.

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:40.609
Some of them had traveled extensively and
lived for long periods of time in places where

00:56:40.609 --> 00:56:43.749
there were languages that they had.

00:56:43.749 --> 00:56:50.579
But of the 17 people who had more than 11
languages, 62% of them were living in the

00:56:50.579 --> 00:56:56.460
same country where they were born, so there
was not a huge amount of mobility there.

00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:05.630
&gt;&gt;male #7: What's the highest-- or the polyglot
with the most languages who was basically

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:07.609
illiterate in all of them?

00:57:07.609 --> 00:57:10.349
Who just learned it all orally.

00:57:10.349 --> 00:57:14.190
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: Oh, that's interesting.

00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:22.569
The people that I've described in that contest
in Belgium in '87 and '90, they weren't illiterate,

00:57:22.569 --> 00:57:27.449
but they were doing oral-- they were performing
orally.

00:57:27.449 --> 00:57:29.900
In both cases 22 languages.

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:37.980
I take the second guy, his performance, to
be a little more meaningful or powerful or

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:41.630
whatever because the rules were different.

00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:43.400
The rules were stricter.

00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:50.839
In the first case, the hyperpolyglots had,
the contestants had this ability to go in

00:57:50.839 --> 00:57:54.999
and start talking about whatever they wanted
to, and the judges let them do that.

00:57:54.999 --> 00:58:01.799
In the second contest, the judges were explicitly
instructed, whatever the person starts talking,

00:58:01.799 --> 00:58:05.069
get them off that topic.

00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:09.459
They're going to just talk to their strengths,
but you want to get them, move them off.

00:58:09.459 --> 00:58:14.480
That's actually one of the ways that oral
proficiency interviews are conducted.

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:18.469
I take the second guy's performance as more
telling.

00:58:18.469 --> 00:58:20.549
So 22 languages.

00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:25.559
That doesn't get to your question exactly,
and I know we're drawing to-- but I didn't

00:58:25.559 --> 00:58:30.920
find anybody who was illiterate in all their
languages.

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:36.089
&gt;&gt;male #7: But I noticed that when you showed
the first slide with the guy's proficiency,

00:58:36.089 --> 00:58:43.400
that he was decent at Arabic but then in the
writing, he was totally illiterate, for example.

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:50.279
I don't know, I think for a lot of us, if
we're going to learn Arabic or Chinese, just

00:58:50.279 --> 00:58:51.289
screw the writing.

00:58:51.289 --> 00:58:52.529
&gt;&gt;Michael Erard: Yeah, yeah.

00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:53.529
Thank you.'

00:58:53.529 --> 00:58:53.530
[applause]
