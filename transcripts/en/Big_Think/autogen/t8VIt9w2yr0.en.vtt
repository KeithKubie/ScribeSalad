00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.039
so I guess the the thing you have to

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049
so I guess the the thing you have to
 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.950
so I guess the the thing you have to
think about in any given poker situation

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960
think about in any given poker situation
 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.629
think about in any given poker situation
is that you're dealing with a lot of

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639
is that you're dealing with a lot of
 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.709
is that you're dealing with a lot of
uncertainty and it's all about how to

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719
uncertainty and it's all about how to
 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.260
uncertainty and it's all about how to
make the best decision in any given

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270
make the best decision in any given
 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.450
make the best decision in any given
moment so the first rule of thumb is how

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460
moment so the first rule of thumb is how
 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.420
moment so the first rule of thumb is how
to extract the most money or chips from

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430
to extract the most money or chips from
 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.429
to extract the most money or chips from
your opponent when you have a strong

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439
your opponent when you have a strong
 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.650
your opponent when you have a strong
hand and how to lose the minimum when

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
hand and how to lose the minimum when
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.240
hand and how to lose the minimum when
you have a weakened you're never going

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250
you have a weakened you're never going
 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.750
you have a weakened you're never going
to be 100% certain which you know where

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760
to be 100% certain which you know where
 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.910
to be 100% certain which you know where
you are you beating them or are you do

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920
you are you beating them or are you do
 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.090
you are you beating them or are you do
you have a worse hand so you have to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100
you have a worse hand so you have to
 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.110
you have a worse hand so you have to
sort of construct a strategy that is

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120
sort of construct a strategy that is
 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.490
sort of construct a strategy that is
mathematically optimal in each situation

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500
mathematically optimal in each situation
 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.979
mathematically optimal in each situation
I guess people tend to think of

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989
I guess people tend to think of
 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.750
I guess people tend to think of
intuition as their gut their gut

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760
intuition as their gut their gut
 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.180
intuition as their gut their gut
instinct and my rule of thumb in poker

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
instinct and my rule of thumb in poker
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.130
instinct and my rule of thumb in poker
is to only fall on my gut instinct if my

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
is to only fall on my gut instinct if my
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.530
is to only fall on my gut instinct if my
sort of logical my slow brain you know

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540
sort of logical my slow brain you know
 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.120
sort of logical my slow brain you know
the system to err that sometimes called

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
the system to err that sometimes called
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.700
the system to err that sometimes called
has not come to a conclusive answer a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
has not come to a conclusive answer a
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.109
has not come to a conclusive answer a
lot of people attempted to just go oh

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119
lot of people attempted to just go oh
 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.120
lot of people attempted to just go oh
this is too tricky I don't know and then

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
this is too tricky I don't know and then
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.130
this is too tricky I don't know and then
go yep well my gut instincts said this

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140
go yep well my gut instincts said this
 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.340
go yep well my gut instincts said this
I'm going to go with that but the best

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350
I'm going to go with that but the best
 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.649
I'm going to go with that but the best
thing to do is to work with both you'll

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659
thing to do is to work with both you'll
 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.899
thing to do is to work with both you'll
feel sort of slow brain and and that gut

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909
feel sort of slow brain and and that gut
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.710
feel sort of slow brain and and that gut
so you'll say you're playing against

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
so you'll say you're playing against
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.109
so you'll say you're playing against
your opponent and you've noticed that

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119
your opponent and you've noticed that
 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.460
your opponent and you've noticed that
actually there's someone who is very

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470
actually there's someone who is very
 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.350
actually there's someone who is very
solid they never seem to Bluff

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360
solid they never seem to Bluff
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.810
solid they never seem to Bluff
and you might have a hand that you would

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820
and you might have a hand that you would
 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.580
and you might have a hand that you would
normally call with saying ninety percent

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590
normally call with saying ninety percent
 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.280
normally call with saying ninety percent
of the time but you know this guy is

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
of the time but you know this guy is
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.410
of the time but you know this guy is
just he's just bluffing never doing it

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420
just he's just bluffing never doing it
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.370
just he's just bluffing never doing it
well

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380
well
 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.319
well
actually this might be on those rare

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329
actually this might be on those rare
 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.940
actually this might be on those rare
situations where you do throw your hand

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
situations where you do throw your hand
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.710
situations where you do throw your hand
in the mark or you have a very strong

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
in the mark or you have a very strong
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.050
in the mark or you have a very strong
feeling you're just not like calling

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
feeling you're just not like calling
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.370
feeling you're just not like calling
even though mathematically it says you

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
even though mathematically it says you
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.770
even though mathematically it says you
should call you shouldn't do it so the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
should call you shouldn't do it so the
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.219
should call you shouldn't do it so the
real I guess the art part of Poker is

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
real I guess the art part of Poker is
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.389
real I guess the art part of Poker is
when you have these flashes of

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399
when you have these flashes of
 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.730
when you have these flashes of
inspiration where you need to deviate

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
inspiration where you need to deviate
 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.030
inspiration where you need to deviate
from the math and the science is knowing

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040
from the math and the science is knowing
 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.940
from the math and the science is knowing
how often you shouldn't you whether that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950
how often you shouldn't you whether that
 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.040
how often you shouldn't you whether that
deviation is the right thing to do at

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
deviation is the right thing to do at
 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.660
deviation is the right thing to do at
the time

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670
the time
 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.430
the time
when it when it comes to your intuition

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440
when it when it comes to your intuition
 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.120
when it when it comes to your intuition
as a poker player I would say do we use

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130
as a poker player I would say do we use
 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.100
as a poker player I would say do we use
it from time to time but it should not

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110
it from time to time but it should not
 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.309
it from time to time but it should not
be your your starting point you as a

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319
be your your starting point you as a
 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.410
be your your starting point you as a
rule of thumb should always go for the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420
rule of thumb should always go for the
 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.320
rule of thumb should always go for the
slow method system to analysis see what

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330
slow method system to analysis see what
 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.300
slow method system to analysis see what
answer that comes up with and then also

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310
answer that comes up with and then also
 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.310
answer that comes up with and then also
check in with your gut so you're you

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320
check in with your gut so you're you
 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.350
check in with your gut so you're you
know in a really big hand and your

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360
know in a really big hand and your
 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.229
know in a really big hand and your
opponent has bet often all I'll have an

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239
opponent has bet often all I'll have an
 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.630
opponent has bet often all I'll have an
instinctive response might might I'll be

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640
instinctive response might might I'll be
 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.580
instinctive response might might I'll be
like oh that's a bluff or all that's

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590
like oh that's a bluff or all that's
 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.350
like oh that's a bluff or all that's
that they have a really strong hand and

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360
that they have a really strong hand and
 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.780
that they have a really strong hand and
I'll make a note of it I won't just go

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790
I'll make a note of it I won't just go
 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.380
I'll make a note of it I won't just go
with that answer

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390
with that answer
 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.690
with that answer
okay now let's look work through the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700
okay now let's look work through the
 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.460
okay now let's look work through the
mathematics lips looks sort of through

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470
mathematics lips looks sort of through
 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.810
mathematics lips looks sort of through
all the other bits of information what

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820
all the other bits of information what
 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.820
all the other bits of information what
are they done in on other cards and so

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830
are they done in on other cards and so
 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.180
are they done in on other cards and so
on and then see if those two answers

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190
on and then see if those two answers
 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.509
on and then see if those two answers
match up now if they both match up great

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519
match up now if they both match up great
 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.520
match up now if they both match up great
I've got a got an easy decision but if

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530
I've got a got an easy decision but if
 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.680
I've got a got an easy decision but if
one is giving a conflicting answer to

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690
one is giving a conflicting answer to
 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.470
one is giving a conflicting answer to
the other then usually you tend to rely

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480
the other then usually you tend to rely
 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.020
the other then usually you tend to rely
on the sort of mathematics the majek

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030
on the sort of mathematics the majek
 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.350
on the sort of mathematics the majek
part however it's still really really

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360
part however it's still really really
 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.090
part however it's still really really
close with the mathematics then I'll

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100
close with the mathematics then I'll
 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.930
close with the mathematics then I'll
fall back on on that gut instinct but as

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940
fall back on on that gut instinct but as
 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.259
fall back on on that gut instinct but as
a rule of thumb your gut is not as

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269
a rule of thumb your gut is not as
 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.600
a rule of thumb your gut is not as
reliable as you think you you can see

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610
reliable as you think you you can see
 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.110
reliable as you think you you can see
these things like means on the Internet

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120
these things like means on the Internet
 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.640
these things like means on the Internet
which is like always going with your gut

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650
which is like always going with your gut
 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.530
which is like always going with your gut
trust your instincts and so on and I

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540
trust your instincts and so on and I
 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.240
trust your instincts and so on and I
personally think that's a cop-out I

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250
personally think that's a cop-out I
 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.699
personally think that's a cop-out I
think that's often the lazy way out so

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709
think that's often the lazy way out so
 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.460
think that's often the lazy way out so
just be when when we are faced with a

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470
just be when when we are faced with a
 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.680
just be when when we are faced with a
really tough decision in life or just

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690
really tough decision in life or just
 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.220
really tough decision in life or just

going oh well you know on taxing our

brains are are very they love to like to

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730
brains are are very they love to like to
 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.250
brains are are very they love to like to
simplify things to do things in black

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260
