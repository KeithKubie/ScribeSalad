00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The answer is 6. We apply this action over here 3 times--1, 2, 3.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We're at this section over here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now we apply the left turn and go forward action, which is the center action over here.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We end facing over here. That's the fourth. Then we go straight again twice.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This action over here--5 and 6.

00:00:17.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So we get a total of 6, as opposed to 7 when we counted the turning separately.
