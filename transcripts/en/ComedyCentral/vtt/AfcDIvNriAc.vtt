Fwap!

00:00:04.136 --> 00:00:07.540
(man)
I thought for sure that was
gonna end in a face-plant.

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:08.608
Oh!

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:09.842 align:start position:0%
(man)
Almost hit the seat.

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:11.177
I don't even know how
the [bleep] I just fell.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.046
- You get that on video?
- Got it.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.213 align:start position:0%
(woman)
What happened?

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:16.516
I just completely [bleep].

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:18.651
Are her breast okay?

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:21.521
The Knicks are gonna
love her next season.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:24.057
That tomahawking tomboy
is Jackie,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.825
and when she tried
to be one of the guys,

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:28.227
she took a steel chair
to the clam.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.198
The only thing chicks
should be dunking is fondue.

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:34.867
Now, before you gals get
your torches and pitchforks,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.769
remember that I pee
sitting down,

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:40.006
so I'm allowed to say
whatever I want about women.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.909
Is it even okay to call someone
a tomboy anymore?

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:46.379
I think the correct term now
is "gross."

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:49.082
There's a reason Brittney Griner
doesn't get endorsement deals

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:50.917
but Maria Sharapova does.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.552
One of those monsters
isn't afraid

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.221
of a few highlights
and some blush.

00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:56.856
I'm not threatened by the idea

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.992
of a tomboy being better than me
at chopping firewood

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:01.294
or fixing a car

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.062
or [bleep] pussy.

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:04.831
I'd just never want to date one

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.666
because I don't like the idea
of constantly having

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.601
to high-five my girlfriend.

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:10.369
But if Jackie wants to bro out,

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:11.671
I'll fly her to Hollywood,

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:14.006
where impressing men
is the only thing that matters,

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.408
in this week's Web Redemption.

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.480

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:38.865

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.204 align:end position:100%

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:48.307

Where's that?

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:50.810

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:52.578 align:end position:100%
By Sacramento.
Which direction?

00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:53.813
North.

00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:55.148 align:end position:100%
Oh, you're not good
with geography at all?

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.116
- No.
- North? Toward Chico?

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.851
- No, south.
- South?

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:01.154
- South.
- Toward Los Angeles.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:03.055
Down.
So north.

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:04.257
So south.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.858
- Down is south.
- Yeah, yeah, it's south.

00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:06.959 align:start size:38% position:63%
Up is north.

00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:08.060
This is crazy.

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:09.562 align:end position:100%
All right,
what went wrong?

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:13.199
I missed the chair.

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:14.300
Oh!

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:15.902 align:start size:56% position:44%
What dunk were you
planning on doing?

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:18.037
Getting the ball
into the hoop.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.972
- Did you wreck your hoo-ha?
- No.

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:21.407
- Your...[whistles]
- No.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.975
- Your vrrr.
- No.

00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:24.110 align:end position:100%
Who was the guy
that kind of gave you

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:25.211 align:start size:81% position:19%
the creepy hug at the end?

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:26.345
(Jackie)
That'd be my ex-boyfriend.

00:02:26.378 --> 00:02:27.613
- Your ex-boyfriend?
- Yes.

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:29.148 align:end position:100%
Was he your current boyfriend
during the video?

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:30.316 align:start position:0%
No, he wasn't,
actually.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.317
Oh, so you guys
still touch.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.318
[laughs]
No.

00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:33.319
When you see
your ex-boyfriend,

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:34.320
do you hug him
or kiss him?

00:02:34.353 --> 00:02:35.454
No.

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:37.423 align:end position:100%
I see my ex-girlfriend,
I'm 50/50.

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:39.258
One of 'em,
I'll give her a kiss.

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:40.960 align:end position:100%
Like a kiss on the cheek,
I'll do that.

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:42.562
One of 'em I'm just
never seeing again.

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:44.096 align:end position:100%
Like, I don't know.
She might be dead.

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.698 align:end position:100%
Why were you only
hanging out with dudes?

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:47.767
Are you one of those chicks that
doesn't have any girlfriends?

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.202
I have two girlfriends.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.903
- And the rest dudes?
- Yes.

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:53.105
- Why is that?
- Girls are crazy.

00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:55.141
That's only what girls that
only hang out with dudes say.

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:56.943 align:start position:0%
[laughs]
Yes.

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:58.044
What do you do
for a living?

00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.245
- I work at Rubio's.
- Rubio's?

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:00.213 align:start position:0%
Mm-hmm.

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:01.214 align:end position:100%
What do you do
at Rubio's?

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:02.281
I'm a shift leader.

00:03:02.314 --> 00:03:03.282
A shift leader?

00:03:03.315 --> 00:03:04.383 align:start size:78% position:22%
You just made up a title.

00:03:04.416 --> 00:03:05.685
- No, that's what I--
- Shift leader.

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:07.453
- That's what I am.
- "I'm a shift leader."

00:03:07.486 --> 00:03:08.621 align:end position:100%
What does that entail,
leading people?

00:03:08.654 --> 00:03:09.822 align:start position:0%
Managing, yeah, mm-hmm.

00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:11.457

- Yeah, manager.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.658 align:start size:66% position:34%

00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:13.960

- Clean?

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:14.994 align:start position:0%

00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:16.028 align:end position:100%
You got to keep
a salsa bar clean.

00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:17.196 align:start position:0%
Oh, yes.

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:18.431 align:end position:100%
Maybe I'll sell
this Lady Foot Locker

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:19.565 align:start size:72% position:28%
and buy into a Rubio's.

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:21.000 align:start size:56% position:44%

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:24.003 align:end position:100%

Not bad.

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:26.305
What's the most athletic thing
you've ever done?

00:03:26.338 --> 00:03:27.473
Run.

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:29.242
What's the farthest
you've ever ran?

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:30.443
Couple miles.

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.478 align:end position:100%
I've ran
14 marathons...

00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:34.413
- Wow.
- In one week.

00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:35.681
Not in one week.

00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:37.083 align:start size:31% position:69%
I could've

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.351 align:start size:72% position:28%
if I put my mind to it.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:39.385 align:start size:53% position:47%

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.721 align:start position:0%
Yep, exactly.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:43.256
They say women can do
everything men can do,

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:45.224
but you proved,
on jumping alone,

00:03:45.257 --> 00:03:47.960 align:end position:100%

made up by a chick.

00:03:47.993 --> 00:03:48.961 align:start position:0%
