Now that you've had a chance to graph, it's my turn. Let's see if I can do this

00:00:03.806 --> 00:00:07.650
right. Because it works better for my brain, I've transferred all the data on

00:00:07.662 --> 00:00:11.589
the table to coordinate notation on the right-hand side of the table. That just

00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:15.549
helps me graph better, personally. So, I'm going to plot these points. We step

00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:18.921
over 3 in the negative direction on the x-axis, and down 14. Now, you want to

00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:23.353
make sure that the points, when you graph them on graph paper, as we saw in the

00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:27.357
previous example, are as accurately placed as possible. So luckily, for the

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.444
scale that we've chosen for this graph and this equation, all of these points

00:00:31.456 --> 00:00:35.630
should lie directly on intersection points of vertical and horizontal lines on

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:39.937
the graph paper. So, that's awesome. Negative 2, negative 11, and you can see I

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.842
just made a mistake again. I forgot that we were counting by two's in the y

00:00:43.854 --> 00:00:48.137
direction, and I placed a point at 2,2 instead of 2,1. So, I've graphed a fair

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.092
number of graphs in my life. So, if you make a mistake doing this, it's not a

00:00:52.104 --> 00:00:56.196
big deal at all. We just have to make sure we correct ourselves. And lastly, we

00:00:56.208 --> 00:01:00.806
have 3,4. Okay, great. These look to me like they're all in a pretty straight

00:01:00.818 --> 00:01:05.224
line, so let's get our ruler to make sure. I think we're safe. Let's connect

00:01:05.236 --> 00:01:09.667
them. And we have a gorgeous line that I will now draw an arrow on either end

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:13.985
of. Remember, this arrow shows this line is extending forever out in either

00:01:13.997 --> 00:01:18.565
direction, continuing its pattern for all values of x. I've also drawn an arrow

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:22.188
on either end of this line to show that it extends forever out in both

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.793
directions.
