00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.220
Okay, let's look at the solution. What about optimized

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.480
app code? Well that's about making the code actually

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.760
run faster. App stats is the best option for

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.530
that. What about reduced latency for static content? Well doing

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.500
this would involve reducing the latency to the user.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.980
A perfect example of edge caching. What about making your

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.830
app more responsive? Well, certainly queues could be an

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.460
option here to reduce the amount of time spent when

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.920
you process the request. But that could also

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.780
achieved using automatic scaling parameters, and of course mem

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.405
cache to serve content from memory instead of

00:00:34.405 --> 00:00:38.990
datastore. What about reducing datastore reads? Well certainly, mem

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.750
cache would help out here, but edge caching

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.750
could also be an option if the content is

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.050
suitable for that. What about improving performance as

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.497
user base grows? Well, that's a clear cut scaling

00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:55.320
out problem, so automatic scaling. All right, I hope you did well. And this quiz

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.480
has no exact answers. So be sure to discuss this in the forums as well.
