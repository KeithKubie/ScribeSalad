00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:08.441
( applause )

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.944 line:0%
As a kid I used to
dream about the oceans.

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:14.614 line:0%
It was this wild place
full of color and life.

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:18.985
<i> Home to these alien-looking
 fantastical creatures.</i>

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:22.221
<i> I pictured massive sharks
 ruling the food chain</i>

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:25.358
<i> and graceful sea turtles
 dancing across coral reefs.</i>

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:27.994
As a marine biologist
turned photographer,

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:31.231
I've spent most of my
career looking for places

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:34.167
<i> as magical as those I used to
 dream about when I was little.</i>

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.802
<i> And it's this
 journey that</i>

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:37.837
<i> I wish to share with
 you all this evening.</i>

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.172
( audience laughter )

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:40.840
<i> So, one of the
 most common</i>

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.076
<i> questions I receive
 from people is,</i>

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:46.445
<i> "What is the most terrifying
 moment of your career?"</i>

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:49.015
<i> Now, being in my
 shoes at this moment</i>

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:51.217
<i> must be really,
 really, really scary.</i>

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:53.619
<i> And, you know, I'll be
 honest, I am scared.</i>

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.521
I'm scared of over-exposing

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:58.024
-I'm scared of under-exposing
-( audience laughter )

00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:00.293
I'm scared of getting
the sharks out of focus

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:01.828
and I'm scared that
my editors are

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:04.531
not going to like a single
picture that I'm taking.

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:05.831
The sharks...

00:01:06.398 --> 00:01:08.634
they are probably the least
of my concern right now.

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:10.603
<i> And, you know, remember
 these are pretty small sharks</i>

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:11.837
<i> six foot at the most.</i>

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:15.575
So, if sharks are not the
scariest part of my job,

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:16.575
well, what is?

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:19.179
There's one creature
that if it congregates

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:22.881
in large enough numbers, it
scares the crap out of me.

00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:24.651
And this is what these
creatures look like.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.986
( audience roaring
with laughter )

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:30.255
<i> The scariest moments of
 my photographic career</i>

00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:32.157
are without a camera, on a stage

00:01:32.157 --> 00:01:33.826
looking over an ocean of people.

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:35.194
You know, give me a white shark

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:38.164
or a<i> Sharknado</i> any
day of the week.

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.199
( audience laughter )

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.901
But I'm getting ahead of myself
here, way ahead of myself.

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.837
And like with any good story,
I think we have to begin

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.272
<i> right at the beginning.</i>

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.777
<i>Now I began exploring bodies of
 water at a fairly young age.</i>

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.077
-( audience laughter )
<i> -Hey!</i>

00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:54.179
<i> They were a lot smaller than
 the ones I explore now</i>

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:55.882
<i> but at that stage, I
 thought, you know</i>

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.316
<i> they were probably
 as exciting as</i>

00:01:57.316 --> 00:02:00.153
<i>the Indian Ocean and the Pacific
 Ocean are for me today.</i>

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:01.954
<i> Let's fast forward.</i>

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:05.792
<i>Today my photography is largely
 anchored in conservation.</i>

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.460
<i> And, you know, with
 conservation photography</i>

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.561
<i> you have two approaches.</i>

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:10.796
I call it "the carrot and
the stick" approach.

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:12.398
<i> On the one hand, you
 can showcase them</i>

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:15.968
<i>the most amazing places on this
planet and make them go, "Wow!"</i>

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:17.403
<i> I could not believe
 a place like</i>

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:19.272
<i> St. Joseph Atoll
 could exist.</i>

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:20.973
<i> And hopefully they make
 a connection with it.</i>

00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:21.974
<i> So, for half the year,</i>

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:23.876
<i> I have this incredible
 privilege to document</i>

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:27.680
<i> some of the most amazing
 marine realms on our planet.</i>

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.414
<i> However as a
 photojournalist,</i>

00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:31.751
I need to document the reality

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:33.386
of our relationship
with the oceans.

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:36.355
So, for the other half of
the year, I document, what I

00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:37.823
<i> sort of call the darker side</i>

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:39.258
<i> of our relationship
 with the sea.</i>

00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:40.560
<i> Whether it's over-fishing</i>

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.662
<i> the impacts of climate
 change or oil-spills.</i>

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:44.998
But I always feel like I
walk a very fine line

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.567
between inspiring
and disturbing.

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:50.069
When young photographers
always ask me,

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.806
"What is, sort of, number
one tip you can give me?"

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:56.175
I always say, "Begin
in your backyard."

00:02:56.842 --> 00:02:59.245
Begin with a subject
and a place that

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:00.947
you are intimately
familiar with

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:04.650
and a place that you can go back
to again and again and again.

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:08.120
In South Africa, I had a
pretty sexy backyard.

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:10.957
I mean, I was lucky.

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:14.260
And my first, sort of, real
reportage story was about

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.661
<i> great white sharks.</i>

00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:17.997
<i> You know, 12 years ago, I
 mean, when I shot this</i>

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:20.199
<i> this was the, sort of,
 standard white shark image.</i>

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.469
<i> You know, focus on the teeth,
aggressive, dangerous, wild and</i>

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.672
<i> these sort of pictures
 are easy to take.</i>

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:29.809
However, the more time I
spent out at sea with them

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:32.344
the less I felt that that
picture was accurate.

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:35.615
Instead of the aggressive, you
know, dangerous white shark,

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:40.252
<i>I was seeing an inquisitive, and
 very often, curious creature.</i>

00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:42.154
The image that follows
is the one picture

00:03:42.154 --> 00:03:44.891
that I think best represents
the white shark to me.

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.194
<i> And this was taken on one of
 those wonderful winter days</i>

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:50.696
<i> the water was clear, the
 sea was calm and you know</i>

00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:52.966
<i> this white shark came across
 this little box-jellyfish.</i>

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:54.634
<i> And, I thought
 it would either</i>

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:56.202
<i> swim through it
 or just ignore it</i>

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:59.171
<i>and for a few seconds this white
 shark actually almost hovered.</i>

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:02.408
<i> As if it was transfixed by
 the light on the tentacle</i>

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.943
<i> and it just kinda, you
 know, hovered there</i>

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:05.811
<i> and just looked,
 as if going</i>

00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:07.146
<i> "Hello, what are you?"</i>

00:04:07.613 --> 00:04:10.383
And, you know, after she had
satisfied her curiosity

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:12.151
that's a three and half
year female by the way

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:14.152
she just kind of, you
know, turned back

00:04:14.152 --> 00:04:15.788
and went back into the depths.

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:19.658
And that is, sort of,
how I know great whites,

00:04:19.658 --> 00:04:22.228
not with the images before.

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:25.398
<i> My next reportage was also
 in Southern Africa again.</i>

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:28.400
<i> But the focus here
 is on sardines.</i>

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.336
<i> Now, sardines are
 a cold water fish</i>

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:32.171
<i> and they prefer the
 west and south coast</i>

00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:33.673
<i> where the water
 is colder.</i>

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:36.209
<i> However, once a year
 something unusual happens.</i>

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:38.210
We have this warm current
on the east coast

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.611
called the Agulhas current.

00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:42.048
And, once a year it
kind of moves offshore.

00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:45.685
<i>And these sardines migrate with
 this cold water northwards.</i>

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:47.219
<i> And we call this
 the "sardine run".</i>

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:49.989
<i>And, you know, sardines, heavily
 over-fished over the years</i>

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:50.990
<i> and this is a
 species that</i>

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.559
<i> really needs the
 conservation attention but</i>

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:56.428
<i> everyone thinks it
 lives in tin cans.</i>

00:04:56.428 --> 00:04:58.698
It's not just the fishing fleets
that follow these sardines.

00:04:58.698 --> 00:04:59.999
<i> There's a whole
 suite of predators</i>

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.633
<i> that follows
 them as well.</i>

00:05:01.633 --> 00:05:03.936
<i> Common dolphins,
 they carve</i>

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:07.106
<i> smaller pieces of sardines
 off the massive shoals</i>

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:09.709
<i> and they pin and herd
 them up to the surface.</i>

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:11.443
<i> And, you know,
 there they form</i>

00:05:11.743 --> 00:05:13.946
<i> the holy grail for
 all photographers.</i>

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:15.114
<i> The bait ball.</i>

00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:19.152
<i> I've done the run for eight
 years. I've seen three.</i>

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.654
<i> So, the dolphins
 herd the sardines</i>

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:24.023
<i> and they take turns, you
 know, one after the other</i>

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:26.125
<i> they'll rush in grab a
 sardine and swim out</i>

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:27.359
<i> and take turns like that</i>

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:28.961
<i> amazing cooperative
 behavior there.</i>

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:31.197
But for me, sardine run

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:33.065
it's all about sharks.

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:34.066
<i> Now, when there's no dolphins,</i>

00:05:34.066 --> 00:05:35.768
<i> these sharks
 have a really hard time.</i>

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:38.004
<i> They get sardine donuts,
 as we call them.</i>

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:40.440
<i> Mouths full of water
 most of the time.</i>

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.974
<i> When the dolphins
 are there</i>

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:44.476
<i> the sardines tend to be herded
 together much more closely.</i>

00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:45.978
Working with sharks on the run

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:48.381
is a little bit spicy at times.

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:51.783
<i> Especially, at the end when
 there's very few sardines left</i>

00:05:51.783 --> 00:05:53.886
<i> they treat you like
 another shark.</i>

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:57.289
<i> So, you get bumped and hit
 probably every ten-seconds.</i>

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:58.891
And if you want to
get good pictures

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:00.927
you just have to ignore the
sharks knocking into you.

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:02.928
<i> Most of the time I know
 I'm not on the menu.</i>

00:06:02.928 --> 00:06:04.463
<i> These sharks feed
 on small sardines.</i>

00:06:04.463 --> 00:06:05.497
<i> But I had two encounters,</i>

00:06:05.497 --> 00:06:08.634
one, I had a large dusky
shark rip-off my fin

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:11.103
and swim away with it.
What's that all about?

00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:12.838
Why does that shark
need another fin, I...

00:06:12.838 --> 00:06:14.006
( audience laughter )

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:15.174
I have no idea.

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:19.011
And then another one, I had
two bronze whaler sharks

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:20.946
each hanging on to my
underwater strobes

00:06:20.946 --> 00:06:22.749
and I felt like a
Ukrainian weight-lifter.

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.183
-( audience laughter )
-I was trying to punch...

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:27.220
They obviously like,
when the strobe recycles

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.954
there seems to be an
electro-current that kind of

00:06:28.954 --> 00:06:30.122
you know, gets
pushed out, so they

00:06:30.522 --> 00:06:32.592
they love biting
on those things.

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:35.661
<i> This is my favorite
 sardine run photograph.</i>

00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:37.663
<i> For two reasons. One,
 it was in clear water</i>

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:40.399
<i>and you know, it looks like the
shark is inhaling the sardines.</i>

00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:42.568
<i> And right after
 this, he basically</i>

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:43.970
<i> swings around and
 comes at me.</i>

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.071
<i>You can see these little sardine
 heads and tails sticking out</i>

00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:47.573
<i> it's like an
 over-stuffed suitcase</i>

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:48.807
<i> with the clothes
 hanging out.</i>

00:06:48.807 --> 00:06:51.344
<i> That's what that reminded me
 of, it's just one of those</i>

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:53.446
<i> you know, interesting
 visual scenes there.</i>

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:54.947
<i> But, yeah, you know,
 that's one of those images</i>

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:57.649
<i> you know, once every eight
 years, if you're lucky.</i>

00:06:57.649 --> 00:06:59.618
<i> At the end of the,
 you know, bait ball</i>

00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:01.921
<i> when there's few sardines
 left, where do they wanna go?</i>

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:04.791
<i> In between your legs, under
 your arms, around your head.</i>

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.625
<i> The sardines are seeking
 shelter around you.</i>

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:07.793
( audience laughter )

00:07:07.793 --> 00:07:09.929
<i> Which is a really,
 really bad place to be</i>

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:10.996
<i> not just because
 of the sharks.</i>

00:07:10.996 --> 00:07:12.998
<i> And there's actually a
 bigger danger on the run.</i>

00:07:12.998 --> 00:07:15.201
I'm photographing and I'm
looking at screen at something

00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:18.304
and as I look up, all
the predators are gone.

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:19.938
<i> You know, it's just
 me and the sardines</i>

00:07:19.938 --> 00:07:21.173
<i> and we're looking
 at each other going,</i>

00:07:21.173 --> 00:07:22.374
<i> "What just happened?"</i>

00:07:22.374 --> 00:07:24.042
<i> You know, they're too stunned
 to actually swim away</i>

00:07:24.042 --> 00:07:25.144
<i> 'cause they don't
 know what's going on.</i>

00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:26.245
<i> That just doesn't happen.</i>

00:07:26.412 --> 00:07:29.014
<i> Instinct kicks in and I go,
"I'm going where they've gone."</i>

00:07:29.014 --> 00:07:31.184
I am back-paddling, I'm swimming
out of the bait ball and...

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:34.419
<i> this guy comes rocketing
 out of nowhere.</i>

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:36.856
-( audience gasping )
<i> -It's a Bryde's whale, and...</i>

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:38.958
<i> He comes up and
 he pretty much</i>

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.593
<i> in front of me, swallows
 the entire bait ball.</i>

00:07:41.593 --> 00:07:43.428
-( audience laughter )
<i> -All. Done.</i>

00:07:43.428 --> 00:07:44.797
I'm probably a foot or two away

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:47.199
and as he does that
he arches upwards

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:49.035
and then he pretty much
just leaves the water.

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:50.937
<i> I mean, they have
 all this energy</i>

00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:52.137
<i> and he leaps out
 of the water</i>

00:07:52.137 --> 00:07:55.340
two-thirds come up and
I am, more or less

00:07:55.807 --> 00:07:58.343
right at the left where the
sardine is leaping out.

00:07:58.343 --> 00:07:59.479
And...

00:08:00.679 --> 00:08:02.281
I'm going, "Oh, crap..."

00:08:02.948 --> 00:08:04.183
So, I curl into this little ball

00:08:04.183 --> 00:08:06.552
and I'm waiting for the sound
of hearing my own bones break.

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:08.387
But I've been trained well.

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:10.756
-I'm still shooting.
-( audience laughter )

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:12.825
And the next picture I
have no recollection.

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:14.226
I have no memory,
but I have this.

00:08:14.226 --> 00:08:15.928
( audience gasping )

00:08:16.328 --> 00:08:18.030
<i> So, this is all the
 water streaming</i>

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.798
<i> out of the Bryde's
 whale's mouth.</i>

00:08:19.798 --> 00:08:21.400
<i> And, I don't remember this.</i>

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.601
<i> Somebody else could
 have taken this.</i>

00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:24.236
<i> It was in my camera at
 the end of the day.</i>

00:08:25.003 --> 00:08:27.640
<i> It's very hard to see,
 you know, in stills.</i>

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.175
<i> So this is sort of, some video
 of a colleague of mine.</i>

00:08:30.175 --> 00:08:32.111
<i> You get the idea
 of the whole...</i>

00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:35.581
<i> how quick and how crazy
 that bait ball actually is.</i>

00:08:37.783 --> 00:08:40.118
<i> Imagine trying to get
 still pictures in that.</i>

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:42.755
<i> And you have to be where
 those sharks are.</i>

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:45.358
<i> You have to be one of those
 sharks, to get the pictures.</i>

00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.794
<i> So, it gets a bit
 crazy at times but...</i>

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:51.964
<i> And this is where the
 birds are just, you know</i>

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:55.534
<i> -using their wings and...</i>
-( audience laughter )

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:57.136
<i> Couple of sharks.</i>

00:08:57.136 --> 00:09:01.206
( music )

00:09:01.206 --> 00:09:03.709
<i> And here comes the
 Bryde's whale.</i>

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.078
( music )

00:09:08.914 --> 00:09:10.749
So, now you get
an idea, sort of,

00:09:10.749 --> 00:09:11.917
what your environment
is like.

00:09:11.917 --> 00:09:13.152
And you sort of just have to...

00:09:14.553 --> 00:09:15.921
have to just, you know

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:19.424
forget about all that stuff and
just focus on the task at hand

00:09:19.424 --> 00:09:20.760
which is getting great images.
