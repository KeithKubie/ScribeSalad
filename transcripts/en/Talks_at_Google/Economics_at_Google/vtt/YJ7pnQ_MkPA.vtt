IAN GOLDIN: Thank you very much.

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:10.940
It's a huge pleasure to be here.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.280
Thank you for coming to this
talk on such a glorious day.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.710
It's very tempting
to be outside.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.890
But I think that development
is the most important subject

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.800
in the world.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.110
And so, I'm glad you
have prioritized it,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.210
at least for your lunchtime.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.299
It's important because
it's not only about what

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.940
happens with other people.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.220
I think, in the end,
it's about ourselves

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.890
and who we are as people.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.230
And what I try
and convey in this

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.840
"Very Short Introduction"
is everything

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.020
I know about development
in 40,000 words, which

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.700
is about 30-something
years of my life and career

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.900
working in development.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.730
I've been fortunate to work
in many, many different roles

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.200
in this.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.489
I've worked for
development agencies.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.780
I've worked for the World Bank.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.950
I've worked for the European
Bank for reconstruction

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.616
and development.

00:01:08.616 --> 00:01:11.330
I was head of policy for
the World Bank Group.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.210
And I've also been on the
other side of the table.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.790
I've negotiated on
behalf of countries

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.080
with the international agencies.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.810
And I was in the South African
government as Nelson Mandela's

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.830
economic advisor, and
ran the State Development

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.170
Bank for Southern Africa
owned by the South

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.060
African government.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.580
And so, it was really
a delight to be

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.740
asked by OUP to write this
short book, but a big challenge.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.400
A big challenge because
as much as we've

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.850
learned over the
last 70-plus years

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.270
about why some people are rich
and why some people are poor,

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.820
and why some countries are
rich and some countries poor,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.120
why development takes
off and then reverses

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.650
and how to achieve it,
what's extraordinary

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.820
is how much we don't know.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.210
And how difficult development
remains, how intractable

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.100
it remains in some places
despite the quite extraordinary

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.570
advances.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.510
And so one has to
approach this subject,

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.740
I think, with a
degree of humbleness

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.420
because each case is different.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.457
There's no cookie cutter,
and there's certainly

00:02:26.457 --> 00:02:27.540
no recipe for development.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.660
If it was so simple,
the whole world

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.930
would have escaped
poverty and we wouldn't

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.540
be having this conversation.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.640
At the same time, we can
celebrate huge success

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.840
with development.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.350
There have been the most
extraordinary achievements

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.780
in my lifetime and, many
of you younger than me,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.060
in your lifetimes.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.340
And so, there must
be some things

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.200
we can learn from all of this.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.850
There must be some takeaways.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.420
And what the book tries to
do is strike this balance

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.560
between not wanting to
imply that there's a recipe,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.510
but also not wanting to imply
that we haven't learned.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.560
For those that are curious,
this is a wonderful subject

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.410
because there's so much
evidence out there--

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.890
the world's 200-plus
countries and their experience

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.530
over the last hundreds of years.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.700
But there's also massive
uncertainties and questions

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.430
going forward which
remain unresolved.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.500
And so, I would
encourage anyone that's

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.230
interested in development
to remain interested and not

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.060
think that in any
way, tick that box,

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.300
there's nothing to add because
everyone has much to add.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.310
And I think it's particularly
interesting being in Google

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.160
because one of the
great, great questions

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.090
is, how will technological
change impact

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.330
on development going forward?

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.480
And I'll say
something about that,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.460
but we know very
little about it.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.060
And I certainly don't
subscribe to some people

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.290
in Silicon Valley's view.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.900
Not of the sensible people in
Google, of course, which is,

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.110
I guess, best articulated in
a book which I better not name

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.046
which suggested that there's
no problem an app cannot solve.

00:04:19.046 --> 00:04:22.580
In other words, technology
will be the panacea

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.840
that cures the world's problems,
whether it's climate or water

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.640
or poverty, et cetera.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.030
At the same time,
there's massive advances

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.350
that technology can
certainly offer.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.470
And we need to think about
this very, very carefully.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.150
So for me, the great
revelation was, of course,

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.950
having been exiled
from South Africa,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.640
thinking I would never
go back in my lifetime,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.420
living in London and
Paris, to discover

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.680
how quickly change can happen.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.440
Two months after the
Berlin Wall came down,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.760
Nelson Mandela was released
after 27 years in prison.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.600
And I never thought I would
have that event in my lifetime.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.060
I thought South Africa was in
an intractable bloody civil war

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.010
for the future.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.700
And that dramatic change
changed my life, too,

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.430
because I then went
back and worked with him

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.120
for the next seven years.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.450
Now, these tipping points,
these rapid changes,

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.360
are clearly both
about the forces

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.620
that are happening in individual
countries, but also elsewhere.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.130
And so, one of the
great, great challenges

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.320
is understanding the
interconnectedness

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.970
between changes in one place
and changes in another.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.440
And that is getting
more complex.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.340
Within five years
of the Berlin Wall,

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.030
dictatorships across
the world fell.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.030
Latin America, Africa,
and Asia, which

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:04.830
had been largely autocratic,
became largely democratic

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.880
over a very short
period of time.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.380
Not because of things that
they were doing, necessarily,

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.370
although that no doubt
contributed, but from things

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.080
that were happening in Europe.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.740
Big change.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.830
And the story of the interaction
between policies in one country

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.990
or one set of countries
and what happens

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.590
is, of course, a very old story
in development-- colonialism,

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.960
imperialism being
part of that problem.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.510
So you can fight
as hard as you want

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.580
for change in your
country, and I believe

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:40.090
people should be fighting
for that, but what others do

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.690
and how the world behaves
matters desperately as well.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.770
And that's why we are all
responsible for development,

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.970
because what the UK
does or what the US does

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.500
or what Google does
really does matter

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.220
to the prospects for people's
lives in other places,

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.490
consciously and unconsciously.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.700
Now, one of the most
other dramatic effects

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.390
of this tumbling down of
walls and of the growth

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.540
of the internet and
interconnectedness

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.000
has been this
extraordinary story

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.600
of the improvement of life
expectancy around the world.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.390
And that's because
ideas are traveling

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.840
more rapidly, more quickly,
to more places than ever

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.010
in history.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.260
And ideas are the
driving force of history.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.570
It's what makes the
difference between how

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.720
one used to do things and
how one can do things.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.885
And that imagination
about what the future is

00:07:42.885 --> 00:07:46.590
is what drives
development ambitions.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.960
If you do a thought experiment
and try and think about

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:55.230
why is North Korea now 10%
of the income of South Korea

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.070
when they were at the same
income levels 60 years ago?

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:03.990
The answer has to be because
their ideas are different,

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.540
and the way that those
are being operationalized

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.600
in their country.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.380
Same people.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.740
No cultural differences
or other differences

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.540
between these people.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.730
And the same story could
be told, for example,

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:19.590
of East and West Germany and
their very, very different

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.210
living standards, et cetera.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.990
But we should be careful not to
fall into the trap that says,

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.030
oh, well, one is simply market
forces and the other is not.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.900
Cuba has a higher average
life expectancy than the US,

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.230
although it's only got 20% of
its average per capita income

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.940
levels.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.880
So it's not simply
about markets.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.540
It's about how much
countries prioritize things,

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.820
what their policies are, that
really does make a difference.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.080
But if you're feeling that
policy doesn't matter,

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.360
just do these sorts of
thought experiments.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.310
And I talk about some
of them in the book.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.820
Ghana and South Korea used to
have the same incomes in 1965.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.270
In fact, Ghana was
wealthier than South Korea.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:07.280
Today, South Korea
has an income which

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.700
is 14 times that of Ghana.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.030
Argentina used to be the fifth
richest country in the world.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.890
Today it is the 65th.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.160
What's happened?

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.200
Why is this the case?

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.520
Those are the sorts of
things I explore in the book.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.390
And bad policies have
a lot to do with it.

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.260
By policies, I
mean the decisions

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.170
that governments make regarding
the key drivers of development.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:38.550
And they are health, education,
infrastructure, the hardware,

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.560
and the software.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.990
And it's that, judicial
systems, rule of law

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:47.640
that really make an
enormous difference.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.380
Now, because ideas are traveling
more rapidly around the world,

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.640
there are some things which
are sometimes slightly

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.460
independent of national policy.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.410
And life expectancy is
broadly, although there

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.980
are some major
exceptions, like that.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.470
So average life expectancy
has increased in the world

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.220
by about 20 years over
the past 40 years.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.460
It took from the
Stone Age to the 1960s

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:15.900
to get that sort of
improvement in life expectancy.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.270
And it's because ideas
have traveled more rapidly,

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.140
particularly since about
1990, and then the late '90s

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.210
with the development
of the internet.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.970
Very simple ideas,
like washing your hands

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.410
prevents contagious diseases.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:29.730
Smoking kills you.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.430
Wearing a safety
belt saves your life.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.170
Those sorts of ideas.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.150
And very, very
complex ideas, like

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.940
those embedded in
vaccines and new cures

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.370
for cancer spreading
around the world.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.660
Some big exceptions.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.630
Notably, southern Africa,
because of HIV/AIDS,

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.990
where life expectancy
went down by 20 years

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:53.100
when the rest of the world went
up, simply because of HIV/AIDS.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.710
And Russia for a whole
set of other circumstances

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.860
where life expectancy has
decreased by about 10 years

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.750
since the fall of
the Soviet Union,

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.030
as the health system
has collapsed,

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:08.320
as suicide, smoking, car
accidents, and other things,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.740
crime, take their toll.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.540
Now, one of the most
difficult questions

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.475
is what we mean by development.

00:11:15.475 --> 00:11:17.350
And of course, when I
talk about development,

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.120
I'm talking about
the development

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.150
of individuals' lives
and capabilities,

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:23.800
as well as economic development.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.810
Other people-- my wife
who's a psychotherapist

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.890
has a completely different
meaning for the term.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.560
And, of course, the
fundraising office at Oxford

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.020
is called the
Development Office.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.920
And Google development.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.082
You get many different things.

00:11:40.082 --> 00:11:42.429
And that was a big question
in naming this book,

00:11:42.429 --> 00:11:44.595
because we might get the
wrong people picking it up.

00:11:44.595 --> 00:11:46.678
And I thought, well, that
was a good thing anyway.

00:11:46.678 --> 00:11:49.850
So let's have a term that has
lots of different meanings

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.850
where lots of people might
pick it up by mistake

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.430
and learn something.

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:59.560
But this concept
remains very contested.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:04.640
Economists tend to think of
this as economic development.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.700
So they'd say a country
is more developed if it

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.580
has a higher per capita income.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.320
Of course, that is an extremely
imperfect understanding

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.490
of what development is.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:18.320
There are countries
like Bangladesh,

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:24.676
for example, average
life expectancy of 75.

00:12:24.676 --> 00:12:28.169
I mentioned Cuba and
its life expectancy.

00:12:28.169 --> 00:12:29.960
And there are some much
wealthier countries

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.940
at a lower life expectancy.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.950
There are countries,
like Bangladesh

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:39.360
again, that have very
low fertility rates.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.480
And other countries
at much higher incomes

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.619
that have much more
rampant fertility.

00:12:44.619 --> 00:12:46.410
There are countries
that have higher levels

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.180
of girls' education, et cetera.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.300
So defining what we
mean by development

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:55.380
is pretty crucial in order to
have a conversation about what

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.270
are we striving
for as a society?

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.930
Are we striving
for higher incomes?

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.620
Do we need growth in
order to get development?

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.230
Or can you have
development without growth?

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.260
Which I don't think is possible,
not at low levels of income.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.150
Which is why this let's
get away from growth idea

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:16.590
that the rich countries are
sometimes falling in love with,

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.930
particularly the
greens, I think,

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.300
doesn't work for, say, Africa.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.410
Because if you're at a per
capita income level of $2,000,

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.880
you'd better grow if
you want to raise that.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.210
No amount of redistribution.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.967
But does the US
still need to grow?

00:13:31.967 --> 00:13:33.300
Does Britain still need to grow?

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.370
That's an interesting question.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:39.120
What is it that we mean by
development in these contexts?

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.120
And of course, this is
changing all the time.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.310
Now, one of the
most exciting things

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:48.090
is the capabilities
approach, which

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.790
says that development is
about people's ability

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.590
to transform their own lives.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.450
And this is Amartya
Sen who really

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:55.786
was at the forefront of this.

00:13:55.786 --> 00:13:57.660
That's how we should
think about development.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.820
Do people have agency?

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.140
Are people able to
affect their own futures?

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.820
And that's both about,
well, you better

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:06.960
be alive in order to do it.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.460
You better be
properly nourished.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.370
You better be educated to know
about what the options are.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.270
You better be healthy.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:17.220
And you better have
freedoms and rights in order

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.540
to affect your own outcome.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:23.220
And I'm very attracted to
this capabilities approach.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.370
As people become more and more
educated around the world,

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.900
they learn more.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.270
But we should be careful
not to fall into the trap

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:35.190
to believe that simply more
education means more freedom,

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.252
because we know that
this isn't true.

00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:39.210
And one of the great
challenges for development

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.750
is understanding why highly
educated people sometimes

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.540
make decisions which seem to
be contrary to development.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.750
And I'm thinking, for example,
about the highly educated

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:53.400
jihadists, for example,
who on average have

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.080
very high levels of education.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.580
So education in
itself I don't believe

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:00.970
is a development objective.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.210
It's a means.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:06.440
And that's true of many,
many different dimensions.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.090
Because there are more
people in the world educated

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:15.840
and connected, we should
expect more rapid change.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.330
And a crucial question
of development

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.450
is, can societies
adapt fast enough?

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:22.740
Let's say you develop today.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.190
Will you be developed tomorrow?

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.570
And as the world
changes more rapidly,

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.820
this becomes a bigger
and bigger concern.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.860
And it's a concern not
only between countries,

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.520
it's a concern within countries.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.240
Is the reason we
have Trump and Brexit

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.090
because some parts of Britain
or some parts of the US

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:48.310
are developing much more rapidly
than other parts, for example?

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.440
And this increasing
differentiation

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.710
within countries
is a big concern.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:56.590
Now, I talked about how the
world changed since the Berlin

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.330
Wall came down.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.020
And some described this as
a process of globalization--

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.050
which I talk a bit
about in the book--

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:09.160
by which we simply mean
flows across national borders

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.880
of goods, services,
products, and ideas.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.120
Got a bad rap
recently, but my view

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.270
is, this is the most progressive
force for development

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.470
that history has ever known.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.980
But it's also the most
dangerous, and potentially

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.390
the ugliest.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:31.210
You see these transformations
in flows depicted here.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:35.470
As the walls came
down, the flows

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.790
between countries,
of financial flows

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.920
in this case, investment aid--

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.430
the black is private
equity and bonds--

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.250
and foreign direct
investment increased.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.200
But so, too, did
their complexity.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.450
And one of the great
challenges going forward

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:57.020
for countries is
managing complexity,

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:00.730
is that everything comes
from more and more places.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.960
And where you fit
into supply chains,

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.730
and where you fit into
the realm of ideas,

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:09.200
and how you influence things
is becoming more complex.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.930
Now, development
really does happen.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:15.170
These are two simple graphs
of the last 2,000 years,

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.170
or two simple lines,
depicting income growth--

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.000
that's red exponential--

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.740
and population growth--
that's green arithmetic.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.910
The simple point of
this is that we're

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:31.880
in a period which is
unprecedented in progress

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.120
in our lifetimes, both in terms
of income growth and population

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:36.620
growth.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.280
The great challenge
thinking forward is,

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.080
is this sustainable?

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:48.210
Will these very unusual patterns
be replicated going forward?

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.360
And I believe the
pace of this change

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.630
is because of
integration of ideas.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.450
Because evolution, in effect,
is happening more quickly

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.490
because people are
discarding their old ideas

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:02.040
and taking on new ideas
quicker about how to do things,

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.600
and how to learn, how to
get girls into school, how

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.496
to stay healthy, how to do
things of that sort of nature.

00:18:10.496 --> 00:18:15.590
So we see, in this period,
average life expectancy

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:16.250
increasing.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.190
We see illiteracy going
down dramatically.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.730
In a world of five billion
people at the end of the '80s,

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.770
only two billion people
could read and write.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:30.050
In a world of 7.5 billion people
today, 6 and 1/2 billion people

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:31.030
can read and write.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.500
4 and 1/2 billion
more literate people.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.590
And if you believe
in that knowledge

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:40.910
as a way of getting agency
of your own life, learning,

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.320
then, of course, is the
most exciting thing.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.060
It's also the reason I believe
this is the slowest lunch

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.440
hour you'll know for
the rest of your lives.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.494
Relax and enjoy it.

00:18:50.494 --> 00:18:52.160
And that's because
there are more people

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.210
with more ideas
participating more and more

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:59.360
in the challenging
and replication

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:03.050
and invention of new ideas
and their application

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.690
to their local environments.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.970
So innovation is
accelerating because there

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.970
are more participants, and
they're sparking off each other

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:11.990
in new ways.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.450
Both random
distribution of genius,

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:19.571
just more geniuses, but also
sparks, more sparks flying.

00:19:19.571 --> 00:19:21.320
And as a result of all
of this, the number

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:25.860
of desperately poor people has
gone down by about 300 million,

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:31.550
despite the world's population
going up by over a billion.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.280
And this has never
happened before in history.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.860
We have rapid population
growth and a reduction

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.790
in poverty at the same time.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.790
So something is happening
in our lifetimes which

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:46.090
is extraordinarily exciting
and leads to a great optimism

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:49.290
that poverty can
actually be overcome.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.650
We should be able to live to
see a world of no poverty.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.120
But will we?

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.460
And that is the question that's
on the development agenda.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.260
And of course, it's not only
about poverty that we care.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.300
We care about many
other things as well.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.800
Now, the SDGs and other
agendas out of the UN

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.130
are the first collective effort,
Sustainable Development Goals,

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.680
Millennium Development
Goals preceding it,

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.727
to establish
collective goal posts.

00:20:15.727 --> 00:20:17.310
And that's very
important because when

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:22.830
one has collective goal posts,
team players know what to do.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:26.170
And the teams, of course,
are the countries themselves,

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.790
plus everyone around the
world trying to help them

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.540
in the public and
private sectors,

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.990
as well as in charitable
and other institutions.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:35.580
Has this led to great progress?

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.020
Yes.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:41.190
But of course, the ambitions
are high, and much,

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.020
much more needs to be done.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:49.040
In addition to writing this
"Very Short Introduction"

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.950
I've written over the last
couple of years, this book,

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.620
"Age of Discovery,"
which is arguing

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.950
that this is a renaissance
moment in human history.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:01.010
The best time by
far to be alive.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:04.160
But also like the Renaissance,
not only associated

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.820
with enormous creativity that
we'll celebrate, obviously

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:12.500
in that case 500 years later,
but also a perilous time.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.250
You know the Renaissance
ended in religious wars

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:20.020
and complete destruction of
the intellectual environment

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.910
and experts, as well as the
hounding of all diversity out

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.940
of Europe, including the
Inquisitions, et cetera.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.570
And the question
is how one manages

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:34.180
rapid development and
social and political change.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.600
And I address that both
in the "Age of Discovery"

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.340
and in the "Very
Short Introduction."

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.350
Now, development is a
very uneven process.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.160
And one of the great
challenges is that,

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.960
while the differences between
countries have been reduced,

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.980
with an exception of about the
bottom 25 countries who are

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.170
in conflict or in
fragile states--

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:03.790
and we can come back to those if
you'd like to in conversation--

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.570
increasingly, we see
differences within countries.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.720
And this poses very big
questions for development

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.260
agencies and others.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.250
Because if a
country, on average,

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:20.830
can afford to overcome poverty,
why should external parties

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.900
have a role to play in it?

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.080
What is the role of outsiders
in overcoming poverty,

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:32.880
for example, in the northeast of
Brazil and other middle income

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.930
countries?

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:37.040
Of course, many countries
remain in dire poverty,

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.630
not least in Africa.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:43.600
Now, rising
inequality is largely

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:49.270
the result of the very uneven
distribution of the benefits

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.080
of globalization.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.830
In other words, some places,
particularly dynamic cities,

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:58.600
are doing much better than
rural areas and smaller decaying

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.960
towns, whether it's in India,
or whether it's in the US,

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.115
or whether it's in the UK.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.790
These are just numbers
around inequality.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:13.030
Another big issue
associated with this

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:17.350
is, of course, taxation and
the ability of governments

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:20.800
in a globalized world to
get the revenues to pay

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:26.740
for redistribution to
invest in health, education,

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.720
infrastructure, all the
things that governments

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.410
have to invest in.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.470
And the poorer the
country is, the greater

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:33.920
the need for investment.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:38.270
So a crucial area is,
what is the relationship

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.920
in globalized firms and
globalized tax systems

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.120
and national financial
capabilities for development?

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.170
And that's one aspect of the
international responsibility

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.580
towards development.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.260
So one big issue going forward,
which is a newer issue,

00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:00.220
is this rising inequality
within countries,

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.110
and how one addresses it.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:07.210
A second big issue is
growing systemic risk.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.880
When we connect, and
when we open our borders

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.210
and have interconnected systems,
whether they're cybersystems,

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:17.540
airport hubs, or
financial systems,

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.370
we don't only grow
our capabilities,

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.850
but we grow our interdependency.

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.720
And the challenge
for many countries,

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.130
particularly poor countries, is
managing this interdependency.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:32.420
How do we ensure that
they have the capability

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:36.020
to not be either the
spreaders or the importers

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:41.890
of financial crises, pandemics,
cyberattacks, et cetera?

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.020
This interdependency
is growing as we

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.970
become more numerous, wealthier,
and more interconnected.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.440
When people were poorer
in the countryside,

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.190
they could do whatever
they wanted to that

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:56.640
didn't affect the world.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.040
But as they become wealthier
and more connected,

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.300
all their actions and all our
actions have spillover effects.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:09.050
So one is this contagion between
systems and interdependency,

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.920
the underbelly of
interconnectivity.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.550
A second dimension
of this, of course,

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.960
is the spillover effects of
the goods becoming the bads.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.940
It's wonderful that
so many countries

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:24.630
are escaping energy poverty
and climbing the energy curve.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.130
That's fantastic.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:29.100
At the same time,
a possible result

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.090
is catastrophic climate change.

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:33.630
It's wonderful that so many
people around the world

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.300
are taking antibiotics.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:41.580
A possible outcome is rapidly
rising antibiotic resistance.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.470
It's wonderful that
people in other countries

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.840
have the options to
enjoy tuna sushi like you

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.230
do in your canteen.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.270
Possible outcome is
extinction of the tuna.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:55.830
The summing up of the goods
when more and more people enjoy

00:25:55.830 --> 00:26:01.720
development can lead
to very bad outcomes.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.620
And the challenge here is
to understand that we all

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.080
have a responsibility in this.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.750
That, as people
become more connected,

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:14.500
their freedom grows,
they have more choice.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.290
As their income grows
and as their ability

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:20.330
to choose and take drugs--

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.446
well, I mean, not
recreational drugs.

00:26:23.446 --> 00:26:25.280
[LAUGHS] Antibiotics
and other drugs.

00:26:27.969 --> 00:26:30.260
Maybe recreational drugs,
but we won't comment on that.

00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:37.540
Have the lights on, et cetera.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.810
But with that freedom
comes a new responsibility,

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:43.270
and that is a recognition
that our freedoms have

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:46.000
to be curtailed
if we want others

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.860
to be able to enjoy them, too.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.040
And this is a big, big
challenge to the market system.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.590
Now, I'm going to rush
through, because I've

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:55.540
taken a bit more
time than I planned

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.280
on this, some megatrends.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.840
I mentioned rising life
expectancy converging,

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:07.540
except for Southern Africa
collapsing because of HIV/AIDS.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:11.290
I mentioned
fertility going down,

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:14.920
except for Africa where the
uncertainty is primarily

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.940
in four countries--

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:20.750
Nigeria, Niger, and
a couple of others.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:23.580
So world life
expectancy improving,

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.620
but because of
fertility going down,

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:31.090
populations flattening and
declining in many countries.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:38.360
I do not believe, and I put
the arguments in the book,

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.350
that the problem is too
many people in the world,

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.545
which, of course, some
people worry about in case

00:27:43.545 --> 00:27:44.170
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.870
The world's population
be flattening.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:50.130
Median age is doubling
around the world,

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:53.080
Africa the only exception.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.620
And that changes many
things, including schooling.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.710
So we need to remove from our
mental map ideas of population

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:04.180
pyramids and put in place these
sorts of structures which are

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.780
the structure of the future.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.390
And they have a dramatic
implication for many things.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:12.710
And they also demonstrate what
all the women in the room know,

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:15.720
which is women are
wiser than men.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.290
Women live longer in all
countries of the world.

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.900
They have better
development prospects.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.400
And the simple
answer is, they don't

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.950
make as many stupid decisions.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:26.220
They don't smoke as much.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.290
They don't drink as much.

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.530
They don't stick as many
knives into each other,

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.700
and don't drive as many
cars into as many trees,

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.130
and they live longer
around the world.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.590
But the opposite in every
country of the world,

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:39.260
more young boys than girls.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:43.160
And the reason is because we
all live in sexist societies,

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.010
and the status, income,
career prospects of boys

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:47.210
are greater than girls.

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:50.720
And the girls no longer look
after us in our old age.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.550
And so, people are
choosing when they only

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:55.500
have one kid to have
more boys than girls.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.090
And this is a global phenomenon.

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.244
So increasingly
skewed distribution.

00:28:59.244 --> 00:29:01.160
And that, of course, has
dramatic consequences

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:01.970
for many things.

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.620
Every country is unique.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.840
China, one child policy.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.930
US immigration,
very significant.

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:11.180
I did this before
Trump was elected.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.730
And it matters because over
half the children born in the US

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:16.340
are to immigrant parents.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.230
So if you change
immigration policy,

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:23.160
you remove this healthy
outlook for the US.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.670
Different African countries,
different perspectives.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:31.130
Nigeria, massive population
growth, as with Kenya.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:36.120
Impact of HIV having
this dramatic shadow

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.930
in many countries.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:39.690
And, of course,
particularly South Africa.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.240
Terribly distorted by HIV/AIDS.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.200
This is Botswana with
and without HIV/AIDS.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.310
The light what it would be
without, and the dark with.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:53.807
So these things can just
wreck development prospects

00:29:53.807 --> 00:29:54.390
for a country.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:58.110
Botswana, in other respects,
a well-managed economy

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:03.360
with lots of resource diamonds,
but wrecked by a failure

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.770
to manage this.

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.590
Migration becomes a
bigger and bigger part

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:09.000
of the development story.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.450
Now, migration has
always been the way

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.830
that countries have
dealt with development.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:18.090
The reason we're all here
is because of development.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:21.240
If not first, second
or third generation.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:25.060
It's always been that way that
people escaped poverty, famine,

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.580
disease, and war.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.080
A third of Ireland migrated.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.640
A third of Scandinavia migrated.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.970
A third of Italy migrated.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:35.940
But as that option becomes
closed off to people

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.700
and the number of
countries increase--

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.680
there's 100 more countries in
the world over the last 100

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.220
years--

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.220
the potential for
migration is doing

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.920
what it's always
served humanity to do,

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.890
which is give people opportunity
to get away from trouble

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:53.680
and find new potential.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.660
That option is being closed off.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.610
And so, development has
removed from a central place

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:04.240
this absolutely key
potential, which is migration.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.934
Now, migration is good not only
for the people that migrate,

00:31:06.934 --> 00:31:08.350
but also for the
societies they're

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:10.150
leaving because of
remittances going back,

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:13.420
and the societies they're
going to because of what they

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.500
contribute to those societies.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.950
None of our societies
in the rich countries

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.750
would be anything
like what they are.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.960
Indeed, I argue that
all great civilizations

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.040
have depended on massive
inflows of immigrants.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.610
So migrants are
exceptional people.

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:34.600
And migration shaped our world
and will define our future

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.254
in the way that it manifests.

00:31:36.254 --> 00:31:37.420
And this is a previous book.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.003
And what the "Very
Short Introduction"

00:31:39.003 --> 00:31:42.190
does, which is partly
why I was able to do it,

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:45.220
is it draws on all my books
on globalization, migration,

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:49.090
financial flows,
and other things.

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:51.820
The work forces of the
world change dramatically,

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:55.610
and Africa becomes, by far,
the most significant source

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:56.110
of labor.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.300
And a key question
for Africa is, can it

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.310
fulfill this potential?

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:03.280
That's both about
education, which there's

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.520
a very positive story to be
told, illiteracy declining,

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.560
but it's also about
the fact that it's

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.110
54 different
fragmented countries,

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.200
and so its political
future is important.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.170
When one looks at the economic
prospects of countries,

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:18.940
the startling thing
is how important

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.542
development has become.

00:32:20.542 --> 00:32:22.750
Developing countries, what
we used to call developing

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:27.550
countries-- and that term
itself is subject to revision--

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.530
and I have a little
graph or table

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:32.380
in the book which shows how
these terms keep changing,

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.180
as they rightly should.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.210
But what some call
emerging markets

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:39.700
now account for 2/3
of global growth.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.760
Without them, we would
be in a much worse state

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.410
in the UK or the US.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:45.970
They are lifting global growth.

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:47.770
They are the engine
of global growth.

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:50.290
They're also the
stabilizers of global growth

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:53.107
because there are many
more growth engines.

00:32:53.107 --> 00:32:55.690
In other words, when the US gets
a cold, the rest of the world

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:58.840
no longer gets a fever because
of China, because of India,

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.550
because of other countries.

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.450
So we should thank them for
their development's success.

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:06.760
And our development now
depends more and more

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:12.620
on their development, which
is a great irony of history.

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.440
Many countries that we think
of as developing countries

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.380
will overtake us in
per capita terms.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.700
Many countries become
richer than the UK.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:25.060
And of course, when you
compound these growth rates,

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.520
you have to divide
the total income

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.980
growth by the population,
which is why China goes

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:34.780
above $30,000 per capita and
India doesn't go above $10,000,

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.190
and Africa above $5,000.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:39.460
But this is very sensitive
to what assumptions one makes

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:44.460
not only on economic growth,
but on population growth.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:49.510
How these population dynamics
transfer into income levels

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.900
matches desperately, and
in the key uncertainties

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.080
of some very big
countries in Africa

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.580
where you see this
difference in per

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:02.230
capita and in average
income levels.

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.960
Now, this also,
of course, doesn't

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.230
talk about the inequalities
that are behind it.

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:10.449
And that goes back
to this question of,

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:13.989
we move towards a world in
where the only countries that

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:17.889
are, on average, desperately
poor are the countries that

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:21.670
are failed states, in some
respects, or in conflict.

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:24.889
And then within the
middle income countries,

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:30.449
how does one tackle these
distributional questions?

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:33.570
The middle class,
defined as $10 per day,

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:37.800
explodes around the
world in its size.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:43.080
4.9 billion middle
class consumers by 2030.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.860
These are the people buying
your products and going online.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:54.179
And in this, the center of
gravity is firmly towards Asia.

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:58.130
Now, a key question is
this adding-up question.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.930
This is another book I've done.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:04.110
Is there enough for everyone
in the world to develop?

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.820
What about the
resource constraints?

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.710
Is the planet full?

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.030
Our planet.

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:11.820
And here I'll come back
to a few observations,

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.100
but I think we have
to say it depends.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.240
It depends partly on what
happens with technology,

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.790
but it also depends on
behavior in the rich countries,

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:22.740
as well as in the
developing countries.

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:25.920
New York State consumes
more antibiotics

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.600
than the whole of
sub-Saharan Africa.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.810
New York State
consumes more energy

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:33.270
than the whole of
sub-Saharan Africa.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.140
So it's all about numbers.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:38.520
It's about consumption
patterns and behavior

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:42.660
that really determines
one's outlook as how are we

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:45.570
going to manage
resources going forward?

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:48.120
Now, you know more
than most about

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.630
revolutionary technologies.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:51.990
And I hope one thing you've
learned is that you cannot

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:56.400
predict the future unless you're
even smarter than all the great

00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.030
minds that have
ever tried before.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:03.810
But we know that there are some
predictables, like Moore's Law.

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:05.340
In the Oxford
Martin school, which

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.370
I was the director of for 10
years, we have over 50 people

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:10.011
working on aspects of this.

00:36:10.011 --> 00:36:12.510
We think it's going to continue
for about the next 20 years.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:15.780
So we have 100,000 to a
million times the power.

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:18.150
And so, revolutionary
technologies like

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:21.400
nanomedicine-- this
is from my nano lab--

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.310
or stem cell-- this is from our
stem cell lab that we created.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:25.950
This is a hard cell--

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:31.740
or genetic manipulation
become a real possibility.

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.280
And the key question,
I think, for all of us

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.480
is, how will these technologies
play through the world?

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.440
And will they widen inequalities
or narrow inequalities?

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.690
Will these extraordinary
technologies,

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:48.690
like gene therapy, the
back mouse, a wild mouse,

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:52.110
the front mouse, a modified
mouse going for 10 times

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:57.380
the time, will these
technologies increase them?

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:58.850
Will only the rich have them?

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:02.060
Will they only be available
in rich countries?

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:05.690
These are key questions
because these technologies

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:11.330
are advancing at
superexponential speed.

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:15.410
And so, one of the key questions
for developing countries

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:18.224
is to understand
what's going on.

00:37:18.224 --> 00:37:19.640
And have they got
the capabilities

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.330
of using them to address
development questions?

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:26.750
Now, I'm very concerned about
this because I think in the UK,

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.850
for example, we don't
really understand.

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:33.020
The government isn't really on
top of technological change.

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.590
Or in the US, for that matter.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:37.850
So how do we expect a
poor African country

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:41.480
to be on top of it?

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.440
Risk is a whole other question.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.450
Risk is very asymmetric.

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:50.250
Remember that risk
disproportionately

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:52.740
impacts on poor people
and poor countries.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:56.190
Rich people can buy themselves
out of trouble, largely.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:58.980
We see the rapid
growth in the US,

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.540
in cities like Phoenix
and Las Vegas--

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.690
which is quite an interesting
story, seeing they're

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:06.000
both in the middle
of the desert.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.190
Just pipe deeper from
longer, turn the aircon on,

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:12.860
and survive in the desert.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.050
No problem.

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:15.480
In fact, not survive, thrive.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.812
These are rapidly
growing cities.

00:38:17.812 --> 00:38:19.770
The same option is
obviously not open to people

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:21.840
living in the [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:26.010
So this disproportionate
impact leads

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:30.060
to a greater need for anyone
that cares about development

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.150
to manage risk.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:35.510
Climate change,
pandemics, everything.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:39.530
Financial crises, impact on
the poor and poor countries

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:41.300
much more than the
impact on the rich.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:44.450
And that's one of the great
challenges going forward,

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:48.410
is how to manage
risk, and to ensure

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:51.890
that we mitigate the risks that
come out of interconnectivity.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:55.060
These are not new, but their
pace and scale is different.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.850
The swine flu that
starts in Mexico City

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:59.820
is in 130 countries in 30 days.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:01.090
That's new.

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:02.810
And so, the preparedness
of countries

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:06.470
to this we've modeled and shown
replicates airline traffic.

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:09.650
And preparing countries for
the cyber vulnerabilities.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:12.270
Can hackers close
down a country?

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:14.840
Or malicious governments,
or other forces,

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.690
destroy their systems, their
financial systems and others?

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:20.300
And how do we help them
become resilient to that?

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.450
Because these are very,
very big challenges.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:26.819
As the cyber becomes the new
nervous system of the world,

00:39:26.819 --> 00:39:28.610
and as we move into
the Internet of Things,

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:30.650
this becomes more important.

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:33.140
Another great
challenge of the future

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:37.670
is how do we think about
technology and jobs going

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:38.960
forward?

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.120
Now, you might be
familiar with the work

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.810
that I developed with
colleagues in Oxford, which

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:47.870
suggests that about
47% of US jobs

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:50.390
are vulnerable to machine
intelligence and AI

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:53.300
over the next 20 to 30 years.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.560
About 40% of European jobs.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.530
And the proportions
are much higher

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:00.320
for developing countries.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.600
Why is this?

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.370
Because we believe
that anything that's

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:06.250
repetitive and rules-based
that doesn't require dexterity

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.920
or empathy is likely
to be disintermediated

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:12.470
by AI over the coming decades.

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:15.520
So if you take away the middle
rungs of the development

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.720
ladder, those middle rungs
which are repetitive tasks,

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:23.470
be they in manufacturing,
or be they in call centers

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:27.400
or back offices, and
replace them with AI,

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:32.030
what is the development
model for countries?

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:35.020
What are we going to
be replacing this with?

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:39.860
And how can these people escape
poverty in that world of AI?

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.470
Will they have the skills?

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:44.050
Can we just say they'll all
become creative and do things

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:45.424
that machines cannot do?

00:40:45.424 --> 00:40:46.840
And if we, at the
same time, close

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:52.800
in the migration gates to them,
do we have a new challenge?

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.270
And of course,
this is coinciding

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:56.810
with many other things
like 3D printing.

00:40:56.810 --> 00:41:01.230
This is footage I filmed at
SpaceX, titanium printing.

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:04.660
So reshoring of production.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:07.270
Of course, the politics of
nationalism and xenophobia

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:10.910
feeding into this
is very, very scary.

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:12.820
So as we think about
this relationship,

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.980
this interconnectivity
is very, very important.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:17.860
So, too, are these
issues of the commons.

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.550
Nature has no price.

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:22.930
We know that no matter how
much the rhino horn is worth,

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:24.190
they won't reproduce more.

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:26.890
And that's true of
all natural systems.

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:31.630
And they become increasingly
important for developing

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:35.772
countries who depend on
these natural resources.

00:41:35.772 --> 00:41:38.230
Of course, governments sharing
these resources aren't good.

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:39.640
This is the Aral Sea.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.170
And so climate,
change really matters.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:45.280
And it particularly matters
to poor people in poor places.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.190
And that's why stopping
climate change,

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:52.440
or slowing its rate of increase,
is dramatically important.

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:55.990
And we might enjoy the fact that
we've had the hottest May bank

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:59.180
holiday on record in the UK.

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:02.840
But this is extremely worrying,
for developing countries,

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.430
particularly.

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:07.110
We have to come up
with a model that

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:10.530
allows people to climb
the development curve

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:13.020
and have energy forms
which are different.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.050
And we have to appreciate
the vulnerabilities,

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:18.690
particularly in
agriculture, but not only.

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:21.960
The most rapidly growing
cities in developing countries

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.060
are seafront cities.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:27.990
That's where 80% of the
growth of dynamism is,

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:30.300
on these coastal cities.

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.750
So climate change
dramatically affects crops.

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.130
Now, the global
governance system

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:38.910
is totally unfit for
21st century purpose--

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.520
rearranging the furniture.

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.490
And countries are
like individual cabins

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:46.710
on an ocean liner with
no captain on the deck.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:49.480
Like so many aspects
of development,

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:54.120
this is an unintended
negative of a very good thing.

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.890
We can celebrate the
fact that the world

00:42:55.890 --> 00:43:00.860
is no longer run by 12 white
men smoking cigars in a room.

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.360
In the latest climate
change negotiations,

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.720
there were 35,000
participants, and the process

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.540
was run by a woman,
Laurence Tubiana.

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:11.950
So that's wonderful.

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:15.850
At the same time, in
this time of handover,

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:17.380
this lack of leadership.

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:20.140
So what international
information systems do

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.410
is important.

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:23.500
The best institutions
in the best places,

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.140
the best expert
systems, notably those

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.125
in finance and our central
banks' treasuries, IMF

00:43:29.125 --> 00:43:33.100
and others, have proved
themselves totally incapable.

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.630
And so, when we
see this rejection

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:38.780
of experts and authority, we
need to understand it's real.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:42.070
Us experts-- I'm
talking about myself--

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:45.730
have let the system down by
allowing a financial crisis

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.170
to happen, which
has particularly

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:51.430
affected poor people
and vulnerable people.

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:56.650
Life expectancy and other
attributes of development

00:43:56.650 --> 00:44:01.500
are not improving in many parts
of the advanced economies,

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.200
let alone in the poor countries.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:08.420
So these distribution questions
are more and more important.

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:12.700
However, the idea that
you can withdraw from this

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.770
is profoundly misguided.

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:17.050
There is no wall
high enough that

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:22.300
will keep out climate change, a
pandemic, a cyberattack, or any

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:24.280
of the real threats
to our futures.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:27.820
But what these high
walls do keep out

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:34.300
is the technologies, the ideas,
the people, the products,

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:39.480
the services that we need
to navigate and thrive

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.150
in the future.

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:42.840
And of course, what these
high walls mostly keep out

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:46.620
is our ability to cooperate,
which is absolutely central.

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:51.440
So I prefer the concept of
entanglement to globalization.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.050
We're in an entangled world.

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:54.810
We're in a world
in which everything

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:58.160
that we do matters
for others, and what

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.870
they do matters for us.

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:03.170
And that's why
development, in the end,

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:07.010
is about being more connected,
but not being more vulnerable.

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:10.430
In feeling an empathy with
people around the world.

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:13.750
And of course, your technologies
allow us to do that,

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:18.160
to share an experience with
people around the world

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:22.000
in a way which was just
unimaginable in the past.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.910
But whether that leads
to a new learning

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:26.350
of our interconnectedness
and helps

00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:28.780
us to understand that,
actually, we are the development

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:32.080
agencies, development
is not about someone

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.480
else somewhere else.

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.890
Development's about us.

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:40.190
It's what we do every minute of
our lives, the choices we make,

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:43.090
the things that we
consume, the way we

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:45.520
develop products and services.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.820
And a consciousness that it's
these kids in the end that

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:54.190
will be as entwined with
our future as our neighbors

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:55.750
next door.

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:57.930
So this is an
ambitious little book.

00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:01.190
It tries to do
the past, present,

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:04.210
and future of globalization
in 40,000 words.

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:06.430
I hope you find it
really-- if there's

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:09.840
any word in it you don't
understand, send me an email

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.470
or connect me on
Twitter, because it's

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:13.960
designed for non-specialists.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.510
But if you find
it is dumbed down,

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:19.930
then also send me
a message and say I

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:21.190
haven't challenged you enough.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:24.700
Because it wants to strike that
balance between inviting people

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.070
into the conversation,
but also giving them

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:30.010
a sense of the challenges.

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:33.470
And that's what, if it does,
I'll be happy to have achieved.

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.970
Thank you.

00:46:39.754 --> 00:46:41.620
SPEAKER: We've got time
for a few questions.

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:43.060
So, everyone, put
your hands up and I'll

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.101
come to you with the mic.

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:47.150
And I'll kick us off if you want
to think of something to ask.

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:49.210
So I was just
thinking, you alluded

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:52.160
to education and the
importance of education.

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:56.290
And I was just
thinking about how

00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:58.450
you've got world leaders
who reject experts.

00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:00.408
You've got world leaders
who don't seem to have

00:47:00.408 --> 00:47:02.260
a good grasp on human history.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:03.880
What impact does that have?

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:06.787
And more importantly,
what should leaders know?

00:47:06.787 --> 00:47:08.245
What understanding
should they have

00:47:08.245 --> 00:47:09.710
of what's gone before them?

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:10.750
And how does that
trickle down when

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:12.874
you're looking at educating
the future generations?

00:47:12.874 --> 00:47:14.800
IAN GOLDIN: Yeah.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:19.000
The only leader that I've been
bowled over by in my life,

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.010
and I've met many leaders,
was Nelson Mandela.

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:27.430
And it was because
what he had above all

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:33.480
was an ability to listen and
to learn and to be curious.

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:37.760
No leader, no matter how
powerful or intelligent

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.520
or whatever, could possibly
be on top of everything that's

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:44.480
going on in the world
and possibly understand

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.370
what they need to know.

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:49.040
And it's that ability to
ask the right questions

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.450
and listen, but also
change your mind.

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:54.110
You know, Nelson
Mandela had basically

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:58.310
become, by the time he'd
come out of prison, a pretty

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:02.430
heavy socialist.

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:04.810
The prevailing
position of his party

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:08.880
was nationalization of
the minds, of the banks,

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:13.290
and a whole lot of policies
which not only did he not

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:16.330
see through, but he abandoned
pretty quickly on coming out,

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:20.260
because he was able to
interrogate the facts,

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:26.900
and learn, and change his
mind, and not at all be ashamed

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:28.840
that changing our
mind is somehow

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.860
a sign of weakness, which
our leaders seem to think.

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.260
You know, they basically want
to be know-alls in a world

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.104
where know-all is impossible.

00:48:37.104 --> 00:48:39.520
The other thing is, of course,
to be slightly more humble.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:43.600
There's no leader, no country,
be it the US or China,

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.670
that can shape their
future anymore.

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:47.860
And that's because we're
in an entangled world.

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.170
What happens in other
places is as likely

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:54.970
to shape the futures
of its citizens as--

00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:58.500
and that attribution
problem, the ability

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:00.420
to stand up and
say, vote for me.

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.550
Not that I will
guarantee you a job or I

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:04.950
will guarantee your future,
because that's definitely

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:08.370
a lie, but vote for
me because I will

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:12.780
do my best to work
with others to do

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.120
that is a more honest thing.

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.820
We seem to not have
that capability.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:21.010
There's huge nationalism.

00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:24.450
And I think what's
so interesting to me

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:29.430
about Macron is not only
that he used new technology

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:31.020
in the same way that
the extreme right

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:33.478
wing and extreme left wing did
to disintermediate authority

00:49:33.478 --> 00:49:36.040
in traditional
political parties,

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.190
but he did it in a
pro-globalization, pro-Europe

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:40.560
ticket, which is, in
France, not the most

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.260
popular winning strategy.

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:44.880
I don't think his opinion
pollsters would have told him,

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:46.320
be pro-globalization.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.382
That's the way to become
a French president.

00:49:48.382 --> 00:49:50.715
But he did it because of the
strength of his conviction.

00:49:50.715 --> 00:49:54.690
And he took 70% of the
French population with him.

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:58.780
So that ability to
lead because you

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:02.352
are able to make a convincing
argument around the case

00:50:02.352 --> 00:50:03.810
is something our
leaders don't seem

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:08.530
to be able to have in a positive
way and an optimistic way.

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:09.280
AUDIENCE: Hi, Ian.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:09.770
Thanks so much.

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:10.895
Really, really interesting.

00:50:10.895 --> 00:50:13.489
I'll definitely get
hold of the book.

00:50:13.489 --> 00:50:15.530
IAN GOLDIN: You can get
it by Google, thankfully.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:17.290
AUDIENCE: Oh, done.

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:18.630
I have two young children.

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:21.240
And I'm sometimes-- you
know, the future worries me.

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:24.172
It looks a bit pessimistic,
bit gloomy, that type of view.

00:50:24.172 --> 00:50:26.380
What would be your advice
for me as a parent in terms

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:30.126
of how I may help them take
ownership of their own futures

00:50:30.126 --> 00:50:31.500
and their own
careers and things?

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:33.958
IAN GOLDIN: Well, I discuss
this a little bit in this book,

00:50:33.958 --> 00:50:37.104
but I also discuss it
explicitly in "Age of Discovery"

00:50:37.104 --> 00:50:39.020
in the concluding chapter,
this sort of advice

00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:42.180
for different groups.

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:46.060
My own sense is
what we all need,

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.310
but particularly young people.

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:48.880
Remember, their
life expectancy is

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:51.480
supposed to be over
100 in a world that's

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.610
changing more rapidly.

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:54.901
So we cannot possibly predict
what they are going to be

00:50:54.901 --> 00:50:58.680
encountering in the future,
what skills they'll need,

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.330
or anything like that.

00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:04.390
I think what you need to be
able to do is have a curiosity.

00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:08.700
Have an interest in learning
and relearning, taking off

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.310
on new ideas.

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:14.790
An openness to people
and different diversity

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:17.610
in all its forms,
and a flexibility

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:21.330
to change your mind,
and to feel welcoming

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:23.880
of new ideas and people.

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.400
And a resilience as
well, because there are

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:29.010
going to be tough times ahead.

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:31.470
There's a lot of systemic
risk in the system.

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:36.060
And that psychological ability
to bounce back and have

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:39.300
an inner core which
sustains you, I think,

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.180
will be important for people.

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:47.310
And that's based on things like
values, on a common humanity,

00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:49.750
on ethical
principles, on family,

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:53.430
on principles like that which
are very difficult to teach.

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:54.840
As a professor at
Oxford, I often

00:51:54.840 --> 00:52:00.150
get asked the question
by aspiring parents.

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:02.790
Not so much the kids,
but their parents.

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:05.880
Should my kid do maths or
should they do humanities

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:07.050
for the future, or whatever?

00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:09.400
What subject is future-proof?

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.159
And my view on that
is that there's

00:52:11.159 --> 00:52:12.450
no subject that's future-proof.

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:16.080
Computers are pretty
good at maths,

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.700
but you need maths
to program them.

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:21.250
So for the time being, maths
is a good subject, or computer

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:21.750
science.

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:23.708
But I'm not sure we'll
be in a machine learning

00:52:23.708 --> 00:52:27.160
world in 20 years' time.

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:29.100
But what we really
need as well is ethic

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:31.920
and humanities, understanding
of history, et cetera.

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:35.810
And that's what "Age of
Discovery" tries to convey.

00:52:35.810 --> 00:52:39.340
If you had asked Da
Vinci that question,

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:42.094
he would've looked at
you in total amazement.

00:52:42.094 --> 00:52:44.260
I mean, he wouldn't understand
what the concept was,

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.090
what discipline was he.

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:50.060
Or Adam Smith for that matter,
or any of these people.

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:53.480
This idea of [INAUDIBLE]
is a new idea,

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:57.030
and it's increasingly fragmented
and is a dangerous idea.

00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:59.210
Now, you have to be
expert in one subject.

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:01.550
And specialization is
growing, so you have

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:02.960
to focus more on one subject.

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.584
And I don't believe
that we can we just

00:53:04.584 --> 00:53:05.630
be master of everything.

00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:08.000
At the same time, it
requires an understanding

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.990
that that silo that you're
in, you need a T-shape.

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:15.320
You need to be able to spread
and understand different ideas

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:18.150
if you want to
survive in the future.

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:19.700
And so both are necessary.

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:23.450
And you might need to create
a different vertical over time

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:24.980
as the needed verticals change.

00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:27.360
But the horizontal
will not change.

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:28.610
That'll be your stabilizer.

00:53:30.404 --> 00:53:32.070
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering if you've

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:36.720
looked at where
the dollar stops,

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.990
and kind of general
well-being kicks in.

00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:44.700
Or is that a luxury that's just
afforded to the UK or the US?

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:46.170
IAN GOLDIN: No.

00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:52.020
Well, you know, until
about $20,000 per capita,

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:55.780
or maybe less depending on
the site, $15,000 per capita,

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.020
you're in a world where you
need more money in order

00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:03.030
to be able to basically
have enough food,

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:04.630
to pay for health and education.

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:11.080
But over that, the
improvements are not great.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:13.800
There's a big issue
about debt, which

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.260
is why the rich countries
have to keep growing.

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:18.990
Because they've got so much
debt, they have to repay it.

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:21.680
The big issue is
on distribution.

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:26.830
If 1% of the population is
capturing 80% of the wealth--

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:28.830
you know, the number of
people in the world that

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:31.350
could fit on a double-decker
bus have half the wealth

00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:32.750
of the world.

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:35.080
They have over 3
billion people's wealth.

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.600
That matters in terms
of whether you think

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.070
how much money do you need?

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:40.960
So these average
per capita numbers

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:43.360
don't mean very much
to someone who's

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:48.610
poor in the middle
of the UK or the US,

00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:50.611
and desperately in debt,
and about to be evicted

00:54:50.611 --> 00:54:52.610
from their house because
they can't pay the rent

00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:53.710
and they don't have a job.

00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:57.290
Tell them that they don't
need more jobs in the country.

00:54:57.290 --> 00:55:00.350
So distribution really matters.

00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:02.890
But I do believe
that we should see,

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:09.370
as a medium-term goal, basically
well-being, sustainability,

00:55:09.370 --> 00:55:10.090
and other things.

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:15.640
We don't need to be, on
average, wealthier in the UK,

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.640
for example, or in the US.

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.530
The problem is distribution.

00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:22.940
And it's also, of course,
the consumption bundle.

00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:26.190
The US is already, and the
UK, consuming too much, much

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:30.840
too much carbon fuel, much
too much other non-sustainable

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:31.710
products.

00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:37.200
So we have to change our
mix in the process, as well.

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.790
Well-being is an
important concept.

00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:40.500
I mean, economists
are very crude.

00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:44.280
They always fall back
on income, and that's

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.990
because there's no other
broadly comparable measure.

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:51.460
And well-being concepts
are particularly slippery.

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:53.580
So you can ask people,
how do you feel?

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:58.080
That's a typical
well-being/happiness index.

00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:01.935
Very weird results you get.

00:56:01.935 --> 00:56:05.880
You can look at other measures
like suicide, depression,

00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:11.060
alcoholism as indicators of
how happy societies are or not,

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:13.340
or groups within society.

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:17.480
But then you also do
get cultural differences

00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.820
that shape that.

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:22.950
So I think we need to move to
much broader sustainability,

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:26.394
well-being types of
dashboards for our society

00:56:26.394 --> 00:56:27.810
where we talk about
all the things

00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:32.602
that we want to achieve
and achieve them.

00:56:32.602 --> 00:56:33.810
SPEAKER: Thank you very much.

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:35.010
That is out of time.

00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:36.510
Thank you [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:37.360
IAN GOLDIN: Yeah.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.610
Thank you for the opportunity.

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:40.760
[LAUGHS]
