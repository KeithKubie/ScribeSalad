00:00:00.557 --> 00:00:02.069
PROBLEM: "Omar rode his boat

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:06.149
for a total of 50 miles over the past 5 days.

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:09.108
And he rowed the same amount each day.

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:10.991
How many miles did Omar

00:00:10.991 --> 00:00:13.472
row his boat each day?"

00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:15.568
So let’s just visualize what's going on.

00:00:15.568 --> 00:00:17.512
He is able to travel 50 miles.

00:00:17.512 --> 00:00:18.864
So let's make a –

00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:20.214
Let’s say this line represents

00:00:20.214 --> 00:00:22.084
the 50 miles that he travels.

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:24.237
So this whole distance right over here

00:00:24.237 --> 00:00:27.778
is 50 miles.

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:29.620
And he does it –

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.947
They tell us that he does it over 5 days,

00:00:32.947 --> 00:00:35.505
and that each day, he does the same amount.

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:38.514
So this 50 miles is if you were to add together

00:00:38.514 --> 00:00:40.556
all of what he did over the 5 days.

00:00:40.556 --> 00:00:41.479
And so, if you want to know

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.491
how much he did each day,

00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:44.759
you essentially want to divide

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:47.470
this 50 miles into 5 equal sections.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.797
And the length of each of those sections

00:00:48.797 --> 00:00:50.802
is the amount he did each day.

00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:52.204
So if we just visualize it –

00:00:52.204 --> 00:00:54.874
So that's one section – second section –

00:00:54.874 --> 00:00:57.641
third section – fourth – and fifth section.

00:00:57.641 --> 00:00:58.579
And actually, I didn't do that very well.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.411
It should look a little bit more equal than that.

00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:02.832
First, second –

00:01:02.832 --> 00:01:04.318
(And that's not going to – Let's see.)

00:01:04.318 --> 00:01:08.505
First, second, third, fourth, and fifth.

00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:09.985
And you don't have to actually do this.

00:01:09.985 --> 00:01:11.270
This is just to help visualize.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.385
So essentially, what we want to figure out is what is

00:01:14.385 --> 00:01:15.817
one of these distances?

00:01:15.817 --> 00:01:17.279
And as you can see in our visualization,

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:19.537
this is really just taking our 50 miles

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:22.522
and dividing it into 5 equal chunks.

00:01:22.522 --> 00:01:28.227
So we're essentially just taking 50,

00:01:28.227 --> 00:01:31.118
and we're going to divide it by 5.

00:01:31.118 --> 00:01:34.026
So 50 divided by 5

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:37.319
is going to be equal to 10.

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.580
So if he goes 50 miles over 5 days,

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.346
and you divide by the 5 days,

00:01:41.346 --> 00:01:45.223
he goes 10 miles each day.

00:01:45.223 --> 00:01:47.162
And we're done.
