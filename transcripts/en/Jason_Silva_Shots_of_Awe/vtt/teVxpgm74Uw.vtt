00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.505
This episode of "Shots of Awe"
is brought to you by Norton.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.000
One of my favorite lines
by Terence McKenna,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.380
to sum up the human
man machine story,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.640
is that human beings--
the goal of humanity

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.270
is to effectively turn
ourselves inside out.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.400
To actualize the
human imagination.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.820
To literalize the human
mind with our creativity.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.850
To turn our tools-- these
technological scaffoldings.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.840
As you turn them into
extensions of mind

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.736
to expand the
boundaries of mind.

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:46.610
You know, Kevin Kelly,
co-founder of "Wired,"

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.060
calls technology the
seventh kingdom of life.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.052
The Technium subject to the
same evolutionary forces.

00:00:54.052 --> 00:00:57.842
Human beings taking matter
of low organization,

00:00:57.842 --> 00:01:00.535
and we put them through the
filters of the human mind.

00:01:00.535 --> 00:01:04.410
And we extrude space shuttles
and wireless communication

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.880
networks and smartphones.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.567
With the Industrial
Revolution, we

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:11.050
transcended the
limitations of our muscles.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.196
With the Digital Revolution,
we transcended the limitation

00:01:14.196 --> 00:01:15.610
of our minds.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.500
With the Biotechnology
Revolution,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.020
we will transcend the
limitations of biology

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.232
by turning the software
of life into something

00:01:23.232 --> 00:01:24.228
that is programmable.

00:01:24.228 --> 00:01:26.220
We will upgrade biology.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.457
With the Nanotech Revolution,
we will transcend the limits

00:01:29.457 --> 00:01:33.441
of matter by patterning
the atoms the same way we

00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:36.200
pattern bits of information
into digital space.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.410
The whole physical universe will
become like the Pixar universe,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.640
as manipulatable and as fluid
as the digital cosmos is.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.880
The physical cosmos
will be programmable

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.580
at that point when we
pattern the atoms like this.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.100
So consider these implications.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.260
Consider then the
context in which

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.087
this places mind, in
which this places life.

00:01:59.087 --> 00:02:00.670
You know, as Bucky
Fuller used to say,

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.640
life is an antientropic
phenomenon.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.370
Life moves away from
entropy towards greater self

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.770
organization-- greater patterns.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.070
Upwellings of patterns
and structure.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.380
This is life.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.722
This is mind.

00:02:14.722 --> 00:02:16.930
And as David Deutsch said
in his book, "The Beginning

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.905
of Infinity," if
you look already

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:23.150
at the physical topography
of the city of Manhattan.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.468
That's the topography in
which the forces of economics

00:02:25.468 --> 00:02:30.750
and culture and intent have
trumped geology, right?

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.190
Literally, the
forces of mind create

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.579
more physical
topographical change

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:36.620
in the forces of geology.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.070
Mind has trumped matter.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.990
And as Ray Kurzweil in his
magnificent, magnificent book,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.440
"The Singularity is Near,"
it turns out, my friends,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.280
that we are central after all.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.380
We're not just a pale blue dot.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.373
Our ability to create
virtual models in our heads

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:56.369
combined with our
modest-looking thumbs

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:59.363
was sufficient to usher in a
secondary force of evolution

00:02:59.363 --> 00:03:01.359
called technology.

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.854
It will continue until
the entire universe

00:03:03.854 --> 00:03:05.850
is at our fingertips.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.830
Having invented the gods,
we can turn into them.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.200
That is the human story.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.110
That is turning
ourselves inside out.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.980
That is actually analyzing
the human imagination.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.560
What is within becomes without.
