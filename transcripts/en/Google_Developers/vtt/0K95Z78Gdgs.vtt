DON DODGE: Hi, I'm Don
Dodge, and this

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.350
is Google Root Access.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.620
Our topic today is advisory
boards and how

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.940
they can help you.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.600
We had such a good time
last time that we

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.270
decided to do it again.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.740
My guest today is David Weekly,
a longtime friend.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.140
David is the founder of PB Wiki,
founder of Hacker Dojo,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.130
advisor to many companies,
and start-up entrepreneur

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.350
extraordinaire.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.560
Welcome, David.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.890
DAVID WEEKLY: Thanks!

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.880
It's good to be here.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.240
DON DODGE: Great.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.990
So we want to talk about
advisory boards.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.950
You've been an advisor to
start-ups, and you've had

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.600
advisory boards that
advise you.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.090
Tell us a little bit about some
of those experiences and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.650
some of the good experiences
you've had.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.150
DAVID WEEKLY: Sure.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.720
So, I think it's been
tremendously helpful for me to

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.780
be able to tap into the wisdom
of people who've been there,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.890
done that--

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.610
people who have seen the movies,
as it were, of what

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.300
I'm going through, and are able
to give insight about

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.820
what's a good idea and
what's a bad idea.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.790
It took me a little while to
get used to using advisors.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.830
I was thinking that, as an
engineer, when I struck out on

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.440
my own, I would just figure
out everything by myself.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.440
Because that's how I had
figured out a lot of

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.800
computing, was just by playing
around with the computer by

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.310
myself and checking online
resources where I could.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.470
And I didn't realize how
powerfully helpful it would be

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.090
to be reaching out to advisors
for help on my situation.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.150
DON DODGE: So founders figure
everything out themselves,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.650
developers figure it out
themselves, that's sort of in

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.240
their nature.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.720
DAVID WEEKLY: That's right.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.320
DON DODGE: But when you think
you already know the answer,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.080
do you go to advisors just to
get validation, or to get a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.010
different set of eyes?

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.960
So how do you reach out to
advisors, even when you think

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.310
you already know?

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.060
DAVID WEEKLY: I think
it's good to

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.170
double-check your work.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.430
And I think that's a good
engineering practice in

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.320
general anyhow.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.160
It's why code reviews
make sense.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.730
And this is kind of
like code reviews

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.280
for important decisions.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.270
So just trying to lay out
to another person--

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.410
this is where I'm at, this is
why I'm making this decision,

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.430
this is why this seems like
an obvious thing to me.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.080
Just lay out your axioms.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.470
And the very process of
explaining your thinking to

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.340
another person is always a good
idea, because it forces

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.520
you to make concrete those
assumptions that otherwise you

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.910
wouldn't have to spell out.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.410
DON DODGE: So a code reviewer
designer, that's an excellent

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.740
analogy to an advisory board.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.240
What kinds of topics do you
take to an advisory board?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.370
DAVID WEEKLY: So I think it's
everything from what should we

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.720
be focused on right now, when
should we take financing, what

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.510
should the structure of that
financing be, when should we

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.790
consider an acquisition
offer--

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.250
basically just taking a look
strategically at the company

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.910
and the key decisions that
you need to make.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.050
And vetting them to a set
of experienced people.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.120
DON DODGE: And how often do
you reach out to them?

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.600
Do you have a routine, like once
a week or once a month,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.240
or a monthly meeting,
or as needed or--

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.830
how do you work that?

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.350
DAVID WEEKLY: So I personally
don't have a lot of

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.330
formalized, calendared structure
with my advisors.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.830
I reach out to them on
an as-needed basis.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.160
And the result of that is that
there can be a couple months

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.530
where not very much is going
on, and I'll just send an

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.520
email blast update to them,
letting them know

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.880
how things are going.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.250
And there are periods of time
when I'll need them very

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.130
aggressively and be interacting
with them,

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.790
sometimes multiple
times a day.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.900
So that I think maps much better
to what start-ups need,

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.650
because sometimes they're just
heads down building product.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.890
It's relatively straightforward
what to do.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.430
And sometimes there's very
important decisions that are

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.650
pivotal to the success of the
company that are going to need

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.340
a lot of advisory input, in
situations that are developing

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.495
very quickly, like around a
financing round or like around

00:04:15.495 --> 00:04:17.100
an acquisition.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.029
DON DODGE: So you run Hacker
Dojo, and you have hundreds

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:25.080
and hundreds of developers who
are working there, always

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.950
seeking advice.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.660
What kinds of advice do you
give to them versus a more

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.980
formal advisor relationship?

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.680
When do you know that it's time
to formalize an advisory

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.760
relationship?

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.240
DAVID WEEKLY: So I think that
the first meeting should

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.490
always be free.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.890
It's similar to if
you're engaging a

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.090
start-up lawyer, right?

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.830
So, I'll try to have a pretty
open door for interesting

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.290
people who need some help and
who are reaching out.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.740
There are some cases in which
the start-up that they're

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.060
working on is so far afield
and the situations that

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.360
they're facing are so far afield
from what I know how to

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.380
provide useful advice for
that I'll just punt.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.540
I'll say I'm very sorry, I wish
you the best of luck, but

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.060
I can't help you with this.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.570
Most the time I will try
to help them out

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.310
over email as a start.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.310
If that goes well, if I'm kind
of excited by what they're

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.620
doing, I'll invite them to come
meet me in person for

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.510
half an hour to an hour.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.710
And if that goes well, and they
come back a second, a

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.260
third time, it's usually at that
point that we'll start

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.240
exploring formally codifying
the advisory relationship.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.910
Then usually the way that that
works is, it's not cash-based

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.180
because these start-ups
don't have any cash.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.590
A lot of these guys are
living on friends'

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.670
couches and so forth.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.480
So it's on an equity basis.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.370
The standard advisory contract
here in Silicon Valley is for,

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.930
ballpark, about half a percent,
vesting over two

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.280
years on a monthly basis,
with full acceleration

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.400
on change of control.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.750
And that last provision, I've
actually run into trouble

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.460
before as an advisor, where
one of the companies I was

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.500
advising ended up getting
purchased--

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.490
by Google incidentally--

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.340
and because I didn't have that
provision in, I only got paid

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.430
a very small amount of it.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.890
But, yeah, that's generally the
structure of these things.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.640
And then if the advisor is not
able to continue providing

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.400
helpful coaching advice is not
available for the start-up,

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.720
the start-up can just terminate

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.250
the advisory agreement.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.880
DON DODGE: Right.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.550
So just to put a little more
definition on that for our

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.220
viewers, you say over two years,
and it vests monthly.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.720
DAVID WEEKLY: Yes,
that's right.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.110
DON DODGE: So that means you
get 1/24 of that stock.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.530
DAVID WEEKLY: Correct.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.790
DON DODGE: So it's not like
employee stock options, which

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.840
sometimes have a one
year cliff--

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.300
DAVID WEEKLY: That's right.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.810
DON DODGE: --where you have to
stay one year to get anything.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:47.330
DAVID WEEKLY: That's right.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.280
DON DODGE: With advisors
it's every

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.310
month they get something.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.440
DAVID WEEKLY: That's right.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.670
That's the typical
arrangement.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.430
Some advisory agreements might
have like a six month cliff in

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:01.270
there, but a one-year cliff, or
a four year contract, are

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.200
kind of unusual in the
advisory realm.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.620
A lot of that is just because
the kind of advice that you're

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.430
going to need for the next two
years could substantially

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.230
differ from the kind of
advice that you'll

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.530
need two years hence.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.650
DON DODGE: Right, longer-term.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.940
And acceleration means
that if you get

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.990
acquired before that two-year--

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.280
DAVID WEEKLY: The advisor
gets all their stock.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.360
DON DODGE: They get all of it.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.560
DAVID WEEKLY: Right.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.840
Because the acquiring entity is
probably not going to want

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.700
to retain the advisory
relationship, and as a result

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.730
the advisor will lose that
part of their stock.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.450
DON DODGE: How do you
find good advisors?

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.020
DAVID WEEKLY: That's
a tough question.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.490
It's very similar to how do
you find good employees.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.270
You want to find people with
whom you have good rapport,

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.480
who you trust, who are
well-respected in the

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.220
community, so you can
backchannel them and you get

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.270
positive results.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:54.530
For me, my first board member,
who is also my first advisory

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.830
board member, was the best boss
I had as a summer intern

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.960
in college.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.350
I really liked this guy.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:01.630
I really respected this guy.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.350
So I kept in touch with him.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.370
And when it came time for me to
start a company I asked him

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.840
to join my advisory board.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.350
Similarly, when I was first
starting my company, I

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.590
produced some interesting
technical products that caught

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.040
the attention of a guy who had
created a company previously

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.220
in the same space.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.770
He reached out to me and said,
hey did you license my

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:24.580
company's software?

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.880
I said no, I built it myself.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.150
He said we need to meet.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:32.210
So then the two of us met, and
we began a long-standing

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.740
relationship.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.900
And I was able to backchannel
him very positively.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:43.615
So I think usually the
biggest thing is do

00:08:43.615 --> 00:08:44.540
you have good rapport?

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.060
Are they able to give you useful
advice right away in

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.270
that first meeting?

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.615
And do they backchannel well?

00:08:49.615 --> 00:08:52.160
And if all those things match
up, then I think exploring an

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.480
advisory relationship
makes sense.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.040
DON DODGE: And so advisors,
do you commonly know them

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.320
beforehand?

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.370
Or you get introductions
to them?

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.840
Or they're industry heavyweights
that you really

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.730
want their advice and you
don't know them at all?

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:13.550
So over your experience where
do your advisors come from?

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.200
DAVID WEEKLY: Generally, they
are people I have some degree

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.730
of social overlap with, and I
think they would be able to

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.900
offer unusual insight into the
market that I'm looking at.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.830
For instance, the two-man
company that I'm currently

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:31.080
running, when we were looking
at the financial services

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.840
space, we brought on board some
advisors who had a lot of

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.000
experience there.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.220
When we decided that that wasn't
the area that we are

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.900
going to pursue, that instead
we're going to focus on family

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.600
sharing, we actually dropped
those advisors and took new

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.940
advisors who had experience in
the family sharing space.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:53.910
So folks like the founders of
Ecomom and Circle of Moms and

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.440
some influential
mommy bloggers.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.760
So we brought those folks on
board instead, because they

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.060
were able to offer unusual
insight into how to get into

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.100
that market.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.310
DON DODGE: Interesting.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.200
I know both of those
guys very well.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.450
It's an interesting story.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:16.050
Should you try to get the
industry heavyweight, the big

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:21.110
person that everyone knows, or
should you try to get people

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:26.130
who you trust and can confide in
on difficult issues, or do

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.460
you look for balance?

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.700
DAVID WEEKLY: I would
look for a balance.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.990
I think a lot of people seek to
get big brand name people

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.010
without a real understanding
of what that person would

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.840
actually be able to add,
other than their name.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.190
Right?

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.980
So Eric Reese, for instance, has
a lot of people who reach

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.330
out to him.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.540
They want to be able to list
him as a formal advisor

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.170
without really understanding
that Eric is quite busy

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.310
couldn't possibly advise
thousands and

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:53.150
thousands of companies.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.190
That wouldn't really be a
meaningful relationship.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.590
And so I think he, anticipating
that those people

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:02.410
are likely to be disappointed,
would turn many of those down,

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.560
if they didn't come through
in some way vetted.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.860
I think, analogously, Y
Combinator, a lot of people

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.400
applied because they think
they'll be able to get good

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.270
advice and mentorship from Paul
Graham and are somewhat

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.570
bitterly disappointed to find
out that, actually, PG's quite

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:20.620
busy, and you don't get extended
periods of hands-on

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.790
mentorship from him.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.490
So I think it can be dangerous
to go right after the top end

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.500
of the curve.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.280
I think where I've seen a lot
more systematic success is

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.520
looking for people who have
unusual insights in the

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.710
industry that you're getting
into, who are maybe

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:40.620
second-tier, who are not all
over the media all day every

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.010
day, but who really know their
field and within their field

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.930
are very well-connected and
very well-respected.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:50.860
So tracing through to those
specific people is a lot

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.140
easier and you'll generally find
that you're second-degree

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.120
from them, worst case
third-degree from them, and

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.280
it's not that hard to
network to them.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.270
What I sometimes face is new
entrepreneurs coming to me

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.090
with blanket requests--

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.350
do you know anyone who would
be able to advise a

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:09.530
company like mine?

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.510
Those kind of requests are
very likely to fail.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.390
It could be that I just had
lunch yesterday with somebody

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.340
who'd be perfect to advise the
company, but the odds of that

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.900
are very, very low.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.540
I tend to find that when
companies have a very specific

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.990
ask, like, hey you seem to know
Jason who's really deep

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.500
in AWS, and has a broad
experience there.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.980
I think he would be perfect
to advise our company.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.620
I've prepared these two
paragraphs to explain why I

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.040
think Jason would be a perfect
fit for our company.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.040
Could you forward that
along to him?

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.320
That's going to get a 100% hit
rate, because they've done the

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.980
research to figure out what
resources they need, why they

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.930
need them, and why that
person would be ideal.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.490
So I usually coach people,
be specific in what

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:52.200
you're asking for.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.670
Be specific in what you're
hoping for, and you'll find

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.830
that it's quite easy
to actually get it.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.210
DON DODGE: So that's a good
segue into how to

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.470
use advisory boards.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:05.060
You have to be specific
in what you ask them.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.810
I get requests all the time,
hey, let's go have coffee.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.540
I don't have time to go have
coffee, but if you ask me a

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.220
specific question then
I can answer it.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.320
So say a little bit about how
you work with your advisory

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.320
board members, and the kinds of
requests, and how you make

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.580
it a very specific ask.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.910
DAVID WEEKLY: So, for instance,
let's say you're

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.050
managing a financing
round, right?

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:34.245
And you have one or two VCs who
are on the table in-bound

00:13:34.245 --> 00:13:38.620
and you want to make sure that
you get a couple more in play.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.820
And you might have some specific
ideas about what VCs

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.820
would be helpful.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:48.540
Even presenting a list of, hey,
these four VCs, I would

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.700
love to go and meet with them.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.570
They seem like they're investing
in this space,

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.410
they're well reputed.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:57.480
Do you guys have connections
at one of these four VCs?

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.560
That's also likely to get a
pretty high hit rate, because

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.920
you're giving straightforward
homework in that sense to your

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.060
advisory board.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.160
It's a little less likely to
succeed if you just sort of

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.770
broadcast out, like, hey,
could you connect

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.210
me with some VCs.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.400
Dear group, right?

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.950
You might get some hits on that,
but the more specific,

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.760
the higher the response
rate is going to be.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.130
DON DODGE: And again, being
specific with advisors, you

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:28.930
might want an advisor who's
great at growth hacking, or

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.380
monetization, or someone
who's great

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.310
social media and marketing.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.250
So you figure out what you need,
the kind of help you

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.580
need, and then you target
specific individuals who you

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.230
think can help.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.980
DAVID WEEKLY: Especially
where you're weak.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.990
I think a great leader is not
great in all dimensions, but

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:51.400
they understand in what
dimensions they are not great,

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.750
and then they figure out ways
to have that not matter,

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.760
either by focusing their company
in other areas, or

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.730
having other people go and shore
up their weaknesses.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.240
And that's true in terms of
employment, finding people to

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.250
hire and work with that are good
at the things you're not

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.620
good at, and in terms of
advisors, people who can help

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.550
you see in your blind spots.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.850
DON DODGE: Right.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.080
What are some of the don'ts,
some of the things you should

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.450
avoid in setting up an advisory

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.750
board or choosing advisors?

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.210
DAVID WEEKLY: Sure.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:27.170
I mean, I don't think that you
need a giant panel of people.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:30.750
I don't think that the goal is
to have 15 people who come

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.910
over to your house once a
month kind of a thing.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:37.760
I generally found that the
quality of feedback is best

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.800
one on one, and ideally
in person.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.820
Sometimes you can't do that.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.920
Sometimes you can get a
lot done over email.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.210
But the best sessions
do happen in person.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.930
They do happen one on one.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.510
So I would say pick on the order
of five advisors who can

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:56.750
help fill out your own strengths
and weaknesses, and

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:02.780
seek to meet with them one on
one, and to present to them

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:06.900
how your company is doing and
how you are thinking about the

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.860
important decisions that
your company is facing.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:13.470
I would say an advisor that asks
you for a cash retainer

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.730
should be a pretty
big red flag.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:19.240
An advisor who on your first
meeting has lots of specific

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.820
ideas about what kind of equity
slice they would like,

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.040
in like the 5 to 10% kind of
range particularly, should be

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.590
giant red flags.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.880
I wish somebody had told me
that when starting out.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.870
You'll find that there are some
general pools in which

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.790
they are higher quality
advisors.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.210
So get mentors, for
instance, who are

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:38.470
part of Founder Institute.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.710
That tends to be pretty
high quality pool.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:43.400
And there's also some low
quality pools, like I find

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:48.140
that a number of angel groups
have people who are circling

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.970
sharks, looking for naive
first-time entrepreneurs and

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:52.330
ways to exploit them.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.390
So I think pay careful attention
to what pools in

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:59.090
which you're fishing for
high-quality advisors.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.220
DON DODGE: So an advisory
relationship is a two-way

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.240
street, right?

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.690
To make it work takes input
from both sides.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:09.915
So I've seen cases where a
start-up has recruited some

00:17:09.915 --> 00:17:12.735
advisors, but then doesn't
reach out to

00:17:12.735 --> 00:17:14.420
them, doesn't use them.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:18.339
Or, conversely, the start-up
is reaching out to the

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:20.240
advisor, but they're
not responding.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.970
So how do you manage
those things?

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:27.510
And I think you mentioned
earlier, these agreements are

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.630
cancelable.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.520
So if it's not working, you can
cancel it and start over.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:31.860
DAVID WEEKLY: That's right.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.810
DON DODGE: But.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.510
What techniques have used
it to make it a good

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.780
relationship both ways?

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.450
How often do you reach out?

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:39.000
That kind of thing.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.280
DAVID WEEKLY: I think at the
very least, sending a ballpark

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.870
monthly update to your
investors, advisors, et

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:49.800
cetera, saying hey, this is
where the company is at, this

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.340
is what we're building, this
is the result of the stuff

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.730
that we've done so far, this is
how things are coming on,

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.810
this is what we're planning
for the next month, here's

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.370
what we said we were doing last
month, and here's how it

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:00.660
actually turned out.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.980
That will keep you honest.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.780
And oftentimes people will find
ways to weigh in on that

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.580
that can be helpful.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.050
But certainly doing that kind of
at least a monthly check in

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:16.530
with advisors is good to be able
to keep them up to date

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:17.200
with where you're at.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.590
So that when you do reach out to
them, for say a one on one

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.870
meeting, they know where
you're coming from.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.220
They've gotten the background
on that, and you can right

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.600
away get to the heart
of the matter.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.810
I would say making sure that
you reach out to them

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:36.540
individually every other month
at least, and once a quarter

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.690
you should be sitting
down with them.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.410
And if you can't get a face to
face meeting sitting down with

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.430
an advisor at least once a
quarter, you should probably

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.695
drop them because they're
too busy.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.020
DON DODGE: I'm an advisor to
several companies myself, and

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:57.350
I've found that when the CEOs
send us that monthly update,

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.880
they're not asking for any help
particularly, but they

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.830
might say, oh I'm in the process
of doing a deal with

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:09.700
XY Company, or I'm in the
process of talking to this VC

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.460
about raising money.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.490
I read that, and I say, oh, I
know the CEO of that company,

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.730
or oh, I know a partner
in that firm.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.030
So you get help without
asking for it really.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.000
DAVID WEEKLY: By making sure
that people are in the loop as

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.290
to what's going on.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:26.920
If they're not in the loop, if
you haven't kept them up to

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.520
date with what's going
on, they have no

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.260
idea how to help you.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.540
advisors want to help you.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.970
This is actually another
interesting thing, is that

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:35.590
networkers want to network.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.960
It makes them feel good.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.530
Connectors want to connect.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:40.125
And advisors want to advise.

00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:43.310
I think a lot of first time
entrepreneurs are very shy

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:47.570
about imposing themselves on
others, and so they don't want

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.150
to reach out and give people
updates, because I'm sure he

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:51.430
gets a lot of email.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.620
They don't want to go and ask
for a specific networking

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.170
request, because that would be
imposing on this person who

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.380
they know who's a very
good networker.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.660
They don't realize that actually
what they're doing is

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.130
validating that other
person's existence.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:07.250
In asking an advisor for input
and actually listening to that

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:10.940
input, you're giving them
meta-feedback that you are a

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.080
good advisor, you are helpful
as an advisor.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.680
And that makes the advisor feel
really good, and feel

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.400
like, ah, my time is being
well spent here.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:18.970
DON DODGE: Exactly.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.190
DAVID WEEKLY: So don't
be afraid to reach

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.720
out for those resources.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.040
DON DODGE: So two highlights
that I've gotten from you in

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.040
this discussion is one, reach
out to your advisors with

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.340
general updates of things
that are going on.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.480
You may get help that you
didn't even ask for.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.070
And the second one is, when you
do reach out for help, be

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:40.130
very specific about what the
ask is, so that they can

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:44.020
either handle it themselves
or directed to

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.070
somebody else who can.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.640
DAVID WEEKLY: That's right.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.030
DON DODGE: Any other advice?

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.260
DAVID WEEKLY: Go in
and get advice.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.000
Don't be a one man army who
thinks you can figure out

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.500
everything yourself.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.480
You exist in the ecosystem.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.440
The more that you can respect
that, and connect with other

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.670
people, the more benefit
you'll get.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:07.200
But then, on the other side of
that, you already, in starting

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.550
a company, have experience
that's

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.910
helpful to other people.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.560
You may not think of yourself as
an advisor-- you may think

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.640
of yourself as an advisee,
looking for a good advisor--

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.650
but don't forget that it's
turtles all the way down.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:23.650
And in order to be a productive
part of this

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:26.730
ecosystem, I think everyone
who participates should be

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.860
looking for ways that they
themselves can share and

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:30.890
contribute back.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:34.300
And it's never too early to be
a productive part of the

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.570
ecosystem, finding somebody
that you can help in a

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.010
meaningful way.

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:38.590
DON DODGE: Thank you, David.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.190
This has been a tremendous
discussion.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:41.830
I really enjoyed it.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:45.120
And thank you for joining us
on Google Developers Live,

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.310
Root Access.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:50.000
Please check the schedule and
come back again when our next

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.790
show we'll be talking about
another important topic.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.040
Thank you very much.
