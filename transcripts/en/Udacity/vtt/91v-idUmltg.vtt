00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.610
Well let's see, we want 4 yards, but
we want to convert yards into feet.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.880
So we should use our conversion factor.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.620
So I multiplied by 3 feet over 1 yard.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.160
I've got this common factor in
the numerator and the denominator, and

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.420
I'm left with is 4 x 3 feet,
which is 12 feet of ribbon.
