00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, so here we are in our editor.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I see the bug, and our error call.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We're sending in the error message,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but we're not sending in the title and the art that we got from the user

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so let's go ahead and fix that,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
title, arts,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and we don't need to actually specify the QWORD parameters,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we can just pass them indirectly, title, art, error.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So we've done that, we saved the file, and let's try this again.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's type in a title, and we click submit, perfect.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Our text box stayed the same.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We replaced that text with nothing,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
enter in some fake artwork,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we still see our error message,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and our text is preserved.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now one thing I would like to show you,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
remember we spent all that time escaping in our previous lecture,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
let's type in some text here.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Okay, I'm going to submit this.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It rendered it nicely, it didn't--we didn't have any escaping issues.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Why is that?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You know we haven't dealt with escaping in this file at all.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Let me show you how that works real quick.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And the way I'm using Jinja,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
it's the template language we're using by the way,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that's what's rendering this HTML.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
One of the parameters it takes when you setup

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
it's little environment is autoescape,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and that's that autoescape = true,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
which will autoescape anything we include from a variable,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
which is really convenient

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
so you don't have to think about escaping content that comes from users

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
if you use autoescape, and I always, always use autoescape.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
If you want to deliberately include something not escaped,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
then you can--there's a method for doing that in your template

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
so it forces you to acknowledge that issue

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
whenever you want to be unsafe,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and in the default case, your just safe.
