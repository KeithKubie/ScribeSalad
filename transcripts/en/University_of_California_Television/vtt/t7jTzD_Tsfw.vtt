00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:23.084
(upbeat music)

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.300
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.430
I'm Mary Comerio, professor
of the Graduate School

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.380
in Architecture and chair

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.820
of the Hitchcock Professorship Committee.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.780
We are pleased, along
with the Graduate Council,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.280
to present Carol Greider,
this year's speaker

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.440
in the Charles M. and Martha
Hitchcock lecture series.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.270
As a condition of this request,

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.020
we are obligated and happy to tell you

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.720
how the endowment came to UC Berkeley.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.010
It is a story that
exemplifies, in many ways,

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.860
the campus linked to the
history of California

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.680
and to the Bay Area.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.840
Dr. Charles Hitchcock, a
physician for the army,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.540
came to San Francisco
during the gold rush,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.230
where he opened a
thriving private practice.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.500
In 1885, Charles established

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.010
a professorship here at Berkeley

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.440
as an expression of his
long-held interest in education.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.350
His daughter, Lily Hitchcock Coit,

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.300
still treasured in San Francisco

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.360
for her colorful personality
as well as her generosity,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.350
greatly expanded her
father's original gift,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.310
to establish a professorship
at UC Berkeley,

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.090
making it possible for us to
present a series of lectures.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.980
The Hitchcock fund has become one

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.940
of the most cherished endowments

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.010
of the University of California,

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.850
recognizing the highest distinction

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.030
of scholarly thought and achievement.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.860
Thank you, Lily and Charles.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.503
And now, a few words about Carol Greider.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.260
Carol Greider is internationally renowned

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.830
for her important contributions

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.320
to the field of molecular biology.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.680
She was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.690
for physiology of medicine,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.080
along with Elizabeth
Blackburn and Jack Szostak,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.280
for their discovery that genetic sequences

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.540
known as telomeres are protected

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.210
from progressive shortening
by the enzyme telomerase.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.890
Greider discovered telomerase in 1984,

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.690
while working with Elizabeth Bradford

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.963
at the University of California Berkeley.

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.150
Telomeres are essential

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.750
to chromosome maintenance and stability.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.160
In the absence of telomerase,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.250
telomeres shorten
progressively as cells divide,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.160
eventually leading to cell death

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.330
or cellular senescence.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.840
Greider's understanding,
Greider's breakthrough discovery

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.210
of telomerase enzyme that allowed

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.460
a mechanistic understanding
of cellular reproduction,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.190
opening new avenues of
research into cancer

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.610
and age-related diseases.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.360
Greider received her BA in biology

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.010
from the University of California,

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.980
Santa Barbara, in 1983, her
PhD in molecular biology

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.570
at the University of
California, Berkeley, in 1987.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.700
She was a Cold Spring Harbor fellow

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.880
and later held a faculty position

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.780
at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.540
in Long Island, New York.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.980
In 1997, she joined the faculty

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.900
of the Department of
Molecular Biology and Genetics

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.790
at Johns Hopkins University

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.900
where she is currently the
Daniel Nathans professor

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.830
and director of molecular
biology and genetics,

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.920
as well as professor of oncology

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.900
in the John Hopkins
University School of Medicine.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.520
Greider also directs her
own research laboratory

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.930
at the University which conducts research

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.900
into telomere function and structure.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.580
In recognition of her
groundbreaking research,

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.020
Greider has been named a fellow

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.040
by the American Academy of Microbiology,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.310
the American Association for
the Advancement of Science,

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.960
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.190
and as a member of the
National Academy of Sciences

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.440
and the Institute of Medicine.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.270
In addition to her Nobel Prize
for physiology of medicine,

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.090
she has received a number of other awards

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.410
in the last 10 years,

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.980
including the Pearl
Meister Greengard Prize,

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.340
the Paul Ehrlich, Ludwig
Darmstaedter Prize,

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.550
the Kathryn Burke and Judd Award,

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.560
the Richard Lounsbery Award,
the Dickson Prize in Medicine,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.170
the Wiley Prize in Biomedical Sciences

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.630
and the Louisa Gross Horowitz Prize.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.270
An amazing list.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.700
Greider has also published

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.050
over 100 articles and book chapters.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.428
Please join me in welcoming
Carol Greider back to Berkeley.

00:05:05.428 --> 00:05:08.595
(audience applauding)

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.950
- Well, it's really a pleasure to be here.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.960
I've been looking forward
to this lecture series

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.440
for a number of months now.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.620
It's always a pleasure to
come back here to Berkeley

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.910
and to be here in the I-House.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.880
Not only did I get my PhD here at Berkeley

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.350
but both my mother and my father

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.530
received their PhDs here at Berkeley

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.830
so it really is like a homecoming.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.760
So thank you very much
for this invitation.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.650
So what I would like to do today,

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.050
is to give you a sense of the background

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.460
of why we thought telomeres and telomerase

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.780
were interesting and
take you on a little bit

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.620
of a journey from the initial discovery

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.330
of the function of telomeres,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.810
through how, now, we understand

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.490
they play a role in age-related disease

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.030
So the theme of this
lecture is going to be

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.190
that curiosity-driven
research can establish

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.393
fundamental knowledge that
fuels practical applications.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.220
So we'll start at the beginning

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.720
or perhaps we'll start at the end

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.360
because telomeres are at both

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.800
the beginning and the ends of chromosomes.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.560
So if you have, within a cell,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.370
the nucleus and in the nucleus
are all of the chromosomes

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.570
and this is a blow-up of
one of those chromosomes

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.730
and so most of what is studied

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.230
in the field of molecular biology

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.830
occurs along the length
of the chromosomes,

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.920
where all of the genes and
the control elements lie

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.470
but we'll be focusing today on this region

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.013
at the end which is called the telomere.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.100
Telomeres provide two really important

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.670
functions for the cell.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.070
First of all, they have to
protect the chromosome ends.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.680
They protect the chromosome ends

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.470
from anything that would chew away,

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.970
a nucleus that may chew
a way from the end.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.780
They protect the ends from
recombination with other ends

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.020
and they protect the ends
from fusion with other ends.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.460
So this is a really essential

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.723
function for chromosome maintenance.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.740
The other thing that telomeres have to do,

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.710
is to allow the maintenance
of chromosome length

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.720
and we'll be going through
why that is very important

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.363
throughout most of the rest of the talk.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.580
So telomeres were first
functionally defined

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.540
by H.J. Muller and by Barbara McClintock

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.360
back in the late 30s and early 40s.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.270
So, Muller, working in Drosophila,

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.400
showed that telomeres were essential

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.330
to protect chromosome ends and McClintock

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.990
was working in the plant, maize or corn

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.070
and also came to the same conclusion,

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.010
that the telomeres were necessary

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.820
for protecting the chromosome ends.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.750
So this was a very early discovery

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.190
and it wasn't possible
to really understand,

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.550
in molecular detail, what a telomere was

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:23.320
or how carried out its function
until it was characterized

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.820
at the very molecular level.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.750
And so that occurred in the 1970s

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.470
with this organism here,
Tetrahymena thermophila.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.930
So Tetrahymena is a single-celled,

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.530
ciliated protozoum.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.140
If you went to the creek,

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.950
you'd be able to take some pond water

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.510
and see ciliates swimming around.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.930
And the Tetrahymena is very unique

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.530
because a single cell
contains 40,000 chromosomes.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.950
So this was the organism of choice

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.210
to try and identify what
is the molecular basis

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.870
for the function of these telomeres.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.270
And so in 1978, Elizabeth Blackburn,

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.670
working together with Joe Gall,

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.510
were able to define the molecular

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.140
sequence, the DNA sequence

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.750
that's at the very end of the chromosome.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.560
And what they found is that
there was a very simple,

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.000
repeated DNA sequence.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.690
So the DNA has normally four
different building blocks,

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.300
T, G, C, and A.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.520
In this case, it was simple repeats

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.800
of two Ts followed by four Gs

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.820
and then hundreds of those repeats,

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.810
on the ends of the chromosomes.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.150
So this was a very
important initial finding

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.750
because it then allowed
additional experiments

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.703
to be carried out to understand
the function of telomeres.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.820
So here's Joe gall and Liz Blackburn.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.300
I'm going to introduce
a number of the people

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.220
along the way because one of the themes

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.750
in science is, of course,
it's not just one person

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.120
making a discovery but many people

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.820
building on what others have done.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.030
So I'll try and give you a flavor

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.140
of some of the people that
have done the experiments

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.293
that I'm talking about, as I go along.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.600
So the first identification
of the DNA sequences

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.160
of telomeres, as I said,

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.010
was in this ciliated
protozoan tetrahymena.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.690
And the telomere sequence
was identified as T2, G4,

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.330
repeats of this sequence.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.170
And then subsequent work by a number

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.170
of other laboratories was able to show

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.030
that very similar, tandemly repeated,

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.870
simple GT-rich sequences were present

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.250
in a variety of other organisms.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.470
So for instance, in fungi,

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.480
there's a model organism,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.330
And here, the sequence was T,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.600
followed by either one,
two, or three G residues.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.970
And then I'll also be talking

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.390
about the human telomeric sequence.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.600
And in all vertebrates, including humans,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.550
the sequence is TTAGGG,
repeated many times.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.940
So this theme, it turns out,

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.890
repeats itself throughout
various organisms

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.610
and this is one thing that's very nice

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.400
about working on something
that is very fundamental

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.860
to biology and that is
that the same themes

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.623
occur throughout many different organisms.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.480
So the telomeric DNA contains

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.080
these tandem repeats of simple sequences.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.800
And of course, most of the DNA

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.570
in a cell is double-stranded,

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.510
so you have both the TG-rich sequence,

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.640
as well as a CA-rich sequence.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.470
Although there is a region at the very end

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.750
of the chromosome in which
it's single-stranded.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:30.230
But in order to carry out
this function of telomeres,

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.160
you require not just
the DNA but of course,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.770
there have to be proteins
that bind to that DNA,

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.570
that actually carry out the function

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.140
of the protecting the chromosome.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.630
and in mammalian cells,

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.310
this is a complex of proteins

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.730
called the Sheltering Complex,

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.000
which protect the chromosome ends

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.600
and so there are proteins that bind

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.330
along the length of the
double strand of the DNA,

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.150
proteins that to those proteins,

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.990
and the proteins that also protect

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:59.010
this single strand region.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.360
And it's together, this complex

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.037
of the proteins in the DNA, that carry out

00:12:03.037 --> 00:12:07.490
the telomere function that
we'll be discussing today.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:12.200
So it turns out that it
was first hypothesized

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.870
by Jim Watson and by others,

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.550
that if you look at the mechanism

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.160
by which chromosomes are copied,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.590
every time a cell has to divide,

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.750
that it was predicted that the chromosomes

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.880
should shorten from their ends
every time the cell divides.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.140
And this is because of
the molecular mechanism

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.800
that replicates the entire
length of the chromosome.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.210
So what one would predict
is that every time

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.990
a cell divides, the
telomeres should shorten

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.640
from their ends.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:45.053
And so you would have a loss
of these telomeric repeats.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:51.270
However, it turns out that
the way most organisms

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.580
that have these linear chromosomes

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.890
overcome this problem in replication

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:57.990
is through this enzyme telomerase

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:02.990
and that's what we were able
to show from Tetrahymena.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.240
So you may have some
telomere shortening here

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.620
but then the telomerase
will add these repeats

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.370
back on to the ends of chromosomes

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.050
so that chromosomes
aren't a unique length,

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.750
rather there's an equilibrium.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.260
There's always some shortening
and then some lengthening

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.160
and some shortening and some lengthening

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.320
and that way, the average length

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.130
of the average telomere
is maintained over time.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.450
So this is a rather baroque mechanism

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.510
that doesn't really avoid
the shortening problem

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.193
but rather, overcomes it.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.020
So we've been interested

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.970
in this telomerase enzyme
for a number of years.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.330
And of course, we don't
usually look at it,

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.140
as this kind of a little cartoon,

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.190
we're interested a little bit more

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.170
in the details of the mechanism.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.330
But I won't really have a chance

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.250
to get into many of
those details here today

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.610
but I'll just show you
some of the components

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.770
that go into this so telomerase,

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.630
so that I can tell you a little bit

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.233
about how we study its role.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.540
So the telomerase is a
really remarkable enzyme.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.560
It actually contains protein components

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.620
as well as an essential RNA component.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.130
So this is unusual for an enzyme.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.270
So this stick figure here
is meant to represent

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.780
the RNA component of telomerase.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.540
And the RNA component of telomerase

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:21.250
actually has a region which can base pair

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.480
with the telomere to be able to add

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.520
these telomeric repeats onto
the ends of the chromosome.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.320
And I'm introducing
this, not so much today,

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.570
to tell you about how
telomerase does this,

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.530
which is really a fascinating question,

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:37.190
but rather to introduce
you to the components

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:41.150
of telomerase that I'll be
discussing throughout the talk.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.710
So this protein here that carries out

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.620
a telomerase function, we call a TERT,

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.150
for telomerase reverse transcriptase.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.840
And so this carries out the catalytic

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.890
function of telomerase.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.530
And this RNA component,

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.740
we imaginatively call telomerase RNA,

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.560
abbreviated, TR.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.890
So you'll be hearing
about these components

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.763
throughout the rest of the talk.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.630
So having discovered that the way

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.240
that telomeres are maintained,

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.930
rather than having them shorten every time

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.810
the cells divide, rather to be maintained

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.920
by telomerase, we were
very curious to know

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.990
what would happen if you
don't have telomeres?

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.590
What would be the consequence

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:25.190
of not being able to
elongate the telomeres?

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.350
And so that led us, and
a number of other labs,

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:33.350
to two really fundamental
consequences of telomerase.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.710
So the question is why
does telomerase matter?

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.700
And it turns out that it's required

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.180
for all cells that have
to divide many times.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.550
So I'll be telling you
a little bit of a story

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:51.200
where telomerase is required
for the growth of cancer cells.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.590
So if you imagine that
you have a particular

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.520
set of cells here.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.830
One of those cells undergoes
some kind of a genetic change,

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:01.210
which allows it to divide more times

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.680
than it normally should.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.510
So that's this red cell here.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.340
And that red cell then will go and divide

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.170
many more times relative to
the other cells around it.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.520
And it turns out, in order for that cell

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.340
to continue dividing and form that tumor,

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.590
it has to solve this telomere problem,

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:19.450
that is the problem with
the telomere shortening

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:20.950
every time the cells divide.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.400
So these cancer cells need have telomerase

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.450
in order to maintain their telomeres

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.770
to go on and continue dividing.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.670
So I'll tell you a little bit about that.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.530
Telomerase is also essential

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.989
for a number of other cells in our body

00:16:36.989 --> 00:16:39.440
which have to also divide many times

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.010
and these would be stem cells
or tissue specific stem cells,

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:44.930
where you have a cell that makes

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.360
a copy of itself but then also has to make

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.270
what are called pluripotent stem cells,

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.080
these are our cells that will go on

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.950
and make the final tissue.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.760
So this, again, are
cells that have to divide

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.150
many times in order to replenish

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.649
the other cells in the body.

00:17:00.649 --> 00:17:02.870
So these are the two areas

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.620
that the telomerase clearly
plays an important role.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.880
And we'll be talking,
toward the end of the talk,

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.630
about how this role here

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.883
plays a role in age-related
degenerative disease.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:19.440
So we were very curious
about the role of telomerase

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.120
and what might happen if
you didn't have telomerase,

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.420
so we set out to generate a mouse

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.750
which doesn't have this activity.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:31.020
So instead of being able
to maintain the telomeres

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.050
by adding repeats onto the end,

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:38.050
we generated a knockout so
it had no telomerase at all.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.970
And then we wanted to study what happens

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.773
to that mouse when the
telomeres get to be short.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.570
So the way that we generated this mouse

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.090
that doesn't have telomerase,

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.220
was we had identified, as I told you,

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.600
the telomerase RNA, that's
abbreviated here, TR.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.510
The M stands for the mouse,

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.973
so it's the mouse version
of the telomerase RNA.

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:06.140
And we generated mice
because mice are diploid.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.360
Of course, they have two
copies of chromosomes.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.230
One from their mom and one from their dad.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.460
So we generated these mice
which are heterozygous,

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.560
in which, they have one normal copy

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.570
of the telomerase RNA
and then the other copy

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.510
is just missing the telomerase RNA.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.180
So it's a minus.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.000
So it has one copy instead of two copies.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.950
When you then take two such mice

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.793
and you breed them together,

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.740
as Mendel told us from genetics,

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.160
what you would get by breeding
these two mice together,

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.110
is you get mice that have two copies

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:42.940
of the telomerase RNA, mice
that are heterozygotes,

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.590
or have, like their parents,

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.820
one normal copy and one missing copy

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.540
or you get the mice
that are completely null

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.280
for telomerase and have
no enzyme whatsoever.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.290
So we generated these mice and remarkably,

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.410
the mice were perfectly fine.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.760
There was nothing wrong with them at all

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.200
and so we were curious what might happen

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.050
over time with these mice.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:09.680
So we designated these mice as the G1,

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.163
that is the first generation
that lack telomerase.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.500
So these G1 mice were
then bred to each other

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.150
and of course, you'd breed the G1 mice,

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:20.860
so these are null.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.670
You get the G2 knockout mice.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.490
You breed those mice together, you get G3.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.553
Et cetera, G4, G5, and G6.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.120
And I'll be showing you
that in these G6 animals,

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.890
we can't get a later generation

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:37.540
because one of the things that happens,

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:38.980
is these mice become infertile.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.260
There are a number of other consequences

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.860
of the loss of telomerase

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.920
but we don't get future generations.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.680
So as these mice are breeding,

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.270
what we found is that the telomeres,

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.520
with each generation of mouse,

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.640
were getting shorter and shorter.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.280
So the cartoon version
of this is shown here.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.870
We breed the G1 mice and we get the G2.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.170
We take these two G2
mice and now the G3 mice

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.200
have shorter telomeres
than their parents did.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.840
And then you breed the
G3 mice to each other

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.760
and the G4 mice have
even shorter telomeres.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.460
So with progressive generations,

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.190
there was progressive telomere shortening

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:21.550
and the way that we actually look at this

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:25.550
in the laboratory is a
very nice visual assay

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:28.710
that was developed by Peter Lansdorp.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.130
And what this is, is a way to look

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.810
at all of the chromosomes in the mice.

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:35.550
So these are metaphase spreads.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:39.400
So you take the the cells
when they're about to divide

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.090
and you can visualize the chromosomes

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.780
which are shown here in blue,

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.960
with a stain that's staining the DNA

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.690
and then the telomeres are visualized

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:52.360
with a fluorescent probe that recognizes

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.710
the telomere and the
intensity of this spot,

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:59.740
that is how many probes
are hybridizing there,

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.070
is proportional to how
long the telomere is.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.680
So the brighter the spot,

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.080
that means you have a longer telomere.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.490
And this is a very nice assay

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.080
because you can actually
see what's happening

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.400
to the chromosomes.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.733
So this is how we were able
to look at telomere length.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:19.490
And what we found when
you breed these mice down

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:23.080
in this nice line here is if you look

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.570
at the intensity of each one
of those red dots from before

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:30.540
versus the number of dots
that have that intensity,

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.580
you have this nice distribution

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.800
and this distribution is the normal way

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.100
that telomeres are maintained

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.160
and they're maintained
about this equilibrium

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.780
because there's some
shortening and lengthening

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.270
and shortening and lengthening.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:43.710
However, with each generation,

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:48.150
now, this is the G2, the G4, and the G6,

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.780
you can see that there's
progressively shorter

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.150
and shorter telomeres with each generation

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.760
that these mice are bred.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.040
One of the nice things
about this visual assay,

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.270
where you're actually
looking at the chromosomes,

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.300
is that we could show that not only

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.440
are we losing telomeric
sequence with each generation,

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.003
but we're actually losing
telomeric function.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.330
And I'll be telling you, in just a minute,

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:18.060
that we see effects

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.810
that is phenotypes in
these later generation mice

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:25.190
that we don't see in the
the first generation mice,

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.290
indicating that the short telomeres

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:30.169
are what's causing effects in these mice.

00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:32.710
So when we actually look

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.830
at the different generations of mice,

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.610
here is the wild-type mouse chromosomes

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.870
that I showed you, with these red dots

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.610
on the ends of the chromosomes.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.040
And you can see that
these mouse chromosomes

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.610
look like these little boomerangs,

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.890
they look like little Vs

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.870
because the centromere is all the way

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:54.370
along one end of the chromosome.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:56.590
So they're attached here and then the two

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.070
long arms are going off here.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:02.240
So you see this nice spread
of mouse chromosomes.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.210
In the second generation,
you also see that,

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:06.820
and also the fourth and in the sixth.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.270
But what was remarkable

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.980
is that in these very later generations,

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:14.140
what you see here is what
looks like two chromosomes

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.230
that have now fused through their ends.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.880
Instead of being little boomerangs,

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.770
they're two that are
attached to each other

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.020
and what that indicates is that not only

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.760
have we lost telomere sequence,

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.530
but we've lost telomere function.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.460
Because I told you that what telomeres do

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.240
is to protect the chromosome ends

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.140
and it protects them from
these kinds of recombination.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.040
So we can actually see

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.193
this loss of telomere function visually.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.310
So the mice,

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:45.730
once they get to be in the
fifth and sixth generation,

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:49.480
it turns out, have a number
of problems with them.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.510
So I mentioned, in the testes,

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.350
that these mice become infertile.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:58.150
So there's actually a cell
death of the germ cells.

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.560
In the intestine, the
normal intestinal cells

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:06.560
which allow cell turnover
isn't occurring properly,

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.120
so you have this atrophy.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.530
In the blood, there's bone marrow failure.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:13.770
So the blood is one cell type

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:17.070
where you have to have
cells continually renewing

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:21.160
because blood cells are dying every day.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.790
In the skin, there's
decreased wound healing

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:25.980
and there was premature graying

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.670
of these late generation mice.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.360
And it was remarkable that
all of these phenotypes

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.450
seen in these mice were seen

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:36.600
in the fifth and sixth generation mice.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.460
Okay, they were seen when
the telomeres were short

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.720
but not in the first generation mice

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.520
when telomerase was absent.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.710
So what that tells us is
that it takes some time

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:49.330
for the telomeres to get short

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.320
and it must be the short telomeres

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.510
that are causing these effects, okay?

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.540
So it's not the absence
of the telomerase enzyme

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.630
because if it were the
absence of telomerase,

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.250
you would see that in the
very first generation.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:05.040
The fact that we have to
wait for six generations

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.920
means it must be the short telomeres

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.470
that are causing these effects.

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:10.800
So I'm going to tell you now

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.760
about work from a student
who was able to show

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.950
that it was actually
the shortest telomeres

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.527
that that caused this effect.

00:25:18.527 --> 00:25:20.860
And this was Mike Hemann.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.570
And Mike did a series of experiments,

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:26.000
crossing mice with long telomeres

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.550
and mice with short telomeres

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:29.670
and what he was able to to show

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:32.040
is that it's actually
the shortest telomere

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.440
that leads to either
cell death or senescence.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.890
So just like the different
generations of mice,

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:41.633
the mice with the long
telomeres, there's no effect.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:45.060
As those cells are dividing now,

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.130
the telomeres become short
and the shortest telomere

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:50.850
in the cell is actually recognized

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:55.360
and it tells the cell that
there is damage going on

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.190
and what happens is the
cells either undergo

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:00.670
cell death or cellular senescence.

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:03.790
So cell death, you actually
get the absence of the cells

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.480
and cellular senescence is a phenomenon

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.350
where the cells just stop dividing

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:10.440
and they won't divide any further

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.750
but they're still staying around.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.110
So it's clearly the short telomeres

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:17.283
that are causing this effect.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.670
So we were interested,
then, in the consequence

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:25.600
of this short telomeres
causing cell death.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.080
And so I'll tell you one short story

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.500
where we were interested
in how this may play

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.743
a role in cancer.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.220
So we were interested in a
particular kind of cancer

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.890
and that's a cancer that
causes B-cell lymphoma.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:46.630
So this is a leukemia type cancer.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:49.900
And model mouse had been developed

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.460
and we called that mouse Emu-myc

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.590
because this expresses
a particular oncogene

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:59.110
and this mouse had been characterized

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.560
and it's very tumor prone

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.049
and will develop this B-cell lymphoma.

00:27:04.049 --> 00:27:05.860
So what we were able to do, then,

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:09.610
is to cross this with
the telomerase-null mouse

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:14.350
and ask what happens when
telomerase is not there.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:17.403
Can that tumor go on and develop?

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:20.980
And so of course, we have to be able

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.480
to understand what happens when you first

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.160
get rid of telomerase.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.759
So we look at the the first generation,

00:27:28.759 --> 00:27:31.860
the Emu-myc mice at are G1

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.080
and then of course, have to
breed and get the G2 mice,

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.560
the G3 mice, et cetera,

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.120
all the way up through the G6 mice

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.780
to understand the role
of the short telomeres

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.463
in this development of the tumor.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.309
So what we find is that there's a change

00:27:50.309 --> 00:27:53.970
in the survival of the
mice due to these tumors.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:57.110
And so I'll just walk you
through this graph here.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.160
This shows the percent
of mice that are alive

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.080
at the beginning of the experiment

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.770
versus the number of days.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.780
And so what's shown in the black line here

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.000
is this mouse which has been made prone

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.690
to these B-cell lymphomas.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.930
And so at the start, 100%
of the mice are alive

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.890
but if you follow this black line,

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.550
you can see that as time progresses,

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:22.800
at 100 days, about half
of these mice have died

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.400
and they've all died of
this B-cell lymphoma.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.983
So they get this tumor
at a very high rate.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:33.380
If we now look at the mice
which were absent for telomeres,

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.210
so they now don't have telomeres,

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:38.780
but they're the very first
generation that lacked telomeres.

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.620
What you find is a very
similar curve here in blue.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:47.230
So all of these mice are
dying of B-cell lymphoma

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:50.890
and they're all have
succumbed to this lymphoma

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:53.050
by about 200 days.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:54.780
However, in contrast,

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.920
when we breed that out
to the sixth generation,

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.250
where now the telomeres are
very short in these mice,

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:04.900
what we find is that
although there are some mice

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:09.850
that die early on, most
of the mice now survive

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:12.350
and what you can see in these mice

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:16.110
is that lymphoma started to grow

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:19.120
but then it stopped growing
and it stopped growing

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.550
because the telomeres were very short.

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.860
And as I told you, the short telomeres

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:26.530
then cause either cell death
or cellular senescence,

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:30.190
so they couldn't go on
and form that tumor cell.

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:32.400
And so this is one indication

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.720
that the the short telomeres will limit

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.780
the growth of cells and in this setting,

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.110
it's limiting the growth
of these cancer cells.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:44.280
So the short telomeres will
block the tumor growth.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:49.280
They don't block the early
stages that cause the cancer

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.820
but what they do is they block

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.630
the growth of the cancer cells.

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.190
So the telomerase itself
isn't playing a role

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:57.650
in the initiation of the cancer.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:59.799
However, when you have short telomeres,

00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:03.000
after those cells start
to grow for a while,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.660
you now block at this stage and the cells

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.603
can no longer go on and
form the full-blown tumor.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:12.520
So this was the work of David Feldser

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.570
who was another graduate student

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.970
in the laboratory who was breeding

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:22.073
these telomeres-null mice
to the B-cell lymphoma mice.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.970
So the other aspect I would like to focus

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:28.780
on now for the rest of the talk

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.300
is the role of telomerase
in tissue renewal.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.600
So we were very interested
in some of the early

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.897
effects that we saw in our 6th generation

00:30:38.897 --> 00:30:40.700
telomerase knockout mice.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:44.130
And we wanted to understand a little bit

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:47.490
more clearly what
happens in normal tissues

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.940
when you don't have telomerase

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:51.863
and the telomeres become short.

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.150
So a number of years earlier,

00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:00.010
we had been involved in a collaboration

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.870
with Cal Harley where we had shown

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.830
and others have also
shown that if you take

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:09.530
normal human cells and
you put those into culture

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.950
and you grow them for a
number of cell divisions,

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:13.390
it turns out what happens

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.110
is that the telomeres
shorten progressively

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.050
as the cells are dividing.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:20.550
So this is this end replication problem

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.670
that I told you about.

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:26.760
And so what is shown
here is a representation

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.320
of the distribution of telomere
lengths in human cells.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.320
Again, there's this heterogeneity

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.400
of the telomere lengths.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.310
And as these cells are dividing,

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:40.820
the length of this
telomere actually decreases

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.450
as the cells are dividing in culture.

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:46.550
So this was a first
indication that telomerase

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:48.280
may play a role, that short telomeres

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.490
may play a role in the inability

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:55.100
of human cells to continue to divide.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.780
And then a similar
phenomenon is actually seen

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.460
in people, not in cells and culture,

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.410
but rather with people of different age.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:08.360
So if you look at the mean telomere length

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.670
and the way that we get
that mean telomere length,

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:14.100
this is a representation
of the telomere length

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.540
and so you can determine
how long a telomere is here,

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.919
versus how long the mean telomere is here

00:32:19.919 --> 00:32:24.200
and if you simply plot
this on this graph here

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.120
and look at mean telomere length

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.470
versus the age of the person

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:31.300
from which you took those blood cells,

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.160
so this is now in normal
human white blood cells,

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.510
what you find is that there
is progressive shortening

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:42.080
of the telomeres with increasing
numbers of cell division.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.700
Now, at first what we thought
that this might represent

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.500
is the fact that these white blood cells

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.630
might not have telomerase activity

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:54.610
and therefore the telomeres
are shortening progressively.

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:56.580
Although what I'm going to show you

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.870
is that they do have
some telomerase activity

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:02.270
but the number of times white blood cells

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:06.450
have to divide outstrips the ability

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:08.510
of the telomerase to be able to keep up

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:09.810
and elongate the telomeres.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:13.510
So over this long course
of cell divisions,

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.130
what you see is this progressive

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.280
telomere shortening in the bulk

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:22.280
of the white blood cells
in all normal individuals.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.840
So the point that I'm going to make

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.430
is that telomerase is limiting in cells.

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:30.770
There's really just
enough telomerase activity

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.250
in order to keep up with telomeres

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.970
on the chromosomes that are where

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:37.150
the telomeres are the shortest.

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:41.320
So this story comes from a
number of different angles

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:45.810
but the first hint that
the short telomeres

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:48.240
might play a role in human disease

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.530
came actually, again, from understanding

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:52.810
molecular components
just like understanding

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.890
the molecular component of
the telomere DNA sequence

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:58.670
allowed us to understand what happens

00:33:58.670 --> 00:33:59.679
with telomere shortening.

00:33:59.679 --> 00:34:02.930
In this case, it's
understanding the structure

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.970
of the RNA component.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:08.100
So the telomerase RNA

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.690
has this structure here

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:15.630
and it was first identified
with Cathy Collin's lab,

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:18.630
here at Berkeley and also in my lab,

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:23.140
that there's this
particular structure here

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.010
which binds to a set of proteins,

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:27.310
in addition to this TERT protein

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:29.340
which is necessary for
telomerase activity.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:32.440
There's a set of proteins
that binds to this structure

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.060
and one of those proteins

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:37.720
involves this protein
here called dyskerin.

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.920
And this dyskerin protein was known

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:44.290
to be involved in human genetic disease.

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:49.290
And so that then led to just
the next year after this,

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:52.680
a publication by a group
of human geneticists

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.630
who were very interested in this disease,

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:56.620
dyskeratosis congenita.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.390
And I'll tell you just in a second

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:01.530
what dyskeratosis congenita is,

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:04.120
but what was happening
here is that this group

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.940
was very interested in this
inherited human disease.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.970
And so they were mapping, in families,

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:15.590
this disease, not knowing what caused it.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:17.680
And by doing this genetic mapping,

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.740
they were then able to
identify that in this case,

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:25.030
the cause was the RNA
component of telomerase.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:28.100
So the title of the paper
that was published in 2001,

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.940
the RNA component of telomerase

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:34.390
is mutated in autosomal
dominant dyskeratosis congenita.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.840
So this really galvanized people

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.540
to understand how it is that telomerase

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:43.573
can play a role in this
inherited genetic disease.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.133
So the clinical manifestations
of dyskeratosis congenita.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.960
It gets its name because
of skin and nail problems.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.800
Fingernails and toenails.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.610
That's why the term is dyskeratosis,

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:02.250
because of the keratosis

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:05.290
in the fingernails and the skin.

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:10.070
So that's how the physicians
would see their patient,

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:11.290
that was the most common

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:13.960
visual manifestation of this disease.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.520
Although it was known that
the mortality of the disease

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.390
was due to bone marrow failure.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:22.300
Okay, so the inability of the bone marrow

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.250
to continue making all
of normal blood cells

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.930
that we require every single day.

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:31.400
So this is an example of this requirement

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.810
for stem cells to differentiate

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:37.293
into all of the different
blood cell types.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:41.260
So that was the initial characterization

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:44.870
of the human disease and the question was,

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:47.720
how is it that the telomerase

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.193
can play a role in this human disease?

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:56.270
So we got involved with
this at Johns Hopkins

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:59.440
because a patient came in
to the hematology clinic

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.310
at Johns Hopkins and as I was mentioning,

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:05.880
we don't do science in a vacuum.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.720
We talked to our colleagues
and I was talking

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.410
with a variety of the people
in the clinical departments

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:18.310
to understand how to study
the blood cell effects

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:19.600
and this patient came in,

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.610
and this is the family of this patient.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:25.450
But this patient came into the clinic

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:29.850
and was diagnosed as having this disease,

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:31.430
dyskeratosis congenita.

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:34.380
And so at the time, Mary Armanios

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:38.460
decided to understand
more about this family

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:42.040
because what was known was
that this keratosis congenita

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:45.910
was often mutations in this
RNA component of telomerase.

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:47.970
So she brought these individuals

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:50.620
within this family into the clinic

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:53.540
and was able to identify
that there weren't mutations

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:56.720
in the RNA component of
telomerase but there are mutations

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.150
in the protein component of telomerase.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:02.493
So again, this is a
telomerase-mediated disease.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.240
And I show you this family,

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.290
this individual that came into the clinic

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:10.730
and his father and his grandmother

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:13.120
and those individuals here shown in black

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.760
had these changes, these mutations,

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.173
in the telomerase, in the family.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:22.500
And so this inheritance of this disease

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.510
was shown to be autosomal dominant

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.810
and I'll tell you a little
bit about what we know

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:29.193
about that autosomal dominant inheritance.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.400
One of the remarkable
things about this family

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.870
was that the the disease showed something

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:38.810
that we call genetic anticipation.

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:41.860
And that's a fancy way of saying

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:45.880
that with each generation
that has the disease,

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.180
there's an earlier onset of the disease

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:53.210
and more severity of the disease, okay?

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:56.610
And this may remind you of
our telomerase knockout mouse.

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:58.510
In the telomerase knockout mouse,

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:01.090
we didn't see anything in
the first few generations

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:03.840
but then we saw effects
in the later generations.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.020
And so the same thing
seemed to be occurring

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:10.933
in this human family with
this inherited disease.

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:14.710
The other thing that was
really quite remarkable

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:17.560
is that those people that
were affected with the disease

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.700
and had this bone marrow failure

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.190
actually were heterozygous.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:26.250
That is, they contained one normal copy

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:31.080
and one mutant copy of
the telomerase gene.

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.910
And that was quite remarkable to us

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:35.970
because in a lot of
human genetic diseases,

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:39.350
you have to have two mutant copies

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:42.080
in order to actually have an effect.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.770
So this really got us thinking

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:48.550
about how could it be that
you could be heterozygous,

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:52.170
that is, have one normal
copy and one mutant copy.

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:55.950
And so as geneticist,
what we thought about,

00:39:55.950 --> 00:40:00.190
was two molecular mechanisms
that might underlie

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:03.290
this inheritance pattern
in these families.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:06.010
And one of those is what's
called dominant negative

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:08.410
and the other is haploinsufficiency.

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:10.310
So what that basically means

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:14.930
is that if you have one mutant
copy and one normal copy

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:18.120
it could be that the
mutant copy actually binds

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.130
to the normal copy and
takes it out of function.

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:22.280
So that's a dominant mechanism.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:26.040
The mutant is dominant
over the normal copy.

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:29.550
An alternative would be that
you have one mutant copy

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:32.960
and one normal copy and
it's just not enough

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.410
to have one normal copy of the telomerase.

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:38.650
And so we realized that
we were in the position

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:43.630
where we could test this
genetically, directly in our mice.

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:44.900
So that's what we set out to do,

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.070
was to determine whether
there's a dominant effect

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.250
or whether it's haploinsufficiency.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:52.210
And what I'll tell you, is our evidence

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:54.460
that it's actually haploinsufficiency.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:58.290
It's just not enough to have only one copy

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:00.633
of the functional telomerase.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.470
So what's shown here is a representation

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:08.060
of the the telomeres again.

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.850
This is a southern blot.

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:12.770
But now we're looking at mice,

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.910
so these are the the mice

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:17.650
that we had initially been characterizing.

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:19.260
And you can see that there's this very,

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:23.190
very long, heterogeneous size

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:26.030
to the telomeres in this
particular strain of mice.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.340
However, we looked at a variety

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:32.680
of other strains of mice and
this is one that's shown here

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:35.403
and you can see that the long telomeres

00:41:35.403 --> 00:41:38.260
that are here in this initial strain,

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:43.260
now are represented by a
much less heterogeneous

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.890
and shorter telomere
length in this other strain

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:49.310
of mice that we call castaneous,

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:50.730
for Cast/Ei.

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:54.140
And so we thought that
we would be able to see

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.800
what's actually happening to telomeres

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.890
much more easily on this
new genetic background.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:02.220
And I'll just represent that here.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:06.770
So if you imagine that you
have this telomere length

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:11.460
with the signal intensity
of those red spots,

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:13.020
the original mouse that we were using

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.830
had very long heterozygous telomeres.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.720
However, this new mouse has much shorter,

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.900
much more homogeneous telomeres.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.000
And so what we imagined might happen,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.680
would be, after you have
telomere shortening,

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.440
if there's a threshold
below which the telomeres

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.810
have to go before you have some sort

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:33.360
of functional consequence,

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:37.110
when you have telomere
shortening in these settings,

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:40.010
a much higher proportion of the cells

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:41.720
would fall below this threshold

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:45.500
when you have this much more
homogeneous telomere length.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.280
And so that's what we had set out to do,

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.560
was to generate mice that now

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.733
have a much more homogeneous
set of telomeres.

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:56.590
And these experiments
actually were initiated

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:58.590
by Mike Hemann, who I showed you earlier,

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:01.470
and then continued by Ling-Yang Hao,

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:05.903
who then really had some
remarkable discoveries.

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:09.400
So what Ling-Yang set out to do,

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.080
was to take these mice now,

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:14.130
where we can see phenotypes more easily

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:16.820
and to ask, what happens if these mice

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:21.010
are always have one normal
copy and one mutant copy?

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:24.090
That is, they are maintained
as heterozygous mice.

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:26.980
Okay, so rather than breeding these mice

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.320
and looking at the mice
that have no telomerase.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.350
Now, we're breeding these mice

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:34.420
and looking, just like
in the human studies,

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:37.770
of always having the case
of having one normal copy

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:39.360
and one wild-type copy.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.950
So that's what we call the
heterozygous generation one,

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:43.590
heterozygous generation two,

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:45.700
heterozygous generation three.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.940
And what we saw was, remarkably,

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.220
there is progressive telomere shortening

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:53.130
as you breed these mice
that have just one copy

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:56.440
of telomerase instead of having
two copies of telomerase.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.790
And so I'll just quickly
show you that data,

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:02.070
to make that point.

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:04.690
So if you have a signal intensity here,

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:06.350
and wild-type is shown in black

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:10.270
so you have this telomere
length distribution.

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:12.970
The knockout mouse have a shorter telomere

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:16.620
length distribution, as
we had previously shown.

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.010
But what was really important

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:20.630
is that the heterozygous
generation one mice,

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:24.360
shown in gray, are
shorter than the wild-type

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:28.190
and more importantly, the
heterozygous generation five mice

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.040
are shorter than the
heterozygous generation one,

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.310
showing that we actually have progressive

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:37.820
telomere shortening when
you have haploinsufficiency.

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:41.010
So this was quite remarkable.

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:42.970
And that gets back to the point again,

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:45.590
that telomerase is limiting in cells.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:47.350
That having just half the level

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:50.140
over a number of generations
doesn't allow you

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:52.223
to be able to maintain telomere length.

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:57.060
If you now look at the
survival of those mice

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.300
and this is, once again,
one of those survival curves

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.730
that I showed you earlier

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:04.880
with the percent of mice alive
versus the number of days

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:07.440
and I'll just have you focus
on two of these curves.

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.880
The wild-type, so in black up here,

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.140
is the wild-type mice over 400 days.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:17.980
And down here are the
heterozygous generation 10 mice.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:21.180
Now, you see that there's
a significant death

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.880
of these mice due to the short telomeres.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.930
And there's actually,
with each generation,

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:30.490
there's a progressive decline
in the viability of the mice.

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:34.710
And this looks very much
like the genetic anticipation

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:36.400
that's seen in the human families

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.363
that have dyskeratosis congenita.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:43.993
So the inheritance of short
telomeres decreases survival.

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:46.340
And as I said, this resembles

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:49.773
the genetic anticipation seen
in dyskeratosis congenita.

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:53.260
So these telomerase deficient mice

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.150
have many of the same defects

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:58.600
that are seen in the human patients.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:02.408
Bone marrow failure, intestinal atrophy,

00:46:02.408 --> 00:46:07.000
immune senescence, they're
chemotherapy intolerant

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.433
and they show this genetic anticipation.

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.250
And the mortality in these mice

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:15.893
is due primarily to these
immune system defects.

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:21.010
And all of these experiments
would not be possible,

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:24.520
were it not for a really remarkable

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.670
mouse handler here, Margaret Strong,

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:30.753
who did all of the intricate
breedings for these mice.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:35.630
So one of the most interesting

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:37.440
things about this set of experiments

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.530
was of course, every time you breed

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.480
two mice that are heterozygous,

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.650
have one copy that's
wild-type and one mutant,

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:47.420
you get out a heterozygous generation

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:50.710
and we can breed these
for many generations

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:52.390
but at each stage of breeding,

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:54.260
we get out, of course, the wild-type,

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:55.840
the next generation heterozygote,

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.640
and we get out the knockout.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.870
And I can remember when Ling-Yang Hao

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:02.090
came into my office one day and he said,

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:04.700
I wonder what would happen
if we looked at the telomeres

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:08.820
of the wild-type mice that
come from these crosses.

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:12.050
And so he did that and
what I'll show you here,

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:14.790
is we designate that wild-type star

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:17.430
because it turns out that
with the progressive breeding

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:20.910
in the heterozygous state,
even the wild-type telomeres

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:23.930
that come out were
short because telomerase

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:27.813
is limiting and the telomere
lengths weren't restored.

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.480
So that's shown here.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:33.690
Again, here's the
intensity of the telomeres,

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:34.880
the length of the telomeres.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.470
Here's the wild-type telomere length,

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:40.020
the knock out just for reference.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:43.190
The heterozygous generation
five I showed you earlier

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:46.060
is shorter than wild-type
but quite remarkably,

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.710
the wild-type five star,
that is the the littermates,

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:53.560
the brothers and sisters
from these heterozygous mice

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.770
also have telomeres that are significantly

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:58.100
shorter than their wild-type counterparts.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.940
And that's because telomerase is limiting.

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.640
You don't have enough
telomerase to go around

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:07.890
and top up all of the telomeres
in just one generation.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:09.880
So I've been making the point to you

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.170
that it's the short telomeres

00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:12.460
that are causing these phenotypes.

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.030
When the telomeres get short,

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:16.720
you cause a damage
response and the cells die.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.250
So quite remarkably, when
we looked in these mice,

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:24.120
these wild-type star mice
also had the same effects

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:27.090
as the mutant mice had.

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:29.850
And this, as I said, is quite remarkable.

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:34.250
So if we look at either
the testis apoptosis,

00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:36.700
that is the the cell death
that occurs in the testes

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.450
or the immune system defects,

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:40.700
if we look at the spleen weight,

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:45.400
the wild-type star mice
had significant reductions.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.820
So this was really quite remarkable

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:52.380
because now we have an
inherited genetic defect

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:57.110
but even now in the case where
the genetics is restored,

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:58.850
the telomere length hasn't been restored

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:00.620
and we still have an effect.

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:03.920
So we called this genetic disease

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.310
in the absence of the telomerase

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:06.800
mutation that caused the disease,

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.230
we called that an occult genetic effect,

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:11.290
a hidden genetic effect.

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:13.350
And it's because the telomeres themselves

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:16.550
haven't yet been restored to
their normal telomere length.

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:18.950
And now, this might be a kind of a cute

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.910
little trick that is, okay,

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:24.320
so we have something, we
now call it occult genetics,

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:26.880
but it actually matters because recall,

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.970
this is an inherited human genetic disease

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:32.640
and you have these
individuals walking around

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.180
that have heterozygous mutations

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:37.880
and the only way to treat a
number of these individuals,

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.500
for instance, who have
bone marrow failure,

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.240
is with a bone marrow transplant.

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.190
So you can imagine,

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:45.890
if you have telomerase
mutation in the family

00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:48.030
and you have one brother that needs

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:51.190
a bone marrow transplant
because he has short telomeres,

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:53.750
that his brother or his cousin,

00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:56.070
who may not have the
mutation in telomerase,

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:58.150
might still have short telomeres.

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:01.210
And so it's important to
know what the telomere

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:05.150
length is of the the donor bone marrow

00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:06.820
rather than just the genetics.

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:08.620
So this actually matters

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:11.023
to the treatment of this human disease.

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:13.300
So it's the short telomeres,

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:16.150
not the absence of telomerase
that's causing the disease.

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.960
So just to round out this story,

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.820
it turns out that having identified

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.010
this genetic anticipation where you see

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:28.820
this worsening of
phenotype and earlier onset

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.480
of this bone marrow failure,

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.990
it turns out that there are other diseases

00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:36.220
that these short telomeres are causing

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.730
besides the bone marrow failure.

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:39.960
And so the first one to be identified

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:44.450
was something called
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:46.860
Idiopathic because we
didn't know what caused it

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:50.037
and it turns out that it's
caused by the short telomeres.

00:50:50.037 --> 00:50:52.940
And this was recognized by Mary Armanios

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:56.020
because she saw this genetic anticipation

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:58.890
in this family that had
come into the clinic.

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:00.690
And so it was identified

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:03.190
that it was actually telomerase mutations

00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:07.320
that underlie this other
human genetic disease.

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:11.520
And as we've been able
to understand more fully,

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.340
Mary has been able to characterize

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:15.900
what she calls a syndrome
of telomere shortening.

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:18.770
That is, there are a
number of different effects

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:20.290
of having these short telomeres.

00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:24.080
There are these bone marrow
failure effects in the blood,

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.800
the lung effects, the pulmonary fibrosis,

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.110
liver disease, and as these studies

00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:31.670
are continuing and ongoing, it's clear

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:33.910
that there are going to be a
number of different effects.

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:37.180
And very interestingly,
all of these diseases

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.600
are actually diseases that are associated

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.420
with the normal aging process.

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:45.610
That is, they are normal,
age-related degenerative disease.

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:48.410
So even in families
that haven't necessarily

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:50.390
inherited one of these mutations,

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:53.510
if you have short telomeres,
you may be at risk

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:56.320
for a number of these age-related
degenerative diseases,

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.143
due to the short telomeres.

00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:02.410
So this is taken from another group

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:03.690
and this is just an example

00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:05.980
of what I had shown you previously.

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:09.980
If you look at telomere length versus age

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:12.520
and this is now just
looking at white blood cells

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.870
from normal people, what you see

00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:18.290
is that there is this decrease
in telomere length with age

00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:20.220
but also what's really quite remarkable

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:22.530
is there's a huge amount of heterogeneity

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:24.100
within the human population.

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:28.210
If you look at a large
number of individual people,

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:30.610
you find that there's this great decrease

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:32.990
and there's been a
little bit of information

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:36.630
in the lay press about how, maybe,

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:39.570
telomeres can tell you how old you are.

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:41.880
However, due to this, of course,

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.410
hopefully you would know how old you are.

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:46.860
But (laughs) the telomeres

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:49.630
could determine, if you didn't
know how old someone was.

00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:51.200
But if you look at the heterogeneity here

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.200
and I gave you a sample of DNA

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.080
and that DNA had telomeres that were 7kb.

00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.300
Okay, that person could be 20

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.800
or that person could be 70.

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:05.550
So it's not something
that's so determinative

00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:08.280
that we can say for sure
if you have a certain

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.930
telomere length that
there's a particular effect.

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:14.337
However, this heterogeneity

00:53:14.337 --> 00:53:17.750
and this decrease in telomere
length in the population,

00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:20.730
those individuals that have
the shortest telomeres,

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:23.510
we know are at risk for disease.

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:27.080
So you can model this
heterogeneity in the population

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:29.290
with confidence intervals
and this was done

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:32.040
by Peter Lansdorp and Mary Armanios

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.970
has also done that at Johns Hopkins.

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:38.320
And so what you get here is
this normal distribution.

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:42.030
So if you look at telomere
length versus age,

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:45.810
these lines here were developed
on 400 normal individuals

00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:48.530
and you can say that if
you're above this line,

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:52.610
then that's the 99th
percentile of telomere length.

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:54.490
So this is the normal distribution

00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:57.200
of telomere length in the population.

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.760
And if you look, now, in a
number of these families,

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:03.550
where you see this
inherited genetic disease,

00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:05.250
those people in the families

00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:08.260
that do not have the telomerase mutation

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:11.340
fall here around this 50th percentile.

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:14.350
However, those individuals
that do have the mutation

00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:17.840
typically fall below the first percentile.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:20.350
So those individuals with
the shortest telomeres

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:23.270
are the ones that are at risk
for the bone marrow failure,

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:26.660
the pulmonary fibrosis, and
the liver complications.

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:31.340
And as I hope that I've
been making apparent,

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:33.080
that since it's the short telomeres,

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:37.780
not the mutation itself
that causes the disease,

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:41.870
any individual that falls
below the first percentile

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:43.960
may be at risk for these disease,

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:47.190
not just those that are in these families

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:49.470
with these inherited syndromes.

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:51.570
So many diseases that are seen in families

00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:54.230
with insufficient
telomerase share features

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:56.860
of these age-related degenerative disease.

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:59.060
So we know that bone marrow failure

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:03.900
is, in the normal population,
an age-related complication.

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:07.520
As is immune senescence,
chemotherapy intolerance.

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.360
Pulmonary fibrosis typically is diagnosed

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:13.090
in the sixth or seventh decade.

00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:15.980
Liver disease and also, paradoxically,

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:18.900
there's increased cancer incidence.

00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:21.560
So the short telomeres may play a role

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:24.690
in the wider population,
not simply in the subset

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:27.393
of people with inherited
mutations in telomerase.

00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:31.070
So just to summarize,

00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:33.920
I've told you that telomeres

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:37.190
are required for
chromosome end protection.

00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:42.190
Telomerase is essential for
telomere length maintenance.

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:45.580
Telomere shortening leads
to either cell death

00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:49.550
or cell senescence after
many cell divisions.

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:52.420
Short telomeres limit tissue renewal

00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:56.390
and contribute to age-related
degenerative disease.

00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:59.200
And then, just to come back to the point

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.380
about fundamental discoveries,

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:04.480
new discoveries often
come from unlikely places.

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.330
When we set out to understand

00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:09.470
how it is that telomeres are maintained

00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:11.820
on the ends of chromosomes,
due to replication,

00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:14.610
we weren't looking to understand

00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:17.080
age-related degenerative disease or cancer

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.190
but by following our curiosity,

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:22.880
it turns out that the
telomere clearly plays a role

00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:25.963
in both these diseases.

00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.920
So curiosity-driven research provides

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:31.460
unexpected discoveries
that can have important

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:33.500
implications for human health.

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:36.970
And these are the current
members of my laboratory.

00:56:36.970 --> 00:56:39.110
We collaborate with Mary Armanios

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:42.070
and her group and many of the experiments

00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:45.500
that I told you were done by past members.

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:48.290
And this is just a slightly older picture

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:51.307
of my laboratory when they
all dressed up as chromosomes.

00:56:51.307 --> 00:56:53.770
(audience laughing)

00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:55.560
And then the laboratory currently,

00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:56.750
it's a little out of focus

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:59.440
but this was the political campaign

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.790
for the American Society of Cell Biology.

00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:03.520
We are research giving a face

00:57:05.702 --> 00:57:07.870
to basic science.

00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:09.692
So I'll stop there.

00:57:09.692 --> 00:57:12.859
(audience applauding)

00:57:14.995 --> 00:57:17.578
(upbeat music)
