00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.235
MALE SPEAKER: Today
with us-- Paul Vigna

00:00:04.235 --> 00:00:06.650
and Michael Casey
with the book called

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.810
"The Age of Cryptocurrency."

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.660
So before we talk, I want
to tell you a little story.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.890
Who of you were here when
Google announced a partnership

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.520
with Virgin Galactic, forming
a company Virgle, which

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.770
would go and colonize Mars?

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.290
Any hands?

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.690
No, you don't remember that.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.440
Well, anyway, we did that
as an April fool's joke,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.440
and the response was tremendous,
like hundred millions

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.650
of views in the first 24 hours.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.780
And when people realized that
was just an April fool's joke,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.150
we got a lot of mail
like, oh, man, why not?

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.790
It's time for doing it.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.330
Like today's SpaceX is doing
something along those way.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.520
So anyway, a couple of weeks
ago, I noticed on the internet

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.010
that Finance Minister of
Greece, Mr. Varoufakis

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.750
has announced that
Greece will actually

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.800
switch to Bitcoin, because of
all the financial troubles.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.880
And boy, I was surprised.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.280
And then I realized, like
after 15 minutes of research,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.910
well, that was a well-played
April fool's joke.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.000
And, of course, the
best April Fool's jokes

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.010
are the ones that are plausible.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.400
So today with us, we have
Paul Vigna and Michael Casey,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.970
who will get us into what is
this digital cryptocurrency,

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.850
and like what is
its possible effects

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.570
on the economic systems,
on the established order.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.660
Let me just give a
brief introduction.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.930
So Paul Vigna boasts
a collective 20 years

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.070
of journalism experience
as a market reporter

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.560
for the "Wall Street Journal."

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.600
Columnist and anchor for
"Money Beat," writer and editor

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.910
of the "Market Talk" column
in "Dow Jones Newswires."

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.200
Paul has been a guest of the
Fox business news network, CNN,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.290
the BBC, and the John
Batchelor radio show.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.360
He has been interviewed
by "Bitcoin Magazine"

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.770
and appears on the "Bitcoins
and Gravy" podcast.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.920
Michael Casey writes
for the "Wall Street

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.616
Journal" covering global finance
in his "Horizons" column.

00:02:02.616 --> 00:02:04.240
Casey has written
for such publications

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.660
as "Foreign Policy,"
the "Washington Post"

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.270
and the "Financial Times."

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.740
He's a frequent contributor to
the journal's "Money Beat" blog

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.110
and co-authors the daily
[INAUDIBLE] with Paul Vigna.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.230
He's host of the book-themed
video series "Wall Street

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.850
Journal After Work"
and a frequent guest

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.840
and host of the [INAUDIBLE]
and "MoneyBeat."

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.410
He's the author of
two books-- "Che's

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.590
Afterlife, The
Legacy of an Image,"

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.040
and one of Michiko Kakutani's
best books of 2009.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.890
And "The Unfair Trade, How
Our Broken Financial System

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.720
Destroys the Middle Class."

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.590
Today, however, we will
be talking about the book

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.860
"The Age of Cryptocurrency."

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.680
Please join me in
welcoming Michael and Paul.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.320
PAUL VIGNA: I have
just become convinced

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.720
within the last
couple of minutes

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.540
actually that our being
asked to speak at Google

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.890
was not an April
Fool's Day joke.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.580
I was not at all sure
until very recently.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.212
So thanks for coming
out, everybody.

00:03:09.212 --> 00:03:09.920
Glad you're here.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.360
Glad everyone out in the
world there is also listening.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.670
So this is going to
actually function almost

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.280
as two separate speeches.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.934
I'm going to talk
for a little while,

00:03:19.934 --> 00:03:21.350
and then Mike is
going to come up.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.933
I'm going to hand
off to him, and he's

00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:24.470
going to talk for
a little while.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.730
And the two, they dovetail.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.120
So hopefully, it will appear
like one seamless conversation.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.550
But you're getting two for
the price of one here today.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.900
So that said, first thing, I
want to start off-- I just want

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.802
a question.

00:03:40.802 --> 00:03:42.260
And not that you
have to answer it.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.384
It's a rhetorical question.

00:03:43.384 --> 00:03:44.650
I'll answer it.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.420
The question is, did
the financial crisis

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.980
matter to Bitcoin?

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.910
Did 2008 matter to what
happened to Bitcoin?

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.050
And there are really
different opinions about this.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.460
On the one hand, you look at
it, and Bitcoin sort of exploded

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.540
right when the financial
crisis happened.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.530
And on the other hand, there
are people that say no.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.630
It didn't matter.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.000
Bitcoin is a product.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.030
It's an innovation.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.750
It would have gone
out in the world

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.050
and done what it has
done regardless of that.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.740
And some of the people
who hold that latter view

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.209
are extremely intelligent
people, some of the people

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.780
who are really involved in this.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.905
And they have a very
strong opinion about it,

00:04:24.905 --> 00:04:27.590
that Bitcoin is a
product, it is software.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.970
It is something that is valuable
in and of its own right.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.560
And it would have gone
out into the world

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.790
and made its way regardless
of when it was released.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.910
But I can't help but
think that 2008 did matter

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.750
to what happened
to Bitcoin-- that

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.960
a decentralized, peer to peer
encrypted, anonymous currency

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.490
system that came out at the
depths of the financial crisis

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.430
struck a very strong chord
with a lot of people.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.260
And that's the "Wall
Street Journal."

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.900
Mike and I write for them.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.360
And you talk about
the period of 2008.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.160
And you talk about really
the entire period of 2008,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.500
when the crisis
started, through 2012,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.520
through 2013, where you just
had the entire global financial

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.930
system lurching from
crisis to crisis,

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.200
just a cataclysm that threw
millions of people out

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.390
of work, that just waylaid
entire economies, from here

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.710
to Europe and Asia.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.880
I mean, it really was a
massive just disaster.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.380
Right?

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.150
I don't need to tell you guys
what kind of disaster it was.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.660
We all lived through it.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:42.970
And what I think that helped
do is, you have this crisis.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.100
You have this--
not just a crisis

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.700
of economies, a crisis of
daily-- stock markets-- it's

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.780
a crisis of confidence.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.289
You have this system
that we're all born into,

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:54.330
that we all grew up with.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.880
The financial edifice that
we never had to question.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.750
You never really
worried about it.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.480
Suddenly, the thing seems
unbelievably fragile

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.690
and unbelievably shaky.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.900
And let's not kid
ourselves, too.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.760
It did crash.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.896
It did collapse.

00:06:09.896 --> 00:06:11.520
Governments had to
come in and bail out

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.747
the companies, the banks.

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:14.830
Governments had to come
in and prop up the system.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.790
I mean, this was an
absolute collapse.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.110
This was a problem.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.070
And into that comes Bitcoin.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.960
Nobody knows exactly
where it came from.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.970
Nobody knows who
Satoshi Nakamodo is.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:34.110
He releases it to this group of
cypherpunks on a mailing list.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.850
It gets very little
attention at first.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.150
And what I think is
interesting-- I'm

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.030
jumping around a
little bit there--

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.874
is that the cypher-- I
don't know how many of you

00:06:43.874 --> 00:06:45.290
are familiar with
the cypherpunks.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.260
But they were this group
of cryptography experts,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.110
very concerned about
issues of privacy,

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.180
about issues-- all the
issues that revolve

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.610
around privacy and technology.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.140
And they've been dealing with
this for decades, and decades

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.560
ago, had been thinking about
a digital currency, a coin.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.450
This is one of
their prime ideas,

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.540
had worked on it
for a long time.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.810
All of these
different precursors,

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.780
protocoins if you
want to, they'd

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.750
all failed for one
reason or another.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.880
So that by the time Nakomodo
comes around in 2008

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.820
and releases Bitcoin,
they've kind of given up.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.740
They've moved on.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.700
They really did not give it
a lot of attention at first.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.530
But through this
period that we're in,

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:33.380
2008, 2009, and the crisis, it
starts to gain some adherence.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.770
It's very small.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.780
But it starts to
gain some very, very

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.400
passionate, passionate
people around this idea.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.240
And they are attached to it.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.240
And you can see this.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.070
What's really
interesting too is if you

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.470
go on the old-- not
the old, the current.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.380
But if you go on the
Bitcoin message boards,

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.671
you can go back and look at
the entire history of them.

00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:54.620
They're all there.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.800
It's all online.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.470
And in researching the
book, I had done this.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.880
I had gone back
and looked at it.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.696
And it's fascinating.

00:08:01.696 --> 00:08:02.320
You can see it.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.840
It goes from a couple of people,
to a couple dozen of people,

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.660
to a couple of hundred people,
to thousands of people.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:15.709
And they are fueled by this idea
of a solution to this problem

00:08:15.709 --> 00:08:17.250
that the real world
is going through.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:21.050
All the time that we're seeing
these headlines, this solution

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.420
of an alternative currency that
completely sidesteps everything

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.530
that is giving us
all these problems.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:32.460
And you start to see a community
grow up around Bitcoin.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.007
And this photo, I'm very
proud of this photo.

00:08:35.007 --> 00:08:36.590
Because if you look
in the reflection,

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.010
you can see that's me taking it.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:42.820
So I kind of photobombed
my own selfie.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.920
So that's my thing.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.470
And what you see in the
years-- in these years,

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.640
this period of 2008
to 2012, really--

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.570
is a community of
extremely passionate people

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.650
coalesce around a currency,
which is a really odd thing.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.080
I mean, to think of a
counterculture movement born

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.120
around a coin, even
a digital coin,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.660
it doesn't usually happen.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.850
But this community
grows, and it's techies.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.350
It's libertarians.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:17.370
It's people who are just kind
of fed up with the system.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.210
And it becomes a
cultural movement.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.690
It was really interesting.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.780
And what you start to see is--
and I'm going to pull up here.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.900
This is some artwork by
a California photographer

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:33.380
named Megan Miller, who did a
photography series on Bitcoin.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.870
And this is what
you start to see.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:39.740
You start to see not just folks
like you, technological folks.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.110
Not just political folks.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:45.150
But you start to see people who
start wearing the B, the badge,

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.670
as a symbol of something.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.380
And Megan's artwork I
thought was very interesting.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.960
And so I just wanted to pull
a little bit of it there.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.710
I'm just going to go through
it quickly, if you want.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.910
And this is what really
started fascinating me,

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.110
when I started
writing about in 2013,

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.080
was the cultural aspects of it.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:05.850
Why?

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.760
Why do you have people
coming around this idea

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.490
of a digital currency?

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.390
And so you have you
Bitcoin artwork.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.320
You have Bitcoin graphic novels.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.070
Someone did a graphic novel
about the hunt for Satoshi,

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.450
which I thought was
really interesting.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:27.110
And then this is a
really good artwork, too.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:31.289
This is by another
California artist, Dave Kim,

00:10:31.289 --> 00:10:33.080
who did-- I don't know
for you guys, that's

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.150
Dorian Nakomodo,
who in March 2014,

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.820
Newsweek said he was
Satoshi Nakamodo.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.610
And Dave Kim was
not into Bitcoin,

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.990
but he was friends with
artists who were putting

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.290
on a Bitcoin-related art show.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.860
And they asked
him to do a piece.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.320
And he did that piece.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.829
And I'm a little
proud of the fact,

00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:52.120
too, that I helped him name it.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:52.920
He had a couple different names.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.010
He didn't know what to call it.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.218
One of them was "Free Lunch."

00:10:55.218 --> 00:10:57.135
And I said, well, it's
got to be "Free Lunch."

00:10:57.135 --> 00:10:59.259
So I interviewed him, and
he said, yeah, of course.

00:10:59.259 --> 00:10:59.770
Why not?

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:00.820
So I convinced him.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.010
So you have photography.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:03.810
You have artwork.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.550
You have comics.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.360
This is another piece of artwork
by [INAUDIBLE], a German artist

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.400
who did his 200 bitcoins.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.780
And actually, I
took a piece of it.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.529
I should have brought
the whole thing.

00:11:16.529 --> 00:11:17.820
Because it's literally a field.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.278
It's like a Andy
Warhol type thing.

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:21.030
It's 200 bitcoins.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.610
It's the symbol.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.220
Why the symbol?

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.238
I still haven't
completely figured it out.

00:11:26.238 --> 00:11:27.821
I think some day
someone's going to do

00:11:27.821 --> 00:11:29.810
a really fascinating
anthropological study

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.130
about this.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:32.690
You had people who did music.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:33.700
You had Bitcoin songs.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.760
And I didn't bring
the songs along.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.990
But you had a
Bluegrass Bitcoin song.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.570
You had a Bitcoin love song.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:44.600
You had a Bitcoin rap.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.360
Nobody writes
songs about Paypal.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.240
Why are they writing
songs about Bitcoin?

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.880
That's a Bitcoin ATM.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.380
It's actually a
little out of place.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.670
I don't know why I put
it in the slideshow.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.378
I shouldn't have put
it in the slideshow.

00:11:56.378 --> 00:11:57.470
Let's go back to that.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.030
That's interesting.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.290
And this is what
I think is really

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.790
critical, is the idea of a
culture, a idea of a community

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.800
coming around this thing.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.780
Because when you think of
what a currency really is,

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.220
we imbue currencies
with a lot of power.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.370
We put a lot of mythology
into what the dollar is.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.730
And who controls it actually
has a very powerful tool

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.150
in that mythology.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.150
But ultimately, a currency
is really just an accounting

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.660
system.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.260
It's a way for a group of people
to keep track of what they

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.640
have, who owes who to what,
and to make that a very

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.800
streamlined, simple process.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.770
What you have now, I think, with
Bitcoin, for the first time,

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.250
is you have a way to
do that digitally.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.990
You a way to do that online.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:45.060
You a way to connect
people who are now

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.180
being connected
through social media,

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.935
but who previously
could not be connected.

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:51.660
Who couldn't interact
with each other.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.243
Could interact with each other
on a very limited basis, right?

00:12:54.243 --> 00:12:57.690
You could talk to each other on
email, or Twitter, or whatever.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:59.410
Now they can do commerce
with each other.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.070
They can send each other
things, and they can pay for it.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.780
It becomes part of a whole.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.440
It becomes part
of this evolution

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.240
of this online
digital community.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.940
And I think that, if you
didn't have the crisis,

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.010
I don't know that that would
have really-- the crisis was

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.830
really like fuel for Bitcoin.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.940
And it really kind of put a
groundswell underneath it.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.130
And the whole thing grew
in a very organic way,

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.340
very viral way.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.780
There's no marketing team
that's pushing Bitcoin.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.110
There's no advertising
campaign for Bitcoin.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.840
The whole thing was
extremely organic,

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.440
and it was all formed
around the community.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.510
And in a very real, real sense,
the community became Bitcoin.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.685
It wasn't just a
piece of software.

00:13:41.685 --> 00:13:43.260
It wasn't just a protocol.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.260
It is literally the community
that decides this thing

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.970
matters to us, and we are going
to use it among ourselves.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.670
And that's what you end up with.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:55.980
And I think that's a
very powerful thing.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.290
Now, what the media still
sees is something like this.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:04.086
Here is Ben Lawsky's
hearing in January of 2013.

00:14:04.086 --> 00:14:06.680
Or 2014?

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.540
2014.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.190
It's a random--
actually, I should

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.510
have taken this slide out, too.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.422
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:12.422 --> 00:14:13.130
PAUL VIGNA: What?

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.046
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:14.046 --> 00:14:16.400
PAUL VIGNA: Anyway,
you still have

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.730
this sort of public
face of Bitcoin, which

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.530
is Mount Gox, which
is Silk Road, which

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:23.575
is regulators trying to
get their hands around it

00:14:23.575 --> 00:14:24.780
and hold hearings.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.160
And that becomes what
most people think

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.520
of when they think of Bitcoin.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.580
But it isn't that.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.180
It really is the community.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.914
And these slides I
wanted to bring in,

00:14:36.914 --> 00:14:38.080
because they're very visual.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.410
But it's really interesting.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.380
The guy, the large gentleman
with the frizzy hair

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.530
and the beard, his
name is Hooroo Jackson.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:50.800
And he had invested in Bitcoin
early, and got rich on Bitcoin,

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.419
and used it to make a movie.

00:14:52.419 --> 00:14:53.960
The movie is called
"Aimy in a Cage."

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.500
He was an aspiring director, and
he was able to fund it himself

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.400
through Bitcoin.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.720
He hasn't released it yet.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.912
He completed it.

00:15:01.912 --> 00:15:03.620
And I just wanted to
pull up some slides.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.240
Because again, it's
just an example

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:10.880
of how people were using this
for more than just a currency,

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.510
a token.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.551
This became something that
became a cultural art,

00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:14.880
being part of their lives.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.632
And hopefully, Hooroo's
movie gets out there.

00:15:17.632 --> 00:15:19.590
I don't know what he's
going to do with it yet,

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.060
but I just think it's
very-- it's not actually

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.260
about Bitcoin.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.470
This is Austin and
Becky Craig, who

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:32.110
in 2013 wanted to travel around
the world using only Bitcoin

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.950
to prove that it could be done.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.290
And they did it.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:38.140
They drove across
country from Utah,

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.534
their home in Provo, Utah.

00:15:39.534 --> 00:15:40.450
They came to New York.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.710
I met them at a
Brooklyn pizza place.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:43.770
That's where they are.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.774
That was supposed
to take Bitcoin.

00:15:45.774 --> 00:15:47.940
It was the only place in
the city that took Bitcoin.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.907
So because they were
only spending Bitcoin,

00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:51.490
they went to this
Brooklyn pizza place

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.282
to buy their pizza with Bitcoin.

00:15:53.282 --> 00:15:54.490
And then they got on a plane.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:55.323
They flew to Europe.

00:15:55.323 --> 00:15:56.460
They flew to Asia.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.380
And they managed to do it.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.310
They managed to go around the
world spending only Bitcoin.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:06.830
Did involve some homeless
nights, some foodless nights.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.130
It was not easy.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.740
But they did it.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.240
And they showed in doing
it that, again, this

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.100
was a community that was
growing up around this thing.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.680
And it was really taking flight.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.350
No pun intended, actually.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.620
It really was growing.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.556
So this is what happened
all through 2008,

00:16:25.556 --> 00:16:30.160
2009, '10, '11, '12, '13,
this community kind of grows.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:36.320
And in 2013, it really kind of
explodes into the mainstream.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.980
And now journalists are
getting interested in it.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.625
The media's taking notice of it.

00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:43.250
You still have all
the salacious stuff.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.110
You still have all
the salacious stories.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.482
But suddenly, this thing
seems to come out of nowhere.

00:16:47.482 --> 00:16:49.190
And people are saying,
oh my god, Bitcoin

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.160
is going to take over the world.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.180
It didn't really
come out of nowhere.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.560
And it really wasn't going
to take over the world.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.920
And I think that was
a problem for it.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.410
Because it appeared
that, overnight, this

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.720
was going to be a new
way of doing things.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.319
And that was part of
what fueled the rise up

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:09.660
to $1,000, the speculation.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.569
Everyone goes crazy over it.

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:16.490
And it put far, far too
much on what is still

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.849
something that is being built.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.723
I mean, it's really
important to keep in mind

00:17:19.723 --> 00:17:21.790
that Bitcoin is still
in a beta phase.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.569
They are still
building the protocol.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:25.339
They're still
building the system.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:27.980
And I think that that
actually kind of came

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.850
to be a problem for
Bitcoin, because it

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.110
couldn't fulfil those dreams.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.880
It couldn't fulfill everything
that people were putting on it,

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.100
and it starts to
have some problems.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.694
And you can see there, that's
just in the first quarter.

00:17:41.694 --> 00:17:43.110
And then the rest
of these slides,

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.234
actually, I should give
credit where credit is due.

00:17:45.234 --> 00:17:47.050
I cribbed these off
of CoinDesk which

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.770
is a Bitcoin news service.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.730
They do a quarterly
"State of Bitcoin" report.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.910
It's actually very, very good.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.480
2013, Bitcoin hits
its all time high.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.530
Falls all through 2014.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.040
The price comes down,
because this speculation

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.080
starts to seep out of it.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.580
It's not going to take
over the world overnight.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.280
It is not going to become
this thing that challenges

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.170
the homogeny of the US dollar.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:13.367
It was not going to happen.

00:18:13.367 --> 00:18:15.700
People start to get a little
disillusioned with Bitcoin.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.140
They start to get a
little bored with Bitcoin.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:23.230
But what was happening
is a different group

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.900
of people was starting to
come into the Bitcoin world.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.610
And to call them, use a loose
term, call them the suits.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.250
Money was starting to
get ahold of this idea

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.260
that there was
something valuable here.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.490
The techies, the libertarians,
had built something.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.260
They had put their
passion into it.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.020
They had given a lot to it.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.420
And they built this thing, and
they showed that it had value.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.570
Even when you have a situation
like, say, that the Silk Road,

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.750
which is an online drug bazaar.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.760
It is clearly illegal.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:55.760
But as a use case for Bitcoin,
it showed that this coin works.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.120
People could trade online.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.430
They could buy and sell online,
and they could send the money

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.880
to each other directly online.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.590
That's a powerful thing.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:07.680
Then you start seeing
the suits get involved.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.910
And about $380
million of VC money

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.302
went into Bitcoin in 2014.

00:19:13.302 --> 00:19:14.760
These are two of
the big deals that

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.330
happened this past quarter--
Coinbase and 21 is a company.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:24.080
They got about $200 million
between the two of them.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.045
And people start
talking about, they

00:19:26.045 --> 00:19:27.960
start comparing Bitcoin
to the internet.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.110
This is another kind
of valuable chart.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.720
It shows where
Bitcoin was in 2014,

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.430
in terms of VC
investment, compared

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.850
to the internet in 1995.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.940
And you can see
that there's money.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.420
There's real money
coming into Bitcoin.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.470
People who care about
making a profit,

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:47.000
who care about
building things that

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.370
are going to be good for
them in the long term,

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.290
are starting to get
interested in it.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.860
So that has become--
and I think, actually,

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.960
in 2015 that's a huge story,
the idea that Wall Street is

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.140
getting interested in Bitcoin
as a technology, as a product.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:07.160
As you see sort of the
cultural part of it fade away,

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.850
you're starting to see this
business case be made for it.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:15.310
But Bitcoin is kind of
reaching a crossroads.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.270
The really passionate
people that

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.970
were going to come on board
early-- the early adopters,

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.620
the techies, the
libertarians, the artists

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.200
that really were looking
for something new--

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.500
that community has kind
of saturated itself.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.440
Bitcoin has saturated
that community.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.910
Can you find people outside of
that that are interested enough

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.180
to get on board?

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.860
That's another
question right now.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.050
And it's a problem.

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.250
This is the number of
Bitcoin accepting businesses

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.640
added in each quarter.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.400
And you can see the
number of businesses

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.240
are-- the growth rate
of the businesses

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.090
is starting to level off.

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.470
Because businesses,
they take it.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:53.980
They accept it.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.938
They say, oh yeah, this
is kind of interesting.

00:20:55.938 --> 00:20:58.780
At the last, we can use
it as a marketing thing

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.840
to attract this crowd.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.620
But they're not
finding that there's

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.760
a lot of business
being done with it.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.439
So you're having fewer
and fewer businesses--

00:21:07.439 --> 00:21:08.730
even though you have big names.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.460
Microsoft is using it
in a limited sense.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.257
Dell is using it
in a limited sense.

00:21:13.257 --> 00:21:15.590
Big companies are understanding
there's something there.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.420
They want to experiment with it.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.580
But they're not seeing a
huge groundswell of business

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.440
from it.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.720
So that's another issue.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.314
And this is another slide.

00:21:25.314 --> 00:21:26.730
Actually, these
next few slides, I

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.700
think I'm going to leave
them up for Mike when

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.674
he starts talking.

00:21:29.674 --> 00:21:31.340
Because this kind of
really gets to what

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.080
you're interested in Mike.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.630
What is Bitcoin
going to be about?

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.440
What is Bitcoin for?

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.270
Is it really for
first-world US citizens

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.980
who have access to all kinds
of banking services, who

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.540
have access to any kind
of credit they need,

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.090
using another one?

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.400
Or is it really about people
who live in emerging markets.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.150
People who don't have
access to banking services.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.600
People who can't really
build up the kind of wealth

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.400
that we take for granted.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.790
That, I think, is where
Bitcoin-- that is really

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.730
what I find very
fascinating about Bitcoin.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:08.711
That's what I think is Bitcoin's
biggest, to use the phrase, use

00:22:08.711 --> 00:22:09.210
case.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.170
I think that is where
Bitcoin is going

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.010
to really prove its worth.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:17.620
And I will say,
too, me personally,

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.525
when I got involved in
journalism, I did it-- well,

00:22:21.525 --> 00:22:24.480
when I got in journalism, I
did it because I needed a job.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.607
And my only salable asset
was writing and editing.

00:22:26.607 --> 00:22:28.190
It was the only thing
I could do well,

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.080
so I got a job in journalism.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.340
But the reason I
stayed with it was

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.695
because I wanted to be able
to tell stories that I thought

00:22:35.695 --> 00:22:36.320
were important.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.160
I wanted to be able
to tell stories

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.720
that I thought mattered
in terms of improving

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.180
the human condition.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:45.140
And in 2013, I
realized that I think

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.770
Bitcoin can help improve
the human condition,

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.560
and that it is
part of that story.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.880
And I was one of
those people that

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.510
became very, very-- that
groundswell came under my feet,

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.320
and I became very
obsessed with Bitcoin,

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.520
and I got very into it.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.103
And Michael also, and that's why
we wanted to write this book,

00:23:01.103 --> 00:23:04.300
because we think there
is a very, very big story

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.940
to tell here, and we
wanted to be a part of it

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.110
in any kind of way.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:11.680
For me, writing stories is
my way of being a part of it.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.840
I'm not a VC.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.910
I'm not an entrepreneur.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:15.659
I'm not going to go
into those businesses.

00:23:15.659 --> 00:23:18.430
I'm not going to start
up own Bitcoin app.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:19.550
I want to tell a story.

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:21.650
I think Bitcoin's a
very-- I think it's

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.740
a critically important story.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.440
But I think it is
also a story that

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.770
is it at the very, very early--
I keep saying very, very.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.610
It's at very early stages.

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:32.130
This thing is only
six years old.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.670
Like I said, it
is still in beta.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.480
It is not even in version 1.0.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.340
They are still
building this thing.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.170
Over the next 5,
10, 15, 20 years,

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.600
you are going to see this go
in places that we can't even

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.160
think of right now.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.450
The way I look at it is I
think it's as if this is 1896,

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:51.300
and we're all living in
our little rural community

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.520
with dirt rows that
your horses go down.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.502
And you just saw the first
horseless carriage go by.

00:23:56.502 --> 00:23:58.210
And it scared the hell
out of your horse.

00:23:58.210 --> 00:23:59.140
It might have scared your wife.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:23:59.950
It scared you.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:01.200
And you don't know what it is.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.460
And it's very odd,
and it's very unusual.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:07.950
And your initial reaction
is, that thing has to go.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.399
That thing is dangerous.

00:24:09.399 --> 00:24:10.940
That thing is going
to hurt somebody.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.570
We've got to get
rid of that thing.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.800
There's a quote by--
and I'm jumping around

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.460
in my historical
references here--

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.340
there's a quote by
a second century

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:22.840
Italian writer named Tertullian,
who had said the first reaction

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.220
to truth is always hatred.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.070
And I think that's a really
kind of interesting way

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.000
to think about new ideas.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.250
The visceral reaction to a
new idea, usually, is hatred.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:37.780
It's doubt.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.040
It's skepticism.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.270
It's nah, this can't work.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:41.570
And I'm that way, too.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.732
When I first heard of
Bitcoin, I was the same way.

00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:45.440
I said, I'm not writing
about this thing.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.270
This is a scam.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:47.280
This is a con.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.310
It's a Ponzi scheme.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:49.950
It's not going to last.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.940
I actually did, I said I
refused to write about it.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.620
But I kept thinking about it.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.767
And I kept reading about it, and
it kept popping up in places.

00:24:57.767 --> 00:24:59.350
And then I started
getting interested.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:02.090
And then I started reading more,
and I started writing more.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:04.820
And the more I read, the
more I saw there was to read.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.600
And the more I wrote, the
more I saw there was to write,

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.190
until the story just got
bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.230
And I think it is
going to keep getting

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:14.210
bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:17.787
And where it goes from
here is not exactly clear.

00:25:17.787 --> 00:25:19.370
And that's where I'm
going to hand off

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.411
to Mike, because Mike is
going to talk about some

00:25:21.411 --> 00:25:22.890
of those things.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:24.550
And I don't think
I went over time.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:25.460
I hope I didn't.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.810
But I'm going to hand off
to my esteemed colleague

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.498
and co-author, Mike Casey.

00:25:30.498 --> 00:25:31.747
MICHAEL CASEY: Thank you, sir.

00:25:31.747 --> 00:25:34.232
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:35.097 --> 00:25:37.180
MICHAEL CASEY: So you've
left me some extra slides

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.182
to work my way through.

00:25:38.182 --> 00:25:40.140
PAUL VIGNA: I thought
you could play with them.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:40.970
MICHAEL CASEY: But
that's a nice slide.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:42.314
You didn't get to talk about it.

00:25:42.314 --> 00:25:43.262
But anyway, OK.

00:25:43.262 --> 00:25:43.736
PAUL VIGNA: Actually,
I should have.

00:25:43.736 --> 00:25:45.158
Because I was talking
about the unbanked, right?

00:25:45.158 --> 00:25:46.580
MICHAEL CASEY: That's all right.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.390
Yeah, and the unbanked,
and property titling,

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:52.756
and a lot of really interesting
use cases for Bitcoin I think

00:25:52.756 --> 00:25:54.880
are going to be very, very
important down the road.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.820
But I'm going to talk about
something a little different.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.210
And it is to talk about this
concept of the crossroads

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.980
that we're at.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:05.110
The transition from a
very passionate community

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:08.250
of true believers, driven by
sort of maybe some libertarian

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:10.750
ideas, and some
very strong views

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:14.114
about kind of a utopian vision
for the world, newcomers.

00:26:14.114 --> 00:26:15.655
Those newcomers are
not necessarily--

00:26:15.655 --> 00:26:17.113
they're a very
different community,

00:26:17.113 --> 00:26:18.660
and they have a
corporate flavor.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.580
And that's a very
important issue

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.090
for how we deal with the
structure, the infrastructure,

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:27.080
of not just Bitcoin, but
cryptocurrencies generally.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.500
And you guys I think need
to think about this stuff.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.480
Anyway, I was
pleased to see, when

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.500
I came in through the
airport last night,

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.795
that there was an ad for this
right there in the airport.

00:26:38.795 --> 00:26:40.670
Some of you actually
may be familiar with it.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:42.940
This is an ad for
Charles Schwab's

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.890
new intelligent
investing algorithm.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.240
And for awhile,
in Grand Central,

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.490
they were running ads without
the name Charles Schwab,

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:54.950
just saying, you know,
investing will change forever.

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:57.560
And leading you to believe that
in March something really big

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.320
was going to happen.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.736
But when I saw it,
I couldn't help

00:26:59.736 --> 00:27:03.040
thinking how much it
reminded me of this.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.185
And you know, it's
kind of interesting

00:27:06.185 --> 00:27:08.340
that this comparison
would be made.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.820
But if you look at
them side by side, HAL

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:15.950
and [? Shrub's ?] intelligent
algorithmic investing machine

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:18.340
had the same spooky
light in the distance.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.772
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:19.772 --> 00:27:20.980
MICHAEL CASEY: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:21.729
This is the thing.

00:27:21.729 --> 00:27:23.190
Well, that's weird
now, Boris, is

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.180
what they've done is they're
now running ads on TV

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:29.722
with a spooky British
voice behind it.

00:27:29.722 --> 00:27:31.180
How they would do
it, I don't know.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.055
But it's interesting.

00:27:32.055 --> 00:27:34.450
So Dave, I'm afraid I can't
help you with your portfolio.

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:35.397
You know?

00:27:35.397 --> 00:27:36.480
I'm an Aussie, by the way.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.480
So I'm not going to get
that accent quite right.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.744
But anyway, this matter is, I
think-- this is a judgement.

00:27:42.744 --> 00:27:44.660
I certainly don't mean
to pick on Schwab here.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.300
Because the idea that you
have a centralized algorithm--

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.150
and this is the point.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.790
The idea that this
is not actually

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.790
your intelligent investors
that are [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.750
Of course, the algorithm
is owned by Schwab.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.620
It's not your algorithm.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:03.310
It flies in the face of the
Bitcoin ethos, if you like.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:06.280
That the algorithm really
cannot belong to anybody.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.190
It needs to belong
to the community,

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:13.510
and it needs to
be something that

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:16.240
doesn't allow the centralization
of the information,

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.710
and therefore the idea that
some powerful corporate interest

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.090
could just morph into HAL.

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.470
And I'm not here to pick on
Schwab about this, of course.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.087
Because algorithms are
essentially owned by companies

00:28:28.087 --> 00:28:30.170
all over the world, and
I'd be remiss to point out

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:31.910
that I'm speaking at the
offices of the company

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:34.034
that owns the most powerful
algorithm in the world.

00:28:34.034 --> 00:28:37.290
So there's nothing wrong
with this principle.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:40.530
It's just that it
speaks, I think,

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:46.080
to what drives the dream of the
Bitcoin world, the idea that we

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.100
can shift this out in
a decentralized way.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:53.240
And it matters right
now because, as Bitcoin

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.060
goes through this
crossroads process,

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.620
there's all sorts of
other interested parties

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:03.162
who-- really noting how
important it could be.

00:29:03.162 --> 00:29:04.620
We were talking
over lunch actually

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.050
about how the-- there's a
struggle that those of us who

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:11.770
think Bitcoin's an important
issue face with the way

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:13.130
the mainstream perceives it.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.620
As much as there is this
incredibly passionate community

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.679
that grew very quickly.

00:29:16.679 --> 00:29:18.470
It seems as if they've
reached a roadblock.

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:21.276
Because once you step outside
of the realm of the techies

00:29:21.276 --> 00:29:23.930
and the libertarians,
the utopians,

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:26.310
the fringe dwellers if you like.

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:28.730
Not to cast aspersions
on all of you tech types,

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:32.659
but there is something--
you are not middle America.

00:29:32.659 --> 00:29:34.200
Middle America has
a problem with it,

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.170
because they perceive and see
all sorts of other problems

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:36.980
with it.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:41.290
What's happening, interestingly,
is that these guys

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:42.390
are getting involved.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:45.030
They're getting involved, and
mainstream is going, what?

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.196
The New York Stock Exchange?

00:29:46.196 --> 00:29:48.904
What are they dabbling
in Bitcoin for?

00:29:48.904 --> 00:29:51.070
Why would you ever want to
get involved in something

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:54.100
that's being run by criminals?

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.260
And yet, it's happening
over and over again.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.635
So you can see
the New York Stock

00:29:57.635 --> 00:29:59.040
Exchange invested in Coinbase.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.110
Duncan Niederauer who
just coincidentally

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:05.870
was the previous CEO of NYSE,
he joined a Bitcoin swap side,

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:08.120
TeraExchange.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.260
This one's really
interesting-- Blythe Masters.

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:14.216
some People see her as
sort of a sinister figure,

00:30:14.216 --> 00:30:15.340
but she really is a genius.

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.220
She created credit
default swaps, really.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.950
And she's now left
JPM, JP Morgan,

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:23.390
and is the CEO of Digital
Asset Holdings, which

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:25.750
is an interesting
new settlement--

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:29.740
digital currency and digital
asset settlement service.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.920
NASDAQ not investing,
but they're certainly

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.877
providing the tech
for [INAUDIBLE] market

00:30:33.877 --> 00:30:35.210
to build a new Bitcoin exchange.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:37.810
UBS just announced a
new block chain lab.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:41.430
And Jamie Dimon, who spoke
disparagingly about Bitcoin

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.460
about a year ago,
now says there is

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:47.110
much for us-- that is JP
Morgan-- to learn from Bitcoin.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:48.980
So this is a sign.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:53.420
These guys are now
getting interested.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:58.600
And it's important, in the
context of this centralization

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.190
versus decentralization debate.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:05.340
Because they're all
profit-seeking companies,

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.530
quite rightfully so.

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:10.240
I mean, as Peter Thiel
reminded us recently,

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.460
you need the search
for monopoly.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.667
You need the search for
profit to drive innovation.

00:31:15.667 --> 00:31:17.500
The challenge-- and
I'll get to this later--

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.680
is how do you prevent
that monopolizing process

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.770
from becoming something that
kills innovation, that stifles

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:26.850
growth, and that ultimately
turns the rent seeking

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:30.380
activities that are inherent
to monopolies into something

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:31.672
really quite destructive.

00:31:31.672 --> 00:31:34.130
And this is the thing I want
to come to in a little moment.

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:40.720
But what's happening as
this corporate mainstream

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.870
interest is growing?

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:44.480
We saw Paul lined out
all the VC money that's

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.730
coming into Bitcoin.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.130
This is another part of it.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:48.629
You know?

00:31:48.629 --> 00:31:51.320
The Wall Street and other
interests, what all of them

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.540
are saying is this.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.830
I like the blockchain,
but I don't like Bitcoin.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:01.950
And this is something that gets
people in the Bitcoin community

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:02.680
kind of upset.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.420
It need not, I think.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.760
But there's an enormous
amount of passion caught up

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.935
in what that represents to
people in this community.

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:23.220
What they're talking about, and
why people get upset about it,

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.760
is that they say, look,
it's impossible to have

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.120
a blockchain without a coin.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.630
This idea that you
had no digital value,

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:37.080
because you need this coin
to secure the blockchain.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.880
If you have all these miners,
all these participants

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:43.270
confirming transactions,
why on earth

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.540
are they going to
participate in this network

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.480
if you can't reward
them in some way?

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.790
So the idea is that the
coin, that token of value,

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:53.960
is critical for the building
of value, the incentive

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.760
system that builds
the consensus model,

00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:01.050
and ultimately, therefore, the
security of the ledger itself.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:03.750
It's not clear that
they're necessarily right.

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:06.730
Now, they are right on
the fundamental question

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.530
of decentralization.

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:12.254
But if you just switch
this around a little bit,

00:33:12.254 --> 00:33:13.920
and we just think
that, well, what about

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.860
if we had a centralized
Block chain?

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.230
Or better put, what if we had
a permissioned blockchain,

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:25.830
whereby the nodes, the
computing-- those that

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:28.580
are providing compute resources
to the process of processing

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:33.960
transactions were actually
given some sort of authority

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.970
to do so?

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:39.310
That there was some entity
that said, you know what?

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:41.792
You guys are going to
participate in this,

00:33:41.792 --> 00:33:43.000
and here are the reasons why.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.958
And there's a vested
interest in participating.

00:33:44.958 --> 00:33:49.440
And for that reason,
we don't need the coin.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.310
Because we've got an
authority to do so,

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:53.810
and we have a reason
to do so, which

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.160
is kind of the legal imperative,
the mandate, the charter,

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.170
whatever you want to
call it, to do so.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:03.090
So we're already actually, to
some extent, in this world.

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:06.680
Where we have
permissionless blockchains,

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.215
Bitcoin being the best
known-- some of the alt coins

00:34:09.215 --> 00:34:10.420
like Litecoin.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:15.570
And Ethereum, the
remarkably expansive idea

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:19.115
of a new versatile blockchain
that Vitalik Buterin,

00:34:19.115 --> 00:34:23.909
the wunderkind developer
came up with, all of which

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:27.489
depend on the idea that anybody
can come in and participate

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:28.810
as a miner.

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:31.029
And then you get
permissioned Blockchains.

00:34:31.029 --> 00:34:32.820
Ripple is probably the
best known of these.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.090
I'm sure you've probably
heard of Ripple.

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:37.600
Where there are gateways
that participate.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.710
And they're ultimately
given this role.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:43.050
And then there's this
newcomers on the block,

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:48.300
Aris Industries out of
London, and Hyperledger.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.000
And they're building
blockchains that

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.750
could be used in corporate
settings, where the focus is

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:59.040
on the power of the ledger
and the smart contracts that

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.910
work within them, rather than
necessarily on coins and value.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:08.610
But when the
bitcoiners come back

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:14.460
and say, look, this isn't going
to work, you just can't do it,

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.350
it still evolves into
this question about why

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:20.880
these companies care about it.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.600
And at the end of
the day, there needs

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.510
to be a kind of commercial
use for blockchains.

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:28.670
So companies are
worried about Bitcoin,

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:32.330
because it has these
sort of broader concerns

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.950
that the general public
is worried about.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:39.280
It is, at the moment, too
volatile as a functioning

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:39.780
currency.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.321
There is this problem
of criminality.

00:35:41.321 --> 00:35:45.490
And there is the insecurity
that digital wallets have.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.440
And some of these
really are, in my mind,

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.990
not particularly big issues.

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:54.350
Because I do feel as if
innovation, even regulation,

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.340
and just general
network effects,

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.520
will eventually
resolve some of these.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:02.150
Probably of greater
concern-- these

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:06.160
concerns that I think more
sophisticated analysis bring

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.790
forth and that are focused
on the protocol itself.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:14.280
It has scalability limits,
particularly in terms of data.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.680
The fact that it takes
10 minutes to finish

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.390
a block-- this is a Bitcoin.

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:20.300
Other alt coins are
much faster than this.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.237
It takes an hour to have
a final confirmation.

00:36:22.237 --> 00:36:24.820
And then of course, you've got
this problem of the mining arms

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.220
race, where the incentive
system has actually

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:30.800
built this massive race toward
massive amounts of computing

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.300
power.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.740
And the concentration that's
been built around the mining

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:37.160
pools on that basis leads
people to some concern

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.524
that we could have a bad actor
one day taking 51% control.

00:36:40.524 --> 00:36:42.690
It hasn't happened until
now, and there are probably

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:45.800
good game theory reasons as
to why that wouldn't happen.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.251
Who wants to destroy
their own value?

00:36:48.251 --> 00:36:50.000
But nonetheless, it's
a legitimate concern

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.500
that hangs over
Bitcoin all the time.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.325
And a lawyer from
a large company

00:36:54.325 --> 00:36:56.740
is probably going to feel
uncomfortable with that very

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:58.195
risk always being there.

00:36:58.195 --> 00:37:00.320
And then there's this sort
of problem of consensus.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:06.140
Bitcoin's achievement
really was the capacity

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:11.100
to incentivize-- to marry the
incentives of the individual

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.850
to the interests of
the group, and to make

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.890
sure these things
worked together.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:16.880
It resolved, in some
respects, the tragedy

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.450
of the commons problem,
where we're all

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:21.170
pursuing our self-interest
in destroying

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:22.990
the public good that we have.

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:28.880
But at the same time, the
model as it's structured

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.720
limits the capacity to
sort of build out further.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:35.070
And so that same problem
starts to reemerge.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.160
In that, what really
would be probably better

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.110
for Bitcoin is to
allow the capacity

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:44.500
to innovate, to allow to
build this system out and grow

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:48.854
on a-- in a more expansive
and innovative way.

00:37:48.854 --> 00:37:51.270
But if you have to keep getting
the consensus of everybody

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:54.330
to do that, and nobody
wants to do so because it's

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.080
against their own
personal interests,

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.190
you once again are back to the
tragedy of the commons issue.

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:00.640
It's kind of like the UN.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:03.125
It's impossible to get the
UN to do anything sometimes

00:38:03.125 --> 00:38:07.490
because you just need consensus,
and it's very hard to develop.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:13.370
But these problems
are being resolved.

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:15.970
I mean, there really is
some remarkable amount

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:19.680
of innovation going on, whether
it's Vitalik Buterin's project

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.350
or it's what the guys at
Blockstream are doing,

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:25.780
to try to build a side chain
that would allow innovation

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:30.040
to happen in isolation
but connected to Bitcoin.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.010
There's a lot of work
going on in this space.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:35.420
But at the same time,
the corporate sector

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:36.934
really doesn't care.

00:38:36.934 --> 00:38:39.350
They just want something that's
practical and commercially

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.891
viable for them.

00:38:40.891 --> 00:38:43.140
And so they're focusing on
what they say they do like.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.440
They want to do
away with this coin

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.540
that they think is just
too much of a distraction.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.789
And really, who cares about
whether the Fed goes away,

00:38:48.789 --> 00:38:52.196
and why do we need a
community currency anyway?

00:38:52.196 --> 00:38:54.570
Why can't we just deal with
some of the other cool things

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:56.540
that this blockchain can do?

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.190
And so they're
talking about some

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:01.310
of these great ideas about
fully orderable databases,

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:04.407
and how you could more
appropriately manage them.

00:39:04.407 --> 00:39:05.990
The idea of smart
contracts that might

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:08.940
remove lawyers, and
escrow, and managers,

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.520
and trustees from the
capacity of two entities

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.170
to trade with each other.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:16.060
They like the idea of
peer-to-peer real-time payments

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:19.280
and settlements to make
the ACH system-- well,

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:23.960
to ultimately do away
with ACH and to improve

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.270
the transfer of value
around the world

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:29.530
and free up all this capital
that's tied up in that.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.460
Provable asset
registries, we talked--

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.550
there's a brief reference
to it under [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:38.390
in that earlier
presentation that Paul gave.

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:40.380
And he's got this
idea that we could

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:44.280
bring property title for
the poor of the world

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.650
and place it onto a
blockchain, this idea

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:52.790
that perhaps we could liberate
capital as a result of that.

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:54.710
And then we could
turn securities

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:57.750
into digitized products
and trade them.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:01.000
And so, there's a lot
of focus on these.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.150
This is what they like
about blockchains.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:05.570
The advantages?

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:09.464
None of this insane race
to-- concentrated mining

00:40:09.464 --> 00:40:11.130
and the arms race we
were talking about.

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.550
It's a safe network,
because there's

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:19.890
no threat of a 51% attack
when a central company would

00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:21.640
manage the blockchain itself.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.270
It would be scalable.

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:25.890
If this was a
centralized model, you

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:28.940
could just set it to the
parameters that you wanted.

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:29.650
Fast.

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:31.660
And this UN problem goes away.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:35.830
You don't need the consensus
of all of the participants

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:38.400
to get things done.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:44.560
But ultimately, there's not much
in the way of disadvantages.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.130
But they're critical.

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:50.840
The very fact of
centralization, and the return

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:55.530
to the idea of trust, are
potentially dangerous.

00:40:55.530 --> 00:41:00.500
Now, it doesn't mean that
there isn't potentially

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.490
an enormous amount of
value to be unleashed

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:06.110
by moving to a centralized
blockchain that would do away

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:09.090
with the problem of
the coins, particularly

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:11.710
in a corporate setting.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:15.590
There's a bit of a debate about
why on earth you would do this.

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:20.790
What benefit could you bring
to a company, when in fact you

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:23.560
could just run a smart
database instead?

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.475
Why do you need to build
this elaborate chain

00:41:25.475 --> 00:41:30.540
of interacting nodes
within your company

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.480
to fulfill these functions?

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:37.310
And there's actually been some
interesting work done on this.

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:39.900
Tim Swanson, who is
in the audience here

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.740
today has put out a really
interesting paper recently.

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:46.340
People are focused on the idea
that there's a smart contract.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.020
That's really what Bitcoin is.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.120
And so you could
imagine-- and I think

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.140
the jury is very much
still out whether this

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:54.380
is going to function
this way or not--

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:57.380
but a company could
perhaps set up

00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:02.020
a structure in which
different siloed units,

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:05.680
different divisions within the
company that have for so long

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:11.010
had to depend upon these rules
and processes, the requirement

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:14.380
that XYZ manager has to sign
off on this RFQ and this guy

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:16.240
has to do that.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:20.350
Anybody who has worked at a big
company, and all of you have,

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:22.689
had kind of a management
and procurement or any level

00:42:22.689 --> 00:42:24.230
that deals with the
movement of funds

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.870
and-- it can be incredibly
laborious, cumbersome,

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:27.650
and bureaucratic.

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:30.980
And the idea that you
could now use a blockchain

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.820
to automate a lot of
those approval processes

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:39.830
and maybe find interoperability
between differently

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:45.420
arranged software stacks, and
different parts of the world,

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.920
you could perhaps develop
efficiencies around that.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.480
Would it outweigh the cost of
building that system rather

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:56.139
than, again, a more
sophisticated central database?

00:42:56.139 --> 00:42:56.680
I don't know.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.140
But I think the
point to make here

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.290
is that, from a company
perspective, who cares?

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:02.000
Like if you can
actually prove that,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.170
and a company can make life
more effective for them

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:07.030
and save money, go for it.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:11.010
That's a way to bring value, and
every company should and would

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:15.340
pursue anything that's going to
save money internally for them.

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.900
The concern, to get back
to this problem about why

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.030
centralization and
trust matter, is

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:22.530
not for that kind of a
centralized blockchain,

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:24.320
but what's being
sort of described

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.630
as the federated
Blockchain-- the idea

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:33.520
that an association of
entities with a shared

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:38.840
interest in something
ends up working together

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.590
to supplant the role that
the miners currently play.

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:44.880
In a permissionless
environment, you'd

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.400
have permissioned members.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:51.330
Now, the example I have
there is the TBTF alliance.

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:53.990
Too Big To Fail, of course,
is the reference there.

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:56.150
And I wanted to
throw out the idea

00:43:56.150 --> 00:44:02.110
that, as those banks that are
getting interested in Bitcoin

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:04.619
and Blockchain right
now explore what

00:44:04.619 --> 00:44:06.160
seems to be one of
the things they're

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:10.920
most interested in, which
is a more efficient process

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.060
through which money and
securities are settled

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.850
around the world, removing
middleman-- making

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:21.510
that process far quicker than it
currently is, so that you move

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:23.030
from three days,
to one week, down

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:28.810
to virtually real-time, freeing
up massive amounts of capital

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:29.500
in the process.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.479
Trillions of dollars a
day are traded in world

00:44:32.479 --> 00:44:33.520
foreign exchange markets.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.370
If we could get that money
to flow instantaneously,

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:38.820
the impact on the globe
could be profound.

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:41.050
There could be great savings
for the global economy.

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:44.110
The problem is
that, if that were

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:51.300
done in a model that is
controlled by the SIFIs,

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.650
the Systematically Important
Financial Institutions,

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:56.470
as the bureaucrats
are now trying

00:44:56.470 --> 00:45:02.950
to deal with the mess that was
the 2008 crisis describe them,

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:04.040
what are we doing?

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:04.540
You know?

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:09.210
We're once again
centralizing information

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:11.940
around the power of
these institutions.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:16.740
And what 2008 told
us was that it's not

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:22.260
just that centralization
inherently breeds monopolies

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.990
and therefore
rent-seeking activities,

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:29.250
and ultimately denies
people the chance

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:32.630
to obtain products
at a fair price.

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:35.850
But it also, when
pushed to the extreme,

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:38.300
and certainly when backed
by the political support

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:43.400
that the implicit backstop
that we taxpayers gave to banks

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:47.630
does, it can be really
destructive to society.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:50.180
We centralize
information and control

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:55.050
around institutions that
have controlled the system,

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:58.340
and it can do an enormous
amount of damage.

00:45:58.340 --> 00:45:59.880
And here's the point.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:05.580
Whereby if I think about Google
as a centralized institution,

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:10.000
and its own clear
profit-seeking motives

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.060
is different from a bank, is
because the infrastructure

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:19.220
in which a bank is
operating-- the banks own it.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:24.380
It is already a centralized,
controlled platform.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:25.520
Right?

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:29.990
TCP/IP, for whatever it's
worth, is an open system.

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.580
It is there.

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.730
And that is the thing
that makes Google continue

00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:34.450
to be an innovative company.

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:36.730
And regardless of
whatever the EU ends up

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:40.490
saying about you guys, there is
a profound amount of innovation

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:42.960
that happens here,
precisely because you never

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.095
know when the next competitor,
disruptive competitor,

00:46:46.095 --> 00:46:48.600
is going to be coming
over the horizon.

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.980
And that is possible
because the infrastructure

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:55.410
is available to all
to exploit, to create

00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:58.700
disruptive,
innovative new ideas.

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:01.300
As we move into the age
of the internet of money,

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:05.690
where we're trying to move
value into this same powerful,

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:09.340
seamless, programmable world
that the rest of the world

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:11.110
has already moved into.

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:16.080
The real risk here is that
we deny that same capacity

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.720
to the banking system,
and that we end up

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:23.450
with a recentralized
model around

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:24.549
the actual infrastructure.

00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:26.340
We don't care about
what the app makers can

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:29.640
do-- what the banks and
their profit seeking entities

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:30.430
can do there.

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.600
What matters is
the infrastructure.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.640
What matters is the platform.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:44.900
So the concern is that, as we go
around this debate, blockchain

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:46.340
without Bitcoin,
the idea that we

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.020
can have some sort of
coinless structure here,

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:53.879
I think it's absolutely
critical that we--

00:47:53.879 --> 00:47:55.420
those of us who are
invested in this,

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.110
but I mean that as a society.

00:47:57.110 --> 00:47:59.650
Because this truly
is an idea that

00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:05.080
is far bigger than the
kind of hobbyist notion

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.460
that people in the general
mainstream still think

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:08.750
Bitcoin is.

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:12.400
There are really profoundly
important issues at stake.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.000
So those of us that
are invested in

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.420
that-- be they writers, techies,
or people in the finance world,

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:24.510
it's beholden upon
us to try to fight

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:28.970
for the guarantee of some sort
of decentralized, open sourced

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:31.660
basis to this transformation.

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:35.520
And companies could,
and should, and will

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.780
do what they need to do.

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:42.080
And blockchains that are able
to operate in efficient ways

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:46.820
internally may well
be a fabulous solution

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:48.900
for that process.

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.960
But I just think that
the passion actually

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:55.240
needs to be sustained around
this decentralization issue.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.760
And if, at this moment of
crossroads, where we're

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:02.090
going from-- the fringe
dwellers have handed the baton

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:05.800
to corporate
America-- we lose out

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:10.790
on the capacity to fight for
the importance of this platform

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:13.290
being a decentralized
infrastructure.

00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:15.180
We face some very big risks.

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:18.800
We don't want to go back to 2008
or some other version of that,

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.850
and we certainly haven't
fixed that problem.

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:25.190
So it seems like
an arcane debate.

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:27.140
And I wrote a column
on this yesterday

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.040
the sparked a lot of interest.

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:32.370
And people get very upset
about whether or not

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:34.110
blockchain can be
without a coin or not.

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:37.340
And the problem is that
it gets lost in a world

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.990
that the rest of us
don't seem to understand.

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:42.182
But it's critical.

00:49:42.182 --> 00:49:43.890
So I'm just going to
leave you with that.

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:46.895
And there's the cover
of the book, which

00:49:46.895 --> 00:49:48.330
is actually on sale afterwards.

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:49.360
We have to do the pitch.

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.491
But we're happy
to take questions.

00:49:51.491 --> 00:49:53.407
Do you want to come up
and stand here with me?

00:49:53.407 --> 00:49:55.892
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:56.807 --> 00:49:59.390
MALE SPEAKER: We're going to use
the microphone for questions,

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:00.230
please.

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:01.480
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.611
It was pretty good.

00:50:02.611 --> 00:50:04.860
What are your thoughts on
the centralization of mining

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:06.130
that's currently going on?

00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:07.380
I know a lot of the
fringe dwellers,

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:08.990
including me, were
able to participate

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:11.010
in that part of the
decentralized system.

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:14.870
But since about a year,
I think that's pretty

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:15.930
much over for everybody.

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:19.410
So it's just a large-- couple
of large data center companies

00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:23.250
that own most of
the mining hardware.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:25.430
How do you think that
that will affect Bitcoin

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:27.110
as a decentralized platform?

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:29.318
MICHAEL CASEY: I think it's
the most important issue.

00:50:29.318 --> 00:50:32.435
I mean, it's-- and again, this
is part of-- the debate gets

00:50:32.435 --> 00:50:34.060
focused on, oh,
Bitcoin's too volatile.

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:35.430
And it's criminals.

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:36.330
That's the issue.

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:39.770
Because that talks to the
core problem of the consensus

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:42.200
infrastructure and
how it builds out.

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.630
Now, is it a problem
that we have this?

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:46.544
It's certainly a problem
for a little guy who

00:50:46.544 --> 00:50:47.835
wants to make some money in it.

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:55.840
To me, the issue is
around whether or not

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.710
there is a 51% attack concern.

00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:00.050
Really, that's ultimately it.

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:03.960
I'd love to think that we would
be in a more democratic world,

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.210
and everybody could
participate in it.

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:09.540
And that is also an ideal that
I think is worth pursuing.

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:14.500
But I think a greater
concern is that it

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:20.330
is exposed to insecurity if
it's just a case of just owning

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:21.232
all the hardware.

00:51:21.232 --> 00:51:23.440
So I think the pools need
to be resolved as an issue,

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.140
seriously.

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:28.080
Now there may be ways to
do peer-to-peer pooling

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:31.140
or something that
moves that aside.

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:33.440
But the other issue
is, have a sort

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.130
of pragmatic view
about the importance

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:37.340
of working with
regulators and making sure

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:41.270
that government has a view as to
how Bitcoin is going to evolve.

00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:44.160
And to the extent to which
that mining activity is now

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:49.265
concentrated in China,
for example, a lot of it

00:51:49.265 --> 00:51:51.940
is these data pools
that are based

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:54.440
behind state-owned enterprises.

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.270
Where the Beijing government
doesn't know they're there,

00:51:57.270 --> 00:52:01.770
but some party
[INAUDIBLE] is paid off,

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:04.280
or is being paid off, rather,
by the Bitcoin miner who's

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.830
using the free electricity
that's subsidized by the state

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:08.070
to run this thing.

00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:11.660
That's hardly the kind of
comfortable infrastructure

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:14.190
that the US government's
going to look to as

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:17.970
the foundation for this system.

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:21.830
So [INAUDIBLE] that's being done
by companies here in the US--

00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:23.680
Bitfury is one of
them-- to try to build

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.680
a bridge to regulators,
to be much more

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:30.690
transparent about their
activities, how much control

00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:34.290
they have over mining, where
their data centers are based

00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:35.700
and so forth.

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:38.090
That's probably the most
important issue right now.

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:40.750
I don't know how easily
we can wind back the clock

00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:44.710
and allow you to
participate at this stage.

00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:47.160
But certainly, making
sure that the threat

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.380
of a 51% attack and that the
security is under control,

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.910
that's just paramount
as far as I'm concerned.

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:56.010
AUDIENCE: Michael,
could you do me a favor?

00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:59.340
For the audience on
YouTube who don't know what

00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:02.500
a 51% attack is, could
you go into details

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:03.830
of what it actually means.

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:04.360
MICHAEL CASEY: Absolutely.

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:04.650
OK.

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:05.150
Sure.

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.990
Yes.

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.940
I forget with the
YouTube audience

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:08.814
we've got a different
audience from this one.

00:53:08.814 --> 00:53:14.900
So a 51% attack is the
notion that-- the blockchain

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:18.950
is a verifiable record of all
of the transactions taking place

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:23.880
in Bitcoin so long as we
can assume that nobody has

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:29.240
the power to manipulate
transactions and actually

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:33.820
have the system approve
fraudulent transactions,

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:36.800
transactions that were double
spent, is the classic problem

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:37.800
that people [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.430
Kind of a form of digital
counterfeiting, if you like.

00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:43.640
And the reason why it would
be possible with a 51% attack

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:47.830
is because, if you
owned more than 50%

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:54.730
of all of the computing power
that is distributed to manage

00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:58.810
and confirm the transactions
in the blockchain, then

00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:02.370
by virtue of the way that
the algorithm creates

00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:10.930
the blockchain chain, you'd be
able to consistently enough win

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:14.460
the awards for preparing
a block and would

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.080
be able to build blocks
of your own interest.

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.420
And that block would
become the longest chain.

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:23.450
Bitcoin is built around the
idea that the longer the chain

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:25.010
of transactions,
the longer of blocks

00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:29.360
in the transactions, that is
the de facto legitimate block

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:29.860
chain.

00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.270
And that is basically
the burden of proof,

00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:34.070
that all the data
behind it is true.

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:35.750
So if you had 51%,
you'd actually

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:37.880
be able to more consistently
build the next block.

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.550
And you'd have
the longest chain.

00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:41.217
You could ultimately
destroy the system,

00:54:41.217 --> 00:54:42.633
because you could
put whatever you

00:54:42.633 --> 00:54:44.480
want into those
transactions, and the system

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.810
would regard that as the truth.

00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:50.150
So that's the sort of
complicated problem

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:52.160
that a 51% attack is.

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:55.420
And it's something
that's really been

00:54:55.420 --> 00:55:00.620
of great concern and a lot
of debate for some time.

00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:03.210
AUDIENCE: I've got a question
for both Michael and for Paul.

00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:06.060
For Michael, real quick, if
you do trust the transparency,

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:08.480
if you have to identify
yourself as a validator

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.522
underneath the scheme that
Bitfury is working on,

00:55:10.522 --> 00:55:12.063
doesn't that defeat
the whole purpose

00:55:12.063 --> 00:55:13.770
of having pseudo-anonymous
validators,

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:17.137
if you have to dox yourself
to be part of the network?

00:55:17.137 --> 00:55:18.720
MICHAEL CASEY: You
know, I don't know.

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:21.822
If you assume that that's an
inherent part of the thing--

00:55:21.822 --> 00:55:22.530
now I don't know.

00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:26.551
Maybe there's different
degrees of documentation.

00:55:26.551 --> 00:55:27.800
Maybe there's certain aspects.

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:29.680
You don't know
exactly where it is.

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:32.720
To be honest, I don't
know technically

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:36.070
enough to understand how
far you would push that.

00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:41.330
But certainly, the idea of
some transparency behind it--

00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:43.460
MALE SPEAKER: Wasn't the
whole network designed so you

00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.380
don't have to be transparent?

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:46.150
Like it's the assumption
that every actor

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:47.580
is supposed to be
pseud-anonymous

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:51.585
and has its own incentives to
do a certain type of action?

00:55:51.585 --> 00:55:52.460
MICHAEL CASEY: Right.

00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:55.870
But maybe there's
some degree to which

00:55:55.870 --> 00:56:00.400
there's enough
information out there

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:04.070
about who's involved, who's
acting, how much you control,

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:07.390
that is at least going to
bring some sort of security

00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:08.210
that network.

00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:12.390
Even if where your nodes
are and who you are

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:13.957
is not actually
sort of necessarily

00:56:13.957 --> 00:56:15.040
identified as who you are.

00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.860
I mean, I don't know
exactly if it is.

00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:20.770
But I think it's hard to
deny that, for the sake

00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:22.670
of confidence and
trust in the system,

00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:23.020
I think this is one of the
things that often comes--

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:24.200
AUDIENCE: But isn't it
supposed to be trustless?

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:24.840
I mean, why should
you have trust?

00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:26.943
MICHAEL CASEY: The
trustless and trust thing

00:56:26.943 --> 00:56:31.780
I find-- to me, trustlessness is
this sort of holy grail concept

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:33.820
that bitcoiners have
obviously held up

00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:35.240
as an important principle.

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.823
But at the same time,
it's never going

00:56:36.823 --> 00:56:40.030
to get anywhere unless there's
trust in the system itself

00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:43.570
from people who use it, and
therefore from the government.

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:45.870
Trust and confidence is
the essence of money.

00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:49.220
So building some degree of
transparency, and openness,

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:50.720
and accountability,
around those who

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:54.470
are working in
this system I think

00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:58.240
is an important compromise,
a bridging thing

00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.450
between those two concepts.

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:03.782
Where you overstep the line and
suddenly destroy all the value,

00:57:03.782 --> 00:57:05.990
because all of a sudden,
you've lost the pseudonymity

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:07.820
and so forth, I don't know.

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:12.614
But it is-- it's
important to recognize

00:57:12.614 --> 00:57:13.905
that there's a challenge in it.

00:57:13.905 --> 00:57:18.330
PAUL VIGNA: And I think to
real true believers in Bitcoin,

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:19.970
this is a core issue, right?

00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:23.970
The whole issue of identity,
pseudonymity, anonymity.

00:57:23.970 --> 00:57:28.175
But to most people, I don't
think they really care.

00:57:28.175 --> 00:57:29.310
Most people don't care.

00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:31.630
Most people
broadcast their lives

00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:36.885
on social media and they--
I think this idea of privacy

00:57:36.885 --> 00:57:38.170
has been so eroded.

00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:40.700
I think most people just
really don't care about it.

00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:41.992
They want a product that works.

00:57:41.992 --> 00:57:43.324
I think it's an important issue.

00:57:43.324 --> 00:57:44.410
I'm not saying it's not.

00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:46.960
But I'm saying that I could
see somebody like BitFury

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:51.190
or somebody else come along and
build a system that does not

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:55.540
put anonymity as its Godhead
and still build a product

00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:57.160
that people would use.

00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.760
It's just a matter of what
you think philosophically.

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.410
AUDIENCE: I have one
question for you then, Paul,

00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:03.550
since I already picked
on Michael a little bit.

00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:06.900
So you mentioned Bitcoin's
in its early stages.

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:10.560
Maybe it's early stages for
investors who just picked up

00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:13.477
on it, or journalists, or people
interested on the outside.

00:58:13.477 --> 00:58:15.310
But from like a network
security standpoint,

00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:16.990
it's already given
up 2/3 of its mining

00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:18.810
rewards over the past six years.

00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:20.150
It's basically a senior citizen.

00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:23.270
Like we're depending on fees
at this point to sustain it.

00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:25.329
It doesn't seem
empirically to-- anyone

00:58:25.329 --> 00:58:26.620
wants to actually pay for fees.

00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:28.590
So in the long
run, how would you

00:58:28.590 --> 00:58:31.175
say it could stay
as middle aged,

00:58:31.175 --> 00:58:34.200
or become young again, from its
senior citizen status in terms

00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:34.950
of network awards?

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:37.830
PAUL VIGNA: Well, again,
I think that's an issue,

00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:41.510
especially if you
have invested hundreds

00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:44.050
of thousands or millions of
dollars in infrastructure

00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:47.920
to be the person, to be
the miner, to be the node.

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.370
The price matters a lot.

00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:50.360
The fees matter a lot.

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:50.860
Right?

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:53.370
It kind of gets back to
what you were saying.

00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:56.600
Idealistically, this would
not be good for Bitcoin.

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.490
But I would love to see the
price go down to like $30

00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:02.480
and see what happens there,
see the shake out there.

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:04.100
And then you would
have a situation

00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:06.100
where it would be cheap
enough that you probably

00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:07.510
could do it on your own again.

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:09.600
And the entire
system resets itself,

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.420
and you have a very
different makeup

00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:14.490
of people comprising
the system than what

00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:16.040
you're talking about now.

00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.180
That could happen.

00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:20.030
And personally, I
think Bitcoin's price,

00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:22.706
if it does survive
as a product, if it

00:59:22.706 --> 00:59:24.580
does survive as a
protocol, I think the price

00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:26.150
is going to come down.

00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:28.990
Because I think as
its utility gets

00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:31.585
proven out, its usefulness
on a day to day basis,

00:59:31.585 --> 00:59:34.460
it becomes less-- it
becomes demystified.

00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:35.850
It becomes less speculative.

00:59:35.850 --> 00:59:39.270
It becomes just this thing
that exists that you use.

00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:42.487
Nobody's going to want to pay
$200 for it or $1,000 for it.

00:59:42.487 --> 00:59:43.820
They might think it's worth $30.

00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:45.800
They might think it's worth $1.

00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:49.400
It becomes much more useful,
and much less valuable.

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:51.860
Kind of like you wouldn't
pay $1,000 for a hammer,

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:56.590
but you'd pay $12.50 for
a good hammer from Sears.

00:59:56.590 --> 00:59:58.140
And that's
idealistically speaking.

00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:01.190
That would be a big problem
for the people who have bought

01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:02.810
into the system right now.

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:04.357
But I could see that happening.

01:00:04.357 --> 01:00:06.190
And you have a shakeout,
and it's a problem.

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:08.790
But other people will
come in, and the system

01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:11.160
will reset itself and move on.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:15.804
So you know, it could go
through some senior moments,

01:00:15.804 --> 01:00:16.720
you might want to say.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.590
But I don't think
that necessarily

01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:21.471
has to be a death nail for it.

01:00:21.471 --> 01:00:23.470
MICHAEL CASEY: On the
question of fees replacing

01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:25.400
Bitcoin rewards, and
this notion that we've

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:29.860
gone to a point where that's
just no longer viable, yes,

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:31.210
it's obviously a challenge.

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:33.510
And I suppose the question
becomes, like anywhere else,

01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:34.890
where's the value proposition?

01:00:34.890 --> 01:00:40.240
I mean, if ultimately the
fees have to rise to a level

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:45.590
that they exceed-- we end up
with transaction processing

01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:47.740
fees that are something
like credit card and Visa,

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:49.120
than what's the point, right?

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.800
So there's a concern, and
it's a legitimate one.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.100
And I know there's a
big debate about, well,

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.490
if we start putting all
this extra value on top

01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:00.990
of the blockchain and
trading large property

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.660
securities and so
forth, who would

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:05.247
want to do that if there's not
enough background security?

01:01:05.247 --> 01:01:07.080
To Paul's point, they
actually probably want

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.895
the value to rise higher
so that you have--

01:01:08.895 --> 01:01:10.520
to the opposite of
that, so that you've

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:15.570
got enough of a security basis
for big transactions to happen.

01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:19.020
The question that becomes how
economical does that become,

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:22.510
and what miners-- it's kind
of like to me, you know,

01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:23.200
we don't know.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:23.350
Right?

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:25.308
I mean, there's just this
huge, big experiment.

01:01:25.308 --> 01:01:27.456
What is going to be
demanded, and what's

01:01:27.456 --> 01:01:29.080
going to become--
what are miners going

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:35.080
to need in return for processing
the amount of information

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.540
that's going to passing
across this blockchain?

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:40.740
And I just-- it's
an article of faith,

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:44.780
but I think there is a sense
that these problems can

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:45.480
be resolved.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:46.980
I mean, we've gotten this far.

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:48.100
I don't know how.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:51.870
You can have a much
better grip on how

01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:54.590
this thing would actually
be physically designed.

01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:58.347
But I just feel as if we've
proved-- it's lasted this long.

01:01:58.347 --> 01:01:59.930
It actually has--
to your point, maybe

01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:01.889
it has become the senior
citizen in that sense.

01:02:01.889 --> 01:02:03.805
The good side of that,
it's actually survived.

01:02:03.805 --> 01:02:04.910
It hasn't been destroyed.

01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:07.010
It has actually
functioned to this point.

01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:09.820
And there's a lot of innovation
and money and interest

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:11.410
in making this thing work.

01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:14.200
And on that basis,
I feel as if there's

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.490
going to be ways to innovate.

01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:16.960
It might not be the economy.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.030
It really is going to
be a problem, perhaps.

01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:22.374
The 21 million
might be the limit.

01:02:22.374 --> 01:02:24.620
The compensation
system just might not

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:28.210
be sufficient to sustain this.

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:31.590
But at the same time, we've
got the workings of a model.

01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:34.501
We have the
blockchain as an idea.

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:36.000
And my point is
simply that whatever

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.690
shape it takes, whether it's
a Ethereum or something else,

01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:41.220
decentralization still
needs to be an objective.

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:43.220
It needs to be a very
important objective of how

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:44.961
we take this thing forward.

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:46.710
AUDIENCE: But my
understanding of the pool

01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:49.600
is still a bunch of
different people, right?

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.700
Who all-- they essentially don't
want to gamble with the, oh,

01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:56.860
might I find a
bitcoin ever or not.

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:57.360
Right?

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.140
They just want
some small portion

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:07.980
of each bitcoin that's found,
proportional to how much

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:08.500
they invest.

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:09.370
Right?

01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:12.885
So how is this a danger?

01:03:12.885 --> 01:03:14.635
MICHAEL CASEY: Well,
it's a danger because

01:03:14.635 --> 01:03:15.660
of the way that the server--

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:17.110
PAUL VIGNA: We're talking about
two different things, right?

01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:18.902
I mean, you're talking
about the big pools.

01:03:18.902 --> 01:03:20.776
You're talking about
basically the contracts,

01:03:20.776 --> 01:03:21.740
the hashing contracts.

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:22.240
Right?

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.160
You're like, you buy a
contract, and somebody

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.007
has a small [INAUDIBLE], and
you get a little piece of it.

01:03:27.007 --> 01:03:27.840
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.480
AUDIENCE: No, I'm
talking about mining.

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.260
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:30.860
MICHAEL CASEY:
--contract, or you

01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:31.600
could be your own
separate miner.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.516
Either way, you still
belong to a pool, right?

01:03:33.516 --> 01:03:36.624
So the pool is the way
to efficiently distribute

01:03:36.624 --> 01:03:38.540
a piece of what's happening
rather than having

01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:40.290
to rely on the idea
that just once you

01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:42.710
might win the next
block three years hence.

01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:43.210
Right?

01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:45.060
So it's a way to
actually portion it out

01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:47.400
on a more steady
flow what that is.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.930
And that would be-- it
wouldn't be a problem at all

01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:51.900
if the pool
structure had nothing

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:56.930
to do with voting power and
the application of the capacity

01:03:56.930 --> 01:04:04.550
to determine what the
shape of the blockchain is.

01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:05.660
But it's not like that.

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:13.190
It is that the pool
itself, it has the capacity

01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:16.600
to actually set the next block.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:22.370
The pool becomes the
administrator of the block.

01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:26.710
It's drawing upon the hashing
power of all of its members

01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:29.100
to then becomes the next block.

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:29.790
All right?

01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:32.479
So that gives it enormous
administrative power.

01:04:32.479 --> 01:04:34.270
I mean, that's why it
comes up all the time

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:40.610
when GHash.IO, which was
one of the biggest pools,

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:41.850
got over 51%.

01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:44.480
There was a some great concern
that they would use that power

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.760
to launch the attack.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.560
Now, they didn't, because not
in their interest to do so.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.143
That's the other
point of this, right?

01:04:49.143 --> 01:04:50.760
Is why would you do it?

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:54.540
That's proven to be enough
of a defense right now.

01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:56.450
But the very prospect
of it is still there.

01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:57.510
AUDIENCE: If they
did that, though, I

01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:58.790
mean it would be obvious.

01:04:58.790 --> 01:05:00.520
People would see it
happening, right?

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:03.460
So would--

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:06.610
PAUL VIGNA: I think, too, the
whole thing is-- you know,

01:05:06.610 --> 01:05:10.426
it's something that Nakamoto
addressed in the white paper.

01:05:10.426 --> 01:05:13.050
I mean, this was something-- he
was the first one to bring this

01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:15.800
up, this idea of a 51% attack.

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:17.190
And he ultimately rejected it.

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:19.510
Because it is ultimately
self-defeating, you're right.

01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:20.410
People would see it.

01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:21.820
They would understand it.

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:26.260
And to the extent that somebody
did take over the blockchain,

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:29.150
they would drive everybody else
out that then becomes useless,

01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:30.430
becomes valueless.

01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:32.630
And everything that they
invested, building up

01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:35.380
to 51% or more, becomes
completely-- they

01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:38.520
lose all their money on it.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.650
It's an issue, but I don't--
firstly, I agree with Nakamoto.

01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:45.807
I don't think it's going
to be a death knell

01:05:45.807 --> 01:05:46.640
problem for Bitcoin.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.306
When I don't think
it's going to happen,

01:05:48.306 --> 01:05:50.180
because ultimately
it is self-defeating.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.030
AUDIENCE: That wasn't
actually what I meant.

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:52.671
I meant the
individual miners who

01:05:52.671 --> 01:05:54.420
are contributing to
the pool would notice,

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:55.461
and then they would stop.

01:05:55.461 --> 01:05:56.350
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:05:56.514 --> 01:05:58.430
MICHAEL CASEY: But it's
the same point, right?

01:05:58.430 --> 01:06:01.016
Ultimately that you would
stop doing something

01:06:01.016 --> 01:06:03.140
that would destroy your
value, would leave the pool

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:04.870
and diminish its power, and
therefore would no longer be

01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:05.453
able to do so.

01:06:08.352 --> 01:06:10.310
I don't know the degree
to which you even know.

01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:12.540
I mean, that there's fraudulent
transactions that are building.

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.880
There's double spins that don't
necessarily get picked up.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.200
I mean, I don't know enough
about the technicalities of it.

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.366
It's quite-- I would imagine
it's actually possible,

01:06:19.366 --> 01:06:20.400
for quite some time.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.900
There's been quite
a bit of research

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:24.020
into whether 51%
attacks are possible

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:26.040
and how it might
manifest itself.

01:06:27.495 --> 01:06:28.870
But it might go
on for some time.

01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:30.000
And all you're doing
is you're eroding

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.770
the value of the--
people, unaware of it,

01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:34.700
are actually off what they
think is a legitimate chain,

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:37.050
and in the process, they're
just actually undermining

01:06:37.050 --> 01:06:39.050
the reality and the
effectiveness of the system.

01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:40.032
Now, I don't know.

01:06:40.032 --> 01:06:41.240
Maybe somebody gets swindled.

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.160
They raise their hand.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:42.910
The word gets out.

01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:43.740
Who knows?

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:45.470
It could very well come out.

01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:47.510
But that would be the
defense mechanism-- I

01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:48.760
think you're absolutely right.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.970
The idea that you would
expect pool members to leave,

01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:52.386
diminish the power,
and that would

01:06:52.386 --> 01:06:55.139
become the self-regulating
system within that.

01:06:55.139 --> 01:06:56.680
The great concern
for me though, just

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.170
from this whole
practical perspective,

01:06:58.170 --> 01:07:00.380
is how does this become used
from a commercial perspective

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:01.930
and whether companies
get involved.

01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:05.130
If I'm a lawyer at a
Fortune 500 company,

01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:06.990
and I wanted to maybe
think I should start

01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:08.960
using Bitcoin for my
international procurement

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.790
or something else, and I'm a
lawyer, it's like, no, look.

01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:13.445
I don't care.

01:07:13.445 --> 01:07:15.070
Whether or not this
is possible or not,

01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:18.827
this is big enough of a risk
that our-- whatever settlement

01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:20.910
that we think we've done
could be reversed however

01:07:20.910 --> 01:07:22.782
many months from now.

01:07:22.782 --> 01:07:23.740
It's just not worth it.

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:24.240
Right?

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.470
So lawyers are
incredibly cautious.

01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:29.270
And the very presence
of a 51% attack I think

01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:31.132
is a challenge for
that very reason.

01:07:31.132 --> 01:07:33.090
AUDIENCE: So I think some
of the early adopters

01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:37.750
got into Bitcoin principally
because it's a better gold

01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:39.260
to store a value.

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:42.700
I think one of the questions
as to Bitcoin's survivability

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:45.770
is what is it going to take
to the rest of the population

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:48.310
to sort of appreciate
that use case?

01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:51.376
Do you have any
thoughts on that?

01:07:51.376 --> 01:07:52.750
PAUL VIGNA: It's
a good question.

01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:58.030
I mean, because I
don't know that there's

01:07:58.030 --> 01:07:59.190
a good answer for it.

01:07:59.190 --> 01:08:00.523
That's why it's a good question.

01:08:00.523 --> 01:08:03.260
I mean, it's a problem,
this idea of Bitcoin

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:06.235
becoming a mainstream
product, it's a problem.

01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:10.942
However, the solution,
I think, is just time.

01:08:10.942 --> 01:08:13.400
This is something that is going
to have to prove itself out

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:16.319
over a period of
years before people

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:19.350
become comfortable enough that
they don't think about it.

01:08:19.350 --> 01:08:20.569
You know, it's funny.

01:08:20.569 --> 01:08:23.110
I was thinking about this on
the plane when I was coming over

01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.750
here yesterday.

01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:25.333
Because I came over
on a plane, right?

01:08:25.333 --> 01:08:27.704
So I flew from New York in
about five or six hours--

01:08:27.704 --> 01:08:28.284
MICHAEL CASEY: [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:28.284 --> 01:08:28.590
PAUL VIGNA: No.

01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:29.370
But, I mean, think about it.

01:08:29.370 --> 01:08:30.250
I got on a plane.

01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:32.700
I got on a giant
hulking piece of metal

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:35.720
that went up 30,000 feet in
the air and in five hours

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.439
transported me 3,000 miles.

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:42.290
If anything goes wrong on
that plane, I am a dead man.

01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:42.939
Dead.

01:08:42.939 --> 01:08:43.750
30,000 feet?

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:44.300
Forget it.

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:44.800
It's gone.

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.600
I got on a plane without
even thinking about it.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.250
I was excited.

01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:47.750
I was happy.

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:49.666
I thought, oh, great,
I'm going to fall asleep

01:08:49.666 --> 01:08:50.380
in San Francisco.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:51.819
That's a great thing.

01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:53.950
Because the technology
has proven itself out

01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:55.200
over the course of a century.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.260
People don't even think
about getting on planes.

01:08:57.260 --> 01:08:59.176
People don't even think
about getting in a car

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:01.729
and driving on a highway
at 80 miles an hour.

01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:05.250
Because the technology
has proven itself out

01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:07.630
over a long, long
period of time.

01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:10.580
Bitcoin is going to have to
go through that same proving

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:13.794
period before the
mainstream people use it

01:09:13.794 --> 01:09:15.960
without even thinking about
it or worrying about it.

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:16.918
Oh, it's digital money.

01:09:16.918 --> 01:09:18.810
Bitcoin, I'll pick one, boom.

01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:21.350
It's going to take time
for it to prove itself out.

01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:22.790
And if it can't
prove itself out,

01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:24.270
well, then it's just
going to die away.

01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:26.603
And it'll be another idea
that was neat and interesting,

01:09:26.603 --> 01:09:28.809
and got some adherence,
and didn't make it.

01:09:28.809 --> 01:09:29.550
MICHAEL CASEY: I'll
just have one last word

01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:31.550
that I think might
round this thing out.

01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:33.950
And that is that I think
absolutely we've kind

01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:37.734
of reached our plateau, our
limit for how many mainstream

01:09:37.734 --> 01:09:39.400
folks are going to
go and say, hey, this

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.640
would be a great tool
for me to go on and buy

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.390
my groceries with.

01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:44.170
And for all the reasons we cite,
it's just not a very attractive

01:09:44.170 --> 01:09:45.250
currency to be used.

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:47.204
The big question,
then, is moving it

01:09:47.204 --> 01:09:49.620
to the next phase is how it
becomes adopted by companies--

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.204
how it's adopted by corporates,
institutions, organizations.

01:09:52.204 --> 01:09:53.620
That's going to
be the next phase.

01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.010
And we're probably going to
have to go through that phase

01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:57.691
before we bring all of the
general public on board.

01:09:57.691 --> 01:09:59.940
That's why this question
that we're talking about here

01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:01.170
is important, because
these guys have

01:10:01.170 --> 01:10:02.880
got a different set
of motives from what

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.240
the early adopters had.

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.360
And that's why the
debate is critical.

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.430
But I don't think we're going
to-- the idea, the dream

01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:12.020
that we would just sort of
automatically move gradually

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:14.780
through the population, and we'd
all sort of start picking up

01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:17.320
this thing and using
it to pay for our gas

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.520
or whatever, it
was a pipe dream.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:24.140
And therefore, the next phase
is this corporate phase.

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:27.090
And how it plays
out is critical.

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:28.850
So just a way to round it out.

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:31.020
MALE SPEAKER: And on
that note, please join me

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:32.690
in thanking Michael and Paul.

01:10:32.690 --> 01:10:35.539
[APPLAUSE]
