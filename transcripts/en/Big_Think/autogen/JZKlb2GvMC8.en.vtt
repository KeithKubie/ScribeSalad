source movement and data sharing I think
 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.769
source movement and data sharing I think
is a very very big part of that it's

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779
is a very very big part of that it's
 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.870
is a very very big part of that it's
important for organizations to have all

the pieces of puzzle especially these
 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.359
the pieces of puzzle especially these
are development organizations these are

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369
are development organizations these are
 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.720
are development organizations these are
Crisis Response organizations but we

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730
Crisis Response organizations but we
 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.290
Crisis Response organizations but we
have not to date really had a sufficient

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
have not to date really had a sufficient
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.760
have not to date really had a sufficient
effective means to share data and I that

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770
effective means to share data and I that
 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.260
effective means to share data and I that
I don't mean we have technical barriers

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270
I don't mean we have technical barriers
 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.090
I don't mean we have technical barriers
to sharing data we have cultural

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100
to sharing data we have cultural
 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.639
to sharing data we have cultural
barriers to sharing data there are a lot

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649
barriers to sharing data there are a lot
 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.690
barriers to sharing data there are a lot
of organizations around the world

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700
of organizations around the world
 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.790
of organizations around the world
including Crisis Response and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800
including Crisis Response and
 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.389

organizations that are reluctant to

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739
organizations that are reluctant to
 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.920
organizations that are reluctant to
share the real data that make that it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930
share the real data that make that it
 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.130
share the real data that make that it
that enables true collaboration and I

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140
that enables true collaboration and I
 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.160
that enables true collaboration and I
think that's a mindset we need to get

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
think that's a mindset we need to get
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.900
think that's a mindset we need to get
around the other thing is there's a

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
around the other thing is there's a
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.970
around the other thing is there's a
difference between providing data and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980
difference between providing data and
 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.939
difference between providing data and
providing data in a usable user-friendly

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949
providing data in a usable user-friendly
 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.260
providing data in a usable user-friendly
way that people can actually use for

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270
way that people can actually use for
 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.390
way that people can actually use for
good and so there are a lot of efforts

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400
good and so there are a lot of efforts
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.690
good and so there are a lot of efforts
around the world to be able to take

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700
around the world to be able to take
 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.100
around the world to be able to take
particularly big data and to put that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110
particularly big data and to put that
 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.429
particularly big data and to put that
into bite-sized bits to put that in in

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
into bite-sized bits to put that in in
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.950
into bite-sized bits to put that in in
something that's that can be used by the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960
something that's that can be used by the
 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.560
something that's that can be used by the
public used by citizen scientists used

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570
public used by citizen scientists used
 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.950
public used by citizen scientists used
by governments to create good and I

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960
by governments to create good and I
 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.480
by governments to create good and I
think there's a strong move in that

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
think there's a strong move in that
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.330
think there's a strong move in that
direction but we've got a long way to go

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340
direction but we've got a long way to go
 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.980
direction but we've got a long way to go
one of the things that I think is really

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990
one of the things that I think is really
 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.690
one of the things that I think is really
going to affect our global society is

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700
going to affect our global society is
 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.880
going to affect our global society is
and one of the things that I think is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890
and one of the things that I think is
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.230
and one of the things that I think is
going to propel open-source and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
going to propel open-source and
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.810
going to propel open-source and
transparency and data sharing is I

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820
transparency and data sharing is I
 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.810
transparency and data sharing is I
believe that true open collaboration

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820
believe that true open collaboration
 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.789
believe that true open collaboration
which requires all those things is going

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799
which requires all those things is going
 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.030
which requires all those things is going
to be a tremendous economic engine and I

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040
to be a tremendous economic engine and I
 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.639
to be a tremendous economic engine and I
think that those organizations and those

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649
think that those organizations and those
 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.039
think that those organizations and those
people and those governments that in

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
people and those governments that in
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.749
people and those governments that in
dealing corruption and Bill and

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759
dealing corruption and Bill and
 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.190
dealing corruption and Bill and
secretive dealing those organizations

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
secretive dealing those organizations
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.620
secretive dealing those organizations
that take an exclusively proprietary

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630
that take an exclusively proprietary
 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.539
that take an exclusively proprietary
mindset are gonna see themselves being

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
mindset are gonna see themselves being
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.859
mindset are gonna see themselves being
left behind and they're gonna have to

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869
left behind and they're gonna have to
 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.170
left behind and they're gonna have to
adapt and evolve and and take on a much

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
adapt and evolve and and take on a much
 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.160
adapt and evolve and and take on a much
more collaborative and cooperative

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
more collaborative and cooperative
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.649
more collaborative and cooperative
mindset to be able to keep up with the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
mindset to be able to keep up with the
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.660
mindset to be able to keep up with the
economic growth that true open

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
economic growth that true open
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.429
economic growth that true open
collaboration will bring and I think

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
collaboration will bring and I think
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.350
collaboration will bring and I think
this is a really significant trend you

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360
this is a really significant trend you
 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.790
this is a really significant trend you
know there's many problems that we that

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800
know there's many problems that we that
 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.750
know there's many problems that we that
we face as a global society you know

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760
we face as a global society you know
 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.830
we face as a global society you know
option for instance you know I don't

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840
option for instance you know I don't
 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.449
option for instance you know I don't
think we've had corruption probably

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459
think we've had corruption probably
 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.729
think we've had corruption probably
since the first transaction and I don't

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739
since the first transaction and I don't
 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.020
since the first transaction and I don't
think we're gonna be able to tackle that

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030
think we're gonna be able to tackle that
 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.759
think we're gonna be able to tackle that
head-on but we can potentially make

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769
head-on but we can potentially make
 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.339
head-on but we can potentially make
corruption obsolete by making it

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349
corruption obsolete by making it
 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.890
corruption obsolete by making it
irrelevant by making it be an

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900
irrelevant by making it be an
 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.220
irrelevant by making it be an
ineffective way to do business
