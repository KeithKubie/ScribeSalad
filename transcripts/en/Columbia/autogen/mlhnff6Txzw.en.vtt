00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.780
I am currently the co-chair for the
Institute for Research in African

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.820
American Studies Alumni Council and so
what we do is we connect current

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.640
graduates to current undergraduates and
we develop programs, we align them and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.320
create a network and a source for them
to think about their work and their

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.520
professions outside of the Academy and
outside of their time here at Columbia

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.710
but we also support the Institute for
Research and African American Studies in

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.870
terms of supporting their programs and
aligning them with current and past

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.010
alumni. The work that I did at
Columbia during my time here is

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.930
essential to the work that I'm doing now
I work on Shirley Chisholm, that was my

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.100
master's thesis, which I received the Zora Neale Hurston Award, and I was a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.559
Paul Robeson fellow here and so it was
essential, it set the groundwork for the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.939
work that I do now, I'm currently the
director of the Shirley Chisholm Project

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.409
for Brooklyn women's activism at
Brooklyn College, I am a loan expert

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.090
around Shirley Chisholm and black
woman's politics and so it was essential

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.290
for the ways in which I think about
black women and politics

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.930
it started the groundwork for my current
manuscript called "Sister Insider/ Sister

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.729
Outsider," a comparative study of shirley
Chisholm and Barbara Jordan and the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.340
black women's politics in the post-civil
rights era and so it allowed me to get

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.570
the feedback from faculty on how to
think about writing, how to approach a

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.840
theoretical framework for the work that
I  do on black women
