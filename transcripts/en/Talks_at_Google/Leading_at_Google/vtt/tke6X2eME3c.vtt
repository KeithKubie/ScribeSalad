&gt;&gt; WITTENBERG: Hi, everybody. Thank you for
coming. My name is Evan Wittenberg. I work

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.540
in the leadership development and people management
group as part of Google University. And we're

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.179
very excited today to be introducing Tony
Schwartz as our next Leading@Google lecturer.

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.630
Tony has an interesting history. Currently,
he's the founder, president, and CEO of a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.020
company called the Energy Project which deals
all about with how to manage your energy,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.090
not your time to be more effective and achieve
optimal performance in the workplace, at home,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.590
in life, et cetera. His background is really
interesting. He began his career as a journalist.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.510
He was a reporter for the New York Times,
associate editor at Newsweek, staff writer

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.280
at New York and Esquire Magazines, and a columnist
for Fast Company. He also has a little dirty

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.989
secret from his past, co-authored the number
one, international bestseller "The Art of

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.609
the Deal" with Donald Trump. So if you have
questions about his opinion of Trump, you

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.040
can ask him later. And more importantly, wrote
a book call "What Really Matters: Searching

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.069
for Wisdom in America." What he's here to
talk to us today about is what I alluded to

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:01.679
you before, how we can be more effective by
thinking about our energy throughout the day

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:07.750
rather than our time. And he's actually piloted
his two-day version of the course here at

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.210
Google that some people on the audience, raise
your hand if you've been through that course;

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.580
a couple of people. So, you can look around
and ask them later if you want to know how

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.950
that was and we'll be announcing more about
that in the next few weeks. A couple of important

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.420
things that Tony has asked, one thing that
you'll learn about in this book when you read

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.490
it, for those of you who got it, "The Power
of Full Engagement," is that the brain is

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.890
actually unable to multitask. So Tony has
asked to please close your laptops unless

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.600
you're actually taking notes about this because
it's not possible to pay attention to both

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.590
even though we fool ourselves about that all
the time. There will be time at the end for

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.381
questions and I would ask you to please come
up to this microphone at the end if you have

00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:46.530
questions about the talk. Hopefully, Tony
will keep you engaged so you won't be tempted

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.010
to go back to the Blackberrys and computers
throughout the talk. And I think without further

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:58.580
adieu, let me introduce Tony Schwartz. Welcome.
&gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: Thank you. Thank you. Good morning.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.480
It's great to be here with a wonderful day.
This work comes out of a passion of mine that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.729
began somewhere in my teens when other people
were doing things very different than I was

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.340
doing. I was trying to figure out what life
was all about and what made it possible, what

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.930
was it that made it possible, I guess, back
then to be a happier and more satisfied human

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.620
being than I was growing up in a difficult
New York Jewish family. But over time that

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.670
evolved into a passion around, what makes
it possible for a person to be all they're

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.580
capable of being. What makes it possible for
a human being to build progressively over

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.090
their life a richer, deeper version of who
they are? And this work is about that. It's

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.230
nominally about helping organizations to be
more effective and more productive. It's nominally

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.640
about the difference about what it takes to
be a great leader. But I deeply believe that

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.780
you can be a great human being and it may
or may not have any impact on--I'm sorry,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.480
you could be--yes, you could be a great human
being and it may or may not have any impact

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.491
on whether you can be a great leader. But
you can't be a great leader if you're not

00:03:10.491 --> 00:03:17.820
a great human being. And so to me, the work
of leadership, the work of really being the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.770
most effective you can possibly be begins
with the work of yourself. And so today, I'm

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.140
going to give you just a little taste of it.
You're going to see that it's oriented a little

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.709
bit in the physical direction and that's largely
because everything begins with the body. I

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.850
want to assure you that if you choose to,
if you're intrigued by this work that there's

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:46.069
a lot more to it and that we ultimately take
account of quite a wide variety of components

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.980
that influenced your capacity to show up with
everything you've got in each part of your

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.870
life. So, what is it that starts us off? What
is it that makes it possible for me to get

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:06.420
folks interested in bringing me into organizations?
And basically, it's this. It's that we have

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.960
developed a gap between demand and capacity.
So, here's the deal. In your lives, what happens

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.660
is when you're born, you obviously have very
low demand. You make a lot of demands but

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.600
you don't have a lot of demand. And your demand
progressively goes up over time. And in the

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.850
world we live in, it just keeps on going until
hopefully one day you drop off the face of

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.550
the cliff and your demands in the most graceful
way possible. But in the meantime, what's

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:43.450
happening is that in the absence of a conscious
and intentional intervention on your part,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:50.250
the capacity you bring to the table is rising
no matter what you do. How many people here--well,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.840
I don't want to ask that quite yet--the capacity
in your life is rising no matter what you

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.650
do to your body, no matter what you do to
yourself. Your capacity just keeps on going

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.180
up, but it hits a peak at a certain point
in your life in the absence of intervention.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.560
What age do you think that peak is?
&gt;&gt; MALE: Forty-five.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:20.120
&gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: Unfortunately, it is 30 not 45.
Now, in this group unlike most of the groups

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.650
I talked to, that's not yet such bad news
for you because you're not there yet. But

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.770
guess what, even if you're not, I promise
you will be. And what happens then is that

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:38.760
your capacity progressively diminishes over
time most especially, most especially at the

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.680
physical level. So for example, in the absence
of you're doing anything to keep this from

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.870
happening, from the age of 30 on, you will
lose one half pound of lean muscle mass every

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:55.169
year for the rest of your life. That's not
good news. And the reason it's not good news

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:00.169
is that demand is not only--how many of you
would say that the demand in your life over

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:07.860
the last two or three years is as high as
it's ever been in your life. Okay. And how

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.930
many of you expect given that you probably
pushed yourself pretty damn hard to get to

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:18.180
where you are today that over the next year
the demand in your life will finally begin

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:25.960
to diminish. So, in other words, your demand
is the highest it's been ever over the last

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.340
three years and you have every expectation
that it's going to continue to rise at a minimum

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.770
not to diminish. Let me ask you this question.
How many of you think that along with your

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:44.130
demand your capacity will rise systematically
to keep pace with your demand over the next

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:51.060
period of time? Houston, we got a problem.
It's this problem, it's this gap, and that's

00:06:51.060 --> 00:07:00.460
the game we're in the business of trying to
address. So, the issue is that when it comes

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:07.650
to meeting demand, the number one resource
most of us use, naturally use, instinctively

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:13.320
use is our time. So, if you've got more demand,
you put in more hours. And I'm sure that many

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:19.350
of you are putting in a lot of hours. And
in fact, organizations, even progressive organizations

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:23.669
like Google, even if it doesn't say it, even
if it has all sorts of wonderful things to

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:30.400
give you an opportunity not to be working
does in fact value you to a considerable degree

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.979
based on the number of hours it's perceived
that you invest. Now, that's great for a certain

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:43.740
period of time. But when you reach the limit
of the number of hours you have available

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:49.650
to invest, you've got a problem when it comes
to expanding your capacity, don't you. How

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.210
many people here would like me to stop, spend
a few minutes giving you some advice on how

00:07:54.210 --> 00:08:00.400
to use your free hours? So, we're already.
That dance card is already full, isn't it?

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:07.069
That dance card is fall and the bottom line
is that time is finite. You've got 168 hours

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:11.699
in the week. You're never going to have another
hour and you already don't have any free but

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:16.440
I guess you're--but I know that your demand
is rising. So, that's not going to solve your

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:22.760
problem if we are going to make it possible
to meet the increasing demand in our lives,

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.860
to take account of the fact that we live in
a more complex world, what you're going to

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.509
have to do is you're going to have to find
a way other than time to get more done. In

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:36.080
other words, you're going to have to get more
than in less time. And the only way that we

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.530
have recognized that that really fundamentally
is possible is to go after a different resource

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:47.600
and that resource is energy. And the reason
energy is a good resource to use is because

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.300
energy unlike time is inside you. Time is
outside you. It moves by you like a train

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.270
and once it's gone, it's gone forever. But
energy is inside you and it can be systematically

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:06.360
expanded and it can be regularly renewed.
So energy is a fabulous resource to put it

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.420
in your disposal. But what is energy? What
is energy? Because it's easy to say energy;

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:17.180
there's all kinds of energy and, you know,
it's easy to get real soft on the idea of

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:23.110
energy. One of the reasons that organizations
use hours is they're very clear to calibrate,

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.120
minutes, hours, days, that's really easy to
calibrate. Energy is more ambiguous, more

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:33.350
subjective. So what is energy? Well, it turns
out, actually, energy has been defined. Energy

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.740
is the capacity to do work, that's what you
go in your physics courses, right? Energy

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:44.170
is the capacity to do work. So in other words,
in simple terms, if you have more energy,

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:49.990
you have more capacity, don't you? So in other
words, if I can help you to systematically

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:54.930
build the reservoir of energy that you have
available, if I could put more fuel in your

00:09:54.930 --> 00:10:01.490
tank then presumably you'll have more capacity.
We tend to focus on skills and competencies,

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:06.050
that's the life you've lived. You've all developed
an enormous number of skills, you've had all

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:11.050
kinds of achievements around skills and you've
been measured by how many of those skills

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:15.320
you have. You've got into Google because you
have more than most people, way more than

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:23.100
most people. But here's the problem in a demand-laden
world with focusing simply on capacity. I'm

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:30.250
sorry, on competency. Capacity is underneath
competency. Capacity is what makes it possible

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:35.519
for you to bring your skill and talent to
life. You can't run on empty, although a lot

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:40.390
of us try to do it. So if you are trying to
bring your skill and talent to life but you

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:45.060
are, you didn't sleep a lot last night or
you don't eat the right foods, or you've got

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.040
the wrong emotional state, or you weren't
good at focusing your attention, or your level

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.740
of commitment and passion isn't all that high,
these are all components of capacity, then

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.170
you're not going to be able to do it. And
we all know people, and we all know times

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:03.160
in our lives when you--despite your enormous
skill and talent, haven't been able to deliver

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:11.810
it, particularly under pressure. In a human
being, I'm sorry--in a car, you need one source

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:17.339
of energy to get the thing to go, and mostly
it's been fuel. Now it's starting to change

00:11:17.339 --> 00:11:23.540
but it still going to primarily be one source
of energy. But a human being--a human being

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:30.839
requires a much more complex set of energies,
energy in the human system is multidimensional.

00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:37.260
We need four separate sources of energy in
order to be able to perform at our best, each

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:42.680
one of them is necessary, none of them is
sufficient by itself and they deeply influence

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:48.959
one another. So you can't get by--or I shouldn't
say get by, you can get by using only one

00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:53.390
or two of them to any great effect but you
can't operate at your best if you do that.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:59.390
So what are these four sources of energy?
So I've already said that, so I don't need

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:06.110
to repeat it. The four--the four sources of
energy start with the physical, why? Because

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:13.290
the physical is the base, it's the--it's the
foundation on which everything else rests.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:18.860
If you don't have sufficient physical energy,
is it going to influence your focus of attention?

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.830
Is it going to influence your ability to manage
your emotion under pressure? Of course it

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:29.610
is. So, we have tended to make this not performance
relevant or relevant to performance in the

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:35.120
work place, we've discounted how important
physical energy is, and we haven't systematically

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:40.240
focused attention on it, and in fact increasingly
in schools for kids where we're starting to

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.970
do work we see that they basically dispense
with the physical dimension. They don't pay

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:50.700
attention to it at all. You know, if you're
not on a varsity team in high school, then

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:56.990
you're not getting any attention to your physical
capacity. Physical capacity has four components.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:02.709
It's the simplest of all the capacities because
of that. Number one, nutrition; you're ability

00:13:02.709 --> 00:13:07.970
to move glucose and sustain glucose at a certain
level in your body, that's number one. Number

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:14.500
two, fitness; how well you transport oxygen
through your body. Number three is sleep;

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.490
how well do you sleep, do you sleep enough
hours, do you sleep deeply enough. And the

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:23.810
forth is, and this is the one that people
don't pay much attention to is recovery or

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:29.019
renewal; the day time equivalent of sleep
because the body is designed to sleep twice.

00:13:29.019 --> 00:13:32.700
The body is designed to sleep for a longer
period of time at night and it's designed

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:38.790
to sleep for a short period of time in the
afternoon. And so it's also designed, unlike

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:43.480
a machine, it's designed to move rhythmically
between the expenditure and the recovery of

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:49.730
energy. And so you need to, as you'll see
when I get a little further into this description,

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:55.270
you need to learn to value intermittent renewal
during the day in the same way that you currently,

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.079
I don't want to say in the same way that you
currently value sleep because a lot of you

00:13:58.079 --> 00:14:03.060
don't value sleep very much. But in the way
you should be valuing sleep. Okay. So that's

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.870
physical energy. Then there is the quality
of your energy. The quality of your energy,

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:15.510
that's how you feel because how you feel profoundly
influences how well you perform, how well

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:22.639
you lead, how well you interact with others,
there is a very specific set of emotions that

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:27.950
are associated with sustainable high performance,
and I'm going to get to those and talk about

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:32.350
those in just a moment. So we've got quantity
of energy, we've got quality of energy, and

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:36.861
then we've got focus of energy. So that's
the mental dimension. Focus of energy is what

00:14:36.861 --> 00:14:41.960
the Evan was obliquely referring to when he
said that I didn't want you to be using your

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.889
computers and Blackberrys. The reason I actually
didn't want you to is because it makes me

00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:53.639
feel bad. It makes me feel like you don't
care, like you don't love me, and I have a

00:14:53.639 --> 00:15:01.589
high need. But the focus of your energy is,
the work we do around this dimension and the

00:15:01.589 --> 00:15:09.529
importance of it is that for thousands of
years it has been understood that we do our

00:15:09.529 --> 00:15:15.240
most effective work when we focus on one thing
at a time. That's were the meditative traditions

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:22.670
came from. We have lost that. Google is responsible
for a lot of that because of the number of

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:27.649
opportunities it gives us to interrupt our
attention, but there are thousands of ways

00:15:27.649 --> 00:15:34.010
now that we get our attention interrupted
and it's at extraordinary cause to your productivity.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.560
It's also at extraordinary cause to the depth
of work that you do. You know that if you

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:44.180
go out and try to take a run for example,
that the first two or three minutes or the

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:50.310
first five minutes, how do you feel? You don't
feel very good, you're not warmed up, you're

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:54.570
not feeling like your muscles are warm, like
you're loose, like you're in your rhythm.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:16:01.480
Well the same thing is true mentally, if you
try to begin a hard task for the first three

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.750
minutes, or five minutes, or eight minutes,
or whatever it is for you, you're going to

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:10.459
be half there and half not there. You are
slowly dropping down into a state of absorption.

00:16:10.459 --> 00:16:15.940
If you interrupt yourself frequently then
what you are doing is you're interfering with

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:22.949
that level of absorption, and on average,
the average person stays on task in an organization

00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:29.510
in an America today for eleven minutes. Eleven
minutes on a task before they go on to another

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:35.270
task, but during those eleven minutes, they
interrupt themselves with something, an average

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:40.910
of every three minutes. So you can see that
we've got a big interference with our ability

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:45.360
to bring absorbed attention to the table which
is part of the energy equation. And then finally,

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.380
there is the one that sounds as soft as in
fact probably the most important which is

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:58.380
what we call the energy of the human spirit.
The energy of the human spirit is the energy

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:06.339
derived from the sense, from the experience
of purpose and from an alignment between what

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:13.209
you say is important in your life and how
you actually live; and the better that alignment,

00:17:13.209 --> 00:17:19.409
the more powerful the source of energy available
to you. In fact, this energy drives, this

00:17:19.409 --> 00:17:25.750
is the "Why," the others of the "Hows." This
"Why" energy drives your behavior at all the

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:31.470
other level. So, it's an additional source
of energy, emotionally, mentally, and physically

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:35.539
when you've got it in place. So four sources
of energy, if you got all those four sources

00:17:35.539 --> 00:17:40.649
of energy happening for you, if you've got
that full reservoir of them, then you could

00:17:40.649 --> 00:17:47.729
fire on all cylinders. How many of you got
those nailed, those four? Let's find out.

00:17:47.729 --> 00:17:51.559
You got a pencil, or you got something that
you can write on? I'm going to take you through

00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:56.559
a little energy audit; that's what we call,
a little energy audit to give you a sense

00:17:56.559 --> 00:18:03.640
of how you're doing in terms of these four
dimensions of energy. How much energy do you

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:09.409
have available to you in each of these four
dimensions? This little audit is designed

00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:15.529
around what we have determined, and it's very
strongly research-based. If you go on our

00:18:15.529 --> 00:18:21.360
website, the energyproject.com, you will see
a database for everything that I'm talking

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.649
about. So I'm not talking about these things
because they occurred to me as good ideas.

00:18:25.649 --> 00:18:32.710
This is our gathering of the research. So,
what I want you to do in each of these questions,

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:38.359
I'd like you to answer, I'd like you to just
make a check mark on your paper if the answer

00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:43.230
to the question is yes. That's all you have
to do. And then at the end we'll add up the

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:49.210
"yes" answers. Bad news is this is one of
those rare test where getting a "yes" doesn't

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:54.509
serve you well. Number one, I don't regularly
get at least seven to eight hours of sleep,

00:18:54.509 --> 00:19:00.700
and I often wake up feeling tired. Number
two, I frequently skip breakfast or I settle

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:06.179
for something that isn't particularly healthy.
Number three, I don't workout enough, meaning,

00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:10.620
cardiovascular training at least three times
a week and strength training at least once

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:16.799
a week. If you don't do both of those, you're
a "yes." Number four, I don't take regular

00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:22.929
breaks during the day to renew and recharge,
and I often eat lunch at my desk if I ate

00:19:22.929 --> 00:19:30.039
lunch at all. Number five, I frequently find
myself feeling irritable, impatient, or anxious

00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:36.010
at work especially when demand is high. Number
six, I don't have enough time with my family

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:42.850
and loved ones, and when I'm with them I'm
not always really with them. Number seven,

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:48.989
I take too little time in my life for the
activities that I most deeply enjoy. Number

00:19:48.989 --> 00:19:57.419
eight, I rarely stop to express my appreciation
to others or to savor and celebrate my accomplishments

00:19:57.419 --> 00:20:03.119
and blessings. If you don't do both of those
things, you're a "yes." Number nine, I have

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:08.340
difficulty focusing on one thing at a time,
and I'm easily distracted during the day,

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:16.980
especially by email. That's a "yes" for all
of you. Number 10, I spend much of my time

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:23.849
reacting to immediate demands rather than
focusing on activities with long-term value

00:20:23.849 --> 00:20:28.879
and higher leverage. Number 11, I don't take
enough time for reflections, strategizing,

00:20:28.879 --> 00:20:34.710
or thinking creatively. Number 12, I work
in the evenings and/or on the weekends and

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:41.169
I rarely take a vacation free of work, if
I take a vacation at all. Number 13, I spend

00:20:41.169 --> 00:20:48.729
too little time at work doing what I do best
and enjoy most. Number 14, there are significant

00:20:48.729 --> 00:20:55.240
gaps between what I say is important in my
life and how I actually live; I say that my

00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:00.430
girlfriend, significant other, wife, husband
is important, but I don't spend much time

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:06.320
or energy on that. Number 15, my decisions
at work are more influenced by external demands

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:12.859
than by a strong, clear sense of my own purpose.
And finally, number 16, I don't invest enough

00:21:12.859 --> 00:21:21.220
positive time and energy in making a positive
difference to others in the world. Total them

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:38.289
up. Okay. All right. There's what?
&gt;&gt; MALE: Cursing.

00:21:38.289 --> 00:21:42.820
&gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: Cursing. So, how many people
have eight or more "yes" answers? Eight or

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.740
more "yes" answers. Look around, the good
news is you've got company. The bad news is,

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:52.460
you've got company. Eight or more. How many
people—you're going to hold it up or you're

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:57.659
12? How many people have 12 or more? How many
people who have 12 or more? Okay. How many

00:21:57.659 --> 00:22:05.799
people are happy about the number of "yes"
answers? How many? Five. And by the way, five

00:22:05.799 --> 00:22:11.229
is extraordinarily low. Five is extraordinarily
low, but not of those five is something that

00:22:11.229 --> 00:22:16.690
you are glad is a "yes," right? Right. So,
here's the interesting thing. I don't want

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:21.970
to get into this too deeply because of the
time limitations, but just at the most simple,

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:28.610
simple level. If you have eight "yes" answers,
think of it as 50 percent of the potential

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:36.359
capacity available to you that is currently
available to you. That's enormous. What is

00:22:36.359 --> 00:22:41.489
this all about? Why does this happen? And
I will submit to you that the reason this

00:22:41.489 --> 00:22:47.429
happens is because we don't make capacity
important, because we take capacity for granted.

00:22:47.429 --> 00:22:53.299
We assume that if the demand goes up, our
capacity will expand naturally to meet it.

00:22:53.299 --> 00:22:58.170
But that's not the way it works, and it takes
a toll not only at the level of productivity

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:04.559
but it takes a toll emotionally, it takes
a tool spiritually, and it takes a toll physically.

00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:12.269
So what really happens is that we go numbed
to this reality. We tend to not notice this.

00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:17.499
Once I put this up and you look at these answers
and you say to yourself, "Oh, my god. These

00:23:17.499 --> 00:23:22.820
are central things in life that are dead obvious
that I should be doing and I don't do them."

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:27.669
You have a hundred stories you can tell me
if I let give you the time about why you don't

00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:32.259
do them. But the reality is it's not doing
you any good not to do them and it's getting

00:23:32.259 --> 00:23:38.119
in the way both in your professional and in
your personal life. So once I raise it up

00:23:38.119 --> 00:23:43.790
into consciousness which is step one, now
you can say to yourself, "Okay. So what do

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:50.070
I do about this? What do I do about this because
Tony..." And this is the story part that begins:

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:58.479
"I am working really long hours. I got a long
commute. I got obligations with my family.

00:23:58.479 --> 00:24:05.409
I've got other things I'd like to do. I can't
do all these things, so get real." All right.

00:24:05.409 --> 00:24:10.159
Well, I want to look at this because the real
issue for you once you've got this up and

00:24:10.159 --> 00:24:14.309
you're looking at it dead honest, and when
you walk out of here, I hope you will. In

00:24:14.309 --> 00:24:19.070
fact, anybody who would like me to send you
the energy audit, I'd be happy to send it

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.460
through Evan and he will send it to anybody
who wants it. So give me your card at the

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.289
end and I'll get you the energy audit so you
can keep track of how you're doing as the

00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:38.200
future unfolds before you. But what I want
to look at now is I want to look at the consequence

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.760
of your having whatever level of capacity
you have. And the way I want to look at it

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:50.509
in a very simple form based on the understanding
that we have four different energy states

00:24:50.509 --> 00:24:57.539
that we can find ourselves in in the course
of the day. But only one of those energy states

00:24:57.539 --> 00:25:05.519
serves us best. And those energy states are
fed by each of these dimensions that we've

00:25:05.519 --> 00:25:11.879
already been talking about by how much capacity
you have in each of these four tanks. So I

00:25:11.879 --> 00:25:20.799
want to look at the practical result of your
having those relatively frightening scores

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:27.259
that most of you have. And this too can become
a very simple way. I'd also be happy when

00:25:27.259 --> 00:25:33.570
it's done to send you this slide. This too
is something that you can keep as a barometer

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:38.349
or as a measure of how you're doing in the
course of the day. So let's take a look at

00:25:38.349 --> 00:25:46.090
it. We call this the energy quadrants, okay.
Now, the vertical axis refers to the quantity

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:51.859
of your energy from low to high. Okay? And
then the horizontal axis refers to the quality

00:25:51.859 --> 00:25:57.190
of your energy from negative to positive.
So, therefore, we end up having four quadrants,

00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:04.509
four different kinds of energy. So let me
ask you this, if I ask you, "How do you feel?

00:26:04.509 --> 00:26:08.999
How do you feel when you're performing at
your best?" I'd like you to just throw out

00:26:08.999 --> 00:26:14.719
some adjectives at me. I'd like you to throw
out some adjectives that define how you feel

00:26:14.719 --> 00:26:18.799
when you're performing at your best.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Aligned.

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:20.620
&gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: Aligned. Happy.
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: Satisfied.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:25.701
&gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: Satisfied. Aligned. Happy. Fulfilled.
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: Energized.

00:26:25.701 --> 00:26:27.570
&gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: Energized.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Excited.

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.620
&gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: Excited.
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: Exuberant.

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:33.249
&gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: Exuberant. Okay. Which quadrant
do those go in?

00:26:33.249 --> 00:26:35.710
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: High positive.
&gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: High positive. The upper-right

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:40.590
quadrant. There's absolutely no question that
those are the adjectives that you feel. Those

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:46.590
are the feeling you have when you're performing
at your best. This is a no-brainer. This is

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:51.409
a no-brainer. And no matter how many people
we've asked this question to when we begun

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:58.729
our work 25 years ago with professional athletes,
and we were told that, at that time, the prevailing

00:26:58.729 --> 00:27:03.519
view in sport psychology was that what, a,
athletes felt when they were performing at

00:27:03.519 --> 00:27:08.260
their best included a mild amount of anxiety.
So, we started asking people, you know. Is

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:13.249
that what you're feeling? You feel of mild
anxiety, the answer was a 100 percent, no.

00:27:13.249 --> 00:27:18.490
They answered just the way you answered. What
we feel are positive emotions when we're performing

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:23.759
at our best. Maybe before you perform, you
are feeling a little bit anxious in a performance

00:27:23.759 --> 00:27:28.590
demand. But, if you're feeling anxious when
you're actually performing, be guaranteed,

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:33.610
you're not going to perform at your best.
So, there it is, that's--how many of you have

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:37.339
learned something that you didn't know by
seeing that those are the emotions associated

00:27:37.339 --> 00:27:42.710
with high performance, nobody, right? Nobody,
that's no big surprise. Here's the surprise,

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:48.299
if you're not feeling this way, you can't
perform at your best. Why is that a surprise?

00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:55.830
Well, because I have to ask you this question.
Is this the way you are feeling at work, energized,

00:27:55.830 --> 00:28:03.820
focus, passionate, confident, exuberant, the
vast majority at the time? Are there times

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:09.700
when you're not feeling this way at work?
Is there anybody who sometimes doesn't feel

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:17.799
those emotions at work? So then, the question
becomes, so when you're not feeling this way,

00:28:17.799 --> 00:28:24.279
how are you feeling and what's the consequence,
right? Because we need to know in the cost-benefit

00:28:24.279 --> 00:28:30.629
ratio if you aren't fueling yourself with
the right emotions, what's the cost, what's

00:28:30.629 --> 00:28:36.269
the consequence, so I'm going to start here
on the upper left because it's the only other

00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:43.880
zone--energy zone that has energy in it. An
absent energy or significant energy, absent

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.710
energy, I don't care whether it's negative
or positive, you're not going to be very effective

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:54.450
in work. So, when you look at this, we call
this the survival zone. Now it's interesting,

00:28:54.450 --> 00:29:00.100
the only reason in any of these zones exist
is because there is some circumstance or circumstances

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.619
in your life when it's appropriate to be in
this zone, otherwise, from an evolutionary

00:29:03.619 --> 00:29:08.379
perspective, it would be naturally selected
out, wouldn't it? It only exists because there's

00:29:08.379 --> 00:29:13.230
a value in it. In other words, there's a time
in your life when it makes sense to be in

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:18.759
this zone, it serves you best to be in this
zone, when is it?

00:29:18.759 --> 00:29:22.910
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: When you're threatened.
&gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: When you're threatened. Here's

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:29.669
the problem. If there is a large mountain
lion coming at you, being in the survival

00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:35.960
zone is a good thing. The reason is because
you will have a physiological shift from your

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:40.669
parasympathetic nervous system to your sympathetic
nervous system from your prefrontal cortex

00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:45.469
testing your limbic system. And what it will--the
consequence of it is that you will be able

00:29:45.469 --> 00:29:50.750
to move more quickly. Your limbic system picks
up threat more quickly than your prefrontal

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:54.950
cortex does, so it's really good when your
life is in danger. If there's a fire at the

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:59.259
back in the room right now, I don't want you
to be asking yourself, "Let me see, how much

00:29:59.259 --> 00:30:05.629
longer can I listen to this talk before that."
What you want to do is you want the body to

00:30:05.629 --> 00:30:10.690
say to you, "Get the hell out and get out,"
or take water and put it on the fire, fight

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:19.129
or flight, right? The problem of what you
said is that survival is not necessarily always

00:30:19.129 --> 00:30:24.490
a true threat to your life. So in other words,
you can feel a sense of threat and you can

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:30.600
feel a sense of danger in your life, but it
might not actually be a threat, but the same

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:36.320
physiological set of responses happens if
you feel threat. What happens? Well, your

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:43.099
vision narrows; your heart rate increases;
your muscles contract; and most important

00:30:43.099 --> 00:30:48.820
in some sense, the blood rushes from your
brain into your extremities. Therefore, the

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:56.570
blood is no longer in your brain. That's not
a good thing, if you have to think. Is there

00:30:56.570 --> 00:31:03.010
anybody here who spends any time during the
day thinking? That's not a good thing. In

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:09.159
fact, it's not a metaphor I'm talking about,
it's literal. The prefrontal cortex in true

00:31:09.159 --> 00:31:14.639
fight or flight when adrenaline and noradrenaline
and cortisol flood through your body shuts

00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:20.250
down because you don't want it to be thinking.
It will interfere with your action. The problem

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:26.259
is that when that happens, all sorts of other
things happen too. So if what's happened is

00:31:26.259 --> 00:31:31.450
your boss has yelled at you or your--maybe
you've got a problem in your work that you

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:35.980
can't solve and your worried about meeting
a deadline or you feel too much demand in

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:43.219
your life or you're negative because you're
exhausted, any of those, the problem is that

00:31:43.219 --> 00:31:48.099
it means that you're in not a position to
do a number of things. When you're in the

00:31:48.099 --> 00:31:52.929
upper left quadrant, here or some of the things,
if we had time, I'd get you to tell me, but

00:31:52.929 --> 00:31:57.980
you would know this, I promise you; but the
first thing is you perform worse in upper

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:04.450
left. That's the first problem, because you
don't think well, because you can't be imaginative,

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:08.909
because you aren't reflective, so you don't
perform as well. The second thing that happens

00:32:08.909 --> 00:32:15.929
is it's terrible for your health. Cortisol,
the hormone cortisol is very important for

00:32:15.929 --> 00:32:20.919
you in certain situations. When it circulates
for very long in your body, it becomes a toxin,

00:32:20.919 --> 00:32:26.249
a poison and it leads to virtually every,
it has an impact on virtually every major

00:32:26.249 --> 00:32:31.580
illness and disease we know. So to spend time
in that zone is very costly to your health,

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:38.219
it's very costly to your performance. And
because energy is contagious, it's very influential

00:32:38.219 --> 00:32:42.729
to other people. For those of you in this
room who have responsibility for other people

00:32:42.729 --> 00:32:49.369
who are leaders, your energy is disproportionately
contagious by virtue of your position. And

00:32:49.369 --> 00:32:54.459
so you have a significant influence on other
people. If you have any doubt that energy

00:32:54.459 --> 00:32:59.539
is contagious, when we're finished with this
talk, let's go down together and walk in to

00:32:59.539 --> 00:33:07.320
the local Department of Motor Vehicles and
see if your energy changes. Energy is very

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:17.409
powerful on your emotions. And so, if you
think if you think of the impact of your energy,

00:33:17.409 --> 00:33:22.179
it's not just that negative energy is affecting
you, it's that it's affecting other people.

00:33:22.179 --> 00:33:25.259
And you've had that experience. You've had
the opposite experience of what I'm talking

00:33:25.259 --> 00:33:28.749
about at the Department of Motor Vehicles.
You're going to a store or you show up on

00:33:28.749 --> 00:33:33.499
a line in an airport and somebody is in a
great mood and has got a smile on their face

00:33:33.499 --> 00:33:39.159
and is relaxed and is exuberant and saying,
"Hi, how you're doing today? You look beautiful.

00:33:39.159 --> 00:33:46.580
I bet you're going to have a great trip."
Does have an affect on you? Huge, it's unbelievable

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.639
of what the impact of that is. That's what
a great salesman is. A great salesman is a

00:33:50.639 --> 00:33:56.919
person who is great at generating the energy
that makes people want to buy. It's about

00:33:56.919 --> 00:34:02.759
energy. Okay, so we've got all these costs
with the survival zone, and the most significant

00:34:02.759 --> 00:34:08.549
energy cost is what of being in a survival
zone. What's the cost of being in a survival

00:34:08.549 --> 00:34:14.359
zone from an energy perspective? It drains
it faster. It's like a gas guzzling car. And

00:34:14.359 --> 00:34:19.579
if you spend too much time in the high negative
zone, you end up in this zone. How many of

00:34:19.579 --> 00:34:25.649
you come to work feeling that way pretty often?
No, you don't, because it's not acceptable.

00:34:25.649 --> 00:34:32.840
Rachel, put your hand down. It's not acceptable
to be in that zone, is it? So if you were

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:39.000
in that zone and you weren't Rachel, you wouldn't
admit it, right, because it's not culturally

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.730
acceptable. To be in the upper left zone is
culturally acceptable to some extent. It's

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:48.440
okay to be anxious. It's okay to be frustrated.
Though it shouldn't be, it is. But this zone

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:53.609
is unacceptable. The reason is because this
zone is the worst place from which to perform,

00:34:53.609 --> 00:34:59.849
okay? All right, so, we've got these three
zones. We know the best zone. We know the

00:34:59.849 --> 00:35:03.509
two negative zones. The other zone, what do
you think we'd call the other zone?

00:35:03.509 --> 00:35:09.890
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: Maintenance.
&gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: Maintenance is one word. Resting

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:13.089
is one word, any other words? Because we got
to come up with a name for it, otherwise,

00:35:13.089 --> 00:35:19.839
it won't be parallel. We need four names here.
I need some help. Okay, it's the recovery

00:35:19.839 --> 00:35:26.300
zone, right? Now, if I were to ask you, "Where
is it that you spend most of your time at

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:32.220
work? Where is it then you spend most of your
at work when you're not in a performance zone?"

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.810
How many people would say, "Oh, I spend my
time in the recovery zone. I'm just chilled

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:43.789
out, relaxed, kicked back?" How many people
would say it's the survival zone? How many

00:35:43.789 --> 00:35:49.510
people would say it's the--a burn out zone?
Okay, we've got 8 answers and a hundred people

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:56.500
in the room. How many people refuse to answer?
The answer in most of your case is by, simply

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:00.450
by elimination, it's going to be that upper
left zone. It's going to be somewhere in that

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:04.440
upper left zone when you're not in upper right.
I'm not suggesting for a moment that you're

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:09.190
not spending significant amounts of time in
upper right, I hope you are, but I also know

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:13.220
that the likelihood is in the face of all
the things you face that you have to deal

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.290
that you're not spending all of your time
there and there are probably a significant

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:23.004
amount of times you're not. Now, that means...
&gt;&gt; Well, are we in the right most...?

00:36:23.004 --> 00:36:26.890
&gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: Where are you right now? Well,
everybody here is way up in the high positive

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:35.180
because you're listening to this. I don't
know where you are right now but I'm hoping

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:40.059
against all hope that you are here with me
in upper right. I know I'm there and I'm the

00:36:40.059 --> 00:36:46.059
person who's the--I'm the person who's generating
the most energy. So, it would be hard for

00:36:46.059 --> 00:36:51.119
you to be depressed with me running around
like a chicken with my head cutoff trying

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:56.500
to entertain you. So the recovery zone is
not a place where you spend much time, is

00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:03.680
it? Because the recovery zone from your perspective
is the sign that you are a slacker, that's

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:09.589
where people go to slack. When are you supposed
to be in the recovery zone? Vacation, no,

00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:17.310
never, never. That's the modern world, never.
Who goes on vacation? How many people here

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:22.339
went on a vacation in the last year and didn't
answer email during the vacation? Well that's

00:37:22.339 --> 00:37:26.750
pretty good so--but that's only 6 percent
of the room and that's probably about accurate,

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:33.380
right? Okay. So the recovery zone gets no
respect. The recovery zone gets no respect

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:38.539
and the biggest--the biggest insight in some
ways that I'm going to be able to share with

00:37:38.539 --> 00:37:47.220
you today is an insight that has to do with
shifting the locus or the movement that characterizes

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:53.869
your day in terms of energy states. So right
now what we know is--right now what we know

00:37:53.869 --> 00:37:59.539
is that in the course of the day, depending
on what happens, you end up being pulled reactively

00:37:59.539 --> 00:38:05.510
into this zone by certain events. I'm I--were
we on that page together? Okay. So all day

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:10.200
long depending on how well or badly the day
goes, you have some movement between these

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:15.240
two zones that it gets overwhelming, you end
up down in this zone. This zone is off limits.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.779
It's never even existed here at Google even
though there's plenty of reason for it to,

00:38:19.779 --> 00:38:23.250
you know, there are plenty of opportunities
for you to live there. Very people are spending

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:28.140
a whole lot of time there. You laughed when
I said it. Now, what I'm going to suggest

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:35.000
to you is a paradigm shift, a profound paradigm
shift in how you think about performance because

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.710
what we learned is that the best movement
for you to be making in the course of the

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:45.640
day is intermittently and intentionally between
upper right and lower right, because we are

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:52.260
not designed as machines, we are rhythmic
beings and we are designed--we need to intermittently

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:57.869
recover energy if want to sustain energy at
the highest level. And that brings me to the

00:38:57.869 --> 00:39:02.900
second principle that in order for us to sustain
performance, we need to learn to balance the

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:07.790
expenditure of energy with the intermittent
renewal of energy. That's a pretty radical

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:14.829
notion. Nobody is thinking that it really
is performance, valuable for your performance

00:39:14.829 --> 00:39:21.270
to build true renewal intermittently throughout
the day. We learned it. I'll take your question

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:26.390
when we're done. We learned it from athletes.
We learned it from athletes because we consistently

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:32.560
found that the greatest athletes understood
something called work-rest ratios. They valued

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:38.539
the recovery of energy as much as they valued
the expenditure of energy. They--that's what

00:39:38.539 --> 00:39:44.670
interval training is all about. That's what
periodization is all about. It's the recognition

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:51.779
that you need to, in order to be a great performer,
train your capacity for recovery as systematically

00:39:51.779 --> 00:39:58.829
as you train any skill that you have in your
life. Recovery is performance specific. It

00:39:58.829 --> 00:40:05.750
affects your ability to perform at a high-level
and to perform at a level of high-quality.

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:13.619
Now, the current style in which most of us
operate is this style. We go between flat

00:40:13.619 --> 00:40:19.559
out and flat out. We've got two gears and
we don't spend anytime in either one. We get

00:40:19.559 --> 00:40:25.250
to this gear when we've gone flat out for
so long that we simply collapse. What I'm

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:32.180
suggesting to you is that we want to build
a very different movement into our lives not

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:38.140
only for the purposes of performing well but
for the purposes of having a life. Now, here's

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:45.079
the counter-intuitive notion. Imagine the
Indianapolis 500 for a moment and the drivers

00:40:45.079 --> 00:40:50.089
who were driving and then I ask you this question,
is the driver who wins that raise, the driver

00:40:50.089 --> 00:40:59.000
who drives the fastest for the longest the
most continuously? And the answer, since I

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.220
have gotten it immediately in time in short
is no, no. The driver who wins is the driver

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:11.720
who drives the fastest for the longest when
he's driving and recovers the most efficiently

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:16.240
when he's not. What is recovery? It's a pit
stop. What do you in the pit stop? In the

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:22.509
pit stop, you refuel the tank; you do maintenance
on the car. If you're effective at that, that's

00:41:22.509 --> 00:41:28.940
a key ingredient and being able to be successful
in the raise. The average amount of time changing

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:34.510
four tires in the pit and changing sometimes
the windshield wipers, filling the gas, how

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:43.410
much time is that spent in the pit on average
for a driver? Fifteen seconds is about right.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:48.849
Because these people have trained recovery,
the pit crews are in fabulous physical shape.

00:41:48.849 --> 00:41:55.619
They are geniuses at ensuring effective recovery;
the higher the demand in your life, the more

00:41:55.619 --> 00:42:00.509
the need for renewal. If you are driving in
a high-performance car, you've got to drive,

00:42:00.509 --> 00:42:05.720
refuel and maintain that car more frequently.
If you are a high-performance human being,

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:12.769
you need to refuel and maintain more quickly,
I mean, more regularly. But here's the deal,

00:42:12.769 --> 00:42:16.609
it's not the quantity of your recovery that
matters, it's the quality of your recovery

00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:21.750
that matters. It's how well you recover not
how long you recover, just as it's not how

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:26.700
many hours you work, it's what you get done
in the hours that you work. That's why we

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:31.890
want to train recovery. This is the way we're
currently recovering, "I try to keep my coffee

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:38.579
buzz going till the Martini buzz kicks in."
We use artificial stimulants to push us up.

00:42:38.579 --> 00:42:44.880
We use artificial stimulants to pull us down.
If you could take control of this, it would

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:49.900
give you a quality of energy and a quantity
of energy that was very different. What we

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:55.839
want is the performance pulse. And that's
grounded in this notion that we are oscillatory

00:42:55.839 --> 00:43:07.150
beings in an oscillatory universe. Why do
I say that? Because I like the way it sounds.

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:12.220
That's what it is. It means we have rhythms.
What are the rhythms of our body? Which organs

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:20.000
are rhythmic in our body? Which bodily systems
are rhythmic? The heart. Heart rate goes up

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.960
and down. A great measure of your heart health
is what's called heart rate variability. The

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:31.900
ability to move flexibly up and down in heart
rate depending on the demand, what else? Breath.

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:38.180
Your lungs and your heart, your muscles are
meant to contract and then after the stress

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:42.609
is over to relax if they don't, you get back
pain, and neck pain, and knee pain and all

00:43:42.609 --> 00:43:47.410
those things that you come up with structural
explanations for that have nothing to do with

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:52.369
anything except the fact that you are not
creating the right rhythm in your life. You

00:43:52.369 --> 00:43:58.869
said the right answer. Every system in the
body pulses starting with the cells, every

00:43:58.869 --> 00:44:04.349
system until somebody shows it's not through
pulses, but we try to live linear lives. We

00:44:04.349 --> 00:44:09.779
tried to live a life that goes in direct opposition
the way the body is meant to function. What

00:44:09.779 --> 00:44:15.330
we want to do is create an alignment with
our own rhythms, not with the rhythms of the

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:20.480
computers you are using. They're designed
to spend energy in a linear continuous way

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:33.920
but you are not. So, not only--it's not only
true that--it's not only true that you have

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:41.069
a need to recover but you have a need to recover
in a very particular way. The circadian rhythm

00:44:41.069 --> 00:44:45.609
is this 24-hour rhythm and by the way it's
another rhythm of day or night that exists

00:44:45.609 --> 00:44:49.390
in the universe. At night you're meant to
be asleep. In the day you're meant to be awake.

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:53.950
You're meant to move between the expenditure
of energy and then the recovery of energy.

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:59.310
We all know about that even though we violated
at great cost to ourselves. Because I can't

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:05.700
go into the fierce costs of not getting enough
sleep in this talk, I invite you again to

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:10.720
go on our website where we put on the homepage,
the 60 minutes piece about sleep that ran

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:15.630
two or three weeks ago. It that doesn't shock
you into sleeping more, making sleep more

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:21.119
important, nothing I say will be able to do
it. Having said that, it's also important

00:45:21.119 --> 00:45:26.290
during the day. At night we've got a thing
called the basic rest activity cycle which

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:34.140
means you sleep, you go from a light stage
of sleep, rapid eye movement, down slowly

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:40.460
into a deep delta sleep over a period of 90
to a 120 minutes all through the night. If

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:44.910
you go through that cycle completely, you're
getting a good period of sleep. If you get

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:48.970
woken up in the middle of it, it interrupts
the quality of your sleep. Now, what's so

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:54.331
fascinating is that exist during the day too
at a higher stake of physiological arousal?

00:45:54.331 --> 00:45:59.811
In other words, every 90 to 120 minutes we
move from a high state of physiological arousal

00:45:59.811 --> 00:46:05.700
slowly down as you're moving right now into
a physiological drop. At the end of 90 minutes,

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:10.710
120 minutes if it's a really high, if you're
in a low demand situation, but in that 90

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:17.200
to 120 minute window, your body is screaming
at you, give me a break. But you override

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:22.710
it. You override it with coffee; you override
it with diet coke; you override it with most

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:28.921
of all cortisol, adrenalin, and noradrenalin
with your body's own speed. You override it

00:46:28.921 --> 00:46:35.079
by going into the upper left quadrant. You
override it by forcing stimulants through

00:46:35.079 --> 00:46:41.220
your body that are not serving you well. So
what we really want to do to perform at our

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:47.930
best is to build a rhythmic relationship throughout
the day where when you're working, I'm sorry,

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:52.809
when you're engaged, you're truly engaged;
and when you're disengaged, you're truly disengaged

00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:58.670
and you're not living in the gray zone in
between. Because when it comes to recovery,

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:05.201
the more you train recovery, the better you
get at it, so it's not a notion of 90 minutes

00:47:05.201 --> 00:47:11.839
on and 90 minutes off, right? Fitness is defined
as the speed of recovery. The fitter you are,

00:47:11.839 --> 00:47:17.069
the faster you recover. The more you train
yourself to recover, the better you get at

00:47:17.069 --> 00:47:22.259
it, the quicker you will recover. We're talking
about sustainable high performance. We're

00:47:22.259 --> 00:47:29.549
talking about the ability to meet very high
demand. These are the scientific well-researched

00:47:29.549 --> 00:47:35.200
pieces of core evidence that suggest what
it takes to show up everyday here with all

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.309
that you've got. I'm going to skip that slide.
And I'm going to say to you that we want to

00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:45.000
move between currently what's happening in
our lives. If you wanted to take away a visual

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.920
image to remember, moving all day, as I said
just a few moments ago, between this upper

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:55.150
right and upper left zone, reactively in the
face of demand. One of the reasons we move

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:58.980
there is we ran out of energy. When you get
more tired, you get more irritable, you get

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:03.530
more frustrated, you get more anxious. What
you really want to do in your life is you

00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:10.350
want to move to this intentional way of managing
your energy so that every 90 to a 120 minutes,

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:16.170
what you're doing is you're renewing energy.
This is the paradigm shift. Right now, you

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:21.839
live life, most of you, as if you're in a
marathon. Meaning, there is a long race out

00:48:21.839 --> 00:48:28.049
ahead, there is no end in sight and so either
consciously or unconsciously you pace yourself.

00:48:28.049 --> 00:48:35.460
You pace yourself by not fully engaging at
any given time in almost anything because

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:41.569
if you try to push yourself as hard as you're
capable of pushing yourself for an expanded

00:48:41.569 --> 00:48:47.849
period of time, you drop like a stone. So
instead of doing that, you find ways to cheat

00:48:47.849 --> 00:48:52.509
on the engagement and expenditure of energy,
sometimes aware that you're doing it, sometimes

00:48:52.509 --> 00:48:58.869
not. I'm suggesting to you a really radical
idea. Reinvent yourself as a sprinter. What

00:48:58.869 --> 00:49:03.589
is a sprinter? A sprinter comes up to the
line, gets down in the crouch, looks down

00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:10.279
to the end of the race, a 100 yards, 200 yards,
400 yards and says, can I fully expand, can

00:49:10.279 --> 00:49:15.800
I bring a hundred percent engagement to this
race. And what is the sprinter answer? You

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:22.160
bet your life, why? Because there's an end
line, because there's a finish line, because

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:28.680
they know that they could do it for a finite
period of time, stop and recover. The same

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:33.740
is true for you if you make it so. You've
lost the finish lines in your life. You've

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:39.809
lost the boundaries. You've lost the stopping
points. You live in a state of perpetual and

00:49:39.809 --> 00:49:46.009
I'm accusing you, I apologize for that, many
of you do. Many of you do and we're all inclined

00:49:46.009 --> 00:49:50.700
in this way because everything is pushing
us in this way. So, we live in this state

00:49:50.700 --> 00:50:01.240
in which we are never setting stopping points.
And instead the very things that allow us

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:07.150
to be connected all the time make it virtually
impossible to be disconnected ever; and you

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:14.829
know what I'm talking about. Here is the deal,
how many people in the room would say that

00:50:14.829 --> 00:50:22.700
based on what I've said so far, what I'm saying
as a way of thinking about how you operate,

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:30.769
about how you perform makes fundamental sense
to you? It makes sense. Okay, how many of

00:50:30.769 --> 00:50:35.140
you based on what I've told you would say
that you're going to walk out of this room

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:39.430
and starting today, based on what I've told
you, you aren't going to fundamentally make

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:45.650
some changes in your life that are in accordance
with everything I've said and please be honest?

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:52.600
So, we're at two or three, okay? So why not?
It's not my fault. Let me tell you that first.

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:56.150
It's not my fault. The reason that you're
not going to is because we're creatures of

00:50:56.150 --> 00:51:01.109
habit. Because what you did yesterday is what
you're going to do today and do again tomorrow.

00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:06.260
We are remarkably automatic creatures. We
need to take this into account when we're

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:11.019
making change in our life. We need to recognize
that our prefrontal cortex, our conscious

00:51:11.019 --> 00:51:16.589
thinking is not the best way to make change.
What we need to do instead is we need to co-op

00:51:16.589 --> 00:51:22.809
the autonomic nervous system. We need to co-op
the part of our physiology that gets things

00:51:22.809 --> 00:51:31.020
done automatically by training our self through
regular repetition to do the things so that

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:36.079
it shows up without our having to think about
it. That's the final energy management principle.

00:51:36.079 --> 00:51:40.390
To manage your energy more optimally, you
have to build what we call positive rituals.

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:46.650
These are highly specific behaviors that become
automatic over time. So what I'm suggesting

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:53.049
to you is that you think about, when you leave
here today, you think about one of those answers

00:51:53.049 --> 00:52:00.319
on that energy audit that upsets you, that
makes you recognize it's incurring or creating

00:52:00.319 --> 00:52:07.470
a really high cost in your life. And think
about what could I do to ritualize a change

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:12.750
of behavior that would make it possible for
me to get a "no" answer to that question I

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:17.170
have a "yes" answer too. So, if were something
like working out for example, I want to give

00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:21.370
you a very simple example, and you said to
me, "Tony, I'm so inspired by what you said,

00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:25.089
I realized that working out would not only
be good for my physical energy but it would

00:52:25.089 --> 00:52:29.970
be a great thing for my emotional and my energy
and for my focus. I'm all with you. I'm going

00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:33.460
to start doing it tomorrow and I'm going to
do it three days a week from now on." What

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:39.890
are the odds you're going to succeed? Very
low, why, it's not specific enough, it's not

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:43.869
precise enough. When are you going to do it?
You're not going to do it if you don't set

00:52:43.869 --> 00:52:47.630
a time because you've already got tons of
things to do and you're going to default right

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:52.490
back into them under any kind of pressure.
The only way you're going to do it is if you

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:58.240
take something out of your life that is currently
in that slot by designating that time as surely

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:02.430
as you designate important meeting here at
Google. So, if you now say to me, "Tony, I'm

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:08.869
going to work out Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
7:00 a.m. I'm going to wake up at 6:45. I've

00:53:08.869 --> 00:53:13.380
got a gym down the street for me. I'm going
to set out my clothes the night before in

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:17.819
order to do that. I'm going to do cardiovascular
for 30 minutes on Mondays and Wednesday. I'm

00:53:17.819 --> 00:53:22.740
going to do strength training for 30 minutes
on Friday." Now, you're talking turkey. And

00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:27.349
here's what happens, you know, it's a ritual
when you've done it for long enough that when

00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:32.720
you don't do it, it feels worse than it does
to use the energy to do it. And any of you

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:37.970
who is--who are working out now, regularly,
know what I'm talking about. That--it isn't

00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:41.999
necessarily easy to work out and there are
many times when you might not feel like working

00:53:41.999 --> 00:53:46.349
out, but if you don't do it, you feel worse.
That is what the ritual is about. I wish we

00:53:46.349 --> 00:53:51.440
had the time to be able to, actually, build
in this room some rituals but we will have

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:56.250
this workshop that will intermittently be
offered at Google and you'll have the opportunity

00:53:56.250 --> 00:54:03.619
to really come in and do this work if it interests
you. For the moment, what I want to suggest

00:54:03.619 --> 00:54:09.410
is that you take a shot at building a ritual,
because you can have your first experience

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:16.019
without me and without much more description.
Take in the next hour, because if you wait

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:20.369
more than an hour, your motivation is going
to go down. So if you take it in the next

00:54:20.369 --> 00:54:27.869
hour, and look for a way to define a ritual
that's highly specific in time, highly specific

00:54:27.869 --> 00:54:34.779
in the behavior itself, and that is doable;
that is biting all something you could chew.

00:54:34.779 --> 00:54:39.489
If you're not working out at all, for example,
don't build in five workouts a week of 30

00:54:39.489 --> 00:54:44.930
minutes of running. Walk, Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday for 15 minutes in the middle of

00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:51.489
the day. That's also a recovery break. Here's
the deal, it's about taking control of your

00:54:51.489 --> 00:54:55.910
life. You think that your life is, you're
at the mercy of a lot of other forces but

00:54:55.910 --> 00:55:00.410
you have the capacity to seize it back. And
that's what I want to leave you with the message

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:11.819
to do, to begin to seize it back because it
belongs to you. Thank you very much.

00:55:11.819 --> 00:55:20.950
I would be happy to take a few questions.
&gt;&gt; WITTENBERG: We have time for a few questions,

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:33.980
if anybody has something, come on up to the
mic. You're all too busy in time for your

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:34.980
rituals?
&gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:35.980
&gt;&gt; WITTENBERG: Would you mind walking up to
the light?

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:36.980
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: Could you give us some examples
of rituals?

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:37.980
&gt;&gt; WITTENBERG: An example of a ritual.
&gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: An example of a ritual, well,

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.630
I gave you an example to physical ritual.
An example of an emotional ritual that we

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:45.319
found is very powerful is what do you want
to do emotionally? What you do want to do

00:55:45.319 --> 00:55:50.660
emotionally is you want to drive as much positive
energy into your reservoir as you can because

00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:55.039
we default to negative emotions. It's the
way we're constructed biologically. So, the

00:55:55.039 --> 00:55:59.869
more, the more positive energy you have in
the system the better off you are. So what

00:55:59.869 --> 00:56:06.489
behaviors could influence your ability to
have more positive emotion at you're disposal

00:56:06.489 --> 00:56:11.349
particularly under the pressure? Well, an
example--a couple of examples we have are,

00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:17.829
writing a note of appreciation to someone
in your life who you think deserves a recognition

00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:22.809
they're not getting enough of turns out to
be something that as a remarkably, powerful

00:56:22.809 --> 00:56:28.220
effect on the other person but also on you.
And so, one ritual might be, to take once

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:32.940
or twice a week where you write a note to
someone. A second emotional ritual might be

00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:38.369
to, to take it at the very end of the day
before you go to sleep or as you're about

00:56:38.369 --> 00:56:43.260
to leave, to take a little inventory, maybe
in a journal or a notebook of what's right

00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:47.069
in my life. What are three things that are
write in my life right now? Because it's a

00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:53.930
technology of injecting the right fuel into
your life. A mental ritual might be something

00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:58.480
like, doing the most important thing first
in the morning. Making the first 90 minutes

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:04.650
of you day everyday or the first 60 minutes
an activity that is, from your perspective,

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:09.529
the one that would provide or create the greatest
value over the course of the rest of the day,

00:57:09.529 --> 00:57:13.580
and making that the most important thing you
do, instead of, answering your email first

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:18.500
and being in reactive mode, being at the mercy
of somebody else's agenda, making that the

00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:25.249
most important thing. Making it specific in
time, planning it the night before is what

00:57:25.249 --> 00:57:28.920
makes it possible to move from an intention
into a habit.

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:34.230
&gt;&gt; MALE: Sir, I just wanted to see if you'd
share the example from your book about your

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:37.640
work with the tennis players, about trying
to find the difference between the top few

00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:39.700
tennis players in the world...
&gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: Yeah, I'll tell you this very,

00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:46.359
very quickly. It's the slide I skipped. God
bless you. You can't get away with anything

00:57:46.359 --> 00:57:51.660
at Google. What we discovered, when we really
discovered the power of renewal was when we

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:55.170
were watching tennis players, trying to understand
what made the difference between the great

00:57:55.170 --> 00:58:00.140
players and the next set of players because
we were working with many of the top 200.

00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:04.099
And it was very hard to see from when they
were playing what the difference was. One

00:58:04.099 --> 00:58:10.269
day, we were watching--my former partner and
I--actually, my former partner was watching

00:58:10.269 --> 00:58:14.700
the top--he was watching two top players on
the same court and what he'd noticed was,

00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:19.509
a man named Jim Layer, what he noticed was
that between points, these two players were

00:58:19.509 --> 00:58:24.769
doing the exact same set of four sequenced
activities. Neither of them was aware that

00:58:24.769 --> 00:58:28.859
they were doing it themselves much less that
the other one was doing it. What they were

00:58:28.859 --> 00:58:32.910
accomplishing and what you were asking about
was renewal. What they were doing was they

00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:39.720
were systematically using the 20 to 30 seconds
between points to refuel their bodies. They

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:44.589
were doing it by first, turning away from
the net so that they left the point behind

00:58:44.589 --> 00:58:48.359
them, switching the racket from the dominant
to the non-dominant hands so they allowed

00:58:48.359 --> 00:58:53.029
the arm to relax, starting to play with the
strings of the rackets so that they could

00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:58.349
keep their attention narrowly focused on the
task at hand, and walking in a way that we

00:58:58.349 --> 00:59:04.460
came to call the "peacock walk" which is to
walk like this. Because how you hold yourself

00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:10.839
influences how you feel. So if you feel better,
obviously, you are in a position to perform

00:59:10.839 --> 00:59:17.420
better. So, those four sequenced set of activities
led to heart rate drop when we started measuring

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:23.940
it of somewhere around one heartbeat per second.
So, the great players were getting 20 to 30

00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:29.520
heartbeats of recovery between every point
and the players who weren't doing this sequenced

00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:32.679
set of recovery activities were getting virtually
none.

00:59:32.679 --> 00:59:39.579
&gt;&gt; MALE: So, your points are very well-taken.
But somewhere along the line you made an assumption

00:59:39.579 --> 00:59:44.269
that I don't quite agree with. You're assuming
that we're oscillating between the high energy,

00:59:44.269 --> 00:59:49.329
between positive and negative feelings whereas
I think we're actually--I find myself oscillating

00:59:49.329 --> 00:59:53.050
between the high and low energy. So I'm going
to go to lunch afterwards, and after lunch,

00:59:53.050 --> 00:59:57.510
I'm going to have this post-lunch low and
I'm not going to feel negative feelings towards

00:59:57.510 --> 01:00:00.040
people. I'm just going to feel, sort of, tired
and wanting to sleep.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:05.730
&gt;&gt; SCHWARTZ: Yeah, and--you know, I can tell
you that if you learn to manage your energy

01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:14.369
more skillfully and build recovery periods
starting an hour and a half after you first

01:00:14.369 --> 01:00:22.019
get to work, and work intensely, and then,
consciously and intentionally recover effectively,

01:00:22.019 --> 01:00:26.790
the recovery will mean that you won't come
out of lunch with the afternoon law. How do

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:30.990
I know that? I know that 'cause it doesn't
happen to me. I know that because I used to

01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:36.200
be dead tired in the afternoon. Now, you can't
overcome the core physiology so you are going

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:40.849
to be more tired at 2:30 or 3:00 trying to
do a task than you would at 10:00, which is

01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:45.759
why you ought to be doing the high demand
kinds of activities, the really complex activities

01:00:45.759 --> 01:00:53.230
earlier in the day or pass that circadian
trough. But, I will promise you that you will

01:00:53.230 --> 01:01:00.130
get a much more even availability of energy
if you more regularly and intermittently build

01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:03.640
in periods of recovery.
&gt;&gt; WITTENBERG: So, that's all the time we

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:07.539
have. Tony will be up here for questions after
and we're also going to go to lunch. So anybody

01:01:07.539 --> 01:01:12.079
who'd like to join Tony for lunch, please
come up here afterwards. And let's thank Tony

01:01:12.079 --> 01:01:12.930
so much for his time here.
