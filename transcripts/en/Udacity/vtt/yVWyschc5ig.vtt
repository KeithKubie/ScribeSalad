00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.054
The landscape of software development
has drastically changed over the last

00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:06.660
10, 20 years, and
will continue to do so.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.290
I think the scariest phrase in
the English language is we've

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.320
always done it that way.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.560
With advances in hardware and

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.950
software, the pace of innovation
has only accelerated.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.520
Old methodologies
simply can't keep pace.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.100
Instead of shipping one major version
every couple of years, software

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.140
companies are continuously updating
services that are offered online.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.670
When was the last time you got
software delivered via CD?

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.400
People just expect new features and

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.640
fixes to happen quickly without
disruption to their daily lives.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.390
Common roadblocks like getting
access to infrastructure have

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.340
pretty much been eliminated.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.660
Virtualization has changed the game for
operational teams.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.500
Now you can create
servers in minutes and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.410
harness the full power of
those physical resources.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.990
Development teams have more opportunity
to create templates, clone, snapshot,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.490
roll back, and
destroy whole environments.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.980
There's also online services like AWS or
Digital Ocean,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.820
where you can go and test your code.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.060
Today, people don't have a lot of
sympathy in our on demand society.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.950
If your site doesn't work or your app is
buggy, people have multiple ways to let

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.680
you know, which leads to
tarnishing your brand's image.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.790
This puts extreme pressure on
developers and operations but

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.570
also product managers and
business people.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.820
How do you manage everything
at this new pace?

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.700
How do you change old habits and
organizational structures and

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.720
processes to adapt?

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.010
A development process with a long detail
design phase, and a planning phase, and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.540
then another long implementation phase
is slow, inefficient and error-prone.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.070
To top it off, organizational silos that
prevent communication leads to stale

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.280
information, misconceptions, and
further slows down the process.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.920
What arose from the ashes
of past mistakes?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.550
Agile development was born.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.600
Constant feedback with an iterative
approach allows to find problems quickly

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.180
for both developers,
and operations teams.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.490
But Agile covers just the first
part of the application life cycle,

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.810
which is development.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.020
Another part of the puzzle comes from
using Agile and Lean approaches,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.030
incorporating operations.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.400
With people still working in
their Silos, bottlenecks remain.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.530
Breaking down the silos,

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.080
allow collaboration through
all stages of the development.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.930
And this brings us to
the definition of Devops.
