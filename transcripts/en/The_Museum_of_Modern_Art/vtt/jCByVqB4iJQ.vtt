00:00:02.158 --> 00:00:07.119
Anne: I'm in MOMA's storage with
Henri Matisse's blue window.

00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:10.878
Matisse had first made a name for himself

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:15.591
as a painter of these
brilliantly colored canvases

00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:19.591
with very discrete
structuring brush strokes.

00:00:21.338 --> 00:00:26.430
In this work of 1913 you see
him at a different moment.

00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:31.350
The mood, the overall color
palette is more subdued,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.938
and there is a clear
sense of Matisse engaging

00:00:35.938 --> 00:00:40.945
with the Cubist geometries of
his contemporaries of the moment.

00:00:42.072 --> 00:00:46.362
Matisse's overarching goals at
this moment remained constant

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:50.762
to arrive somehow at the
essential character of things.

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:54.409
This is, in fact, a very
reduced version of the view

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.296
of his studio that he saw
out of his bedroom window.

00:00:58.164 --> 00:01:00.832
When you first look at
it the overall impression

00:01:00.832 --> 00:01:06.643
is of this expanse of blue, of this
virtually monochromatic canvas.

00:01:06.876 --> 00:01:11.464
Several scholars believe
that in creating this picture

00:01:11.464 --> 00:01:17.266
Matisse used what was known as
a Claude, or a black mirror.

00:01:17.632 --> 00:01:24.073
In fact, this little square in the
lower right of the composition may be

00:01:24.073 --> 00:01:28.294
a stylized representation
of this artist's tool.

00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:34.541
They were a device that eliminates
all sensations of color,
probably a very useful tool

00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:40.757
for him in stylizing, reducing,
simplifying what he saw before him.

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:43.920
When you look at this work
with x-rays for example,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.758
you can see that up in the tree areas
he gradually eliminated details.

00:01:49.878 --> 00:01:56.631
The more you look at it and begin to look
at the relations of one part to another

00:01:56.631 --> 00:02:01.694
you realize that a major
reason for its beauty

00:02:01.694 --> 00:02:07.962
is that Matisse has so carefully aligned
virtually every element in this picture.

00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:11.458
Everything in some way lines up.

00:02:11.458 --> 00:02:16.492
The top of the statue with
this black line of the window

00:02:16.492 --> 00:02:21.297
or the top of the lamp, or this
band that may have been a curtain

00:02:21.297 --> 00:02:27.087
may be a wall, but that Matisse
extends down into what really becomes

00:02:27.087 --> 00:02:30.983
this wonderful abstract blue stripe.
