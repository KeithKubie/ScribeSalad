00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.320
So we've got three functions
graphed right over here.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.320
And then we have three
equations right over here

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.999
that could describe
these functions.

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:09.540
And once again, we
need to figure out

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.862
which ones will match
with which other ones.

00:00:11.862 --> 00:00:14.320
And I encourage you to pause
this video right now and think

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.890
about it.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.664
So let's go equation
by equation.

00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:20.080
And at least let's try to write
them in a form or at least

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.740
look at parts of them that will
make it a little easier for us

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.880
to figure out which
ones match up.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.740
So let's look at this
first one right over here.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.670
So this first one,
instead of just taking

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.640
the trouble of multiplying
all of this out,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.776
I really care about
the highest degree term

00:00:36.776 --> 00:00:38.150
and maybe the
lowest degree term.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.130
So let me just try
to figure those out.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.550
So I could rewrite
that one as y is

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.024
equal to-- the highest
degree term is essentially

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:47.440
going to be, we're going to
take the product of these four

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.290
expressions: negative 1/11
times x minus 5 times this times

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.960
this.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.310
So if we take the highest
degree part of each of them,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.351
that's going to give us
our highest degree terms.

00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:59.610
So it's going to be
negative 1/11 times x times

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.827
x squared times x squared.

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:03.660
So that's going to be
x to the fifth, right?

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.826
x squared times x squared
is x to the fourth times x

00:01:05.826 --> 00:01:06.940
is x to the fifth.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.551
Negative 1/11 x to the fifth.

00:01:09.551 --> 00:01:11.550
And then it's going to
be plus a bunch of stuff.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.008
And then our lowest degree term
is going to be, let's see--

00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:17.520
It's going to be negative
1/11 times negative

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.485
5, which is positive 5/11.

00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:21.110
Actually let me just
write it this way.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.580
Plus negative 1/11 times
negative 5 times positive 10

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.922
times 2x.

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:31.213
I guess we could work this out.

00:01:31.213 --> 00:01:36.334
This is what, positive 100/11.

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:37.750
But let's just
leave it like this.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.950
That's going to be our
lowest degree term.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.720
I just took the lowest degree
from each of these expressions

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.230
that we're going to be
multiplying together.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.980
And so, this is another
way of viewing it.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.410
And what's useful about this
one is we could immediately

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.810
think about the
end behavior here.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.780
So what do I mean
by end behavior?

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.330
Well we've covered this already.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.962
Let's look at the coefficient
on the highest degree term.

00:01:58.962 --> 00:02:01.170
And let's also think about
whether the highest degree

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.240
term is odd or even.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.150
Since we're dealing
with an odd degree

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.210
polynomial-- this
is x to the fifth--

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.120
and this coefficient on
the highest degree term

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.860
is negative, this
is going to have

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:23.299
end behavior like
negative x to the third.

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.340
And what would negative
x to the third look like?

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.514
Well when x is
really negative, it's

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:28.680
going to be really positive.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.390
Because x to the third is going
to be really negative, but then

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.530
you're multiplying
it times a negative.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.874
And then when x is really
positive, x to the 3rd

00:02:34.874 --> 00:02:36.290
is going to be
even more positive,

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.530
but we have a
negative out front,

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.030
so it's going to
be really negative.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.670
So this function is going
to look something like this,

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.200
and it's going to do some
crazy things in between.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.830
So which of these
look like that?

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.700
Well let's see... f starts high,
then it goes high up again.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.090
So it's not that one.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.035
g starts low and ends up high.

00:02:58.035 --> 00:02:59.920
This starts high, ends up low.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.250
So the only one that's left--
this actually kind of plays

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.390
tricks with the eye--
the only one that's left

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.660
is the dotted purple
one which is-- actually

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.110
do they even have
a label on this?

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.360
Well we'll call that one h.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.100
That one is h.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.470
And let me highlight it,
because I know it's hard to see.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.830
So this one.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.940
This one right over here.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.670
Notice: end behavior.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.000
It starts for very
negative values

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.627
and has a very high
value for our function.

00:03:27.627 --> 00:03:29.710
Then it does all sorts of
crazy things in between.

00:03:33.414 --> 00:03:35.080
And you can actually
see that it clearly

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.440
has one, two, three,
four, five roots.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.130
But that's not what we're really
concerned with for this sake.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.290
And then after it does
all that crazy stuff,

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.480
as x gets really positive,
the value of the function

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.870
becomes really negative.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:57.030
So its end behavior is like
negative x to the third.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.380
So we can feel confident that
this function right over here

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.006
is h of x.

00:04:05.006 --> 00:04:07.130
Now, in other videos I've
looked at the intercepts.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.220
But what is the
y-intercept for this one?

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.831
Well, when x equals 0, this
whole thing is equal to 0.

00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:13.830
Because the lowest degree
term isn't a constant.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.010
It has an x in it.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.610
So when x is 0, this
whole thing is 0.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:17.649
And that's consistent.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.876
Actually all three of these
have a y-intercept of 0.

00:04:19.876 --> 00:04:21.709
And you see that's
because all three of them

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.620
have a lowest degree
term that involves an x.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.180
So we can really just
concern ourselves

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.370
with the highest degree terms.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.260
So now let's think
about the next function.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.850
And I'm gonna give myself
some real estate here.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.600
I don't want to scroll
down just because I

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.650
want to be able to
look at the graph.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.390
So let's look at-- oh
my phone's ringing.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.360
This is more important.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.182
Let me work on this video-- So
this next one right over here.

00:04:48.182 --> 00:04:50.140
Let's just think about
what it might look like.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.556
It would look like y is equal
to-- its highest degree term

00:04:52.556 --> 00:04:54.960
is 110 times x squared
times x squared.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.450
So positive 110 times x
squared times x squared,

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.730
which is x to the fourth.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.530
And then plus a
bunch of other stuff.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.550
So what's its end
behavior going to be?

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.080
Well it has an even exponent
on its highest degree.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.240
Or it's an even
degree polynomial.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.520
And the coefficient on
that highest degree term

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.620
is positive.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.670
So it's going to
have end behavior

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.390
like positive x squared.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.290
So when x is really negative,
the value of the function

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.782
is going to be really positive.

00:05:28.782 --> 00:05:30.240
And then when x is
really positive,

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.580
the value of the function is
going to be really positive.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.288
And it might do some
kind of crazy things

00:05:34.288 --> 00:05:36.470
in between, because this
obviously isn't x squared.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.480
It has all sorts of
crazy terms there.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.200
So which of these
functions looks like that?

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.150
Well let's see.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.840
Our f has that,
when x gets really

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.980
negative it gets
really positive.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.620
And when x gets really positive,
it gets really positive.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.650
And it's the only one that
has that type of behavior.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.410
So we can say fairly confidently
that f of x is this function.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.087
Or this function is f of x.

00:06:00.087 --> 00:06:01.920
And then once again,
deductive reasoning, we

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.390
can think that this
last one is g of x.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.710
That this last one right
over here is g of x.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:08.666
But let's verify it.

00:06:08.666 --> 00:06:11.165
So if we were trying to think
about its highest degree term,

00:06:11.165 --> 00:06:15.150
it would be y is
equal to 1/11 times

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.260
x times x squared
times x squared.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.220
So 1/11 x to the fifth.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.390
And then plus all sorts
of other business.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.430
So here you have an odd
degree-- it's a fifth degree--

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.050
and you have a
positive coefficient

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.710
on that fifth degree term.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.020
So it's going to
have end behavior

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.370
like positive x to the third.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.200
So when x is really negative,
the value of the function

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.589
is going to be really negative.

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:40.630
And when x is positive,
the value of the function

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.250
is going to be really positive.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.732
And it's going to do all sorts
of crazy things in between.

00:06:44.732 --> 00:06:45.940
So which one looks like that?

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.320
Well g looks like that.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.110
When x gets negative,
the value of our function

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.270
gets really negative.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.550
As x gets really positive,
the value of our function

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.040
becomes really positive.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.790
And it does all sorts
of craziness in between.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.410
So we can feel good
that that one is g of x.
