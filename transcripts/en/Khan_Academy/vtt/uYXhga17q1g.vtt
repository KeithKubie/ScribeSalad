00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.837
- [Voiceover] This right
here is a screenshot of

00:00:02.837 --> 00:00:05.860
the line and angle proofs
exercise on Khan Academy,

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.004
and I thought we would
use this to really just

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:09.948
get some practice with
line and angle proofs.

00:00:09.948 --> 00:00:12.404
And what's neat about this, this even uses

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:14.756
translations and transformations

00:00:14.756 --> 00:00:17.195
as ways to actually prove things.

00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:19.272
So let's look at what they're telling us.

00:00:19.272 --> 00:00:23.709
So it says line AB and
line DE are parallel lines.

00:00:23.709 --> 00:00:25.323
All right.

00:00:25.323 --> 00:00:27.668
Perform a translation that proves

00:00:27.668 --> 00:00:30.372
corresponding angles are always equal,

00:00:30.372 --> 00:00:33.676
and select the option
which explains the proof.

00:00:33.676 --> 00:00:37.163
All right, so let's see
what they have down here.

00:00:37.163 --> 00:00:39.908
So they say perform a translation

00:00:39.908 --> 00:00:43.428
that proves corresponding
angles are always equal.

00:00:43.428 --> 00:00:46.904
And then select the option
that explains the proof.

00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:49.947
So they've picked two
corresponding angles here.

00:00:49.947 --> 00:00:52.114
And so you see this is kind
of the bottom left angle,

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:54.442
this phi, and then you
have theta right here

00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:56.170
is the bottom left angle down here,

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.139
so these are corresponding angles,

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:01.756
line FB is a transversal,
and they already told us

00:01:01.756 --> 00:01:05.316
that line AB, what did they
call it, did they call it DE?

00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:08.959
And line DE, are indeed, parallel lines.

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:12.323
So we wanna prove that these two things,

00:01:12.323 --> 00:01:15.689
that the measure of these
two angles are equal.

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.219
So, there's many ways that
you can do this geometrically.

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.281
And we do that in many
Khan Academy videos,

00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:26.494
but this one, they offer us
the option of translating,

00:01:26.494 --> 00:01:28.537
of doing a translation,
so let's see what that is.

00:01:28.537 --> 00:01:30.976
So I press the translate
button, and when I move this

00:01:30.976 --> 00:01:33.213
around notice it essentially translates

00:01:33.213 --> 00:01:36.941
these four points, which has the effect of

00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:40.095
translating this entire intersection here.

00:01:40.095 --> 00:01:44.088
So if we take, this point
where my mouse is right now,

00:01:44.088 --> 00:01:47.984
that is the point D, and
I'm translating it around.

00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:51.813
If I move that over to B,

00:01:51.813 --> 00:01:54.518
what it shows is, because under

00:01:54.518 --> 00:01:57.352
a translation the angle
measures shouldn't change.

00:01:57.352 --> 00:02:00.558
So when I did that, this angle,

00:02:00.558 --> 00:02:04.757
so it's down here, theta is
the measure of angle CDF.

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:07.359
And so when you move it over here,

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.322
this right over here should be the same.

00:02:09.322 --> 00:02:12.212
This angle's measure is the same as CDF,

00:02:12.212 --> 00:02:13.829
I'm just translating it.

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.125
And when you move it
over here, you see look,

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:19.477
that's the same exact measure as phi.

00:02:19.477 --> 00:02:21.088
So this is one way to think about it.

00:02:21.088 --> 00:02:25.238
I just translated the point D to B,

00:02:25.238 --> 00:02:28.714
and then it really just
translated angle CDF

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:31.725
over angle ABD.

00:02:31.725 --> 00:02:34.614
So to show that these
have the same measure.

00:02:34.614 --> 00:02:37.444
Or at least to feel good
about the idea of them

00:02:37.444 --> 00:02:38.926
having the same measure.

00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:41.421
So let's see which choices describe that.

00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:44.554
So let me, I'm having
trouble operating my mouse.

00:02:44.554 --> 00:02:48.144
All right, the translation mapping

00:02:48.144 --> 00:02:51.643
point F to point D, so point F

00:02:51.643 --> 00:02:55.705
to point D, point F to point D,

00:02:55.705 --> 00:02:57.937
we didn't map point F to point D.

00:02:57.937 --> 00:02:59.506
So this is already looking suspect,

00:02:59.506 --> 00:03:02.960
produces a new line which
is a bisector of segment DB.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.496
A new line which is a
bisector of segment B,

00:03:07.496 --> 00:03:10.669
okay, this doesn't seem
anything like what I just did,

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.774
so I'm just gonna move on to the next one.

00:03:12.774 --> 00:03:15.357
Since the image of a
line under translation

00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:17.941
is parallel to the
original line, that's true,

00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:21.909
the translation that
maps point D to point B,

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:23.281
that's what I did right over here,

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:26.690
maps angle CDF to ABD.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.986
And that's what I did, I mapped angle CDF

00:03:29.986 --> 00:03:34.986
to angle ADB, that'e exactly
what I did right over there.

00:03:35.797 --> 00:03:40.190
So this is to ABD, translations
preserve angle measures,

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.605
so theta is equal to phi.

00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:44.477
Yup, that one looks pretty good.

00:03:44.477 --> 00:03:46.931
The translation that mapped point D to E.

00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:49.347
I didn't do that, I didn't take

00:03:49.347 --> 00:03:52.419
point D and move it over to E like that,

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.043
that didn't really help me.

00:03:54.043 --> 00:03:56.540
Let's just keep reading
it just to make sure.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.740
Produces a parallelogram,
that actually is true,

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.905
if I translate point D to point E it does,

00:04:03.905 --> 00:04:07.208
I have this parallelogram constructed,

00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:09.169
but it really doesn't help us establishing

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.026
that phi is equal to theta.

00:04:11.026 --> 00:04:13.912
So that one I also don't feel good about.

00:04:13.912 --> 00:04:14.928
So and it's good because

00:04:14.928 --> 00:04:16.720
we felt good about the middle choice.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.412
Let's do one more of these.

00:04:19.412 --> 00:04:24.105
So they are telling us that line AOB,

00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:29.493
and they could have just said line AB,

00:04:29.493 --> 00:04:32.040
but I guess they wanted to put
the O in there to show that

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.833
point O is on that line,
that AOB are colinear.

00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:39.719
And COD is our straight
lines, all right, fair enough.

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:41.376
Which of these statements prove

00:04:41.376 --> 00:04:43.679
vertical angles are always equal?

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:45.679
So vertical angles would be the angles

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:47.868
on the opposite sides of an intersection.

00:04:47.868 --> 00:04:49.704
So in order to prove that vertical,

00:04:49.704 --> 00:04:53.631
so for example angle AOC, and angle DOB,

00:04:53.631 --> 00:04:55.575
are vertical angles.

00:04:55.575 --> 00:04:58.905
And if we wanted to prove
that they are equal,

00:04:58.905 --> 00:05:00.981
we would say well their
measures are gonna be equal,

00:05:00.981 --> 00:05:03.182
so theta should be equal to phi.

00:05:03.182 --> 00:05:06.489
So let's see which of these
statements actually does that.

00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:11.423
So this one says segment
OA is congruent to OD.

00:05:11.423 --> 00:05:14.148
OA is congruent to OD.

00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:17.388
We don't know that, they
never even told us that.

00:05:17.388 --> 00:05:19.885
So I don't even have
to read the rest of it,

00:05:19.885 --> 00:05:21.823
this is already saying,
I don't know how far

00:05:21.823 --> 00:05:23.940
D is away from O, I don't know if it's

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.068
the same distance A is from O.

00:05:26.068 --> 00:05:27.837
So we can just rule this first choice out.

00:05:27.837 --> 00:05:30.485
I can stop reading, this
started with a statement

00:05:30.485 --> 00:05:33.147
that we don't know, based on
the information they gave us.

00:05:33.147 --> 00:05:35.372
So let's look at the second choice.

00:05:35.372 --> 00:05:40.270
If ray OA and ray OC are each

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.779
rotated 180 degrees about point O,

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:48.460
they must map to OB and OD respectively.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.633
If two rays are rotated
by the same amount,

00:05:51.633 --> 00:05:54.057
the angle between them will not change,

00:05:54.057 --> 00:05:56.392
so phi must be equal to theta.

00:05:56.392 --> 00:05:58.080
So this is interesting, so let's just

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.441
slow down and think about
what they're saying.

00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:04.192
If ray OA and OC are
each rotated 180 degrees,

00:06:04.192 --> 00:06:06.664
so if you take ray OA,
this right over here,

00:06:06.664 --> 00:06:10.666
if you rotate it 180
degrees, it's gonna go

00:06:10.666 --> 00:06:12.558
all the way around and point
in the other direction,

00:06:12.558 --> 00:06:16.809
it's going to become, it's
going to map to ray OB.

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:18.353
So I definitely believe that.

00:06:18.353 --> 00:06:20.689
OA is going to map to ray OB,

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:24.762
and ray OC, if you rotate it 180 degrees,

00:06:24.762 --> 00:06:28.235
is going to map to ray OD.

00:06:28.235 --> 00:06:30.896
And so this first statement is true.

00:06:30.896 --> 00:06:34.162
If ray OA and ray OC are each rotated

00:06:34.162 --> 00:06:37.286
180 degrees about point
O, they must map to

00:06:37.286 --> 00:06:40.113
ray OB and OD respectively.

00:06:40.113 --> 00:06:41.374
And when people say respectively,

00:06:41.374 --> 00:06:42.610
they're saying in the same order.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.744
That ray OA maps to ray OB,

00:06:45.744 --> 00:06:49.849
and that ray OC maps to ray OD.

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:52.409
And we saw that, ray OA maps,

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:54.792
if you rotate it all the
way around 180 degrees,

00:06:54.792 --> 00:06:59.001
it'll map to OB, and then OC
if you rotate 180 degrees,

00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:02.247
will map to OD.

00:07:02.247 --> 00:07:05.639
So I'm feeling good about
that first sentence.

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:08.728
If two rays are rotated
by the same amount,

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:11.408
the angle between them will not change.

00:07:11.408 --> 00:07:14.191
Yeah, I could, yeah.

00:07:14.191 --> 00:07:17.399
Especially if they are rotated

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:21.287
around, yeah, I'll go with that.

00:07:21.287 --> 00:07:22.983
If two rays are rotated
by the same amount,

00:07:22.983 --> 00:07:24.916
the angle between them will not change.

00:07:24.916 --> 00:07:29.581
So if we rotate both of
these rays by 180 degrees,

00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:33.698
then we've essentially
mapped to OB and OD.

00:07:33.698 --> 00:07:35.722
Or another way to think about this angle,

00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:40.241
angle AOC, is going to map to angle BOD.

00:07:40.241 --> 00:07:44.110
And so the measure of those
angles are going to be the same.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.258
So phi must be equal to theta.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.807
So I actually like this
second statement a lot.

00:07:49.807 --> 00:07:51.214
So let's see this last statement.

00:07:51.214 --> 00:07:56.018
Rotations preserve lengths and angles.

00:07:56.018 --> 00:08:00.158
AB is congruent to CD.

00:08:00.158 --> 00:08:02.615
Actually, we don't know whether segment

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:06.480
AB is congruent to CD,
they never told us that.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.318
We don't know how far
apart these things are.

00:08:09.318 --> 00:08:12.447
So we know that phi is equal to theta.

00:08:12.447 --> 00:08:15.038
So this statement right
over here is just suspect.

00:08:15.038 --> 00:08:17.991
And so actually I don't like that one.

00:08:17.991 --> 00:08:20.081
So I'm gonna go with
the first one which is,

00:08:20.081 --> 00:08:22.863
it takes a little bit of
visualization going on,

00:08:22.863 --> 00:08:26.366
but if you took angle
AOC and you rotated it

00:08:26.366 --> 00:08:29.206
180 degrees which means
take the corresponding rays,

00:08:29.206 --> 00:08:32.214
or the rays that make it up,
and rotate them 180 degrees,

00:08:32.214 --> 00:08:34.973
you get to angle BOD.

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.373
And the angle between those rays,

00:08:37.373 --> 00:08:39.272
or the measure of the angles
we were just talking about,

00:08:39.272 --> 00:08:40.541
shouldn't change.

00:08:40.541 --> 00:08:42.490
So I feel really good
about this second choice.
