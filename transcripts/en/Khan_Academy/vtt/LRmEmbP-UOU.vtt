00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.277
- [Voiceover] So we
have been talking about

00:00:03.277 --> 00:00:04.848
the Market Revolution

00:00:04.848 --> 00:00:06.444
in the United States

00:00:06.444 --> 00:00:09.179
which was this period in the first half

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.762
of the 19th century

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.967
where the way that Americans
did business really changed.

00:00:16.918 --> 00:00:19.998
And it changed in a number of ways,

00:00:19.998 --> 00:00:23.665
so the kinds of work
that people did changed

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:30.076
and the people they sold
their goods to changed

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:33.651
in the form of new markets.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.489
And even the kinds of commodities

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.572
that they were producing.

00:00:40.178 --> 00:00:42.370
All of these were
altered in the first half

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.037
of the 19th century,

00:00:45.148 --> 00:00:48.648
thanks to a couple of simultaneous trends.

00:00:50.658 --> 00:00:54.801
The Industrial Revolution
in which new technologies

00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:58.801
were developed to make
production more efficient

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.230
and revolutions in
transportation and communication,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.311
which made it easier
to get goods and people

00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:10.379
to far distances more quickly

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:14.079
and to communicate over
considerable distances

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:15.162
more quickly.

00:01:16.128 --> 00:01:19.530
And these really resulted
in a reorganization

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.113
of American society

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.260
that some historians have actually said

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.427
was more revolutionary than
the American Revolution.

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:31.707
So in the last video,

00:01:31.707 --> 00:01:35.810
we discussed some of the new technologies

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.489
which changed American work
in the early 19th century.

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:44.517
One of these was the
introduction of the textile mill,

00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:46.729
which was powered by a water wheel,

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.146
by Samuel Slater,

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:52.787
which helped textile mills
become the chief industry

00:01:52.787 --> 00:01:54.537
of New England,

00:01:54.537 --> 00:01:57.747
also helped women start
working outside the home

00:01:57.747 --> 00:02:01.565
in the Lowell Mills,
started by Charles Lowell

00:02:01.565 --> 00:02:04.858
and also began the system
by which factory owners

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:09.508
would hire individuals,
rather than family units,

00:02:09.508 --> 00:02:12.407
to work for wages in their factories.

00:02:12.407 --> 00:02:16.366
The other major invention that
had a really important impact

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:19.646
on American society was the cotton gin,

00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:23.563
which was a machine that
separated cotton seeds

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:29.206
from the fiber and it made
the production of cotton

00:02:30.278 --> 00:02:32.678
considerably more profitable.

00:02:32.678 --> 00:02:36.666
And so, with cotton a profitable crop,

00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:40.327
the American south
really invested in cotton

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:43.708
and investing in cotton
as its main cash crop

00:02:43.708 --> 00:02:47.084
meant they really entrenched
the system of slavery.

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:50.501
So even though in the 1780s, early 1790s,

00:02:51.658 --> 00:02:53.676
many southern states were thinking perhaps

00:02:53.676 --> 00:02:57.828
they'd abolish slavery because
the institution was not

00:02:57.828 --> 00:02:59.648
overly profitable,

00:02:59.648 --> 00:03:03.315
as cotton became the
cash crop of the south,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.307
the institution of slavery
would be entrenched

00:03:07.307 --> 00:03:10.390
and continue to grow until the 1860s.

00:03:11.407 --> 00:03:14.838
So those are some of the new
technologies of production.

00:03:14.838 --> 00:03:17.948
In this video, I wanna spend
some time talking about

00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:21.220
the revolution in communication
and transportation

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.470
that happened also in this time period.

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.158
So just like inventions
like the textile mill

00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:33.158
or the cotton gin made
it easier to work faster,

00:03:34.588 --> 00:03:37.160
inventions in transportation
and communication

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.408
in the early 19th century
also made it possible

00:03:40.408 --> 00:03:42.199
to transport goods faster

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.249
and to transport information faster.

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:47.188
So I wanna talk about just a few

00:03:47.188 --> 00:03:50.349
of these transportation inventions.

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.709
One of these was the railroad.

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.396
Now, the railroad was not
invented in the United States.

00:03:56.396 --> 00:04:00.718
Rather, the United States
imported the railroad technology

00:04:00.718 --> 00:04:02.519
from England and Germany

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.538
and this is one of the
very first railroads

00:04:05.538 --> 00:04:07.118
in the United States,

00:04:07.118 --> 00:04:08.717
I think it's kind of adorable

00:04:08.717 --> 00:04:11.000
'cause you can see how it still is really

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.333
owing a debt, stylistically, to a wagon.

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:18.556
Even looks like a wagon here on the end.

00:04:18.556 --> 00:04:21.850
So railroads begin to come
into the United States

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.017
in the early 1800s and first
they're mostly for cargo

00:04:27.828 --> 00:04:30.209
or helping to move stone,

00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:31.710
things to help build canals,

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.750
which we'll get to in a second.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.583
But soon they're also
passenger rail stations.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.800
And the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.133
or B&amp;O railroad,

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.479
which you may know from
your Monopoly board

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.547
was one of the first passenger rail lines

00:04:49.547 --> 00:04:51.548
in the United States.

00:04:51.548 --> 00:04:54.160
Another major transportation revolution

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.620
of this time period was shipping on water.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.620
So, in 1807,

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:04.492
inventor Robert Fulton

00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:07.746
came up with the steamship

00:05:09.018 --> 00:05:09.916
and so a steamship,

00:05:09.916 --> 00:05:13.328
and you can see the little
smokestacks right here,

00:05:13.328 --> 00:05:15.740
makes it much easier to power the ship

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.771
and one thing you can do
then is go against the tide

00:05:18.771 --> 00:05:19.778
of a river,

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:21.870
so instead of just, for example,

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.809
going down the Mississippi River

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:25.040
to the port of New Orleans,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.400
you can also go back up
the Mississippi River

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.360
which means commerce can go
more easily in both directions.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.508
Another major innovation of
the time period are canals.

00:05:36.508 --> 00:05:39.925
And this here is a map of the Erie Canal,

00:05:41.916 --> 00:05:44.166
which was completed in 1825

00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:49.749
and a canal is a relatively narrow,

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.828
relatively shallow waterway

00:05:52.828 --> 00:05:56.745
but it still allows cargo
barges to move across

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:01.600
what otherwise would be really
hard to navigate territory,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.420
so, you know, it's hard to see here,

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.059
but there are mountains here, right.

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:08.726
So, now you can take

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:11.759
cargo across mountains,

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.478
across large stretches of land by ship,

00:06:15.478 --> 00:06:17.328
which is much faster

00:06:17.328 --> 00:06:18.600
than trying to do it on foot

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.933
or with a wagon.

00:06:20.898 --> 00:06:24.505
I think it's actually hard
for us to imagine now,

00:06:24.505 --> 00:06:27.194
but in the early 19th century

00:06:27.194 --> 00:06:30.527
and really for most of time before then,

00:06:32.118 --> 00:06:35.668
waterways were the highways of the world.

00:06:35.668 --> 00:06:39.659
It was a lot easier to
get from Boston to London

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:41.429
across the Atlantic by ship

00:06:41.429 --> 00:06:44.068
than it would have been to get from Boston

00:06:44.068 --> 00:06:47.748
to the Appalachian Mountains on foot.

00:06:47.748 --> 00:06:50.349
Before the invention of air travel,

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:53.678
before the Interstate Highway System,

00:06:53.678 --> 00:06:58.319
and really, up until the
invention of the railroad,

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:01.828
waterways were the
easiest way to get around

00:07:01.828 --> 00:07:02.911
in the world.

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:07.427
And the last communication revolution

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:12.167
that I wanna talk about is the
invention of the telegraph,

00:07:12.167 --> 00:07:15.043
which a portrait painter-turned-inventor

00:07:15.043 --> 00:07:16.543
named Samuel Morse

00:07:18.675 --> 00:07:20.508
first patented in 1844

00:07:22.916 --> 00:07:25.333
and Morse invented Morse Code

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:29.914
because the telegraph worked by sending

00:07:29.914 --> 00:07:32.483
pulses down copper wires

00:07:32.483 --> 00:07:35.565
and so it made it easy to communicate

00:07:35.565 --> 00:07:39.065
through coded messages of dots and dashes.

00:07:40.264 --> 00:07:44.014
So, dots and dashes
corresponded with letters

00:07:46.255 --> 00:07:49.083
which allowed you to send messages over

00:07:49.083 --> 00:07:51.166
extremely long distances,

00:07:52.266 --> 00:07:54.763
so you could send a message by telegraph

00:07:54.763 --> 00:07:56.033
in an instant,

00:07:56.033 --> 00:07:57.873
as opposed to sending a letter,

00:07:57.873 --> 00:07:59.795
which might take days or even weeks

00:07:59.795 --> 00:08:02.416
to get to its destination.

00:08:02.416 --> 00:08:04.784
So, all of these revolutions
in transportation

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:08.082
and communication kind of translate into

00:08:08.082 --> 00:08:12.163
two major transformations
in American business

00:08:12.163 --> 00:08:13.593
at this time period.

00:08:13.593 --> 00:08:15.426
One, is that the scope

00:08:17.925 --> 00:08:21.537
of business that you
can do is much greater

00:08:21.537 --> 00:08:25.827
because now, if you're
a farmer who lives in,

00:08:25.827 --> 00:08:27.077
say, Rochester,

00:08:28.953 --> 00:08:30.370
your radius of...

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:36.743
your radius of people you
can sell your produce to

00:08:36.743 --> 00:08:40.251
before it goes bad is considerably larger.

00:08:40.251 --> 00:08:42.900
Now, instead of just being able to get to

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.411
where you can get maybe in
a wagon's trip of a day,

00:08:46.411 --> 00:08:50.220
you can send your crops on the Erie Canal

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.132
and suddenly, you're dealing
with a much larger market.

00:08:54.132 --> 00:08:59.092
So, they're not only creating
a national web of commerce,

00:08:59.092 --> 00:09:02.811
they're also creating an
international web of commerce

00:09:02.811 --> 00:09:05.429
because these canals and steamships

00:09:05.429 --> 00:09:08.212
go to international ports which mean that

00:09:08.212 --> 00:09:12.379
you can now do business from
the western part of New York

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.982
with people who live in London.

00:09:15.982 --> 00:09:17.572
And the other thing that increases here

00:09:17.572 --> 00:09:19.572
is the pace of business,

00:09:21.918 --> 00:09:26.085
right, so instead of having
to negotiate a business deal

00:09:27.121 --> 00:09:28.651
through a series of letters,

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.860
which might take you many weeks,

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.260
now you can negotiate a business deal

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.499
by the telegraph

00:09:34.499 --> 00:09:37.251
and it's only gonna take
you a couple of days.

00:09:37.251 --> 00:09:39.709
Likewise, it might have taken you weeks

00:09:39.709 --> 00:09:42.322
to send your logs for example,

00:09:42.322 --> 00:09:44.182
down the Mississippi River.

00:09:44.182 --> 00:09:45.719
Now you have them in a steamship

00:09:45.719 --> 00:09:47.851
and it takes just a couple of days.

00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:50.582
So there's an overall expansion

00:09:50.582 --> 00:09:54.660
in the number of people who
can participate in markets.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.020
The expansion of the distance at which

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.351
you can participate in a market

00:09:59.351 --> 00:10:01.461
and the pace at which you can do it.

00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:04.044
You can do business much faster

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.701
with these revolutions in transportation

00:10:07.701 --> 00:10:09.201
and communication.

00:10:10.212 --> 00:10:11.091
And in the next video,

00:10:11.091 --> 00:10:13.831
I'll talk more about how
these transformations

00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:14.914
in technology

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.200
and the scope and pace of
American business affected

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.900
the society of the United States

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.939
in the early 19th century.
