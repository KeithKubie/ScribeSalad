00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.500
- [Announcer] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.770
Bipedal, naked, large-brained.

00:00:16.623 --> 00:00:20.570
Long the master of fire,
tools and language.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.850
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.344 --> 00:00:27.740
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.690
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.550
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.030
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.120
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.770
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.540
understanding of the past.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.170
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.530
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here,

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.880
an exploration made possible

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.530
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.320
- Humans eat meat more often

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.290
and in greater quantities
than any other primate.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.340
And as we've already heard today twice,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.430
meat consumption is seen by many

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.640
as one of the defining
features of our species.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.490
And it's been linked to the evolution

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.900
of our large brains, bipedal locomotion,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.690
pair bonding and other
distinctly human traits.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.200
So therefore, it's critically
important to understand

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.960
what caused this dramatic dietary shift.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.730
So, to understand how and why meat eating

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.110
became so prevalent in our lineage,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.410
we need to know something
about the ancestral state.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.800
In other words, we need to make inferences

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.342
about the behavior of
the last common ancestor

00:02:33.342 --> 00:02:37.130
of humans and our
closest living relatives.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.360
So I'm talking about this creature here.

00:02:40.378 --> 00:02:43.840
It lived in Africa four to
eight million years ago.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.669
So, as our closest living relatives,

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:51.152
and specifically as large-bodies,

00:02:51.152 --> 00:02:54.310
primarily fruit-eating apes,

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.771
chimpanzees and bonobos provide clues

00:02:56.771 --> 00:02:59.890
about the behavior of
this last common ancestor.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.271
Of course, they are not
exact replicas or models

00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:05.890
of the last common ancestor.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.940
Instead, they help us to understand

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.701
the ecological pressures
that this animal faced,

00:03:11.701 --> 00:03:14.418
and, in turn, can help us understand

00:03:14.418 --> 00:03:17.840
what changed in our lineage and why.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.314
Both chimpanzees and bonobos eat meat,

00:03:21.314 --> 00:03:23.940
but chimpanzees do so more often.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.880
So we know more about the factors

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.500
that affect their hunting frequency.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.090
So that's why I'm discussing
chimpanzees today.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.350
A little bit of background
on chimpanzee biology.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.915
Chimpanzee diet is
dominated by ripe fruit.

00:03:38.915 --> 00:03:42.584
Figs, like these here, are
particularly important.

00:03:42.584 --> 00:03:45.390
And the abundance and
distribution of ripe fruit

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.470
in chimp habitat affects
grouping and travel patterns

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.150
of the chimpanzees, which, as we will see,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.530
also affect hunting behavior.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.787
In addition to a largely fruit-based diet,

00:04:01.787 --> 00:04:05.750
chimpanzees also eat leaves,
specifically young leaves,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.930
which are easier to digest
and extract protein from.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.213
They eat flowers and stems

00:04:12.213 --> 00:04:15.490
as well as invertebrates
like termites and ants,

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.930
and at some sites, they
use tools to do so.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.900
So here's a chimpanzee at Gombe

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.900
using a long blade of grass

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.460
to extract termites from a termite mound.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.940
So it should come as no
surprise to this audience now

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.140
that chimpanzees also eat meat.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.660
But compared to humans, they
do so relatively rarely.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.130
So this is a, and it's
actually really surprising

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.440
to find that there are relatively

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.720
few published data on the proportion

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.410
of diet spent eating meat.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.460
So this is just a quick
and dirty breakdown

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.380
of diet from Gombe National
Park, which is where I work.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.600
And as you can see, the time spent feeding

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.310
is dominated by ripe fruit and leaves,

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.260
and meat makes up about 4.3
percent of feeding time.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.370
Insects are about 3.2 percent.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.950
Compared to Kanyawara, which
is Richard Wrangham's site,

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.770
there they spend less than one percent

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.890
of their feeding time eating meat.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.570
And at Mahale, where they estimated it

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.490
in terms of grams per day,
it's only about 45 grams.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.300
So very very different to
what we see among humans.

00:05:30.859 --> 00:05:34.597
So, by far, the most
important prey species

00:05:34.597 --> 00:05:38.140
for chimpanzees is the red colobus monkey.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.490
These guys weigh from
eight to 10 kilograms,

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.040
although at some sites the chimps

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.910
target the infants and the juveniles,

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.140
which are obviously much smaller.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.000
Red colobus are arboreal,
they live in trees.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.270
They rarely come down to the ground.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.280
And they live in large
groups, 50 or so individuals.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.040
And they fiercely defend themselves

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.120
against the chimpanzee hunters.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.310
So when I say that they're the most

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.750
important prey species, you can see why.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.120
So here are five major chimpanzee

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.950
long-term research sites,

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.950
and at all sites where red
colobus and chimpanzees coexist,

00:06:17.972 --> 00:06:22.380
red colobus are the most
frequent prey species.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.810
So you can see here, at Mahale,
Tai, Gombe and Kanyawara,

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.000
it's about 80 percent of the prey taken

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.710
are red colobus monkeys.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.580
And at Ngogo, at least until recently,

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.920
90 percent of the prey were red colobus.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.550
But this has changed in recent years,

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.840
because the chimpanzees have

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.270
decimated the red colobus population,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.160
which we may hear about
later from David Watts.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.120
So which species make
up the other category?

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.930
The little gray bars at
the top on that last graph?

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.530
Well, to some extent,
other arboreal monkeys.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.020
So from left to right, red-tailed guenons,

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.392
black and white colobus
monkeys and blue monkeys.

00:07:02.392 --> 00:07:06.160
And then also they prey
upon small ungulates,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.160
infant bush pigs, at the
bottom left, bushbuck fawns,

00:07:11.188 --> 00:07:15.100
adult duikers, which are
small forest antelopes,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.030
and then small animals
that hide in tree holes,

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.950
like this galago here,
and nestlings and so on.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.399
So hunts of the latter,
particularly the bottom row here,

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:28.640
don't really involve pursuit

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.860
in the same way that hunts
of arboreal monkeys do.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.190
They're much more of a quick grab

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.110
as the chimps come across
them as they're foraging.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.094
Now hunting frequency varies considerably

00:07:42.094 --> 00:07:45.060
within and between sites,

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.501
ranging from as few as two kills per year

00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:51.810
in Budongo Forest in Uganda

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.810
to as many as 136 per year
at Ngogo, also in Uganda.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.670
So this variation gives us the opportunity

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.549
to study the ecological factors

00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:06.430
that affect hunting decisions.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:12.770
So clearly, much of it,
much of this variation

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.660
is gonna be driven by what prey species

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.040
are available in the habitat.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.500
So as we saw, red colobus monkeys

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.148
dominate the prey profiles

00:08:22.148 --> 00:08:24.650
at the sites where they're present.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.142
So if they're not available,

00:08:26.142 --> 00:08:30.410
we're gonna see lower rates
of hunting overall, obviously.

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:35.200
So we can see here, at
Fongoli and Budongo,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.650
there are no red colobus monkeys,

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:41.350
and their number of prey
killed per year are quite low.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.470
However, we see also, there's considerable

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.240
variation in the sites where
red colobus are present.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.720
So there is additional variation

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.840
that's not explained by the
presence of red colobus monkeys.

00:08:57.048 --> 00:08:59.310
So it's not just gonna be the presence

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.960
of a particular species that's important,

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.505
it's also gonna be important

00:09:02.505 --> 00:09:06.470
how dense the population is,

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.320
how many there are in the habitats.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.310
And this is a particular
challenge that we face,

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.229
particularly when it
comes to the cryptic prey.

00:09:15.229 --> 00:09:17.650
So, for example, these galagos,

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.220
they're small, solitary,
nocturnal primates

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.590
that are active at night,

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.060
and they nest in tree
cavities during the day.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.320
Really hard to get a good sense

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.430
of how many there are in the habitat.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.050
So we're gonna hear in Jo
Fritz's talk later today

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.480
that these galagos are eaten

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.900
relatively frequently at Fongoli,

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.799
but this may simply be because,

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:40.170
relative to other sites, perhaps they're

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.270
more common there than they are elsewhere.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:48.140
There's also considerable
variation within sites as well.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.968
So I'll use Kibale National
Park as an example here.

00:09:51.968 --> 00:09:54.230
Duiker, this small forest antelope,

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.680
are frequently seen at Ngogo,

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.140
but only rarely seen at Kanyawara,

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.280
which is a chimpanzee community
in the same exact forest.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.320
So it's really challenging to do so,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.335
but I think we really need
to have some systematic

00:10:10.335 --> 00:10:12.060
comparison of prey density,

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.470
both within and between study sites,

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.370
to fully understand prey choice.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.470
So with that in mind, what other factors

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.130
are going to affect hunting frequency?

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.410
So as a behavioral ecologist,

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:30.050
I think in terms of the costs
and the benefits of hunting.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.410
The main costs are energy,

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.994
especially when hunting arboreal monkeys,

00:10:34.994 --> 00:10:38.340
because it takes a lot of effort

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.194
to climb trees quickly
and chase the monkeys.

00:10:41.194 --> 00:10:42.650
Time is important.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.510
Mean hunt duration at
Gombe, Craig Stanford found,

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.060
is about 28 minutes, so
there's opportunity cost.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.650
And also injury.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.900
From falling or from being attacked

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.440
by prey who clearly
don't want to be eaten.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.430
The benefits, as we heard
about from Alyssa, are clearer.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.610
Meat is always gonna be beneficial.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.240
Meat is concentrated source

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.820
of easily-accessible
macro- and micro-nutrients

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.860
However, for chimps, it does, it would be,

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.470
it seems unlikely that meat
is essential to their diet,

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.420
given that some communities rarely hunt,

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.580
and even among communities
that do hunt frequently,

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.543
there are some individuals
who rarely get meat.

00:11:26.543 --> 00:11:29.863
So they have other alternatives,

00:11:29.863 --> 00:11:32.590
presumably the insect diet that they have,

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:33.720
to get some of these nutrients,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.140
although it's just less efficient

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.860
than getting it from meat.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.380
So, therefore, we expect chimpanzees

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:46.330
to take advantage of low-cost
opportunities to get meat.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.660
They can afford to be picky

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.620
because they don't require it to survive,

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.960
but when they can get
it, they'll advantage

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.080
of those low-cost opportunities.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.250
So I'm proposing that variation in factors

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.010
that affect hunting costs

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.370
should affect hunting frequency.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.100
So what evidence do we
have that chimpanzees

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.778
are especially sensitive
to the costs of hunting?

00:12:09.778 --> 00:12:13.331
First, theory predicts that females

00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:16.630
should be more risk-averse than males.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.260
Female reproductive
success is more closely

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.420
tied to their body
condition, compared to males,

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.180
whose reproductive success is determined

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.760
by the number of females
that they mate with.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.360
So, the costs of wasted effort,

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.480
wasted effort on failed hunting,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.560
should be greater for
females than for males.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.010
So this predicts, then, that females

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:44.880
should specialize in prey that
are less costly to capture.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.880
So indeed, at Gombe, females
capture over 60 percent,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.590
you can see the gray bar
on the right-hand side,

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.290
60 percent of the sedentary,
passive prey items,

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.330
like fledglings and bushbuck fawns,

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.582
things that don't fight
back and don't run away,

00:13:01.582 --> 00:13:06.582
compared to only about 10
percent of the arboreal monkeys,

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.190
which require a lot of effort

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:11.320
to capture, and they fight back.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.935
In between, we have
terrestrial aggressive prey

00:13:13.935 --> 00:13:18.347
like bush piglets who, it
doesn't involve climbing

00:13:18.347 --> 00:13:22.330
through the trees, but they
have very very angry moms

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.460
who you do not want to mess with.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.470
So at Gombe, females specialize

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.510
in sedentary, non-threatening prey.

00:13:31.582 --> 00:13:35.460
Females do, as we saw,
sometimes hunt red colobus.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.800
But when they're present at a hunt

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.050
that's already in progress,

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.640
they are less likely than
males to participate.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.530
So this, again, suggest
that they are particularly

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.920
sensitive to the costs of hunting.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.140
Also, there is less incentive
for females to hunt,

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.860
because when they are successful,

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.460
most often, a male just
comes and takes it away.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.900
So instead, females are more likely

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.090
to sit and watch from below,

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.780
and then beg for meat from
successful male hunters.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.706
At all sites, upon encountering
a red colobus troop,

00:14:11.706 --> 00:14:13.940
a hunt is more likely to occur

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.050
if there are many adult male

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.600
chimpanzees present in a party.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.740
Chimps have what we call a
fission-fusion social system,

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:25.313
so if you think of that oval
as one social group's range,

00:14:25.313 --> 00:14:28.800
the entire social group are
never all together at once.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.760
Instead, they form fluid subgroups

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.980
that change in size and composition

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:38.270
in relation to food and
female availability.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.850
So, when I talk about the
number of male chimpanzees,

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.690
I'm talking about the
number of male chimpanzees

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.410
in one of those subgroups.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:48.400
And, as I said, the
likelihood of a hunt occurring

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.576
upon encountering red colobus monkeys

00:14:50.576 --> 00:14:52.710
is proportional to the number

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.770
of males present in that party.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.840
So there is some debate about why this is.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.660
It could be that, when
there are more males there,

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.231
there are more opportunities
to collaborate,

00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:05.902
and to coordinate one's actions.

00:15:05.902 --> 00:15:08.758
However, as my colleagues
and I have argued,

00:15:08.758 --> 00:15:11.962
we think there's a simpler alternative,

00:15:11.962 --> 00:15:14.818
that group hunting simply arises

00:15:14.818 --> 00:15:19.818
as the cumulative effect
of independent actions.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.180
The more hunters there are,

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.100
the easier it is for one
individual to make a kill.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.990
Either way, hunting costs are lower

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.960
as more individuals hunt.

00:15:31.908 --> 00:15:35.280
So large communities are certainly

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.160
going to have, they're more likely

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.060
to form these large hunting parties,

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.300
contributing to the
overall hunting frequency.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.330
So remember this chart
that I showed earlier

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.561
with variation in hunting frequency

00:15:45.561 --> 00:15:48.830
within sites where red
colobus are present?

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.971
So, some of this variation is certainly

00:15:50.971 --> 00:15:54.160
going to be due to community size.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.540
So over the years, when
these data were collected,

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.608
there were 150 to 200 chimpanzees
in the Ngogo community,

00:16:00.608 --> 00:16:05.010
while Gombe, Mahale and
Kanyawara were all around 50.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:07.225
So it certainly seems as though

00:16:07.225 --> 00:16:10.337
the large population size at Ngogo

00:16:10.337 --> 00:16:15.020
had an important effect
on hunting frequency.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.500
Another factor is variation
in forest structure.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.941
So this is a high-res satellite
image of part of Gombe,

00:16:25.941 --> 00:16:27.930
and you can see, just by looking,

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:31.530
that the density and
continuity of the forest canopy

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.050
varies considerably within the range

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.340
of a single chimpanzee community.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.180
So, we look in the valleys, we see

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.990
evergreen forest, which looks like this.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.420
It's a continuous canopy, tall trees.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.700
It's really costly for
an individual to hunt.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.972
Lots of energy is going to be
spent climbing and chasing,

00:16:50.972 --> 00:16:52.960
and it's easier for monkeys to escape,

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.340
so hunts might take longer

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.910
and be less likely to succeed.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.492
On the ridges, we see woodland habitat,

00:17:00.492 --> 00:17:04.310
which are characterized by short trees

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.580
that are widely spaced, so it's easy

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:10.300
to trap monkeys in one single tree.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.090
Less energy spent catching them.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.350
And, as we expect from that,

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.652
we see that forest structure does indeed

00:17:17.652 --> 00:17:21.088
have an effect on both the
probability of hunting,

00:17:21.088 --> 00:17:26.088
in the darker maroon bars,
both at Ngogo and at Gombe,

00:17:27.938 --> 00:17:30.950
and also affects the probability

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.040
that a hunt succeeds as well.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.799
Finally, overall diet quality

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:43.290
affects whether or not chimpanzees

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.660
will take on the risk of hunting.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.577
So for example, Richard
and I showed at Kanyawara,

00:17:48.577 --> 00:17:51.130
that hunting is more frequent

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:56.130
during periods when overall
high quality fruit is available.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.025
And this result here isn't just because

00:18:00.025 --> 00:18:05.025
high quality fruit enables the
formation of large parties,

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.530
as it does at Gombe and at Ngogo,

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.420
but once you take that into account,

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:15.420
we found that the probability
of a hunt occurring

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.910
was simply higher after
controlling for group size

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.120
during times when there was
high quality fruit available.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.659
So a party of six males,
you can see there,

00:18:25.659 --> 00:18:28.283
hunts twice as often as a party,

00:18:28.283 --> 00:18:31.813
a party of six males in
high quality fruit seasons

00:18:31.813 --> 00:18:35.820
hunts twice as often
as a party of six males

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.510
in low quality fruit seasons.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:39.650
We've argued that this is because

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.230
the costs of a failed hunt are lower

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.890
when there is high quality
food to fall back on.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.270
So to conclude, there is considerable

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:53.105
variation in hunting frequency
within and between sites.

00:18:53.105 --> 00:18:56.360
And this is because hunting frequency

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.328
is affected by many ecological factors

00:18:59.328 --> 00:19:01.465
having to do with the prey,

00:19:01.465 --> 00:19:04.832
having to do with the predators,

00:19:04.832 --> 00:19:08.350
and the ecology of the site.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:12.099
So, if we agree that
it's logical to conclude

00:19:12.099 --> 00:19:14.430
that the last common ancestor

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.470
was faced with similar
ecological pressures,

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.760
and would therefore have
exhibited similar patterns,

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.440
how then do we explain the increase

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.635
in hunting in the hominin lineage?

00:19:26.635 --> 00:19:28.957
So I suggest that the first step

00:19:28.957 --> 00:19:31.117
might have been an increase

00:19:31.117 --> 00:19:34.550
in low-cost opportunities to capture prey,

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.310
which could likely come as a
combination of many factors,

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.962
but I would argue that
certainly prey availability

00:19:40.962 --> 00:19:44.720
and habitat were key factors.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720
Thank you very much.
