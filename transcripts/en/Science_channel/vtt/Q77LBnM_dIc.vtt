00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:08.041
Narrator: BAKLAVA, A SWEET TREAT
FROM THE MIDDLE EAST

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:12.445
MADE FROM PASTRY,
SYRUP, AND NUTS.

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.747
FIVE CENTURIES AGO, AS TODAY,

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:18.051
THE FIRST JOB OF THE DAY
IS TO PRODUCE THE DOUGH.

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:22.121
WHEAT FLOUR, WATER,
EGG, SALT,

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:23.556
AND A GLUG OF OLIVE OIL

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:26.292
ARE CHURNED TOGETHER
IN PRECISE AMOUNTS.

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:32.098
ONCE IT'S MIXED,
THE FINISHED DOUGH

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:35.701
IS CARVED UP
AND ROLLED INTO BALLS.

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:38.371
BUT THE BAKLAVA DOUGH
SHOULD BE SO FINE,

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.906
IT'S TRANSPARENT.

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.941
AND THESE LUMPS
CLEARLY AREN'T.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.210
SO FIRST, THEY'RE FED
INTO A ROLLING MACHINE

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.081
TO BE FLATTENED AND STRETCHED
TILL THEY'RE 33 FEET LONG.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:55.754
THE FLATTENED DOUGH IS THIN
BUT NOT THIN ENOUGH.

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:57.690
SO COMPANY OWNER
NADIR GULLU

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.959
AND HIS TEAM GO TO WORK
WITH ROLLING PINS

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.462
OF HARD PEAR
OR HORNBEAM WOOD

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:04.397
AND PLENTY OF ELBOW GREASE.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.574
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT
MUSCLE POWER.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:18.144
THE UNPOLISHED MARBLE TABLES
ALSO GRIP THE DOUGH.

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:34.160
SHEETS OF DOUGH ARE LAYERED
ON TOP OF EACH OTHER,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.828
10 TO A PIN.

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:38.164
TO STOP THEM FROM STICKING,
THE FACTORY

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:42.368
GOES THROUGH OVER 550 POUNDS
OF STARCH A DAY.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:44.737
THE STARCH ALLOWS THEM
TO PEEL THE LAYERS APART

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:47.240
TO REWORK THE DOUGH.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.409
TURNING LEAVES OF PHYLLO
INTO BEAUTIFUL BAKLAVA

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.612
IS A MANY-LAYERED,
MULTI-CHEF RELAY RACE.

00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:55.181
NADIR'S SON, MURAT,

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:58.485
STARTS THE PROCESS
WITH LAYERS OF GOSSAMER PASTRY.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:05.525
MEANWHILE, THE RESIDENT
NUTCRACKER GRINDS PISTACHIOS.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.167
A SHARP BLADE CHOPS,
RATHER THAN CRUSHES, THE NUTS,

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:16.935
PRESERVING
THEIR NATURAL OILS,

00:02:16.935 --> 00:02:18.771
SO THEY REMAIN
FULL OF FLAVOR.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.645
MURAT GOES NUTS
WITH A LAYER OF PISTACHIOS.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:29.182
THEN THESE ARE COVERED
BY ANOTHER 20 SHEETS OF PASTRY.

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:33.085
TO MAKE ONE TRAY
OF BAKLAVA,

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:36.355
IT TAKES AT LEAST 3 HOURS.

00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:38.391
AND YOU NEED
AT LEAST 10 PEOPLE.

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:40.726
Narrator:
A SOAKING OF MELTED BUTTER

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:44.196
AND THEN IT'S INTO
A 329-DEGREE-FAHRENHEIT OVEN

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:45.965
FOR 45 MINUTES,

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:49.168
GIVE OR TAKE
A CRUCIAL 60 SECONDS.

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:53.105
44, 45
OR MAYBE 46 MINUTES LATER,

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:56.108
THE BATCH IS DRENCHED
IN BOILING SUGAR SYRUP.

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:57.610
AND IT'S READY TO EAT.
