00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.891
- Welcome back from
the break, everybody.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.840
We're going to proceed
with our final panel

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.780
now, a panel on
citizenship on the move.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.050
And may I ask the panel
members to come up to the stage

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.480
and take their seats while I
have the honor of introducing

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.880
Professor Jacqueline Bhabha.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.310
Professor Jacqueline
Bhabha is the director

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.540
of research at the Harvard FXB
Center for Health and Human

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.810
Rights, a professor of
the practice of health

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.690
and human rights at the
Harvard T.H. Chan School

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.930
of Public Health, and
also an adjunct lecturer

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.188
in public policy at the
Harvard Kennedy School.

00:00:46.188 --> 00:00:48.480
Before coming to Harvard,
she directed the Human Rights

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.790
Program at the
University of Chicago

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.280
and was a practicing human
rights lawyer in London

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.390
at the European Court of
Human Rights in Strasbourg.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.410
She's published extensively on
issues of transnational child

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.560
migration, refugee
protection, children's rights,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.000
and citizenship.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.390
Most recently, she is the author
of Can We Solve the Migration

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.340
Crisis? and Child Migration and
Human Rights in a Global Age.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.500
She will be
moderating this panel.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.120
Professor Bhabha,
thank you very much.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.060
- Thank you.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.980
So thank you all so much
for still being here.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.100
You must pity us.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.670
A rather daunting task, first
of all, to be the last panel.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.750
And secondly, to be the last
panel after the keynote speech

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.500
we've just had.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.550
So please bear with us.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.992
We'll do our very best to
be stimulating and engaging.

00:01:45.992 --> 00:01:48.200
So I'm going to make a couple
of introductory remarks

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.850
before I briefly introduce
our three panelists.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.520
This conference, I
think-- our panel

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.580
is entitled "Citizenship
on the Move."

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.890
And I think this
conference has already

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.920
demonstrated very clearly how
citizenship is on the move,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.420
if you like.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.320
Moving between assimilating
native peoples on the one

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.350
hand, peoples who want to
preserve their nationhood,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.570
and excluding
Puerto Ricans-- who

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.700
are citizens-- on the other.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.790
Choking out citizens'
labor rights,

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.060
imposing reductive physical
tests of belonging on tribes.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.020
So all these different types
of movement that citizenship

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.980
is engaged in.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.420
So we've come a long way
from the early discussions

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.910
of citizenship
that T.H. Marshall,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.250
the famous British
sociologist who

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.170
wrote first, very
comprehensively,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.820
about citizenship from
the issues he addressed.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.990
He said that citizenship really
consisted of three elements--

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.220
civil, political, and
social citizenship.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.790
And he said civil and political
citizenship were really one

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.218
in the 18th and 19th centuries.

00:02:58.218 --> 00:02:59.760
And they were a
product, if you like,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.380
of the Euro-American
political transformations

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.430
in state governance.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.560
And that social
citizenship was a product

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.940
of the post-war period
of kind of welfarism.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.760
And so he saw these three
elements of citizenship

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.710
as kind of capturing
some of what

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.920
we think of now as
fundamental human rights.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.720
So political citizenship
is about, for example,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.830
the right to vote--

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.290
a right that Puerto Ricans,
as we've just heard,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.750
don't really have.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.810
Civil citizenship
is about issues

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.390
such as freedom of speech.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.810
And then social citizenship
is about social rights

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.620
such as the right to education
or to social insurance.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.340
Now, two of Marshall's
constitutive elements

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.860
of citizenship are
actually no longer confined

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.910
to citizens at all.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.120
They aren't constitutive
of citizenship.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.430
So if you think of the
right to free speech,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.350
it actually is a human right
that belongs to everyone.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.110
Whether you're a
citizen or noncitizen,

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.080
whether you're documented
or undocumented,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.160
it's a fundamental human right.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.550
And similarly, in many
countries, including this one,

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.150
the right to education
and other social rights

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.610
also belong to non-citizens.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.440
Some, like the
right to education--

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.089
to primary education--

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:24.890
belong to any child who is in
the jurisdiction, irrespective

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.590
of their legal status.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.220
Some, like social
insurance, belong to people

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.350
who have legal residence.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.500
So a green card or some
form of permanent residence.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.440
So citizenship, what we
think of as the core element

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.110
of citizenship, has also
moved in that sense--

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.960
that non-citizens,
residents, for example,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.880
have many of the core
rights of citizenship.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.060
And so I think this is a
very positive transformation.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.880
I think the fact that
these constitutive elements

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.930
of citizenship have become
more broadly accessible

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.730
is a very positive move.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.460
And it's now really
only political rights--

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.320
the right to vote--

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.530
that are jealously
guarded by citizens.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.980
And even here, there
are some exceptions.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.920
Now, as others
have said actually

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.360
in the course of this
wonderful conference,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.280
this transformation
in citizenship--

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.780
in the landscape
of citizenship--

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.610
didn't happen as Marshall
suggested, somehow cumulatively

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.610
and progressively as a
kind of a force of nature.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.970
It's a product of
contestation, of course.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.390
Contestation on the streets,
contestation in parliament,

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.170
contestation in the courts.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.920
Contestation about what
it means to be human

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.160
and about what the import
of these key human rights

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.480
principles--

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.525
such as non-discrimination--
should be, in terms of access

00:05:50.525 --> 00:05:51.275
to these measures.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.570
And so it's a happy thing
that citizenship has generally

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.220
been on the move.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.820
But today, we see the
concept of citizenship,

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.280
I think, being on the move in a
much less inspiring direction.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.020
Consider-- and I'm
going to just give you

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.610
a couple of
international examples.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.370
Today, much of our discussion
has been focused on the US.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.850
But consider the mobilization
of citizenship in India,

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.820
to privilege Hindu
beliefs and customs,

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.690
and this dreadful development
now around cow slaughter

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.760
that you may have
been following.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.820
Consider the distortion of
the notion of citizenship

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.750
in Hungary to elevate
Christian beliefs and mores

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.360
over any other form
of European belonging,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.500
even casting mosques as
somehow non-European.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.390
And of course, closer
to home, consider

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.320
the current US administration's
willful obliteration

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.850
of the complex and multifaceted
history of the construction

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.890
of American citizenship
in his comments

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.990
about who are the
Americans that are supposed

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.120
to be becoming great again.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.390
So citizenship discussions
have become, now,

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.920
a site for militant
exclusionary processes, which

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.440
they hadn't been, I
think, for some decades.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.570
So we have a marvelous array of
panelists in this final session

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.385
to address these
unrelated issues.

00:07:15.385 --> 00:07:18.520
And I'm going to
just give very brief

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.950
thumbnail biographical
sketches, because we all

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.380
have the booklet.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.060
So our first speaker is Theresa
McCarthy, Onondaga Beaver Clan

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.690
of Six Nations of the Grand
River territory in Ontario

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.390
and an associate professor
of Native American studies

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.310
at the University of Buffalo.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.950
She, I think, is going to
be a perfect person for us

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.550
to hear from in relation
to North American

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.580
citizenship and its moving
landscape and histories

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.770
and legacies.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.950
Our second speaker
is Alexandra Stern,

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.820
who is a historian and an expert
on genetics in the Americas--

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.250
interesting and
unusual combination.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.230
She is a professor
of American culture

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.870
and women's studies at
the University of Michigan

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:06.040
and an expert on the history
of eugenic sterilization.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.780
She's actually
engaged in efforts

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.110
to address compulsory
sterilization, a very

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.825
live issue in many parts of
the world, not only in the US.

00:08:14.825 --> 00:08:16.450
And I think, given
the discussion we've

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.730
been having about blood
proportions and blood count,

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.480
it's very interesting,
I think, to pick up

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:28.660
some of those conversations
about body and control of body

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.130
perhaps with this light.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.330
And finally, last but of course
not least, Lyndsey Stonebridge,

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.049
who takes us across the
Atlantic to the EU and beyond.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:40.659
She is a professor
of the humanities

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:43.360
and human rights at
University of Birmingham

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.840
and has worked on the
history of and responses

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.810
to violence, right
from Nuremberg

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.350
through to contemporary
refugee-related crises.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.050
So she has a very
wide and very original

00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:00.970
way of thinking about some of
the most egregious violations

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.020
in human history.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.480
So please join me in welcoming
these three great panelists.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:26.910
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Theresa
McCarthy [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.130
So I just said, hello.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.010
My indigenous name is [? Aida ?]
[? Ahta ?] and it means she

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.220
dries the clay.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.170
I'm Theresa McCarthy.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.810
I'm Onondaga Nation Beaver Clan.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.270
And I'm grateful to be here with
you all today to share ideas

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.400
and to learn from
each other here

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.190
on the territory of the
Wampanoag and Massachusett

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.660
people.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.420
Now, my comments today emphasize
how indigenous citizenship

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.150
further unsettles notions of
citizenship in settler nation

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.200
states.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.120
I am interested in
talking about expressions

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.730
of indigenous citizenship that
transcend the nation state

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.950
borders imposed on
our homelands and that

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.160
exceed the current boundaries
over reservation territories.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.170
My research foregrounds
Haudenosaunee women's

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.970
assertions of
citizenship through

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.013
the political
theorizing and action.

00:10:08.013 --> 00:10:09.930
This is seen through the
work that our people,

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.210
and particularly
our women, engage in

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.970
to defy the extinguishment
of our territorial rights,

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.790
our political subjugation, the
eradication of our cultures

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.490
and languages, and our
compulsory enfranchisement

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.235
into the nation states
of the US and Canada.

00:10:24.235 --> 00:10:25.860
Given my training as
an anthropologist,

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.390
another related
interest of mine is

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.230
on how historic academic work,
particularly 20th-century

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.270
scholarship on my
people, has served

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.790
to reinforce the
extinguishment of our rights.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.470
Legions of
non-indigenous experts

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.180
who made long careers
of studying us

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.010
referred to us as the Iroquois.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.260
And we remain the most
anthropologized indigenous

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.880
people in North America.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.500
But we call ourselves
Haudenosaunee,

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.540
which means "they
build the house,"

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.460
in reference to our nations
coming together as one.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.000
The Haudenosaunee are comprised
of six nations, the Mohawk,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.830
Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga,
Seneca, and Tuscarora.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.200
We came together to become
a confederacy of nations,

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.187
the Haudenosaunee
Confederacy, in accordance

00:11:04.187 --> 00:11:06.270
with the central teaching
of our cultural history,

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:10.050
the Gayanashagowa, or
the Great Law of Peace.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.790
And it's from the
Gayanashagowa that we

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.980
derive our structure
of political leadership

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.060
and governance.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.700
Our Confederacy remains
in operation today

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.310
as the oldest continuing
living participatory

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.242
democracy in the world.

00:11:22.242 --> 00:11:23.700
The fact that, as
Haudenosaunee, we

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.860
remain a separate and distinct
political entity from Canada

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.160
and the United States, that
we have never surrendered

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.057
or relinquished our sovereignty,
that our historical presence,

00:11:32.057 --> 00:11:34.140
and that our Confederacy
governance structure long

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.200
predates other nation state
formations on our territories,

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.810
are just some of the ways that
we unsettle normative thinking

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.280
about citizenship.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.530
Our people remain adamant
that being enfolded

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.010
into US and Canadian citizenship
jeopardizes our sovereignty

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:48.720
and undermines our treaties.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.222
It advances colonialism and,
in turn, our disappearance.

00:11:52.222 --> 00:11:54.180
Since border crossing is
a theme of this panel,

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.880
I want to push our thinking
about borders further today.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.230
The Haudenosaunee are a
border-crossed people.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.870
The Canada and US
international border

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.180
bisects our homelands, meaning
that our peoples rights

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.430
to declare who we
are and move freely

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.070
on our ancestral territories
are constantly challenged

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.690
by foreign governments.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.510
These borders are not supposed
to exist for the Haudenosaunee.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.220
They have no basis
in our cosmologies,

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.740
and they were never meant to
inhibit our freedom of movement

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.870
according to historic treaties.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.580
But these provisions
are rarely upheld,

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.830
because they aren't
widely understood.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.040
It's rare to find border
guards, customs agents, or even

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.980
immigration lawyers, who
know anything about them.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.540
This ignorance
results in a myriad

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.370
of consequences for our people.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.650
Delay, detainment,
denial of entry,

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:38.090
deportation, and historically,
even incarceration.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.600
Our additional laws
and legislation

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.180
in Canada and the US further
strangulate these rights,

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.850
so that something that is
not supposed to exist--

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.910
this settler-colonial construct,
this figment of the colonial

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.080
imagination--

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.390
has very real political
and legal consequences

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.250
for our people.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.950
Now, to briefly
illustrate, here is a map.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:57.510
It's not perfectly
to scale, but it

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.070
outlines our
traditional territories

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.440
and locates our
contemporary settlements,

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.950
and shows the Canada-US border
cutting through our homelands.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.590
In the Northeastern region, it
runs through Akwesasne Mohawk

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:11.250
territory, meaning that border
crossing is a daily experience

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.130
for them, as is grappling with
the distinct jurisdictions

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.660
of Ontario and New
York State, which

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.700
also bisects their territory.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.590
And although this
complexity is concentrated

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.390
in just one place
in a particular way,

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.970
this reality is something
which all Haudenosaunee

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.340
as border-crossed
people must contend.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.910
When I look at this map, I see
a legal and political minefield

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.950
of an enormous magnitude
that has literally

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.050
ripped our people apart.

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.390
Thinking just in terms of
the implications arising

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.180
from Canadian and US
Indian policy alone--

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.170
this endless
enormous bureaucracy

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:43.287
of legal imposition.

00:13:43.287 --> 00:13:45.120
The Bureau of Indian
Affairs, the Department

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.400
of Indian Affairs, the Indian
Act, colonial band councils,

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.040
IRA governments, all of it.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.037
Right?

00:13:51.037 --> 00:13:52.620
And the depth of
this impact that it's

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.140
had for over a century
on our people--

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.300
close to two centuries--
constantly undermining

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.090
who we are, our connections to
each other, and our homelands.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.810
It's just astounding.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.860
And this is why, in my work,
I expend a lot of energy

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.720
taking non-indigenous
scholars to task

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.760
who studied our
people for the ways

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.830
that they discredit our
contemporary political

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.680
assertions, by
scrutinizing the complexity

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.900
of our colonial entanglements
as evidence of our disarray

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.120
and decline.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.490
In particular, I look at
the pathologizing narrative

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.200
of Iroquois
factionalism-- this idea

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.900
that we're constantly in
conflict and infighting that's

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.720
meant to maintain colonial
hierarchies while remaining

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.870
unaccountable to land theft
or to institutional structures

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.600
intended to eliminate
indigenous people.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.970
For the Haudenosaunee,
settler nation state borders,

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.900
like the northern Canada-US
international borders,

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.370
are ongoing sites of
colonialism, imperialism,

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.310
and empire, where our histories,
our distinct political

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.980
identities, and our
relationships to our homelands

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.713
are erased and invisible.

00:14:49.713 --> 00:14:51.130
But these are not
the only borders

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.710
through indigenous
territories where this occurs.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.470
As folks who do critical
border studies tell us,

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.260
borders are multiple
and movable sites

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.920
existing beyond the established
physical structures and spaces

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.248
where the edges of
nation states meet.

00:15:05.248 --> 00:15:07.540
With this in mind, it's
important to think about nation

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.700
state border-making
practices involving

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.740
development and
corporate resource

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.980
extraction on indigenous lands.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.480
So that this is a border.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.520
This is a slide on
[INAUDIBLE] territory

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.680
militarized law enforcement
protecting hydro fracking

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.890
operations by a
Texas-based oil company

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.195
in New Brunswick in 2013.

00:15:29.195 --> 00:15:30.070
And this is a border.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.890
This is Cannonball,
North Dakota,

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.320
against the Dakota
Access Pipeline.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.430
This is a border site.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.010
This is the same place,
Cannonball, North Dakota

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.510
against Dakota Access Pipeline.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:45.130
Again, militarized police
protecting Energy Transfer

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.860
Partners.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:48.760
And this is a border.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:54.850
This is the RCMP invasion of
unceded Wet'suwet'en territory

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.590
in northern BC.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.260
Again, coming in to
protect the interests

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:05.345
of putting oil pipeline through
those unceded territories.

00:16:05.345 --> 00:16:06.220
And this is a border.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.678
This is a little
bit harder to see.

00:16:07.678 --> 00:16:09.490
But this is militarized
law enforcement

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.340
at the height of tensions
involving the 2006 reclamation

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.180
of Six Nations lands
at [INAUDIBLE],,

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.680
meaning "the protected
place," which

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.607
is involving my community.

00:16:19.607 --> 00:16:20.440
And this is another.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.260
You can see just in the
background that militarized

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.850
law enforcement there.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.740
So these depictions of
recent settler state

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.720
border-making practices,
which are advancing

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.940
the rights of corporate
and settler state

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.210
citizens on our land, expand
but replicate historic patterns

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.710
of colonial violence.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.650
They elicit massive responses
from indigenous peoples,

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.920
united to stand against this
violence and exploitation.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.360
We can also look
at the indigenous

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.400
front lines that form to
confront and challenge

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.370
these exploitations
as borderlands, where

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.380
we see our people
asserting their citizenship

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.870
and practicing their
sovereignty in the service

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:57.135
not only of ourselves but of
everyone's continued existence.

00:16:57.135 --> 00:16:59.260
Because what's happening
at these border sites with

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.500
hydro-fracking, oil
pipelines, mega development,

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.180
cannot be contained.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.540
Ecological destruction, climate
change, water contamination,

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.970
pollution, they render
all borders meaningless.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.300
So assertions of indigenous
sovereignty and citizenship

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.210
at these sites are invaluable.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.619
I want to turn to
briefly provide

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.359
a frame of reference
for what citizenship

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:21.319
means to Haudenosaunee people.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:26.530
One of the ways I like to
look at Haudenosaunee women's

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:29.620
political theorizing is by
shining a light on our people's

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.270
artistic brilliance.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.820
It is important to highlight
and center this knowledge

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.580
and to know that there
is an invaluable archive

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.130
of information on Haudenosaunee
women's political theory

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.450
out there.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.830
Not all of it is written down.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.370
A lot of it is,
but not all of it.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.220
But there are other
places to look.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.550
So this is Mohawk artist Shelley
Niro's multimedia piece Time

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:49.688
Travels Through Us.

00:17:49.688 --> 00:17:51.730
And just a little bit from
the image description,

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.590
in case it's a little
bit hard to see, and just

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.548
to give you a little bit
of background-- in it,

00:17:55.548 --> 00:17:57.490
Niro presents her mother
and two daughters,

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:59.500
the trio representing
the social, cultural,

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.080
and personal values that have
been transmitted from one

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.790
generation to the next.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:07.720
The turtle, which is Niro's
clan animal, and it's a pendant

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.770
on her necklace and the central
animal of the Haudenosaunee

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.740
creation story, also
figures in the piece.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.960
Now, this piece provides
a beautiful visual

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.670
that encourages
generative thinking

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:20.970
about the centrality of
women and our understandings

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.190
of Haudenosaunee citizenship
and political structure.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.290
As a matrilineal people,
we inherit our clans

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.090
and our nations through
our mothers line.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.040
And women play an
invaluable leadership role

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.630
in our government structure--

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:36.070
selecting, directing, and when
necessary, deposing our Chiefs.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.040
Caretaking of the land is
also invested with the women.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.650
Our clans our extended
kinship structures

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:43.960
that are the building
blocks of our governance.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.710
They orient our structure of
relationality, responsibility,

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.710
and accountability to each
other and to creation.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:52.780
And this is an active
process reinforced

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.180
in the verbal structures
of our language, which

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.600
denote the action of being
in relation as something that

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.880
is always ongoing.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.270
And lastly, I just love how
Niro invokes time in this piece.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.490
The importance of
this relationality,

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.700
of honoring life, and of how
these responsibilities move

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.380
through us across
time through past,

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.170
present, and onward
to future generations.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:15.670
OK.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:19.150
This is another important
model for understanding

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.070
the Haudenosaunee Confederacy.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:25.420
This is Mohawk artist
Elizabeth Doxtater's

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.310
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,
which means "it encircles

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.320
everything."

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.060
This is Doxtater's
visual narrative

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.340
of the Great Law of Peace
from which our Confederacy

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.740
governance arises.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.110
Most of our people who
think about the great law

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.900
and of our political system
and how it came to be sort of

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.400
think about it as
an oral narrative,

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.130
because it's mainly communicated
as an oral narrative.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.950
And we don't often encounter
a woman's rendering

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.360
of this teaching.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.880
Doxtater's piece gives us
a three-dimensional sense

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.620
of the magnitude
of representation

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.120
that our people have within
our Confederacy system.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.230
And just a lot of people can't
visualize what it looks like.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.510
Her decision to bring
women to the forefront

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.140
reminds us that the Confederacy
is not just a chief's council

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.840
but, rather, a collective
union of clan families

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.930
that represents all the people.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:14.260
Doxtater also anchors the
Gayanashagowa in the land

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.240
through her use of the
corn husk in this piece.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.640
Because it's all made
out of corn husk dolls.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.830
And she explains that
working with the corn husk

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.020
is quote, "like reaching
back to the time

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.820
of her ancient ancestors.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.770
Corn is still grown
and harvested,

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.840
the husks still
braided, it is still

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.270
ceremonially celebrated
the same as it has

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:33.100
been for thousands of years."

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.240
End quote.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.160
So these two amazing
artistic works

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.180
can also help illuminate how
the use of these status terms

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.530
and concepts like citizen,
nation, and sovereignty, when

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.600
informed by additional
understandings,

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.650
bear little resemblance to
Western legal interpretations.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.930
And as with lots of words
in the English language,

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.630
indigenous people make them
their own, extending them

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.340
so that they are
infected with meaning

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:01.030
derived from our languages
and intellectual traditions.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.640
So one example, for
example, the translation

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.770
of the Mohawk word
for nationality

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:09.260
literally means
"bodies in the land."

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:09.760
OK.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.430
So the Haudenosaunee
have a long history

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:14.410
of asserting and
practicing sovereignty

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.520
in ways that also help others.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.210
And an example that began in
the early 20th century involving

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.860
a Confederacy chief, Deskaheh,
whose name was Levi General--

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.020
his travels from Six
Nations at Grand River

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.540
to the League of Nations
in Geneva, Switzerland

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.260
to petition for recognition
of Haudenosaunee sovereignty

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.780
just as Canada's termination
efforts were really

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.910
bearing down on our community.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.790
His petition did not achieve
its desired outcome at the time,

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.520
and he was punished
for his actions.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.860
When he returned from overseas,
the federal government

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.410
would not allow him
to return to Canada,

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.720
forcing him to remain
in the United States,

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.820
where he died
shortly thereafter.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.410
But his efforts
became a catalyst

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.540
for future generations
of Haudenosaunee people

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.340
who have worked
tirelessly to enable

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.480
what he was trying to accomplish
and to honor his sacrifices.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.450
We can see this today through
Haudenosaunee contributions

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.910
to creating, expanding,
and sustaining

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:14.350
a global regime of human rights
that centers indigenous people.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.960
Closer to home, Deskaheh's
work inspired the formation

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.860
of the Indian Defense League of
America, which since 1926 has

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.340
worked to uphold Haudenosaunee
people's rights to freely cross

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.077
the borders on our homelands.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.070
Back to indigenous women.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.570
OK.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.640
Indigenous women's leadership
is exerted in formidable ways

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.680
at the front lines of our
contemporary struggles

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.870
to protect the lands and waters.

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.090
At these most recent
instantiations

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.350
of nation state borders
on our territories,

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.410
we always see women
at the forefront

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:47.750
as those who are most
compelled to push back

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.760
against the colonial
power that relentlessly

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.010
tries to shape their lives.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:56.000
The architects of our 2006
land reclamation movement

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.750
at Six Nations--

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:01.520
Dawn Smith, who is Onondaga
Eel clan, and Jamie Jamieson,

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.210
who is Mohawk Turtle clan--

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:06.020
were two young
struggling single mothers

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.050
who had already endured
hardships and tragedies that

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:12.530
would break anyone when
they decided to take action.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.090
Neither of them
would have ever said

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:16.760
that they were ever the perfect
embodiment of Haudenosaunee

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:19.310
values, but both of them
saw the consequences

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:23.270
of further encroachment on Six
Nations' land as unbearable.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:27.030
And with, initially, only
a handful of others--

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.210
this is just the
group the first day--

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.950
resolved to put their
bodies on the line.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.040
And as a result, this
was the first time

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.590
in 200 years of Haudenosaunee
history at Grand River

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:39.470
that our people actually managed
to regain rather than lose

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:40.940
our lands.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.920
So what is often
mischaracterized

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.790
as resistance or activism is
really just the doing part

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.800
of Haudenosaunee citizenship--

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.410
declaring our citizenship as
sovereign indigenous nations

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.060
through our action
at these new border

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.045
sites emerging on our lands.

00:23:55.045 --> 00:23:57.170
Understanding that the
purpose of these movements--

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:59.510
to defend land,
to protect water--

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.420
resides in promoting a
future-oriented consciousness

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.110
grounded in doing this
ongoing work to sustain life.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.750
These are the ways that our
people transcend and exceed

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.420
the settler-state borders
imposed on our territories,

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.520
as we always have.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.670
Just to leave with
some parting thoughts--

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:20.960
we encounter a lot of
pessimism, fatalism, cynicism

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.180
about our assertions
and movements.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.010
And it's important to
address the pitfalls

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.350
of narrow definitions
of success or failure

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:29.630
in settler-colonial contexts.

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:31.250
If the successes of
indigenous efforts

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.280
are narrowly defined by
the outcome of dismantling

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.950
entire settler-colonial
structures,

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:39.140
then it is unlikely that
successes could ever

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.460
be countered.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.800
It's better to think about
how these movements succeed

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.507
despite these structures.

00:24:44.507 --> 00:24:47.090
It's better to think about how
settler-colonial structures are

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.090
continually undermined by
the way in which our people

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.250
maintain commitments
to who we are

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.800
and to our relational
responsibilities.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.170
And it is better to think
about how these understandings

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.500
continue to thrive, to guide
the politics of the present,

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.750
and to inspire greater
numbers of people

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.180
to see themselves in this light.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.660
These are the victories that
are important to hang on to,

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.580
because these are the
victories that are going

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.360
to continue to move us forward.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:12.860
Thank you.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:19.256
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.830
- I think as a sort of antidote,
sort of way through some of it,

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:34.080
I just want to
start by going back

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.900
to Teresa's last
slide, which had

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.050
a sign on it that
read, "refugees

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:44.780
welcome on native land."

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.730
And I think it's a mark
of the thoughtfulness

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:51.000
of this conference that a
conference on citizenship

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.990
decided to end with refugees,
i.e. the category of people

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:59.070
that many people think of as
being outside of citizenship.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.020
And it's a deep and
unusual thoughtfulness

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.520
and I congratulate
the organizers

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.282
for how you've curated it.

00:26:05.282 --> 00:26:06.990
It's kind of thoughtfulness
that we don't

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:09.820
see very much of at the moment.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.320
And I think what
I've learned today,

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.290
and why I want to put those
two things together a bit,

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.360
is if you really want
to understand something

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:21.130
about the value of citizenship,
and what it means today,

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:22.630
we need to listen
to people who live

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:26.500
in the shadows of citizenship.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.140
Because they know more--

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.493
they are the experts
on citizenship.

00:26:31.493 --> 00:26:33.160
And that also provokes
another question,

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.710
which is what kind
of solidarities

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.260
can there be between
the people who live

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.065
in the shadows of citizenship?

00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:42.190
And that's something, as
I've been listening today,

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.940
has come up again and again.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.680
And that question of
solidarity, it seems to me,

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.870
is vitally important
for exactly the reasons

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.750
that Alexandra has just
explained to us, that it's

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.660
getting very, very dire.

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.300
In terms of refugees and
the question of citizenship,

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.690
what we have in my part of the
world in Europe and the country

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.840
I currently live in, the
UK, is a renewed appetite

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.530
for racialized de-citizenship--
de-citizenizing people

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:13.372
which we haven't seen in
Europe since the 20th century.

00:27:13.372 --> 00:27:14.830
And the other reason
I think I want

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.330
to stick with that question of
solidarity or come back to it

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.500
towards the end is
that, again, we've

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.680
heard a question about what
kind of global citizenship

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.040
might we imagine today.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.620
And what kind of global activism
might we try and re-imagine

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.430
today?

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:34.390
So my starting
point for my remarks

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:37.270
today are a quotation from
the historian Michael Barnett.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:41.943
And this is from his study
of the United Nations' High

00:27:41.943 --> 00:27:43.360
Commission for
Refugees, which was

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.180
established after the
war in the last century.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:49.270
And he says, "Only a world
of sovereign states that had

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:52.060
categories of people called
'citizens' and were intent

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:56.320
on regulating population flows
could produce a legal category

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.880
of 'refugees.'"

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:02.470
So only the idea of a nation
state that has citizens

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:04.330
produces a category of refugees.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.000
We have to think
the two together.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.190
The one is the
other of the other.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:11.510
Two case studies-- I'm
drawing on two case studies.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:15.460
One is a project I finished last
year called "placeless people,"

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.430
which was just a literary and
intellectual history of how

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:20.800
the category of refugees
and statelessness

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.370
emerged in the last century, in
the middle of the 20th century.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.800
And a key figure in my
thinking there and for today

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.010
was Hannah Arendt.

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.700
And what you have
here on your left

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:35.300
is Arendt's document
in lieu of a passport.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.333
We've had loads of
citizenship documents today.

00:28:37.333 --> 00:28:38.750
I want to gather
them all together

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.780
and put them in one place.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:44.410
This is a document that
doesn't give citizenship.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:46.510
It is a document that
testifies to statelessness.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:47.632
And that's Arendt.

00:28:47.632 --> 00:28:49.840
And you can see, that took
quite a lot of explaining.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.330
If you think of our
digital coding of passports

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.650
and identity today.

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.600
This is quite [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.860
The other project is recent.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.890
It's a project called
"refugee hosts."

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:02.860
And it's a project on
South-South Humanitarianism.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:06.610
And refugee-refugee solidarity
in the global south,

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:09.760
particularly in the context
of hosting of Syrian refugees

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.790
in Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:16.300
And as you all know I'm
sure, the most refugees

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.210
in the world today are being
hosted in other global south

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:20.040
countries.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.540
You know, the idea of everyone
coming up to the global north

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:27.920
from across is a very minor
part of the global story.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.530
And the second
slide I have here,

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:33.430
I found in the women's
bathroom of St. Joseph's

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:36.190
University in Beirut's
politics department.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.080
This is the women's bathroom.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.520
Jackie said I have an
unusual way through things,

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.990
like collecting
bathroom graffiti.

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:46.745
And in the women's
bathroom, that sign up there

00:29:46.745 --> 00:29:48.370
says-- it's a classic--
you know, leave

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.470
the bathroom in the state
you'd like to find it.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.430
And one of the woman
scholars has written,

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:55.777
no, leave the state in the
toilet where you found it.

00:29:55.777 --> 00:29:57.610
And another scholar has
come along and said,

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:01.060
no, leave the nation state in
the toilet where you found it.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.327
I'll come back to that point.

00:30:02.327 --> 00:30:03.910
And I think my
argument is going to be

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:06.310
that the placeless
condition that Arendt

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:09.880
and others diagnosed and
lived in the last century

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.980
was disavowed in the
years that followed.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.990
And it was disavowed
by a kind of emergence

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:17.500
of a global humanitarianism
that has failed.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.710
And it continues to fail.

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:23.200
But that failure is
producing new articulations

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.960
of global citizenship
and humanitarianism

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.370
elsewhere in the world.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:28.870
OK.

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:32.020
So citizenship is the
universal mark of belonging.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.490
We've seen that today.

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.920
But it is also, as
Arendt rant argued,

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.400
a mask that we put on
in order to be legally,

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.330
politically, culturally,
and socially visible.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.060
Now, as many
[INAUDIBLE] generation

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.330
of European Jewish refugees
discovered in the last century,

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:51.880
to cross the border, to
be pushed across a border,

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.910
was to experience the
mask of citizenship fall

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.350
from your face.

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:59.230
Quote, "On the day I lost
my Austrian passport,"

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.690
wrote Stefan Zweig,
"I discovered

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.970
that when you lose
your native land,

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:06.310
you are losing more than
a patch of territory

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.370
within set borders."

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.780
Zweig's desolation was absolute.

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.470
The mask fell, the man stumbled,
reached out to retrieve it,

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:18.280
and found his hand
clutching into air.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.460
Now, Arendt was impatient
was Zweig's objection.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.350
She thought he was
naive to expect

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:27.220
that the world would be pleased
to see the man behind the mask.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.890
Quote, "Everywhere
the word 'exile'

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.410
which once had an
undertone of sacred awe,"

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:36.160
she wrote, stateless
herself in 1944, "now

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.620
provokes the idea of
something simultaneously

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:42.220
suspicious and unfortunate."

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.050
So now provokes the
idea of something

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:46.330
suspicious and unfortunate.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:49.210
Exile, in other words, had
ceased to become awesome

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:52.750
once identity became associated
with the modern nation

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.810
state and the movement
of peoples administered,

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:57.710
regulated, and controlled.

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:00.550
Hence Barnett's point
about citizens and refugees

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:03.400
being two sides
of the same coin.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.160
Now, Arendt's analysis
of what de-citizenship

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.790
meant for her generation of
refugees is now well known.

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:11.950
The world found nothing
sacred, she said,

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:15.220
in the abstract
nakedness of being human.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.980
18th-century ideals of
universal citizenship,

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:21.760
which we've already heard were
already problematic, finally

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:26.230
bit the dust when, engulfed
by nationalism and racism,

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:29.170
the European state began
to decide who was a citizen

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:31.990
and who was not, leaving
hundreds of thousands

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:36.340
to the sovereign and arbitrary
decisions of other nations.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.860
Awesome exile had been
replaced by a more

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:42.930
piteous and suspicious
placeless condition.

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.040
But the placeless
condition did not only

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.860
belong to refugees
and the stateless.

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.500
Existentially,
politically, legally,

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:54.760
placelessness also affected
and affected the supposedly

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.160
securely domiciled.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.710
In quote, "their
complete dependence

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:00.920
on the compassion of others."

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.587
You don't have anything
else to rely on.

00:33:02.587 --> 00:33:05.410
Not a politic, not a civic
society, not a social,

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:06.340
not a culture.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.670
You are completely dependent
on the compassion of others.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:12.310
Arendt wrote again in
'44, "the placeless

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:16.960
create an uncanny impression
of something utterly inhuman."

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.100
This is quite interesting.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.470
Note that what she's saying
is that the dependence

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:26.110
on compassion alone produces the
idea of uncanniness or threat.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:28.930
So Arendt is putting a
question mark on the idea

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:31.390
that simply more compassion
towards refugees,

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:34.840
a call we often hear
today, is what's required.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.630
Importantly, what she was
also doing is anticipating

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:39.460
the moral and
political mess we get

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.100
in when compassion
becomes all that we

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.440
offer the world's refugees.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.510
Now placeless people appear
as uncanny and threatening

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:51.870
because they remind
the securely citizened

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:54.150
of their own vulnerability.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.520
The catch of panic when
you put your passport

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.505
in the wrong pocket.

00:33:57.505 --> 00:33:59.130
The stiffening of
your body when you're

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:02.400
moved into an unexpected
immigration queue.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.950
These feelings find a
tangible correlative

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:07.500
in the figure of the
placeless person.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.179
So that I think what we
call a refugee crisis

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:11.760
are much better
thought of as being

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.270
crisis in the most intimate
feelings and meanings

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.230
of citizenship.

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.239
The two go together.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:22.250
The placeless remind everyone
that we're only wearing a mask.

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:24.060
And I think, going
back to Alex's paper,

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.580
this is why the mirror to
the pathos as the merely

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.730
human face of the refugee
is the armored mask

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:32.239
of ideological hate.

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:35.719
When he wanted an image of
the inhumanity of totalitarian

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:38.840
nationalism in
1984, George Orwell

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.270
chose to describe a
boat of refugees being

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.679
bombed in the Mediterranean.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:45.110
This is '44 or '47.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:47.150
Winston Smith
records in his diary

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:50.739
how the audience
was much amused.

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:52.554
Now, naked
ideological aggression

00:34:52.554 --> 00:34:54.429
as Alex has just shown
us and as we all know,

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:56.770
is now back in vogue.

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:58.420
And this weaponizing
of suspicion,

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:01.840
however, is not only an
anomaly in the history

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.500
that Jacqui mentioned of a
benign liberal humanitarianism.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.400
I think it's kind
of its evil twin.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.900
Postwar, the global
vulnerability

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.450
signaled by refugees
and the placeless

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:15.850
was displaced onto
the vulnerability

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:18.340
of the placeless themselves.

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.380
The fantasy of
citizenship, to go back

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:24.160
to Michael Barnett's quote,
fortified and protected itself,

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.500
and with it the idea of
national sovereignty,

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.500
by projecting that
vulnerability onto those

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.110
who continue to be
forced on the move,

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:35.650
particularly, and mostly
in the global south.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:37.690
Everyone may be vulnerable.

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:40.180
But henceforth, the
category of the refugee

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.720
will carry that vulnerability
with her as, so to speak,

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.670
extra baggage.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:47.340
Now as the issue
of placelessness

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:51.090
moved through a developing
global human rights regime,

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:55.380
those uncanny feelings Arendt
noted became institutionalized.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.620
As she among others, including
the very controversial refugee

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.370
advocate and American
journalist Dorothy Thompson--

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:03.180
as they all predicted,
the more the world

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:06.300
became globalized, the more
the major states cooperated

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.700
to keep their power and
wealth, the more people

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.160
will be thrown into an
existence where they only had

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.180
their humanity to bargain with.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.850
It didn't, of course,
start out that way.

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:19.850
Human rights, in [INAUDIBLE]
memorable, beautifully

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:22.850
ambitious formulation,
should have, could have,

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:26.000
transformed what he called
objects of compassion

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.130
into subjects of
international rights.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:30.200
That was [INAUDIBLE]
ambition, is to turn--

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.790
no more objects of compassion.

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:34.700
Everyone needs to be a subject
of international right.

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.950
[INAUDIBLE] was dismayed--
in fact, he was furious--

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:38.480
when the drafters
of the Universal

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.780
Declaration of Human Rights
weakened asylum rights

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:43.720
in article 14.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.500
Now the Refugee
Convention, which

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.980
followed in 1951, and
still operative today--

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:52.160
it's important to remember-- was
designed not to give refugees

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.770
rights but to keep citizens
of sovereign states

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:57.980
secure by establishing a
system of burden-sharing

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.450
across the world.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.940
[? Elfin ?] Rhys,
a Welsh theologian

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.130
involved with the
Palestinian refugee aid

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:06.350
effort at the time
of the convention

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:08.890
described early drafts of
the convention being like--

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:10.640
and I love this quote--
he said it's like,

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.850
"a menu at an expensive
restaurant with every course

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:17.630
crossed out except the soup,
and a footnote to the effect

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.340
that the soup
might not be served

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.850
in certain circumstances."

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:25.940
Refugees, in other words,
spun further from rights-based

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.635
agency--

00:37:27.635 --> 00:37:31.970
a kind of global citizenship--
and further into compassionate

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:33.540
uncanniness.

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.600
Now, back in 1939,
Dorothy Thompson

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.790
had argued that there
can be no solution,

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:41.180
she said, to the refugee problem
as long as the world is divided

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.370
into absolutely
sovereign states,

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:45.440
anticipating
Barnett's observation

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.530
about the tenacity of the
opposition between citizens

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:50.150
and refugees.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.610
Now since then, of course,
forms of global sovereignty

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:53.570
have changed--

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:56.210
changed a great deal.

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:57.890
But significantly,
the categories

00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:59.990
of the citizen and
the refugee have

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:02.480
remained stubbornly intact.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.200
If anything of late, in Europe,
Australia, and here in the US,

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.220
have become more tenaciously--
we might even say maniacally--

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.950
attached to that opposition.

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:16.550
Now the solution to the
so-called refugee crisis today

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:20.480
cannot, I think, be only more
horrified humanitarianism.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.210
Only because the first
solution to the refugee problem

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:25.250
was already to
humanitarianize it,

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:29.030
to take away rights and push
a humanitarian argument.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.870
This is not about help.

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:34.010
It's another phrase from today
that's ringing in my head.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.960
In the process, the
placeless condition,

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.750
and its real challenges to
thinking about what citizenship

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:41.150
means, were neutralized.

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:42.650
And the opportunity,
which I think

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:45.530
was seen clearly by Arendt's
generation along with any may

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:48.890
others, to think about the
kinds of citizenship that

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:52.100
might be available beyond
national sovereignty was

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:55.220
squandered, was lost.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.500
Which leads me by
way of conclusion

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:01.490
to the kinds of conversations
about citizenship and refugees

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:03.620
that are happening today.

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.290
Not in the global vernacular
of humanitarianism,

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:09.410
human rights aid,
crisis, with what I think

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:12.710
is rather dodgy moral
grammar of uncanny compassion

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:14.690
and its talk of
solutions to problems

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:16.580
that it has caused,
often, indeed,

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:20.430
by its compassionate
humanitarian solution;

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:23.340
but in the women's bathroom of
the politics department of St.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:26.730
Joseph's in Beirut
today, where I

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:29.340
like to think Hannah Arendt
is kind of hanging out

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:32.520
as a friendly ghost as
those women scholars discuss

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.040
the future of citizenship.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.190
Now, Lebanon as you all know,
along with Jordan and Turkey,

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:41.310
is one of the major
hosts of Syrian refugees.

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:43.080
And has long been a
nation whose politics

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.690
have been defined by refugee
history, particularly

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:48.780
Palestinian refugee history.

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.970
Now back in 2010, there
were several different ways

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:53.340
in which it was possible for
Syrians to come to Lebanon

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.960
after the war broke out.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.350
You could register as a refugee
with the United Nations High

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:00.270
Commission for
Refugees, but then you'd

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:02.100
have to agree not to work.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.050
So that's more passive
humanitarianism.

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:05.800
You'd have to agree
to give up that right.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.592
Well, not that you
actually had that right.

00:40:07.592 --> 00:40:09.450
You'd have to agree not
to try and claim it.

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:12.660
If you were rich enough, you
could buy a residency permit

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.000
which would allow you to
work, but you could only

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.760
do that with the sponsorship
of a Lebanese citizen.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.450
So a kind of
adjunct citizenship.

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:22.430
Or you could decide
that your best

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:25.400
bet was to lose your
passport at the border

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.910
and pass like a ghost into
one of the legal and political

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:31.250
twilight communities
of the displaced

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:34.250
and their hosts that are
now a permanent feature not

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:36.380
only in Lebanon and
across the Middle East

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.630
but across the world.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:42.500
Now one such place is
Beddawi in northern Lebanon,

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:47.870
a Palestinian refugee camp
established by UNRWA in 1955

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:50.270
and home now to at
least three generations

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.610
of Palestinian refugees.

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:57.050
Since 2010, Beddawi has
also been host to thousands

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:58.370
fleeing the war in Syria.

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:01.130
And the camp can't move
out because it's only given

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:03.470
so much land, so it's moved up.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:06.020
It is very, very crowded.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.330
In Beddawi, as in
similar communities,

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:10.730
the opposition between
citizens and refugees

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:14.300
is not operative-- not
out of any utopianism,

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.300
but out of history
and sheer necessity.

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:21.200
Survival depends on a mutual
and precarious and, importantly,

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.260
constantly-negotiated
compassion between

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:28.140
different nationalities,
histories, traumas, needs,

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:31.040
desires, and political hopes.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.070
We often talk about
humanitarian crises.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.100
But in Beddawi, as in elsewhere,
it makes much more sense

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:41.400
I think to talk about emergency
or crisis citizenship.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.100
The citizenship
at issue may well

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.940
not depend on the state or,
indeed, the nation state

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:47.480
to define it or keep it safe.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.390
So it might as well be left
in the bathroom for now.

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:52.940
But if we want to get beyond
peer pity and suspicion,

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:54.950
compassion and hate,
I think we would

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:58.220
do well just now to learn
from those who have no choice

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:01.850
but to try out new
modes of being together.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:04.010
With this in mind,
I'd like to end

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:07.690
by quoting from my
refugee hosts collaborator

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:11.110
the Beddawi-born poet
Yousif Mohammed Qasmiyeh

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:14.690
and his beautiful acknowledgment
of what it means to share

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:16.520
the placeless condition.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.300
He writes, "Refugees
ask refugees,

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:25.020
who are we to come to you and
who are you to come to us?

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:26.780
Nobody answers.

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:31.210
Palestinians, Syrians,
Iraqis, Kurds share the camp.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:34.550
The same-different camp,
the camp of a camp.

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:37.100
They have all come to
re-originate the beginning

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.140
with their own hands and feet."

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.112
Thank you.

00:42:40.112 --> 00:42:46.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:52.910
- So thank you all very much.

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:55.010
So these are really
very rich and thought

00:42:55.010 --> 00:43:00.440
provoking contributions
with interesting overlaps

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:04.460
and interesting divergences.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.340
And I really wonder
whether each of you

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.500
might like to ask
each other questions,

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:12.520
because there seems
so much conversation

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.980
sort of between these papers.

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.690
But maybe I'll just
start off by saying

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:19.850
that what I found so
fascinating is that each of you

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:25.760
really problematize and give a
new lens on something that we

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:30.890
see as familiar and
transparent, and actually

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:32.810
make us look at it in
a very different light.

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:36.530
So Theresa I found
your presentation

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:40.850
about the US-Canada border
absolutely extraordinary.

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:43.310
I never thought about
this in all my years

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:47.638
of working on borders and on
militarisation of borders.

00:43:47.638 --> 00:43:49.430
And we always talk
about the militarization

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:50.390
of the southern border.

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:55.940
But what you showed was
really so starkly shocking.

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:58.310
And I don't know if I'm
the only one in this room

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:00.320
to be so shocked, but it is--

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.020
I think you really performed an
extraordinarily useful service

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:11.720
to us by just demonstrating the
kind of violence of the attack

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:17.510
on these actually peace loving
native communities who've

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:20.300
been there forever, and the
imposition of as you rightly

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.880
said this colonial division.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:28.290
So really, my
question to you is,

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:33.390
what remedies might be
the most productive,

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:35.820
given that the law is
certainly not going to deliver?

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:40.830
Because the law actually
instantiates and reifies

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:44.790
part of the problem by
generating this border

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:49.240
and by sort of discrediting
the sense of openness.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:55.290
So what remedies might
be most productive

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:59.970
do you think in challenging this
sort of blatant use of state

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:01.950
violence against
these communities?

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:04.870
So maybe I'll just maybe
pose a few questions.

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:07.620
And then you can
address them or not.

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.620
Just like other
chairs said, you know.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.040
Alex's presentation, sort
of in a different way,

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.470
of course, also extremely
and equally disturbing.

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:23.670
And I just wondered
something very practical.

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:27.390
Like you didn't give us
a sense of scale here.

00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:30.090
You know, are we
talking about tens,

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:34.170
hundreds, thousands, millions
of people who think this way?

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:36.600
You know, occasionally
an event erupts.

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:41.520
You know, what happened
just now in New Zealand,

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.470
where you see the
sort of underbelly

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:48.120
of this sort of
white supremacism

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.570
or ethno-nationalism.

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:54.060
But one is normally not
really following it,

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:55.740
unless you're part
of those sites.

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.880
So it would be very
useful, I think,

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.540
to get a sense from you
of the scale of this.

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.760
I mean, is this a
kind of phantasma?

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.860
Is this just a kind of
deluded kind of paranoid dream

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.960
these people have of
deporting everybody

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.680
who doesn't fit the kind
of white nationalist mode,

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.620
or is this actually a serious
political threat that we should

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:21.960
be really addressing
maybe more than we do?

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:26.190
Or is that a false dichotomy,
are elements of this threat

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:27.592
seeping in different ways?

00:46:27.592 --> 00:46:28.425
But I just wondered.

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:34.950
And Lyndsey, I absolutely
loved your paper.

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:39.360
And I think that what
you say about the kind

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.210
of symbiotic relationship
between refugees and citizens

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:44.040
is actually really
thought provoking

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:47.000
and I haven't thought
about that enough myself.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.390
But I wondered
about what you were

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:54.670
saying at the end about
this kind of question

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:56.500
of new modes of being together.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.230
It sounds so utopian
at a moment where

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:03.550
we are riven by new modes
of not being together

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:05.660
and the impossibility
of being together.

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:08.873
And even in the
context of camps,

00:47:08.873 --> 00:47:10.665
we know that-- and I've
seen this certainly

00:47:10.665 --> 00:47:12.248
at some of the camps
I've been to-- we

00:47:12.248 --> 00:47:16.060
see tremendous rivalries
between Syrians

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:24.340
and Iraqis and Afghans,
born out of dire scarcity

00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:27.220
and the kind of
tensions that arise.

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:31.990
But is this a
serious proposition

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:34.750
you think, politically,
that one might think

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:40.900
of new ways of building
on the common exclusion

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:44.650
from first-class citizenship,
and that this might really

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:47.050
provide a new way
of being together

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:51.580
and of organizing and creating
a kind of political solidarity?

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:54.430
Or is this more a
kind of reflection

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:59.050
on the kind of humanistic
spirit that still manages

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:00.890
to survive despite all else?

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:06.040
So these are just some of my
rather disparate reflections.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.722
But if you'd like to
address them, please do.

00:48:09.722 --> 00:48:11.680
And if you wouldn't like
to, then please don't.

00:48:13.758 --> 00:48:15.300
- Well, do you want
to start, since--

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:15.970
- OK.

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:17.910
It is not at all utopian.

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:19.750
It's, you know, to be
very British about it,

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:21.330
it's bloody awful.

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:24.250
And it's made even more awful
at the moment because of-- going

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:27.370
back to some of the themes
of these invisible borders,

00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:32.320
the Trump decision to cut
funding for UNRWA, now means--

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:36.233
and UNRWA is very important
in Palestinian camps because--

00:48:36.233 --> 00:48:38.400
- Does everybody in the
audience know what UNRWA is?

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:38.860
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:39.250
- Sorry.

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:40.125
- Maybe just explain.

00:48:40.125 --> 00:48:43.270
- So it's-- the United
Nations set up an organization

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:47.780
specifically for Palestinians
to look after them in 1948.

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:48.280
OK?

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:52.000
So that's a humanitarian
aid organization.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.400
And it's been
important insofar it

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.580
offers limited humanitarian
support for people in the camps

00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:59.410
and has done since '48.

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:01.870
So some health care,
a lot of the schools.

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:05.338
And a lot of people who
work for UNWRA are refugees.

00:49:05.338 --> 00:49:06.130
Their Palestinians.

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:09.400
So it's not a kind of, you
know, particularly, only

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.500
paternalistic mode.

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.830
But it's also very important
because UNRWA's existence

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:18.010
says that the world recognizes
the Palestinians are

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:20.770
dispossessed because
they're in need of aid.

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:23.730
So it's political as well.

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:26.460
So the Trump
administration last year

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:29.700
decided to withdraw
funding from UNRWA.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.790
The catastrophic effects
of that are already

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:34.590
being felt in the camp.

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:38.790
So in Beddawi, there's no
antibiotics left already,

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:40.840
and it's only three months in.

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.710
And then schools are closing.

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:46.617
And it was a kind of
political move in terms of aid

00:49:46.617 --> 00:49:48.450
as well, because it's
like saying, actually,

00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:51.040
the world doesn't
recognize that you have

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.050
this thing done to you now.

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:57.700
Because we're dismantling UNRWA.

00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:02.390
So to go back to Jacqui's point,
it's not a utopianism at all.

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:04.660
But I think it goes back
to earlier points that

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:10.080
have been made, that out
of situations of emergency

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:14.840
and survival, there are new
ways of coming in together.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:19.140
And I also do think
that in Europe,

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.850
and I'm sure this is
happening in the US

00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:23.640
as well, because
things are so dreadful,

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.890
there are new solidarities
that happening particularly

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:28.830
with younger activists,
legal activists, people

00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:31.170
who are working in
the Greek islands who

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:33.000
don't have to be there
but they've gone out

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.410
and they've helped.

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:36.900
And they're forging
different definitions

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:39.510
of international
solidarity that are outside

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:41.830
of the postwar consensus.

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:43.980
And we don't know
what those are yet.

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:46.560
I mean, in some ways we're
just glad they're there,

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.810
because they are actually
stopping some people getting

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:50.570
drowned and they are
feeding some people

00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:52.320
and they are providing
minimal conditions.

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:57.000
But that generation of people
are also creating new networks.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.100
So, you know, across
from Palestinians

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:02.100
to Greeks to people
from Sub-Saharan Africa,

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.390
to other refugees.

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:07.800
Across the solidarities between
Central American and South

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:11.100
America, and that kind of global
something, that's all growing.

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:15.060
So that could be, not
utopian, but it's happening.

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:18.100
And new definitions of
citizenship are being born.

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:20.280
We don't know what
they're going to be yet,

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:24.000
but I'm dang glad
they're giving it a go.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:24.617
- Thank you.

00:51:24.617 --> 00:51:25.450
[INAUDIBLE] helpful.

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:26.430
Yeah, Alex.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:29.820
- Yeah, well, the issue of
scale is very important.

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:33.870
And there's very little
research on this,

00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:36.480
in terms of understanding
beliefs of the alt-right

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:39.510
because of its
fairly new emergence

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:41.520
and also because
of the difficulty

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.970
of studying something
that exists for the most

00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:48.780
part in social media, in a
landscape that is ephemeral,

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.790
where there's not
much accountability,

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:53.970
and where we're seeing
a lot of movement

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:57.450
around de-platforming and
suspension of various sites,

00:51:57.450 --> 00:52:00.600
which is a good thing that
these are being recognized

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:01.890
and regulated.

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:06.193
One of the few studies
that was done used--

00:52:06.193 --> 00:52:07.860
let me just make sure
I get this right--

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:12.630
the American national
election survey data in 2016

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:17.760
to look at what percentage
of the white population

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:22.260
concurs with beliefs that are
in sync with white nationalism.

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:25.020
And the researcher
that did this study

00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:27.450
looked at three core beliefs--

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:29.130
a strong sense of
white identity,

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:31.440
a belief in white
solidarity, and a feeling

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.090
of white victimization--

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:36.210
and determined that
based on this sample

00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:40.290
that approximately 6% of
the white population or 11

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:44.160
million white people
agree with those three.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:48.900
However, if you take them
separately, about 30% to 40%

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:51.660
of white people agree with
at least one of those.

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:54.600
And that number of
30% to 40% is actually

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.660
one that's good to keep in
mind because other studies that

00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:01.380
have looked at the rise
of authoritarianism

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:03.720
in Europe and the
propensity to support

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:06.570
authoritarian
leadership seems to find

00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:11.050
a steady rate of around 35%,
particularly of young people.

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:12.960
And this is something
to be aware of-- what

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:17.290
we call the millennial or
the zoomers generation who,

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:19.530
you know, would respond
to questions that

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:21.900
would support authoritarianism.

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:24.120
And this is also
happening in a context

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:29.070
where we have the rise
of national populism,

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:32.970
ethno-nationalism, and a lot
of cross traffic of these ideas

00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:34.980
that are moving from the
alternative-- you know,

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:39.600
alternative for Germany,
to what's happened recently

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.060
with the elections
in the Netherlands,

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.500
to what happened in New Zealand.

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.380
So it's really important to put
it in a transnational context.

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:50.670
My idea is to not--

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:52.620
I don't want to
sensationalize this.

00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:54.300
But we also don't
want to trivialize it.

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:58.470
So in my own work, I'm always
seeking to find that balance.

00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:00.798
- Thank you.

00:54:00.798 --> 00:54:02.290
Theresa?

00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:04.390
- I just have some thoughts--

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:07.390
in terms of what I'm talking
about-- just the extent

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:09.610
to which settler
colonialism itself

00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:13.480
remains so unaddressed in
social justice movements

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.470
and organizing.

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:18.340
That people don't sort of
examine that core, that it just

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:20.050
keeps going on in ways.

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:24.250
People do things in ways
that continue to reify that,

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:25.870
even though they're
sort of seeking

00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:29.770
justice, more inclusion,
better ways of living.

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:33.250
And just that the kinds of
intersections and alliances

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:35.530
that could be built
from interrogating

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:38.860
that more thoroughly.

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:42.250
- It is so interesting, because
in that cross-border context,

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:44.080
you think about third
country nationals,

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:48.730
and whether or not people
could be sent back from Canada

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:49.360
to the US.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.620
Is US a safe country?

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:53.440
I mean, that's the
domain in which I work.

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:56.800
But that's not at all
talking about native peoples.

00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.875
It completely is talking
about refugees or undocumented

00:54:59.875 --> 00:55:01.120
or migrants.

00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:01.858
- Mm-hmm.

00:55:01.858 --> 00:55:04.150
Yeah, and I just think, for
people to even really start

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:06.610
to ask, like, why is our
political difference so

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:07.180
threatening?

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:10.270
I mean, it's important to
us because we have treaties

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:12.430
with the United States
and with Canada.

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:15.640
That also should be important
to Canadians and Americans,

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:19.390
because that's also how
they get their rights.

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:20.980
And, you know, those
relationships--

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:25.390
those nation to nation
relationships-- are vital.

00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:26.730
And they should remain intact.

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:28.270
And there's lots
of, actually, ways

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:31.030
that people could
think about those

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:33.250
and build in the
way in which they

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:36.250
can move to help
other movements,

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:38.830
help other causes and issues.

00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:42.790
I mean, I have rarely seen the
environmental movement sort

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:44.635
of talk about how
indigenous treaties

00:55:44.635 --> 00:55:47.260
and indigenous sovereignty could
be helpful to those movements.

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:49.030
It doesn't necessarily
occur to people

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:51.660
when it can be
incredibly helpful.

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:54.930
And I think with
these more recent--

00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:57.580
what I showed as my
sort of border actions--

00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:00.030
I think people are actually
starting to catch on to that

00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:05.020
and to think about how these
are actual legal political

00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:06.880
relationships that
can be traced.

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.610
And they're not enforced
because there really

00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:13.730
isn't a critical mass now
pushing for that enforcement.

00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:17.518
And so there is so much
potential there, I think.

00:56:17.518 --> 00:56:19.060
Like I said, I want
to talk about how

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:21.700
indigenous citizenship and
sovereignty can actually

00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:24.900
help other people in
other movements as well.

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:25.795
- Thank you.

00:56:25.795 --> 00:56:27.670
Well, thank you for
those very rich comments.

00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:29.420
So we have a few minutes left.

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:33.090
So if we have any questions,
could people please line up

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:35.720
and ask those questions?

00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.120
Thank you.

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:37.620
Yeah.

00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:39.070
Please go ahead.

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:39.570
- Hi.

00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:40.800
My name is Becky Thompson.

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:44.340
I want to appreciate the
panel and this entire day.

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:49.260
I wanted to share a little
bit about refugee solidarity

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:51.840
and then pose a
question as well.

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:56.130
So for those of us who've
been in Greece since 2015,

00:56:56.130 --> 00:56:59.550
and also in Beirut, what
we have been witnessing

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:03.540
is a tremendous amount
of refugee activism.

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:06.690
And that comes, in part,
because of the need for people

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:09.420
to be saving each other's lives.

00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:11.850
So I think, for
example, of people

00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:14.910
waiting in Izmir
in Turkey, wanting

00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:17.130
to come across on the rafts.

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:20.640
And the smugglers are
not saying, excuse me,

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:23.470
the only people on the
rafts can be Syrian.

00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:23.970
Right?

00:57:23.970 --> 00:57:25.350
So what that means
is that people

00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:28.890
are coming across and
fearing for their lives,

00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:33.350
creating solidarity with
each other in that moment.

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:37.970
So Afghans and Kurds and
Palestinians and Syrians

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:38.900
together.

00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:42.890
And then walking up the
mountain pass in Lesbos

00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:44.450
all the way to Mytelini.

00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:46.490
And what I was witnessing
over and over again

00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:50.830
is, any time an elder
needed to sit on a backpack,

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:54.210
it didn't matter what
country that elder was from,

00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:56.900
especially if she was a woman,
she would get that backpack.

00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:59.630
And then you see now in
[INAUDIBLE] and in [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:59.630 --> 00:58:04.400
and in [INAUDIBLE]
organizing happening across

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:07.260
so many ethnicities
and religion as well.

00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:10.670
So I want to lift that up
as, you know, coming back

00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:14.660
each time I'm thinking, if we
had here the kind of solidarity

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:16.250
that we are seeing
there, we would

00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:17.960
be in a whole other
place in terms

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:19.685
of transnational solidarity.

00:58:19.685 --> 00:58:20.810
- So your question, please.

00:58:20.810 --> 00:58:23.750
- So my question, then, is
to you about what examples

00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:27.170
you have seen in your
own work of the activism

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:30.320
and the crossing of boundaries
that wouldn't have otherwise

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.010
been crossed.

00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:31.610
Thank you.

00:58:31.610 --> 00:58:33.250
- Thank you.

00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:33.750
Lyndsey.

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:34.250
- Yeah.

00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:36.195
Well, I think you gave
really good examples,

00:58:36.195 --> 00:58:37.770
and I'd be tempted
to say the same.

00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:40.230
But going back to
Jacqui's point,

00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:43.440
I think those things happen,
as you've pointed out,

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:45.912
out of situations of survival.

00:58:45.912 --> 00:58:47.870
And what is very interesting
is they're usually

00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:50.210
not being administered.

00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:52.280
In any resource-deprived
situation,

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.605
you're going to get fighting.

00:58:53.605 --> 00:58:54.980
I mean, some people
will scrapped

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:56.270
because of this resource.

00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:59.420
And what you have what
you had in Lebanon,

00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:01.790
and slightly
differently in Jordan,

00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:05.240
is Syrian refugees could come
on to the United Nations High

00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:07.520
Commission for Refugees and
have a certain streaming

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:10.340
and slightly more aid--
because there was Syrian--

00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:11.990
than Palestinians.

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:15.830
And it was the administrative
nature of humanitarianism

00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:20.360
that was feeding
divisions, whereas what's

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:22.850
happening in some of the
situations you were describing

00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:27.180
and also in other
parts of the world,

00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:30.760
including Jordan, is a
different type of solidarity.

00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:34.280
And a Sheikh said
to me in a workshop

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:36.380
we were running in Jordan--

00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:38.450
we were running
workshops with people

00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:41.240
who were hosting refugees
and refugees themselves.

00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:42.920
Quite often, people
who are hosting

00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:45.740
refugees in Jordan and Lebanon
come from refugee families

00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:46.460
themselves.

00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:50.020
Largely Palestinian or another
kind of tradition or going way

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:50.520
back.

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:52.760
So there is a kind of
identification there.

00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:57.290
And the Sheikh said to me, we
don't have the word refugee

00:59:57.290 --> 00:59:57.920
here.

00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:58.670
That's yours.

00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:59.840
That's Western.

00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:02.220
We have guests and strangers.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:03.470
And technically, he's right.

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:04.610
I mean, that's what
Michael Barnett

01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:06.485
was saying in the history
of humanitarianism.

01:00:06.485 --> 01:00:08.750
We invented this
category of refugee

01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:12.507
in order to administer those
people who were not citizens.

01:00:12.507 --> 01:00:14.090
They're actually
people who are moving

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:16.887
for all sorts of reasons.

01:00:16.887 --> 01:00:18.470
And so one of the
things we need to do

01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:20.420
is invent a different
language for talking

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:23.390
about hosting, guesting,
staying, staying

01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:24.140
too long maybe.

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.070
Being an awkward
guest, whatever.

01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:27.410
It's never easy, we know.

01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:28.938
Many people [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:28.938 --> 01:00:30.980
But we desperately need
to find another language.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.022
And I think you're right.

01:00:32.022 --> 01:00:33.680
I think some of that
is happening out

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.440
of sheer necessity,
not out of utopianism.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.190
No one is being an
idealist at the moment.

01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:39.150
It's too grim.

01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:39.650
- Thank you.

01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:42.620
I'm going to just exercise
my prerogative as the chair

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:45.320
and ask each of the four
people standing there

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.330
to ask their question,
and ask the three of you

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:49.370
to make notes as necessary.

01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:50.960
And then we'll answer everybody.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.600
And we'll then have time to hand
over for the final comments.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.100
Yeah.

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:55.600
Sir.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.760
- Thank you.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.480
Again, I'm David Alan.

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:02.120
I want to take
seriously this idea

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.800
of leaving behind the
notion of the nation state.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:10.020
If not in the toilet,
at least behind.

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:13.100
And it occurs that--

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.260
actually, a
startling observation

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:19.490
from the very first presentation
might offer us a framework

01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:20.870
for thinking forward.

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:23.350
Again, in practical terms.

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:25.580
That observation
was that this event

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:33.090
is taking place on Wampanoag
land, where we stand today.

01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:35.750
And why is that suggestive?

01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:40.520
Because if we would try to do
something serious about that,

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:47.180
we'd have to dismantle all the
forms of property ownership,

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:50.120
such as Harvard's
ownership of this land.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.550
At least there'd have
to be resolutions.

01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:58.610
Just as if we were going to
move beyond the nation state,

01:01:58.610 --> 01:02:02.180
we would have to
not only dismantle

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:05.340
the building block for all
the world's organization,

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:08.540
and certainly a
lot of democracies,

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:10.700
and move to some other form.

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:14.280
So I invite-- yes,
it's a bit startling,

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.500
the notion of turning
back over to the Wampanoag

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:22.100
where we're standing, but it
might jolt us out of ourselves

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:25.820
to think of this problem
in very practical terms.

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.400
How might we move beyond the
building block of the nation

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:28.670
state?

01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:29.170
Thank you.

01:02:29.170 --> 01:02:29.874
- Thank you.

01:02:32.242 --> 01:02:34.200
- My name is [? Winn ?]
[? Quayle. ?] Thank you

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.450
for your panel.

01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:38.550
There were several
references to the concept

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:41.190
of race during this panel and
of course other panels earlier

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:42.137
today.

01:02:42.137 --> 01:02:44.220
And we heard a lot of
discussion about the concept

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.590
of blood purity.

01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:47.590
I'm not a scientist.

01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:49.770
But my question relates
to the relationship

01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:52.530
between a biological
conception of race

01:02:52.530 --> 01:02:55.560
and a social conception,
and whether--

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.950
since now everyone can have
their genes sequenced--

01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:02.160
is it possible that white
nationalists might find out

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.583
that they're related
to African-Americans

01:03:04.583 --> 01:03:06.000
and whether any
of that might have

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.732
some consequences for these
political discussions?

01:03:11.732 --> 01:03:14.520
- Hannah.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.020
- Hello.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:16.160
My name is Hannah.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.040
I'm from the graduate school
of design here at Harvard.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:24.080
I only yesterday heard about
this term polypolitanism,

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:30.170
which the professor used
instead of cosmopolitanism.

01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:33.140
It's an idea that we can
belong to many instead

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:38.420
of either nation state or
international, so it to me

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:39.620
was very hopeful.

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:47.190
And it sounded very
realizable that we

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:49.320
don't have to sort of
dismantle everything

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.380
that we have in order to
go for another future.

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:55.350
But we can actually have
more than one identity,

01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:57.180
and I resonate with that.

01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:59.730
And I think a lot of people
resonate with wanting

01:03:59.730 --> 01:04:06.630
to navigate as multiple
sort of people.

01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:07.130
So yeah.

01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:10.650
So I was wondering if
you had any thoughts

01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:14.640
on this idea of
polypolitanism and if you

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.260
have any critiques of that.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:19.400
I'm just curious what
you thought of that.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:19.900
Thank you.

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:22.950
- Thank you very much, indeed.

01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:25.507
So who'd like to start?

01:04:25.507 --> 01:04:26.590
Alex, why don't you start?

01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:29.310
- I can start.

01:04:29.310 --> 01:04:33.540
The question of ancestry
testing and white nationalism

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:35.610
is a very interesting one.

01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:39.840
And what researchers
have found--

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.540
and, you know, you
can learn about

01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:45.870
if you actually go into
some of these message boards

01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:50.130
where white nationalists or
focusing on ancestry testing

01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:52.230
is they like the
results of the test

01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:55.170
when they tell them
what they want to hear.

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:57.300
But they actually don't rely--

01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:59.670
they like the idea of the tests.

01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:02.880
And that's in fact why the
American Society for Human

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:05.700
Genetics recently made
a very strong statement

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:08.520
against white supremacy
and the misuse

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:12.930
of these tests, the
scientific distortion of them

01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:15.150
by white supremacists.

01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:17.220
They specifically
used that term.

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:19.170
However, one of
the aspects that's

01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:21.600
very interesting about
white nationalists

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.510
is, because they
don't they frequently

01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:28.500
don't get the results
they want, they

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:32.340
engage in a romanticized
notion of community.

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:36.000
They often ignore genetic tests.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.690
They partake of the
metaphors of blood and soil.

01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:42.300
But for example, if they
don't get a result they want,

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:45.660
they'd say, well, I'm
white in spirit and soul.

01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:51.900
Or I feel a connection to the
medieval past or the Crusades.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:54.810
And there's a lot of
these fantasy invocations.

01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:58.080
So this is happening on
multiple discursive levels.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:03.300
But the ancestry testing
does kind of cross that,

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:08.130
and that will continue to
play a role in certain aspects

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:12.810
of at least claiming identity.

01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:14.750
- Thank you.

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:19.060
Theresa, do you want to comment
on Harvard handing over--

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:21.130
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:24.040
- OK, good.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.310
I think-- where to start?

01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:26.977
One of the things we
talk about, there's

01:06:26.977 --> 01:06:30.430
a lot of debate about
doing land acknowledgments.

01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:33.250
And part of it is because
people don't want it just become

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:35.380
like a rote one off thing.

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:38.380
They want people to
sort of think like--

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:39.830
it's not invisible anymore.

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:41.140
It's not erased anymore.

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.330
But to think about
this idea of, OK,

01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:47.080
what is the relationship that
comes with that acknowledgment?

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.820
Because you're asking
this big question.

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:50.890
How do we dismantle?

01:06:50.890 --> 01:06:53.710
You know, what is this
anti-colonial vision?

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:55.840
It starts with
having relationships.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.920
And moving out of possession
to relationship, I think,

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:03.760
is where it has to start.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.110
So acknowledging that.

01:07:05.110 --> 01:07:06.550
And then, OK,
where do we go now?

01:07:06.550 --> 01:07:08.380
What do we do to build
those relationships

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.270
and to keep them
going and to have

01:07:10.270 --> 01:07:13.030
that be an ongoing process?

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:16.270
In our earliest
treaties that we have

01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:18.410
between Haudenosaunee
people and the newcomers,

01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:21.010
they were treaties of
peace and friendship.

01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:22.540
And they were
treaties about ways

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:28.280
to coexist and to have
independent political systems,

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.580
but to exist in a
non-colonial relationship

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:34.030
where there wasn't
imposition or interference.

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:35.530
And so those visions
are out there.

01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:39.430
And they're principled on
these ideas of having relations

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:43.180
in a different way that aren't
about necessarily possession,

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:47.290
and can we think about
sort of structuring

01:07:47.290 --> 01:07:48.730
things more along those lines.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.220
- Yeah.

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:54.800
No, but back to
the nation state.

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.250
Because there's not one
type of nation state.

01:07:58.250 --> 01:08:01.110
It's always changing
and can change.

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:04.700
I really was touched
by your translation

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:07.250
of what nationality means.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.600
Bodies in the land.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:12.950
And I just thought that's really
powerful and that could work.

01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:15.225
And then it all kind of
looked back to this morning.

01:08:15.225 --> 01:08:16.850
And actually what we
have at the moment

01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:19.520
is a version of a nation
state which isn't actually

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.140
about sharing and
solidarity, or just sharing,

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:25.729
learning how to share.

01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:29.240
As the panel pointed out,
it's about power and money

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:33.050
and a version of a fantasy
nation state, which is actually

01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:36.540
about keeping power and money
for certain types of people.

01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:39.104
So I wouldn't want to trash
the idea of the nation state

01:08:39.104 --> 01:08:41.479
because I don't think there's
just one idea of the nation

01:08:41.479 --> 01:08:41.979
state.

01:08:41.979 --> 01:08:44.270
They're always competing,
arguing about the best way

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:45.450
to be together.

01:08:45.450 --> 01:08:48.620
But I do think-- and that's why
I love the bodies in the land--

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:53.510
it's time to have more of an
upfront struggle about defining

01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:55.130
new definitions of
what it might mean

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:58.460
to be in the nation or
different nations in one state.

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:01.220
I mean bi-nationality,
tri-nationality,

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.800
poly-nationality
within one state

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.760
were options in the '40s that
people we're talking about

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:08.120
and just got closed down.

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:11.040
I think it's time to have
those conversations again.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:11.540
- Terrific.

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:12.620
Well, thank you so much.

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:16.340
I think a measure of a good
panel and a good conference

01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:19.010
is where people are really
listening to each other,

01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:21.810
picking up each other's phrases,
incorporating them, learning

01:09:21.810 --> 01:09:22.310
from them.

01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:24.078
And I think by that
criterion, this

01:09:24.078 --> 01:09:25.370
has been a fabulous conference.

01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:27.920
So I think I can
speak for all of us

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:32.076
when I say a big thank you to
Radcliffe for organizing this.

01:09:32.076 --> 01:09:37.016
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:40.979 --> 01:09:43.649
- I wanted to give a couple
of concluding remarks

01:09:43.649 --> 01:09:48.270
today, thanking first off all
of you who came and shared

01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:51.540
your time and in many cases
your questions and remarks,

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:54.550
or your concerns.

01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:58.200
I want to begin just a couple
of quick notes of gratitude

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:04.740
to our dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin
for her leadership,

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:09.180
to the academic ventures
group at Radcliffe that puts

01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:12.120
on events like these and
its fearless leader Rebecca

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:15.740
Wasserman, and to
the event staff,

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:19.800
Jessica [? Vicland ?] and others
who do just such an amazing job

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:22.200
bringing these
kinds of complex--

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:27.060
highly complex--
events to fruition.

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:31.290
Let me also once again
thank the committee

01:10:31.290 --> 01:10:36.780
that I was privileged to
join, the planning committee,

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:39.330
and my colleagues on the
planning committee, which

01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:41.310
include Professor Phil Deloria.

01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:43.440
I see you.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.660
Professor Jiyun Kim.

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:48.120
And Professor
Gabriela Soto Laveaga.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.130
They did just such
an amazing job.

01:10:50.130 --> 01:10:53.670
I mean, the diversity of
perspectives, geographies,

01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:57.300
spaces, voices that
you heard, that's them.

01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.460
And I really can't
emphasize that enough.

01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:00.510
Becky Wasserman, too.

01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:05.110
But it's really just a
remarkable accomplishment.

01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:06.220
So what did we do today?

01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:11.170
What did we do to citizenship?

01:11:11.170 --> 01:11:13.300
I'd like to think we kind
of unsettled it a bit.

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.470
Right?

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:16.090
Busted it apart.

01:11:16.090 --> 01:11:18.920
Is there anything
left to it anymore?

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:22.330
We learned from Sabeel Rahman
that it's not one off, one on.

01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:23.360
It's not binary.

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.280
It's not like a light switch.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.410
It's more smooth.

01:11:26.410 --> 01:11:30.410
It's functional,
continuous, convex.

01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:32.930
It gets undone by
economic power,

01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:35.900
to the extent that economic
relations can render

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:40.860
it fictive, almost, as we
learned from Zephyr Teachout

01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.930
whose talk was really scary.

01:11:43.930 --> 01:11:46.920
But really persuasive.

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:50.010
It has been used, as our
indigenous friends have

01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:54.750
reminded us, as a cudgel
to forcibly assimilate

01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:58.000
the indigenous peoples of
North America and elsewhere.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.640
We learned that
from Rosita Worl.

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.520
We learned that
from Jill Doerfler.

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:07.260
Citizenship has been
used to reassemble

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:12.930
a fictional white majority,
a fictional white community

01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:16.430
as Professor Minna
Stern just noted.

01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:21.530
And as Lyndsey [INAUDIBLE]
just reminded us,

01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:25.900
citizenship's
residual categories

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:29.300
define those outside
of them as people,

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.790
as agents, of somehow
having less value,

01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:36.440
less permanence, less
belonging than those within.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.590
And finally, perhaps
more most poignantly,

01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:43.640
[INAUDIBLE] reminded us
that sometimes citizenship

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.470
isn't enough.

01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:50.740
You can have all the
formal citizenship,

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:54.230
but it doesn't deliver
the antibiotics, the food,

01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:55.990
the water that
needs to be there.

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.620
I'm not ready to throw in
the towel on citizenship

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:02.280
yet, though.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.930
And while I don't
have any answers,

01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:06.870
let me just point
a couple of paths

01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:11.160
forward, really not so much for
progress in the global sense,

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.650
but in ways that we can think
about it that are really

01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:18.390
just inspired by if not just
pure repetitions of what

01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:20.760
you heard earlier today.

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:25.510
We need more than
citizenship, obviously.

01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:28.210
But maybe we also need a
transformed citizenship.

01:13:28.210 --> 01:13:31.660
Maybe unsettling
citizenship, making

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.260
it unruly, unruled
in that respect,

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:38.080
is exactly what we
need to save it.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.410
And once saved or once
appropriately transformed,

01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:45.070
maybe we need what it provides,
namely rights and governments

01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:47.890
in the best sense.

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:50.350
Maybe we need the
kind of citizenship

01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:52.510
that respects the
sovereignty and treaties

01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:55.570
of indigenous
communities and citizens.

01:13:55.570 --> 01:13:59.500
Maybe we need governmental
resources properly

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:03.460
laid out to protect human rights
and those most vulnerable,

01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:06.190
whether they're the
poor, whether they're

01:14:06.190 --> 01:14:09.460
the refugee, whether they're
indigenous citizens, what

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:11.110
have you.

01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:12.910
Maybe we need a more
encompassing vision

01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:16.510
of citizenship that
rejects racist thinking

01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:21.640
and imagined Edens or that
refashions the museum much

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.290
as Pap Ndiaye is doing
right now in Paris.

01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:29.080
And maybe we need a form of
citizenship that calls us

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:34.730
to the kind of commitment and
vitality that Mayor Carmen

01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:38.380
Yulín Cruz Soto
called us to today.

01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:42.970
And on that note, I really
can't do any better.

01:14:42.970 --> 01:14:45.910
And none of us could do
any better than the way

01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:49.990
that she marshaled
our aspirations

01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:52.090
at that wonderful
keynote address.

01:14:52.090 --> 01:14:54.040
I hope that and
all of this remain

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:58.750
with you, the questions, the
aspirations, the inspiration.

01:14:58.750 --> 01:15:00.048
Go on and be good citizens.

01:15:00.048 --> 01:15:01.090
And have a great weekend.

01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:03.790
[APPLAUSE]

01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:08.640
