[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.520
SPEAKER 1: Please help me
welcome Craig O'Rourke.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.539
[CLAPPING]

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.830
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Thank you Paul.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.310
Everybody hear me OK?

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.200
Great.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.450
So I've written a book,
"Destination Perpetuity."

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.840
The premise of my book is to
introduce the reader to what

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.300
I believe to be true wealth.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.970
So I want to start by talking
today about what wealth is.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.790
Now, there's thousands of
people that work here at Google.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.340
And if I had the opportunity
to ask every person what wealth

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.100
is, I'd get hundreds, if not
thousands of different answers.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.160
But when I ask people
what wealth is I

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.260
notice most people
usually give me a number.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.190
They'll say, well,
I'd feel wealthy

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.523
if I had a half a million
dollars, or a million dollars,

00:00:53.523 --> 00:00:55.090
or $10 million.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.640
My point is, most people think
of wealth in finite terms.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.500
I don't think of
wealth that way.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.330
I don't think of wealth
in a finite term,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.300
because if you have $1
million or $10 million,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.981
and if you live long
enough and well enough,

00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:11.230
you won't have any money left.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.730
Right?

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.670
You'll go through it.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.970
I think of wealth as infinite.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.130
Wealth, to me, is safe,
secure, dependable cash flow.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.290
It's money you can count
on month after month,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.610
year after year, and
decade after decade.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.670
That's why I think investing in
income producing real estate is

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.520
by far the best
investment anybody can

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.290
make to create true wealth.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.860
Now, why do I say that?

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.240
Because income producing
real estate, the nature of it

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.030
is a self funding
investment, which

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.330
makes it also a
self-sustaining investment,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.866
thereby creating an investment
that is an annuity for life.

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.990
It's a stream of cash that
lasts forever, isn't it?

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.847
It's truly an infinite
amount of money.

00:01:56.847 --> 00:01:58.430
So let me explain
what I mean by that.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.971
But before I get
into that, I'm going

00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:01.960
to tell you how I got
the idea for the book.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.585
I was asked recently,
how did you think

00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:05.210
of putting this book together?

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.060
Well, it came to me organically.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.699
I'm a baby boomer, 57 years old.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.470
And I noticed when I
was in my 20s, 30s,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.890
and 40s conversations
with friends and coworkers

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.120
were very carefree things.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.790
We'd talk about were
the best happy hour was,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.360
going to play beach
volleyball, or rock climbing.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.000
About the time I turned 50
those conversations started

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.190
to change.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.590
They started talking about
knee replacements, Lipitor,

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.890
and social security solvency.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.250
Now, out of all these
AARP related topics

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.075
the one that seemed to cause
the most anxiety among people

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:41.200
was the one you'd think
they'd get the most excited

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.270
about, the topic of retirement.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.260
When I'd ask people how or
when they wanted to retire,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.550
I'd get shrugs.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.190
People would say, I'm
going to work till I die.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.940
I had one friend.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.856
When I asked her when
she was going to retire,

00:02:53.856 --> 00:02:55.045
she simply started crying.

00:02:55.045 --> 00:02:57.110
I thought, this is not good.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.510
And I knew a better way.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.400
I know a way to
build true wealth.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.289
So I decided to share
it by writing this book.

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:04.330
Now, I've been fortunate.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.010
My book has been
selling pretty well.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.780
And it started
trending a little bit.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.730
And so I've gotten
speaking engagements.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.764
And I was recently up in the
Bay Area in San Francisco.

00:03:12.764 --> 00:03:15.055
And I was speaking to a group
of real estate investors,

00:03:15.055 --> 00:03:18.071
and at the end had a
question and answer period.

00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:19.820
And this one woman
stood up, and she said,

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.429
I really enjoyed your talk.

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:22.720
And I'm going to buy your book.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.262
And I might even try and
follow some of your ideas.

00:03:26.262 --> 00:03:27.970
She said, but there
was one thing missing

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.372
in your presentation, and
I said, what was that?

00:03:30.372 --> 00:03:32.080
And she said, you
didn't mention anything

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.122
about your qualifications.

00:03:34.122 --> 00:03:35.330
And I said, what do you mean?

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.660
And she said, well, where
did you go to school?

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.430
What degrees in
finance do you have?

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.680
And I said, well, I don't
have any degrees in finance.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.150
I've never studied finance.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.490
And she said, well,
with all due respect,

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.120
why should we listen to you
about investing money if you

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.550
don't have any qualifications?

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.530
So I shared a story with her.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.060
I told her that
I've had a front row

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.230
seat for almost 40 years
watching as a real estate

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.250
portfolio started with just a
conversation around my parents'

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.700
kitchen table, and
blossomed into a self

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.280
funding, self-sustaining
portfolio of income

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.870
producing real
estate that carried

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.210
my parents through their
retirement very comfortably.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.077
Let me tell you how
that came to be.

00:04:16.077 --> 00:04:17.410
My dad was a real estate broker.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.870
I was the youngest of four boys.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.160
And he was fairly successful.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.960
He sold income
producing real estate.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.970
And he was so
successful, he decided

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.100
to open his own
brokerage about the time

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.440
I was eight or nine years old.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.200
Now, that caused a lot
of anxiety in my house,

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.270
because when you start a
business, it's expensive.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.820
So any extra money that
was coming into the house

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.610
went right back in to
build the business.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.290
So consequently,
there wasn't a lot

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.960
of money in our house
on a monthly basis.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.440
And there certainly wasn't a lot
of savings in our house either.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.570
Now, my mother was
most bothered by this.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.210
She would sit once a
month at the kitchen table

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.160
and pay all the bills.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.260
And about half way
through paying the bills

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.690
she'd always say the same
thing, which puzzled me.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.730
She'd say, I'm tired
of this roller coaster.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.320
Get me off this ride.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.510
Of course, that was her
analogy for the fact

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.330
that my parents never quite
seemed to have enough money.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.670
And I didn't
understand that analogy

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.210
about my dad's business
and the income we had.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.520
But even at that early
age of eight or nine

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.940
I too had a gauge on
my dad's business.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.700
My gauge was the dinner table.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.640
You see, I knew if
we had spaghetti too

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.960
many nights in a row, my
dad didn't have any clients.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.510
If we had spaghetti
with meat sauce,

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.990
I figured he got a listing.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.740
If there was chicken on the
table, something was in escrow.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.440
And if I came home
and smelled steak,

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.870
ah, contingencies have
been removed, right?

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.990
Now, it didn't matter to me.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.627
I like chicken, steak,
and pasta all the same.

00:05:46.627 --> 00:05:47.710
But it mattered to my mom.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.130
It mattered a great
deal to my mom.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.640
So I'll never forget the
night that this conversation

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.380
of retirement came.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.350
My mom was cooking
dinner, stirring

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.097
yet another pot of spaghetti.

00:06:01.097 --> 00:06:02.680
I was sitting there
doing my homework.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.776
My dad came walking in.

00:06:04.776 --> 00:06:07.150
And my mother, when my dad
opened the door and walked in,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.369
my mother froze him in the
doorway with just a stare.

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:11.410
He knew something was up.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.980
He just froze.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:12.563
He said, what?

00:06:12.563 --> 00:06:13.900
What did I do?

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.240
My mom said, completely
out of the blue,

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.980
what are you doing about
our financial future?

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.760
My dad was ill prepared
for this question.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.160
He said, I work every day.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.980
My mom said, so do
I. I got four kids.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.300
I work every day too.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.350
That wasn't the question.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.975
She said the question
was, what are you

00:06:30.975 --> 00:06:34.559
doing about our financial
future, our retirement?

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:36.100
My dad thought about
it for a minute.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.940
And he was a real estate agent.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.356
So he always had
an answer, right?

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.816
He finally said, I'm
going to work till I die.

00:06:40.816 --> 00:06:42.709
My mom said, OK, that's fine.

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:43.750
You go ahead and do that.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.950
You go ahead and
work till you die.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.270
But what if you die first?

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.660
What about me, and
what about these kids?

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.480
Well, my dad agreed that that
was not a very good plan.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.660
So that night after dinner
they sat at the kitchen table

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.120
and they talked about options.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.482
Now, the obvious option
would be for them

00:07:00.482 --> 00:07:02.440
to buy a piece of income
producing real estate.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.559
After all, my dad was
a real estate broker.

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:06.100
He sold income
producing real estate.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.430
He owned a real
estate brokerage.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.437
But the problem was, he
didn't have enough money.

00:07:11.437 --> 00:07:13.270
They had a very small
amount of money saved.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.978
Not enough to buy a
piece of real estate,

00:07:14.978 --> 00:07:16.840
because real estate's expensive.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.750
So they went to
plan B. They decided

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.150
to talk to my dad's friend Don.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.770
Now, Don and my dad had
been lifelong friends.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.550
They had gone to
college together.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.340
They had served in
the military together.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.840
They'd raised their
family together.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.090
We used to vacation with them.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.180
We were so close that
my brothers and I

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.280
called him Uncle Don.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.830
And the one thing I
remember most about Don

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.336
was everybody always said,
he's the smartest guy we know.

00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:43.960
That was what everybody
said about Don.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.550
So when I heard my
parents, I didn't

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.660
know what retirement
was, but when

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.690
I heard they were going to
talk to Uncle Don about it--

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.510
I knew this was causing
anxiety in the house--

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.593
I thought, problem solved.

00:07:51.593 --> 00:07:53.230
They're going to talk to Don.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.672
So a couple weeks went by.

00:07:54.672 --> 00:07:56.380
My parents had that
appointment with Don.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.600
I was very excited to find
out what Don had to say.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.400
So after the appointment I
came running up to my dad.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.330
I said, dad, dad,
dad, what did Don say?

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.356
What did Don say
about our retirement?

00:08:04.356 --> 00:08:05.480
My dad just shook his head.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.719
He said, son, we're
not going with Don.

00:08:07.719 --> 00:08:08.760
I said, what do you mean?

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.010
He's the smartest guy we know.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.012
We have to go with Don.

00:08:11.012 --> 00:08:12.970
My dad, you could tell
he was a little anxious.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.011
He said, son, this is not
for you to worry about.

00:08:15.011 --> 00:08:16.764
He said, just know
this, Don wants

00:08:16.764 --> 00:08:18.430
to invest our money
in the stock market,

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:19.970
and we don't like that idea.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.870
Now, my parents had both been
children in the Depression.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.170
So they knew firsthand how
devastating so much money

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.310
in the stock market can be.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.940
And they weren't going
to take that risk.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.320
So I said, well, what
are you going to do dad?

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.150
He said, don't
worry about it, son.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.500
I'm going to invest our money.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.441
Now, again, I knew my
dad was good at his job.

00:08:34.441 --> 00:08:36.190
I knew he invested
money for other people.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.898
So that was fine.

00:08:36.898 --> 00:08:38.289
I went about my business.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:40.419
But my dad had a
problem, didn't he?

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.780
My dad did not have enough
money for a piece of income

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.320
producing real estate.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.480
So he took a page from
my mom's playbook.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.327
He went to work the next day.

00:08:49.327 --> 00:08:51.910
And he asked all of his friends
and his coworkers how and when

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.550
they were planning on retiring.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.020
Some of them shrugged.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.110
Some of them cried.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.960
Some of them said they'd
work till they die.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.210
My dad found a few
like minded friends.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.250
And together they
pooled their money.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.546
They formed a partnership.

00:09:04.546 --> 00:09:05.920
And they bought
their first piece

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.320
of income producing real estate.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.380
And a few years later
they bought another one.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.190
And a few years later
they bought another one.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.550
And in a relatively
short amount of time

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.620
chicken and steak became
much more frequent

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.690
on our dinner table.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.050
Our summer vacations,
camping in Big Bear,

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.050
became two weeks in
the Hawaiian Islands.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.550
The plan was working.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.700
The cash was flowing.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.560
And after a few years
they were successful.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.550
They had a portfolio of
cash positive properties,

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:42.540
generating income, and
building equity over time.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.330
When they got to their desired
retirement age, they were set.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:45.985
They retired.

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:47.610
They had a very
comfortable retirement.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.010
They had 20 years of
worry free retirement.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.140
They lived in beautiful
home, drove nice cars.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.320
They traveled.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.900
They had the good
life for 20 years.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.700
Safe, secure,
dependable money they

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.482
could count on for 20 years.

00:09:59.482 --> 00:10:00.670
And everything was good.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.420
But life changes.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.160
Doesn't it?

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:09.319
And in 1997 my dad's good
friend Don passed away.

00:10:09.319 --> 00:10:10.860
This was a very sad
thing for my dad.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.735
They were very close.

00:10:11.735 --> 00:10:13.000
My parents were very upset.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.510
So I decided to take
them to the service.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.660
Driving home from the service
I said to my dad, you know dad?

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.790
You know what I remember
most about Uncle Don?

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:21.805
He said, what?

00:10:21.805 --> 00:10:23.430
I said, everybody
always used to say he

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:24.799
was the smartest guy we knew.

00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:25.590
And my dad laughed.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.090
He goes, people
did say that, son.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:27.930
I remember that.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.510
And he said, but you know what,
when it came to investing,

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.869
your mother and I were smarter.

00:10:32.869 --> 00:10:34.410
And I said, oh, I
remember that, Dad.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.790
I remember you didn't
invest with Don

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.950
because he was going to put
your money in the stock market.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.537
My dad said, that
was only part of it.

00:10:39.537 --> 00:10:40.870
That was only part of the story.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.780
He said, you were too young
for me to explain to you

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.441
what the real reason
we didn't invest.

00:10:44.441 --> 00:10:45.440
And I said, what was it?

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.490
See, what my parents
didn't like was the fact

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.390
that Don's firm used actuaries.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.210
Now, most of you
probably here know

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.760
what an actuary does when
they work for an insurance

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.540
firm like that.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.430
What they do is they ask
you certain questions.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.189
They say, do you drink?

00:10:59.189 --> 00:10:59.730
Do you smoke?

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.320
Do you use recreational drugs?

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.370
Do you exercise?

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.240
Is there cancer or diabetes,
or any other ticking time bomb

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.190
in your family bloodline?

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.430
They take all this information,
and they compare it

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.990
to mortality
charts, because they

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:18.150
need to determine approximately
how long you're going to live.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.732
They need to know
that information,

00:11:19.732 --> 00:11:21.690
because they need to give
that to men and women

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.570
like Don who plan
for your finances,

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.450
because they need to figure
out approximately how

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.750
long your money needs to last.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.330
My parents didn't like that.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.100
My parents didn't
like the idea of being

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.629
told how long their
money would last

00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:37.170
and how long they
were going to live.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.450
So they went a different
route, didn't they?

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:39.658
They invested in real estate.

00:11:39.658 --> 00:11:41.340
And it worked out
beautifully for them.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.320
But why?

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.930
Why is real estate
a better investment?

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:46.880
Let's do a little side
by side comparison.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.005
Now, remember, I don't have
any degrees in finance.

00:11:49.005 --> 00:11:52.400
But this is just my view of
how any investment works.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.250
I see all investments
as having four phases.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.260
The first phase is the
initial investment.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.510
You simply pick what
you're going to invest in.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.400
And you create a
plan, don't you?

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.952
So it's certainly easier
to get in the stock market.

00:12:03.952 --> 00:12:05.660
You can start with a
little bit of money.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.830
You go to somebody like
Don, and you say, hey,

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.371
I want to invest in
the stock market.

00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:11.207
And you decide your
level of risk tolerance,

00:12:11.207 --> 00:12:12.290
and all these good things.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.220
You lay out your plan.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.552
I want to retire at this age.

00:12:14.552 --> 00:12:16.010
And I want to have
this much money.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:16.910
Great.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.860
Similar in some
ways to real estate.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.180
With real estate you still
have to devise a plan.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.180
You have to figure out
when the building's going

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.400
to get paid off, or paid
down to a point where

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.150
it can generate enough cash
flow for you to retire off of.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.580
But the harder part with real
estate is that down payment,

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.000
isn't it?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
It takes a lot of money
to get into real estate.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.230
So a lot of people shy
away from real estate

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:40.730
because of phase one, because
it takes a lot of money, right?

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:42.680
So phase one is
absolutely easier

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.837
to get into with the stock
market than real estate.

00:12:45.837 --> 00:12:47.170
But what about the other phases?

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.760
Let's take a look at
phase two for a minute.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.680
Phase two is the
continued funding phase.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.320
This is a very important phase.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.820
No matter what you
invest in, you're

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.736
probably going to have
to continually fund it.

00:12:57.736 --> 00:13:00.500
Most people start with
a small amount of money

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.174
and a very aggressive
retirement plan.

00:13:02.174 --> 00:13:04.340
Everyone wants to retire
as early as possible and as

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.059
wealthy as possible, don't we?

00:13:06.059 --> 00:13:07.850
So if you go to a guy
like Don and you say,

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.790
hey, here's my money, let's
get going, Don's going to say,

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.180
thank you very much.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.320
Glad you entrusted
me with your money.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.862
And I'm going to do everything
I can to build your portfolio.

00:13:17.862 --> 00:13:20.278
But I got to tell you, you
gave me a small amount of money

00:13:20.278 --> 00:13:21.920
here, and an aggressive plan.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.870
So you're going to
have to help out.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.000
So Mr. and Mrs. Investor,
every month you're

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.830
going to write me a check.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.430
Month after month,
year after year,

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.460
decade after
decade, the investor

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.810
is writing checks to
fund their own portfolio.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:36.680
Don does his part.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.260
The investor does their part.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.890
And it works nicely.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.480
That's called investor funding.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.460
What about real estate?

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.460
Real estate also needs
to be funded, doesn't it.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.293
You have a mortgage.

00:13:45.293 --> 00:13:45.980
You have taxes.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:46.784
You have insurance.

00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:47.950
You have a property manager.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.610
And you better put
some money away,

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.070
because that roof will
leak, and that carpet

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:53.730
will need to be changed.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.280
So you better have
a rainy day fund.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.780
It takes a lot of
money, doesn't it?

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.700
So that's real estate investing.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.090
But here's the part I like
about real estate best.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.190
Those dollars should
be coming not from you,

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.690
but from your tenants.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.470
Month after month,
year after year,

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.510
decade after decade, that
investor funding should all

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:15.030
come from your tenants
pockets, not yours.

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.570
What about the fun part?

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.810
What about phase
three, distribution?

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.020
That's the really good part.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:20.520
All right.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.061
Fast forward.

00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:24.270
You're 65, or whatever age
you decide to retire at.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.251
Ring, ring, ring.

00:14:25.251 --> 00:14:26.000
Pick up the phone.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.490
It's Don.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:27.490
He says, happy birthday.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.430
Happy 65th birthday.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.930
We made it.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.210
You're fully funded.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.552
Don't send me any more checks.

00:14:31.552 --> 00:14:32.760
I'm going to send you checks.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.750
And he does.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.800
He starts sending you
checks month after month,

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.740
year after year,
decade after decade.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.740
Those dollars are
flowing into you, right?

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.210
Same with real estate.

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.860
You've made a plan.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.620
And your property has
been paid down or paid off

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.686
to the point where all
of those tenant dollars

00:14:48.686 --> 00:14:50.310
are now funding your
investment, right?

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:53.790
So they both work pretty much
in phase three, the distribution

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:54.630
phase.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:57.770
But phase four is
the most important.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.120
Phase four is the
continued asset growth.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.150
You see, with Don's
plan, what happens?

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.010
The asset itself, the stocks,
the bonds, the mutual funds,

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:08.500
whatever you've invested
in must be sold off.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.550
It must be liquidated
every time you

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:14.580
are going to get some
type of disbursement.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.730
So over time that
portfolio liquidates

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.240
until there's nothing left.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.940
But that's not the
case with real estate.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.820
You see, because real
estate is self-funding,

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.790
the self-funding
nature of real estate

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.390
creates a self-sustaining
investment, right?

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:36.800
Which provides distributions
from the excess cash flow.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.780
And the real estate
itself is left

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.130
untouched to be able to
continually appreciate

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.780
in value over time.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.220
You see, my parents didn't like
the idea of fixed parameters

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.910
of time and money.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:54.569
What they wanted was
infinite cash flow.

00:15:54.569 --> 00:15:55.610
And that's what they got.

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.440
They created an
annuity for life.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.334
They had a stream of cash
that would last forever.

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:02.000
That's what income
producing real estate

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.316
can do for you if
you do it right.

00:16:04.316 --> 00:16:05.690
And it's a really
good thing they

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:09.180
went that path, because
remember those actuaries?

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.270
They told my dad
he'd live to be 75.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.500
He didn't listen.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.870
My dad lived to be 83
years old, eight years

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.850
passed what the actuaries
had planned for.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.280
He would have run out of
money at 75 years old.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.100
But instead those eight years,
he wasn't stressed about money

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.050
or looking for a job.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.720
My dad was living a
very comfortable life,

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.410
living in a beautiful home,
traveling, enjoying life.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:35.940
And my mom?

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.840
They told my mom
she'd live to 78.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.930
She also did not listen.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.240
My mother lived to 98.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.900
20 years beyond
what the actuaries

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.100
would have planned for.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.030
20 years.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:55.480
She would have run out of
money in 1997 at 78 years old.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.110
You know what would
have happened?

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.500
She would have ended up on my
pull out sofa in my guest room.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.810
But that's not what happened.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.640
What happened instead was she
continued to live her life.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.125
She lived in a beautiful home.

00:17:07.125 --> 00:17:08.000
She drove a nice car.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.660
She traveled.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.530
She ate out.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:10.849
She lived the good life.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.880
My mother never
even thought twice

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.460
about spending every dime
in her checking account,

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:22.410
even as a widower in her 90s,
because she knew next month

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:23.430
there'd be more money.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:27.800
She knew that because she had
almost 40 years of watching

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.800
a cash flow portfolio provide
money, month after month,

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.680
year after year,
decade after decade.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.260
For nearly 40 years she
never worried about money.

00:17:41.052 --> 00:17:45.290
And what happened to her
real estate portfolio

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:48.800
from 1997 when she would have
had run out of money with Don

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.090
to the year 2017
that she lived to?

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:52.070
It exploded, didn't it?

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.090
I don't have to
tell anybody here

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.881
what happened to Southern
California income

00:17:54.881 --> 00:17:57.770
producing real estate
from 1997 to 2017.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:58.580
It exploded.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.690
The biggest change in
my mom's financial world

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.150
was she was worth
so much more money.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.960
She wasn't broke.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.820
Everything continued to grow.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.220
And she continued to
have all the money

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.500
she needed to live off of.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:16.247
Now, before my dad died my mom
was much healthier than him.

00:18:16.247 --> 00:18:18.330
And he knew she was going
to live for a long time.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.330
And so he came to me and
he said, you know son,

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.782
I want to make sure you take
care of your mom's portfolio.

00:18:22.782 --> 00:18:23.740
And I said, I will dad.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.240
I promise.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.870
So after my dad passed
I went to my mom.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.367
I said, mom, I got to tell you,
I made this promise to dad.

00:18:29.367 --> 00:18:30.950
My mom said, oh,
don't worry about it.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.376
She said I've got a good CPA.

00:18:32.376 --> 00:18:33.500
I'll get a good accountant.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.670
I'll take care of everything.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:35.300
You got your own life.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:35.720
You're too busy.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.410
Don't worry about.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:37.670
I said, no, I made
dad that promise.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.378
And I'm going to take
care of everything.

00:18:39.378 --> 00:18:41.690
So she said, OK, but
before you sign on to this

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:43.773
let me tell you what you're
getting yourself into.

00:18:43.773 --> 00:18:44.344
I said, OK.

00:18:44.344 --> 00:18:45.760
She said I've got
four properties.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.730
I said I know that.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.374
She said all four
of those checks

00:18:48.374 --> 00:18:50.040
come in at different
times of the month.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:50.990
I said, OK.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.360
She goes, I want them deposited
the minute they come in.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.151
I said, no problem.

00:18:54.151 --> 00:18:55.690
I'll set it up on
automatic deposit.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:56.900
She said, oh, no.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:57.540
Not my money.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.040
No.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.498
You're going to
take it to the bank

00:18:59.498 --> 00:19:01.700
and deposit it at my branch.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.045
And I said, well, mom, I
don't mind depositing it.

00:19:04.045 --> 00:19:05.670
But there's a branch
right by my house.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.150
She said, oh, no.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.650
No, no, no.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.090
You'll go to my branch.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.714
And you'll go to window
six and you'll see Maria.

00:19:11.714 --> 00:19:13.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.691
I said, mom, OK.

00:19:15.691 --> 00:19:16.190
Fine.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.148
I'll go to your branch.

00:19:17.148 --> 00:19:17.990
But there's an ATM.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.650
I'm just going to use it.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:19.190
She says, oh, no.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.370
No.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.520
No.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:19.730
No.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:20.390
No.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.670
I had a problem
with an ATM in 1983.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:23.937
That's not happening.

00:19:23.937 --> 00:19:25.020
You're going to my branch.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.420
You're going to talk to Maria.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.762
I said, mom, your branch
has incredibly long lines.

00:19:29.762 --> 00:19:30.470
She goes, I know.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:33.250
You should take a newspaper
and a cup of coffee.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.000
I said, all right, but
what if I get there

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:35.930
and Maria's not there?

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.000
She said, then you'll
go back the next day.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.460
So guess what I did
for four times a month?

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.687
I'd go to the bank.

00:19:41.687 --> 00:19:43.520
And I got in the habit
of taking a newspaper

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.936
and taking a cup of coffee,
because there were the longest

00:19:45.936 --> 00:19:46.970
lines I'd ever seen.

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:50.059
And this one particular day,
I always take the "USA Today."

00:19:50.059 --> 00:19:52.100
And you're probably all
familiar with the format.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.480
And they have the money section.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.401
It's in green.

00:19:54.401 --> 00:19:56.650
And they the little money
snapshot at the base, right?

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:59.480
This one particular day had a
very interesting little money

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.080
snapshot.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.320
And it was the results of a poll
they'd done by money managers,

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.470
people like Don, men
and women like Don

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.970
that invest money for people.

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.340
And the poll asked
one simple question.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.900
What drives your clients?

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.470
Is it greed or is it fear?

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:20.180
By an overwhelming 83% the
respondents answered fear.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:24.050
It was fear that drove
people to invest.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.110
And that's really smart,
because it is fearful to run out

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.181
of money, isn't it?

00:20:28.181 --> 00:20:30.680
And as I was standing in this
line I looked around the bank.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.680
And they had a series of
posters all encouraging people

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.960
to invest money with this bank.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.584
And they were all based in fear.

00:20:38.584 --> 00:20:41.000
And I thought, wow, this bank's
really ahead of the curve.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.270
I'm reading "USA Today" now.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.497
And they've already got
[INAUDIBLE] posters up.

00:20:44.497 --> 00:20:46.080
And there was one
poster in particular

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.660
that really struck me.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.132
And it was this
nice little couple.

00:20:49.132 --> 00:20:51.590
They're probably 65, 70 years
old, sitting on a park bench,

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:52.850
having a little picnic.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.280
And the caption reads, will
you outlive your money?

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.070
And I thought, wow, that's kind
of a scary thought, isn't it?

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:01.250
And down below it says,
contact us to find the answers.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.750
And as I'm standing
in this line I'm

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.625
holding a check for
$6,000 in my hand.

00:21:05.625 --> 00:21:07.250
And that check
represented the proceeds

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.020
from one of my mom's properties.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.455
And those proceeds, those were
after the taxes were paid,

00:21:11.455 --> 00:21:12.830
and after the
insurance was paid,

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:13.710
and after the
property [INAUDIBLE]..

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.835
That's what she brought
back from that one property

00:21:15.835 --> 00:21:18.440
every month, $6,000.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.940
I wanted to stand up and yell,
I got the answer right here.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.290
This is the answer, income
producing real estate.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:27.680
But as I was holding that
check I started thinking,

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.780
how did this check come to be?

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.470
And I remember exactly when
my dad bought that building.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:35.727
I remember because
it was the same week

00:21:35.727 --> 00:21:36.810
I got my driver's license.

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:37.940
It was 1976.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.369
I was 16 years old.

00:21:39.369 --> 00:21:40.410
And I was running around.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:41.493
I got my driver's license!

00:21:41.493 --> 00:21:42.120
So excited.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.203
My dad was running around.

00:21:43.203 --> 00:21:44.120
I bought a building!

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.010
And he would always tell the
story about this building.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.120
He was very proud of it.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.200
And the story he would tell
is, it was a listing of his.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.730
And it was 1976.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.920
The economy was not great.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.510
Interest rates were rather high.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.090
And this building in
this particular area

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.614
was really not a very good area.

00:22:00.614 --> 00:22:02.030
People were steering
away from it.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.547
So they weren't really
investing money into it.

00:22:04.547 --> 00:22:06.380
But my dad really
believed in this building.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.750
And so he'd advertised it.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.790
And he got the owner
to do some work on it.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.800
And back then, of course,
1976, nobody had computers.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.480
So what real estate
agents had to do,

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.730
they had to pick up the phone.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:17.880
And they had to
start calling people.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.100
So my dad would call
everybody he knew,

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.447
and all the clients he knew,
all the agents he knew.

00:22:21.447 --> 00:22:23.280
He did this for weeks,
and weeks, and weeks.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.870
Finally, just no takers.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.380
So we went back to the
seller, a guy named Bill.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.880
And he said, Bill, I got to
tell you, I've tried everything.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.463
I've adverted.

00:22:30.463 --> 00:22:31.670
I've called.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.020
There's no takers.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.940
And Bill said, I've got
to sell this building.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.050
And my dad said, I know.

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.754
I think you need to
reduce the price.

00:22:37.754 --> 00:22:38.670
And Bill said, oh, no.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:38.900
No.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:39.110
No.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.320
No.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:39.530
No.

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:39.810
No.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.310
We're not going to
reduce the price.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.125
You told me it was
worth $110,000.

00:22:43.125 --> 00:22:45.240
And my dad said,
well, I believe that.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.120
But I can't convince
anybody else of that.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.080
And he said, well, I'm
not reducing the price.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.104
Think of something else.

00:22:50.104 --> 00:22:52.020
So my dad thought about
it, and he said, well,

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.510
interest rates are
kind of high right now.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:58.710
And lending's pretty
restrictive right now.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.760
He said, you own the
building free and clear.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.920
Bill said, that's right.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.190
He said, would you consider
doing some owner finance?

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:06.262
He said, absolutely.

00:23:06.262 --> 00:23:08.220
He said, would you be
really aggressive with it

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.860
and let somebody put 10% down?

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.330
Bill said, absolutely,
but I want my price.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.190
So my dad said, OK.

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.070
So he got back that day to the
office, got back on the phone,

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.330
started calling people.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:19.860
He called this one friend Jim.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.990
Now, he'd sold lots
of real estate to Jim.

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:23.970
And he made Jim a lot of money.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:25.620
And he called Jim
and said, Jim, Jim,

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.910
I got to tell you
about this building.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.140
Jim said, Mike, you've called me
about that building five times.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.090
I don't want to hear
about it anymore.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:30.450
I don't want it.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.460
Don't like that area.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:31.960
He said, no.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.680
You've got to listen to me.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.765
And he told him
about the financing.

00:23:33.765 --> 00:23:36.060
And he said, well, it does
sound like a good deal.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.550
But Jim said, you know Mike,
I got to ask you a question.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.475
If this building's such a good
deal, why don't you buy it?

00:23:41.475 --> 00:23:43.600
And my dad said, I would
love to buy it, Jim,

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.770
but I don't have any money.

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.580
And he said, OK, you have
a commission don't you?

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:49.550
My dad said, yes.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:50.300
He said, what's your commission?

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.050
He said, 5%.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:51.659
He said, OK.

00:23:51.659 --> 00:23:53.450
And what does he want
down on the building?

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:54.770
10%.

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.440
Jim said, OK, tell you
what, let's buy it together.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.065
I'll put in 5%.

00:23:58.065 --> 00:23:59.231
You roll your commission in.

00:23:59.231 --> 00:23:59.900
So they did.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.220
They bought that building.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.370
They bought that building
in 1976 for $110,000.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.930
They put $11,000
down, $5,500 each.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.030
That was my dad's
commission he rolled in.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:12.470
And as I'm standing
in this line,

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:16.165
holding this check for $6,000
I started thinking, wow,

00:24:16.165 --> 00:24:17.540
what is the Return
On Investment,

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:22.170
the ROI on a $5,500 investment
that returned $6,000?

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.680
Well, it's over 100%, isn't it?

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.639
But I thought about it.

00:24:25.639 --> 00:24:27.055
I thought, well,
that's not really

00:24:27.055 --> 00:24:29.420
the right way to figure a
return on investment, is it?

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.420
Because in real estate we always
talk in annualized numbers,

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.500
don't we?

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.780
So if you want to look at
it as an annualized number

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.160
it's really $72,000 a year.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.630
I thought, wow, that's amazing.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:44.164
A $5,500 investment that
returns $72,000 a year.

00:24:44.164 --> 00:24:45.830
So I was starting to
figure out the ROI,

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.485
and I thought, wait,
that's not right either.

00:24:47.485 --> 00:24:49.359
That's not the right
way to figure it either.

00:24:49.359 --> 00:24:52.910
Because you really have to look
at all the positive cash flow.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.312
And the building's been
paid off for 20 years.

00:24:55.312 --> 00:24:57.020
Now, I've been doing
the books that long,

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.540
so I happen to know it
hasn't been $6,000 a month.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.970
But on average it
was $4,000 a month.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:06.510
So if you look at $4,000 a
month, times 12 months, well,

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.480
that's $48,000 a year.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.800
Multiply that by 20, you
have $960,000, don't you?

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.720
So a $5,500 investment
that returns $960,000

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.276
of positive cash flow?

00:25:19.276 --> 00:25:20.900
So I started to figure
the ROI on that.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.600
And I thought, wait, wait,
wait, that's not right either.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.766
Because we also have to
consider the first 20 years.

00:25:25.766 --> 00:25:29.210
Because, remember, this is a
self-funding, self-sustaining

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:30.030
investment.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:32.810
And those tenant dollars,
remember that phase two

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:34.830
where the tenant dollars
come in to pay down?

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:35.788
Got to figure that too.

00:25:35.788 --> 00:25:38.030
Those were dollars that
came in to pay this off.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:41.729
Now, it wasn't $4,000
a month back then.

00:25:41.729 --> 00:25:42.770
But you know what it was?

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:43.970
It was $2,000.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:49.180
So if you look at that, $2,000
a month, times 240 months,

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.020
well, that's $480,000.

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:55.610
You add that to the $960,000,
you come up with $1,440,000.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:59.180
I thought, OK, a
$5,500 investment

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.180
that returns $1,440,000.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.409
What is the ROI on that?

00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:04.700
And I start to figure that out.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.410
And I said, wait a second.

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:07.830
That's not right either.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.970
Because we're only talking about
the cash flow here, aren't we?

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:14.630
You see, real estate has
multiple streams of income.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.250
There's also tax advantages.

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:17.469
There's 1031s.

00:26:17.469 --> 00:26:18.260
There's write offs.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.389
There's depreciations.

00:26:19.389 --> 00:26:20.930
My head wants to
explode when I start

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:22.013
to think about that stuff.

00:26:22.013 --> 00:26:23.690
I leave that for the CPA.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:25.850
But let's talk
about the big dog.

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.380
What about appreciation?

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:30.200
That's where people really
make money in real estate.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.370
It's appreciation, isn't it?

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:36.500
So this building that my
parents paid $110,000 for

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.916
is currently valued
at $2.7 million.

00:26:40.916 --> 00:26:41.870
All right.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:45.470
But remember, they had a
partner with this, didn't they?

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:50.090
So their value of the
building would be $1,350,000.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:55.100
Now, if you add that $1,350,000
to the $1,440,000 of cash

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.900
that came in over
those years, you

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:02.480
get $2,790,000 on a
$5,500 investment?

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:02.980
So OK.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:03.959
I started thinking.

00:27:03.959 --> 00:27:06.500
And now I have all the numbers
to figure out what the ROI is.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.390
And just as I was starting
to calculate that,

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.330
I thought that's
not right either.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:12.350
You know why?

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:14.630
Because next month
there's another check.

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:16.370
And the month after that.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:17.840
It goes on and on, doesn't it?

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:22.790
So what is the ROI on a $5,500
investment that generates

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:26.480
$2.7 million and counting?

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.720
I'll tell you what it is.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.360
It's financial freedom.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.984
It is true wealth.

00:27:31.984 --> 00:27:33.650
That's what the return
on investment is.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:34.970
It's true wealth.

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:36.890
And what is true wealth?

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.350
True wealth is
financial peace of mind.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.890
It's safe, secure,
dependable cash flow.

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:46.380
It's money you can count
on, month after month,

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.610
year after year,
decade after decade.

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:52.790
That, to me, is true wealth.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.525
Let me give you a statistic.

00:27:54.525 --> 00:27:56.150
I thought this was
kind of interesting.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:28:00.350
60% of Americans feel somewhat
confident about having

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:02.750
enough money to retire.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:06.320
But only 18% feel
truly confident they

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.860
have enough money.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.780
My parents were
part of that 18%.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.170
My family was part of that 18%.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.200
My clients were all
part of that 18%.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.480
Everybody here should
be part of that 18%.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.740
You should have that confidence
that you have enough money

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.080
to retire.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.700
Life is full of
choices, isn't it?

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.750
And where you decide to
invest your money is a choice,

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:29.950
isn't it?

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:31.800
So, to me, the idea
of investing in

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.320
a self-funding, self-sustaining
investment that continues

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.590
to grow even during
distributions, as compared

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:41.460
to a continually
diminishing portfolio, well,

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.060
there's no question at all.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:47.830
I mean, the answer's as
simple as, well, this, right?

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:49.720
Pretty easy answer.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:55.380
I titled my book
"Destination Perpetuity,"

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.630
because the word
perpetuity means

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.720
an annuity that has no end,
or a stream of cash that

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.960
lasts forever.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.040
That is what real estate
investing can and should be.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.872
Thank you very
much for your time.

00:29:06.872 --> 00:29:09.704
[CLAPPING]

00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:13.240
If you have some questions,
I'll be here for a few minutes.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.180
Yeah.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:14.430
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.510
SPEAKER 1: Oh, let me
throw the mic back to you.

00:29:20.849 --> 00:29:21.640
AUDIENCE: Holy cow.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.339
That's awesome.

00:29:22.339 --> 00:29:23.130
Never seen the mic.

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:24.990
SPEAKER 1: Google has
the coolest stuff.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.220
AUDIENCE: This is
comfortable to hold too.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:27.940
Quick question.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.070
Going back to the numbers
you were presenting,

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:31.660
that was really
interesting, but I

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:37.240
struggled to follow where the
mortgage payment, and taxes,

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.640
and insurance, and capital
expenditures and all that

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.390
was accounted for.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:40.600
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Yeah.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.099
Sure.

00:29:41.099 --> 00:29:44.290
So the first 20
years, all of that,

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:46.480
the tenant funding
dollars go in.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.760
They pay off all that.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.340
AUDIENCE: Was it a $4,000
net operating income?

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.290
It was your cash flow?

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.230
CRAIG O'ROURKE: The
$6,000 and the $4,000?

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.730
Yeah.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:58.270
So that check I was
holding in that bank line?

00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:59.920
That's in the pocket.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.690
That's your net.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:01.190
Yes.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:03.520
That's after everything
has been paid.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.110
So the mortgage was
already gone at that point.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:08.770
But that's after the taxes,
the insurance, the property

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:12.430
manager, after money is put
away in a rainy day fund.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.620
Those are your net in the
pocket pre-tax dollars.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:15.160
Yes.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:19.000
AUDIENCE: So your numbers
started after that 90% debt?

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.340
It was 90% leveraged, right?

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.749
5% down from your dad.

00:30:21.749 --> 00:30:23.290
CRAIG O'ROURKE: So
the first 20 years

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:24.550
the building was paid off.

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:25.630
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:28.390
Your numbers aren't
correlating to that timeframe?

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:28.960
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Oh, they didn't?

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.500
I have to go back and look.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:29.740
AUDIENCE: Oh, no.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:30.740
I'm wondering.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:31.450
I was confirming.

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:32.330
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Oh, OK.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:32.860
Yeah.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:33.444
I know.

00:30:33.444 --> 00:30:35.110
Those slides, I've
got to clean them up.

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:37.510
They always confuse people.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:39.620
And it goes too fast too.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:43.240
So the first 20 years the
building got paid off.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.219
And that's a good rule
of thumb for anybody

00:30:46.219 --> 00:30:47.260
investing in real estate.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.044
You should really
try and create a plan

00:30:49.044 --> 00:30:50.710
that pays your building
off in 20 years.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:52.420
I'm looking at some
very young people here.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.795
You pay your building off in
20 years when you're my age,

00:30:54.795 --> 00:30:56.240
you have that cash
flow building.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.270
That's sort of the idea of it.

00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.950
And then the next
20 years you still

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:03.490
have taxes, and insurance,
and all of that.

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:07.690
But because of the
magic of inflation,

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:09.460
those dollars are
always big enough

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:13.402
to then sustain extra cash
flow for the investor.

00:31:13.402 --> 00:31:14.110
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.330
Thank you.

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:15.222
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Yep.

00:31:15.222 --> 00:31:16.090
Anybody else?

00:31:21.374 --> 00:31:22.040
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.420
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Hi.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.670
AUDIENCE: So obviously
California's super expensive.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.394
If you want to buy anywhere in
LA, It's basically $1 million,

00:31:28.394 --> 00:31:29.810
which is a couple
hundred thousand

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:31.770
down for a down payment.

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:34.430
So even if you split it with a
couple people, it's expensive.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:37.040
What are your thoughts
on buying an investment

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.410
property in another state,
even if you're not there

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:40.520
to kind of manage it?

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.186
CRAIG O'ROURKE: That's
a great question.

00:31:42.186 --> 00:31:43.610
So keep this in mind.

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:47.090
That same argument
you have right there

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:49.490
was what people were
having 40 years ago.

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:52.250
And they'll be having
40 years from now.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:54.110
So you can buy in other states.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:56.330
You can buy in other
parts of LA or other parts

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:57.470
of Southern California.

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:58.940
Risk equals reward.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.692
And when I work with
clients, and they

00:32:01.692 --> 00:32:03.275
want to buy income
producing property,

00:32:03.275 --> 00:32:04.340
I always ask them
the same thing.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.631
I always say, what do you want?

00:32:05.631 --> 00:32:07.945
Do you want cash flow, or
do you want to grow equity?

00:32:07.945 --> 00:32:09.528
And what do you think
they always say?

00:32:09.528 --> 00:32:10.130
Both.

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:11.960
That's what everybody
wants, right?

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.380
But you do have to make choices.

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.130
In other words, we're
in Venice right now.

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:19.520
So if we go to buy an income
producing property in Venice,

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.040
our cap rate's probably going
to be about maybe 2% or 3%.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:22.539
Right?

00:32:22.539 --> 00:32:23.217
It's really bad.

00:32:23.217 --> 00:32:24.800
It's going to take
you forever to cash

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.008
flow on a property like that.

00:32:26.008 --> 00:32:28.790
But what was our appreciation
rate in Venice last year?

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:29.950
It's like 8%.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.850
It's crazy, right?

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.010
So now if we take
those same dollars,

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:35.730
and I'll give you
a perfect example.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.220
I have a client that I sold
his property in Redondo Beach.

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.303
And he wanted to re-invest
in Southern California.

00:32:40.303 --> 00:32:41.780
And the cap rates were not good.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.780
They were like 5% or 6%.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.400
And he said, you know Craig,
I'm going to take my money

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.530
and move it to Ohio.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.175
I can get a 9% cap, 10% cap.

00:32:47.175 --> 00:32:49.550
That's basically your rate of
return on the money, right.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.870
And I said, OK.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:51.940
But he was young.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.050
He was 38, 39 years old.

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:56.000
I said, but are you sure
you want to do that?

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.810
He said, why?

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:58.880
He said, I have owned
buildings there for years

00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.630
and they cash flow great.

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:01.088
And I said, how do
they appreciate?

00:33:01.088 --> 00:33:01.965
He goes, they don't.

00:33:01.965 --> 00:33:03.340
That's where you
make your money.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.550
So you have to create a plan.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.760
You have to say, what do
I really want out of this?

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.130
So looking in these, if
everybody here came to me

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:11.796
and said, I want to
invest some dollars,

00:33:11.796 --> 00:33:15.140
I'd say appreciation
dollars first, and then

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.050
cash flow dollars.

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:18.860
So we have this beautiful thing
called the 1031 tax exchange.

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.026
So what I do with clients
when they come to me early

00:33:21.026 --> 00:33:26.150
on in their 20s or 30s,
like that, even in your 40s,

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:28.040
my idea of a good plan
would be to invest

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.480
someplace that's appreciating.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.160
Don't worry about
the cash flow yet.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.030
Let it appreciate.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.669
Get those appreciation dollars.

00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:36.210
Because that's where you make
your real money in real estate.

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.126
Then when you have those
appreciation dollars,

00:33:38.126 --> 00:33:40.100
you do a 1031 tax
exchange, which

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.310
means the IRS allows you
to, not sell that building,

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.500
but trade that building
for another property.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.950
So in other words, your
taxes are deferred.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:48.950
There's no tax dollars
coming out of your pocket

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.570
until you would ever sell it.

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:51.950
You take all of that equity.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:53.870
And you move it into
another property

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:57.170
that has a better cap rate.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:59.860
I did that with some clients
just a few years ago.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.520
I started working with
them almost 20 years ago.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.380
And we built this beautiful
appreciation portfolio

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.929
in the South Bay, Manhattan
Beach, Hermosa Beach,

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:09.710
Redondo Beach.

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.270
And they bought all
these properties.

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.370
And for 20 years they just
let them grow in appreciation.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.050
Didn't really have
any money coming in

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:16.639
that they could put
in their pocket.

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:18.620
The tenants funded
all the bills.

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:22.089
But then when they were ready
to retire in their late 40s,

00:34:22.089 --> 00:34:22.880
we sold everything.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.860
We moved everything
down to Long Beach.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.540
And their cap rate tripled.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.340
And suddenly they had
six figures a year

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.600
to retire off of.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.858
So you have to plan it out.

00:34:30.858 --> 00:34:31.399
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:31.399 --> 00:34:32.082
Thanks.

00:34:32.082 --> 00:34:33.290
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Anybody else?

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:33.790
Yes.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.150
Good shot.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:38.670
Wow.

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:40.745
AUDIENCE: Not a very
good catch, though.

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:43.120
Do you think there's any value
to flipping houses, buying

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.036
houses that are not good,
or buying empty land

00:34:45.036 --> 00:34:46.420
and then developing them?

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:46.719
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Yeah.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:48.520
Well, there's two
different questions.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:52.030
One's developing
and one's flipping.

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.790
This is a tough
market for flipping.

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:55.960
You're about eight
years too late.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.140
But we cycle through those
markets all the time.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.040
And there are deals out there.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.232
I just worked with a
developer recently.

00:35:03.232 --> 00:35:05.440
A year ago I found him a
property that he could flip.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:10.610
And we're just working with
counteroffers right now.

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:12.130
But he's a very
shrewd developer.

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:13.510
He knows exactly
what he's doing.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:14.620
He's got a crew.

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.390
And he's going to make a
couple hundred thousand dollars

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.890
off it.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.580
But those deals are very
hard to find at the moment.

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.250
But we do cycle
through those deals.

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:23.320
Developing is different also.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.080
Developers have to
look at properties.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:28.600
They have to put on their
own developer glasses

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.060
and look two to three
years out, depending

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.910
on what you're selling,
what you're trying to build.

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:36.309
And then you have to
guess what the market will

00:35:36.309 --> 00:35:37.600
be like when you go to sell it.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.100
What will interest
rates be like?

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.686
What will our economy be like?

00:35:40.686 --> 00:35:42.060
So, again, seven,
eight years ago

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.140
it was easier to see
this steamroller.

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:48.051
Now, I personally think that
we're in a very good economy

00:35:48.051 --> 00:35:48.550
right now.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:53.356
I personally think
our economy is on a--

00:35:53.356 --> 00:35:56.680
I think we're going to do
nothing but grow right now.

00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.100
But with that growth comes
higher interest rates too.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:00.760
Right?

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.600
So it's a double
edged sword, isn't it?

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.900
So anybody thinking
about buying,

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.420
do it today,
because you're never

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:09.320
going to see these
interest rates again.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.200
So even if you think
prices are too high,

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.280
don't worry about
it, because when

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.900
you buy real estate, whether
it's income producing

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.640
real estate, or real
estate you live in,

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.098
what you have to realize is,
you're not buying real estate.

00:36:18.098 --> 00:36:20.120
You're buying a payment.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.630
And when you buy a payment
attached to interest rates

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:26.440
like today, it doesn't matter if
the real estate goes like this.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:29.456
As long as you're buying it with
a 10 year plan, you'll be fine.

00:36:29.456 --> 00:36:31.330
So don't ever buy real
estate with short term

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:34.420
plans like flipping, because
that's how you can get burned.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.200
I'm very conservative.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.240
The safest way to
buy real estate--

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.940
My theory is never sell
anything, by the way.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.330
But that doesn't mean you
can't trade it, do a 1031,

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:47.429
or something like that.

00:36:47.429 --> 00:36:49.720
And I never buy anything with
less than a 10 year plan.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.610
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:51.382
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Personally.

00:36:51.382 --> 00:36:51.923
Anybody else?

00:36:51.923 --> 00:36:53.642
Yeah.

00:36:53.642 --> 00:36:54.247
Go.

00:36:54.247 --> 00:36:56.080
AUDIENCE: What do you
think about for people

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.880
that currently rent?

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.840
Should you be prioritizing
buying a place to live in,

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.420
or should the investment
idea kind of be

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.800
parallel to where you're living?

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.060
Because it's hard to save for
a down payment to live, and to

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.120
do this investment.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:11.650
CRAIG O'ROURKE: That's
a good question.

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:12.820
That's a lifestyle question.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:14.620
It's also a tax question.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:18.010
I would probably say
to you, buy a place

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:20.080
to live in if you like
where you're going to be.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.270
If you know you're going to
be here at Google for a while,

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:23.830
and you're stable in
your job, and you're

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:25.746
stable in your community,
buy a place to live,

00:37:25.746 --> 00:37:29.080
because the tax write offs
for your personal residence

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:32.050
are going to outweigh the tax
write offs for an investment

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:32.920
property.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.660
And what you can do
when you go to sell

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:38.380
that property, or better
yet, trade that property,

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.900
you can then move that equity
into an income producing

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.160
property if you want.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.060
So you can do that.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.910
But in Venice and
other areas of LA

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:51.760
right now, the average
renter, if you have 20% down,

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.119
you can buy and own
for less than you

00:37:54.119 --> 00:37:55.660
can rent when you
figure all your tax

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:56.840
savings and your deductions.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.480
So if you're renting
right now and you

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.460
can afford to buy, buy it,
because these interest rates,

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.929
we'll never see them again.

00:38:03.929 --> 00:38:04.470
Anybody else?

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:10.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.350
So I have two questions.

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:13.490
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Sure.

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:15.198
AUDIENCE: The first
one is simpler maybe.

00:38:17.219 --> 00:38:19.010
In terms of your
credentials, why don't you

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:21.270
just brag about
your own portfolio

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:22.986
and how this has helped you?

00:38:22.986 --> 00:38:24.110
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Well, yeah.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:27.011
I mean, it's great.

00:38:27.011 --> 00:38:27.880
I will.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:28.900
I'll brag about that.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:29.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:33.600
And I'll also tell
you what I did wrong.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:34.820
So here's my story.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:37.100
I started investing when
I was in my early 20s.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:41.160
And by the time I got to
44 or so, I was retired.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:41.660
I was done.

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.720
I had all the positive cash
flow I needed to retire.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.690
And then I started
seeing these investments

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:48.230
that looked really good.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:50.030
A little bit too good maybe?

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:52.685
And one by one I started selling
properties off and investing

00:38:52.685 --> 00:38:53.810
in these other investments.

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:55.670
It turned out to
be a Ponzi scheme.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:57.275
I lost almost everything.

00:38:57.275 --> 00:39:00.320
And by the time I was
50 I had to start over.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:05.450
58, next month, right
back where I needed to be.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:08.040
I had great focus,
and it was my career,

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.740
so it was not hard for me to do.

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:11.504
I did have a little
bit of real estate

00:39:11.504 --> 00:39:13.670
that I was able to play
with and move things around.

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:16.020
And I knew how to watch the
market and see where to go.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.030
But I've done it twice.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.297
It works.

00:39:18.297 --> 00:39:19.130
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:21.706
And then the second question
is, is your advice to people--

00:39:21.706 --> 00:39:23.830
and maybe you already
answered this, so forgive me,

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.780
but is your advice to people
who don't have that much cash

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.145
to partner with other people?

00:39:28.145 --> 00:39:29.020
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Yeah.

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.410
I talk about that in my book.

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:32.970
Talk about double
edged swords again.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:33.890
They're good and they're bad.

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:36.015
You have to really be
careful who you partner with.

00:39:36.015 --> 00:39:39.440
And even if it's your
best friend, or a sibling,

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.600
or whatever, get
everything in writing.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.660
And most importantly, get a
good exit strategy in writing.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.682
Because invariably, if you
two guys partner on something,

00:39:47.682 --> 00:39:49.890
one of you is going to want
out before the other one.

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:50.960
And it's going to be a problem.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.310
So you have to create
an exit strategy.

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:53.310
You have to do all that.

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:56.080
But it is one of the best
ways to own real estate.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.730
And I've owned I don't even know
how many pieces of property.

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:02.372
And I've owned dozens and dozens
of properties in partnerships.

00:40:02.372 --> 00:40:04.580
And just you have to be
careful who you partner with.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.920
And you have to be very
clear on who's doing what,

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.600
and how you're getting out.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.330
And then partnerships are fine.

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:11.449
Yeah.

00:40:11.449 --> 00:40:11.949
Yes.

00:40:16.674 --> 00:40:18.340
AUDIENCE: I bought
management companies.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:20.590
I've heard stories, good
stories and bad stories.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:22.390
Like oh, we'll take
away all your headache.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:23.620
And then some of it
is like, oh my god,

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.661
if I've done it myself it
would have been better,

00:40:25.661 --> 00:40:26.886
save me way more money.

00:40:26.886 --> 00:40:27.760
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Yeah.

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.600
AUDIENCE: Any?

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.475
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Yeah.

00:40:29.475 --> 00:40:31.270
It's management-- [SIGHS] Yeah.

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:32.610
AUDIENCE: Because if you
have so many properties

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.060
you're going to have
management for sure.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:34.600
CRAIG O'ROURKE: I know.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.641
AUDIENCE: Do it yourself.

00:40:35.641 --> 00:40:39.410
CRAIG O'ROURKE: So we have seven
properties, my family and I.

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:42.970
And we have some we
manage ourselves, some

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:45.601
we have property managers for.

00:40:45.601 --> 00:40:46.600
It's like anything else.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.790
It's hard to find good
property managers.

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:54.760
So if you're going to invest in
income producing real estate,

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.190
I would almost find a good
property manager first.

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:59.764
And the best way to do
that is talk to people

00:40:59.764 --> 00:41:01.930
that you know that own
income producing real estate.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.160
Ask them who they use.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.000
Get references.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.020
Get referrals.

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:05.650
Go online.

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:07.040
Check everybody out.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.790
There's some really
good people out there.

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:11.290
And you shouldn't have to
pay more than about 5% or 6%

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:12.859
for a really good
property manager.

00:41:12.859 --> 00:41:15.400
And I will tell you this, if
you get a good property manager,

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.150
they'll actually
make you more money.

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:19.180
Because what they
do is they are going

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.559
to keep your units filled.

00:41:20.559 --> 00:41:22.600
They're going to keep them
filled at market rent.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.220
If there's a problem, they're
going to take care of it,

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.030
not you.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:27.760
So property management
is the way to go.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.760
But you have to be very careful
who you choose as your property

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.331
manager.

00:41:31.331 --> 00:41:31.830
Yes?

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:39.110
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
to hear how the new tax

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:41.675
laws are affecting 1031
exchanges and write offs.

00:41:41.675 --> 00:41:42.550
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Yeah.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:44.870
Well, there's no
effect with 1031s.

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:47.460
But write offs,
depreciation is a big deal.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:48.770
That's a big, big deal.

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:52.010
So what's happening is that
your primary residence is now

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:54.350
capped at $800,000.

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:59.100
So that's going to be a game
changer for real estate.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.560
Now, I live in Redondo Beach.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.120
So our neighboring community
is Manhattan Beach.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.620
And the joke there is everybody
lives in a McMansion, right?

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:10.880
They're these giant houses,
3,500, 4,000 square feet.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.110
The yard's about as
big as this stage.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:16.190
And everybody moved
in there 25 years ago.

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:17.480
And they were really popular.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.580
And everybody paid like $1
million or $2 million for them.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.121
Well, now they're worth about
$2.5 million in today's market,

00:42:22.121 --> 00:42:22.730
right?

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:27.490
But my crystal ball says, people
aren't going to want those.

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:31.710
Because, first of all, they're
all filled with empty nesters.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:34.740
They don't want to go up and
down those stairs anymore.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:35.850
And the house is too big.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:36.990
They're going to
try and sell them.

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.650
And guess what.

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:41.160
If I'm going to buy a house, I'm
not going to buy a $2.5 million

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.310
giant box that I
can only write off

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:45.900
maybe a third of my interest.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.650
So that portion of the market
is really going to be impacted.

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:53.990
Now, I would say that the
$1.4 million and less market--

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:56.490
good luck finding something
like that anywhere around here--

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.640
but that market's
going to be very solid.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:03.250
So the real estate community
is going to change.

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:06.630
And, as all of that's going
on with these new tax laws,

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:09.390
mark my words, interest
rates are going up this year

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:10.560
big time.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.170
So with the new
incoming Fed chief,

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:16.450
you're probably going to see at
least three raises this year,

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:17.920
if not more.

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.379
And I think they'll
be significant.

00:43:19.379 --> 00:43:21.211
They're not going to
be Janet Yellen raises.

00:43:21.211 --> 00:43:22.650
They're going to be real raises.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:26.400
So we're going to be
in a shifting economy.

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.382
So if I was planning
on buying something,

00:43:28.382 --> 00:43:29.340
what would I buy today?

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.415
I'd try and probably look
for a primary residence.

00:43:32.415 --> 00:43:34.407
If I didn't have
only 20% to put down,

00:43:34.407 --> 00:43:36.990
I'd probably look for something
at $1.4 million, $1.3 million,

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:40.680
something like that to maximize
as much of that $800,000 as I

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:41.275
could.

00:43:41.275 --> 00:43:43.980
But I'd get in the interest
rate game right now.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:45.490
Because that's going to change.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:46.323
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:46.323 --> 00:43:47.630
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Anybody else?

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:48.210
Yes.

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:49.585
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering, if you

00:43:49.585 --> 00:43:51.540
were to choose an
investment, would you

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:54.270
prefer, assuming they
are the same price

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:56.330
range, single family,
versus multi unit,

00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:57.955
versus a condo in a complex?

00:43:57.955 --> 00:43:58.830
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Yeah.

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:00.420
Great question.

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:04.020
And I'll take those in
order of what I believe

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:05.280
to be the least desirable.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.380
And that's the condo.

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:11.010
Condo is least desirable because
when markets shift they always

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:12.330
get hurt the worst.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:14.330
You have the least
control over a condo,

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:16.050
and the least control
of your finances

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:18.300
because you also have
an association that's

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.600
controlling how much you have
to spend every single month.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.690
And the desirability
of resale is

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:26.220
much less than a single family.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:27.870
So condos are the
least desirable.

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:30.000
Single family is in the middle.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.140
Single family is great.

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.460
Always going to have a
single family market.

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.390
People love those.

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:35.350
They always appreciate
really well.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:38.181
But the multi-family will do
better as an investment always.

00:44:38.181 --> 00:44:38.680
Why?

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.100
It's because what we
call the number of doors.

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.530
So doors refers to how
many tenants you have.

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:46.290
So if you have a single
family home over here,

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:48.330
and you have a three
unit building over here,

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:50.705
and you have a vacancy over
here, you got a 100% vacancy.

00:44:50.705 --> 00:44:54.300
If you got a vacancy over
here, you have a 1/3 vacancy.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:45:01.519
And everything, your
costs always get so much--

00:45:01.519 --> 00:45:02.810
the words are escaping me here.

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:06.330
There's a cost benefit basically
to having multiple units.

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.190
And you'll always,
always do better.

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:10.740
Investors look for as
many doors as they can.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:12.900
So somebody who's
really a big time

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.051
investor in the multi-family,
they want a huge complex.

00:45:16.051 --> 00:45:17.550
They want as many
doors as they can,

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:19.049
because that's
really where you make

00:45:19.049 --> 00:45:20.720
your money is the
number of doors,

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.011
the number of tenants you have.

00:45:22.011 --> 00:45:23.740
And that's the safest
way to go as well.

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:24.490
Anybody else?

00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:25.656
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:27.630
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Yes.

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:29.310
AUDIENCE: So I was
wondering if you

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:32.460
had any thoughts on commercial
versus residential real estate,

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:36.552
and basically if there's
different strategies that you

00:45:36.552 --> 00:45:37.510
need to take with each?

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:39.219
And what are the things
to caution about?

00:45:39.219 --> 00:45:40.093
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Sure.

00:45:40.093 --> 00:45:41.100
Risk equals reward.

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.610
And it's interesting.

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:45.990
I own commercial properties.

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:49.670
And we also own residential
income producing properties.

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:52.260
The commercial properties,
a few years ago

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.570
when the economy melted
down, what happened?

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:56.370
What happened?

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:57.630
The stock market failed.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:01.700
Real estate prices plummeted,
and businesses shuttered down,

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.220
right?

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.170
So there went your
commercial real estate.

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:06.320
What happened to multi-family?

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.670
Bulletproof.

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:10.470
As a matter of fact, so many
people lost their homes,

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:13.320
there was such a big pool
of renters, prices went up.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:15.780
When was the last time you
heard rents are going down?

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:17.700
It just doesn't happen.

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:22.420
Residential income producing
real estate, in my book

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:27.780
I talk about it being
recession resilient.

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.356
I wanted to put recession
proof, but my publisher

00:46:30.356 --> 00:46:31.355
said I couldn't do that.

00:46:31.355 --> 00:46:32.030
I'd get sued.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:34.290
But recession resilient.

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:36.950
I believe it's recession proof
if you buy in the right area.

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:39.200
When was the last time you
heard rents are going down?

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.590
It doesn't happen.

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:41.812
But with commercial, it does.

00:46:41.812 --> 00:46:43.020
Commercial goes through that.

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.870
Plus with commercial, like I
own a couple of warehouses.

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:48.930
And both of them I've
split into two pieces.

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:51.120
They were single, but I
put two tenants in there

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.760
just to mitigate in
case one moves out.

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.900
But I've had both of
those dark at times.

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:58.960
Now, I get a much better rate of
return, a much better cap rate,

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.310
if you will, off of my
commercial properties.

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:05.310
But I don't lose any sleep
off my residential income

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:08.060
properties, especially if I
have a good property manager.

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:08.610
Anybody else?

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.150
AUDIENCE: For someone who
wants to get into or add

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:17.060
real estate as part
of their portfolio,

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:19.620
but does not want to do
anything with buying,

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.810
management property,
et cetera, is there

00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:24.150
an easy way where I can
just give my cash to someone

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:26.310
and get some of a return?

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:28.500
I mean, there's REITs,
but peer to peer stuff.

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.910
Do you have a
recommendation for someone?

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:30.180
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Yeah.

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:30.960
Give it to me.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.880
I'll take care of it.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:34.970
No.

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:35.970
REITs are fine.

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:37.527
But keep in mind,
when you own REITs,

00:47:37.527 --> 00:47:38.610
you don't own real estate.

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:39.990
You own stock.

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:41.040
That's different.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:47.310
So there are groups
that do that.

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:50.366
And, again, it's kind of
like the property management

00:47:50.366 --> 00:47:50.865
question.

00:47:50.865 --> 00:47:54.334
It's like, who are you
giving your money to?

00:47:54.334 --> 00:47:57.630
I've just seen too many
people hurt on those.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:01.290
Personally I think if you're
going to be a real estate

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:04.470
investor, and there
is work to it,

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:06.840
and there's work the
entire time you own it,

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:11.130
I think you have to be hands
on, or probably then just buy

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:12.090
a single family home.

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:13.865
And that is your
real estate nest egg.

00:48:21.399 --> 00:48:23.690
AUDIENCE: Actually my question
was exactly why not just

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:27.970
buy like that fund in our 401k?

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:29.460
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Exactly.

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:30.470
That's stocks.

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:31.040
That's REITs.

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:36.540
But you don't have as
much control over that.

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:39.740
And you have a different
set of write offs.

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:42.740
So you can certainly invest
in real estate that way.

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:45.530
But when you invest with
a portfolio like that,

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:48.785
somebody else is making
those bigger choices for you.

00:48:48.785 --> 00:48:51.050
You're deciding when to buy
and when to sell, right?

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:53.660
But what is invested
in is different.

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:55.970
And there's a cost to that.

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:59.660
Because those people that run
the REITs are getting paid.

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:01.940
So there's a large
amount of what

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:04.260
could be your profit
that's going to them.

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.500
So if you make those
choices yourself,

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.510
you're gaining all
that profit yourself.

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:09.760
It's just a different
theory of investing.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:09.912
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:49:09.912 --> 00:49:10.470
Thanks.

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:12.350
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Yeah.

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:14.749
Yes.

00:49:14.749 --> 00:49:15.290
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:17.990
Do you have any tips
for market research

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:19.880
except looking at cap rates?

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:23.349
Like other things that
you would look at?

00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:25.640
CRAIG O'ROURKE: My tip is
get a good real estate agent.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:26.240
Seriously.

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.850
I mean, that's my
best tip is find

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:32.499
somebody who's a professional
in the area you want to look at.

00:49:32.499 --> 00:49:33.040
AUDIENCE: No.

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.670
I mean, like research for areas.

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:37.480
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Oh,
research for areas.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.740
You know, that's
a good question.

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:42.601
And that's a fluid question
too, because areas are always

00:49:42.601 --> 00:49:43.100
gentrifying.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.290
Like right now everybody's
excited about Inglewood.

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:46.240
The stadium's going in there.

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.510
What's going to
happen with Inglewood.

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:49.301
And people are excited
about Hawthorne too.

00:49:49.301 --> 00:49:52.710
Is SpaceX going to buy the
Toyota space and move in there?

00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:55.730
So there's all these sort
of fluid things going on.

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:58.580
Right now in Southern California
we're in such a good market

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:01.460
I think that you're fine
almost wherever you go.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.410
But look at anybody
that bought real estate

00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:05.510
15 years ago in Venice.

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:06.470
My gosh, right?

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:09.140
Just unbelievable.

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.240
So you see something
happening like Google

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:13.237
moving into a neighborhood,
put money there.

00:50:13.237 --> 00:50:14.820
There's all kinds
of things like that.

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:17.870
So you have to watch
for the opportunities.

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:21.467
And you just have to
be cognizant of what's

00:50:21.467 --> 00:50:22.300
going on around you.

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:27.290
Anybody else?

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:28.710
AUDIENCE: So I have a question.

00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:30.950
So basically if you
have two options,

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:34.100
one is a really nice house
on a smaller piece of land,

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:37.470
versus a crappy house on
a large piece of land.

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:39.540
So if you wanted to
choose between the two,

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:41.090
what is the trade off?

00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:43.010
CRAIG O'ROURKE:
Buy the crappy one.

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:43.760
Always.

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.770
Always.

00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:50.870
You always want to buy the worst
house in the best neighborhood.

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:53.450
Location, location, location.

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:57.445
Those are truly the three
rules of real estate.

00:50:57.445 --> 00:50:59.570
And if you're a handy guy,
and you can get in there

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:01.361
and fix it yourself,
or you have the money,

00:51:01.361 --> 00:51:02.772
that's a great opportunity.

00:51:02.772 --> 00:51:04.730
Because that property,
if somebody's selling it

00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:08.240
in a condition like that
where it's falling apart,

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.270
it's been priced
accordingly, or you're

00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:11.999
going to pay for it accordingly.

00:51:11.999 --> 00:51:13.790
And then you create
what you want it to be.

00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:15.860
You go in, and you decide
what floors you want,

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.110
and countertops, and all that.

00:51:17.110 --> 00:51:18.740
You make it your own, especially
if you're going to live there.

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:20.750
And even if you're going to rent
it out, you do the same thing.

00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:22.490
But you'll always
want to buy, if you

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:24.500
have the time, and the
energy, and the willpower

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:25.520
to go through all that.

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.607
Because it's a lot.

00:51:26.607 --> 00:51:28.190
But it's like with
somebody else asked

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.260
about property management.

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:32.390
Real estate you'll
always be involved

00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:34.280
in maintaining
that to some level,

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.780
even if you have
property managers.

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:37.640
So if you're not scared
of that, if you're not

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.223
scared of taking that property
and making it something better,

00:51:40.223 --> 00:51:41.660
that's the opportunity.

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:42.200
Yes.

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:44.241
AUDIENCE: So this might
be an open ended question

00:51:44.241 --> 00:51:46.310
on your advice for
looking for tenants if I

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:47.580
don't have a management firm.

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:48.565
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Oh.

00:51:48.565 --> 00:51:50.065
AUDIENCE: Like how
long the contract

00:51:50.065 --> 00:51:52.430
is, and what do you look for in
a tenant if you're doing that?

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:55.013
CRAIG O'ROURKE: The first thing
you do is run a credit report.

00:51:55.013 --> 00:51:58.910
And what I always do,
I run a credit report,

00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:02.090
and I tell my prospective
tenant, here's a credit report.

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:02.990
You pay for it.

00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:07.010
If you have A plus credit,
I'll rent the place to you

00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:09.560
and pay for your credit report.

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.414
But if your credit's bad,
and I give him a break point,

00:52:12.414 --> 00:52:14.080
then you're paying
for the credit report

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.890
and I'm not renting it to you.

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:20.000
And what happens then is most
people who have bad credit

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.740
don't even run
the credit report.

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.340
They just go away on their own.

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.880
So once you get the credit
report, that's really

00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:28.430
what you're looking at, because
people that have good credit,

00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:30.370
they got there by
paying their bills.

00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:32.120
And that's really what
you're looking for.

00:52:36.539 --> 00:52:37.080
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:37.871
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Hi.

00:52:37.871 --> 00:52:40.700
AUDIENCE: So if you were to
be looking at an investment

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.890
property, like let's
say a fourplex,

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:45.710
and you're OK with it maybe
being like a long term

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:47.450
investment, like 10
years plus, you're

00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:50.530
going to kind of be more focused
on the long term appreciation

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:52.760
and keeping hold
of it, what would

00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:56.090
be a sort of minimum
cap rate that you

00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:58.250
would recommend purchasing at?

00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:02.570
And also do you want
something that perhaps needs

00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:05.960
a little bit of work,
so as tenants move out

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:09.440
you can kind of come in and do
a little bit of cosmetic fixing?

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.230
Do you want something that you
don't have to do anything to?

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:16.790
Not even like cosmetic
that has no vacancies,

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:18.377
and has a really low turnover?

00:53:18.377 --> 00:53:20.210
CRAIG O'ROURKE: You
have a lot of questions.

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.570
OK.

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:20.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:21.330
Sorry.

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:21.510
CRAIG O'ROURKE:
That's all right.

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:22.130
AUDIENCE: That was
like five questions.

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:23.390
CRAIG O'ROURKE: I
think I got them all.

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.690
OK.

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:24.770
So let's start
with the cap rate,

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.320
because that's really important.

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.430
Cap rates are area specific.

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:30.620
And they're also
property specific.

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:33.711
So like we said earlier,
cap rate here in Venice

00:53:33.711 --> 00:53:35.960
is probably about 2 and 1/2%,
3%, something like that.

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.630
Cap rate down in Long
Beach is about 6 and 1/2%.

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:40.730
So, again, I would say,
what is your motivation?

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:43.560
Are you buying for appreciation
or are you buying for cash

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.223
flow?

00:53:44.223 --> 00:53:45.806
If you say I want
both, then I'm going

00:53:45.806 --> 00:53:48.530
to find an area with
about 5% cap rate.

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:50.060
So that's the cap rate thing.

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.744
There's no right cap
rate or a wrong cap rate.

00:53:52.744 --> 00:53:54.410
There's a right cap
rate and a wrong cap

00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:57.380
rate for a specific area.

00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:59.900
And also for a
specific property too.

00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:04.580
Because even if
you're in Long Beach,

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:07.070
and you have one property
that has an ocean

00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:09.962
view and another one that's
next to a smelting factory,

00:54:09.962 --> 00:54:11.420
they look exactly
the same, they're

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:12.570
going to have different
cap rates because they're

00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:13.880
different desirabilities.

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.320
So those questions are
always very specific.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.290
Each property is so specific.

00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:22.130
But right now, in general,
most of my investors

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:23.690
are looking for a 5% cap.

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:26.492
And that's not
that easy to find.

00:54:26.492 --> 00:54:27.950
And so that's sort
of the hard part

00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:29.810
is finding that middle
of the road property.

00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:32.990
And that's where most
investor dollars are going.

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:34.230
Your other question.

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.820
Remind me?

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:36.680
AUDIENCE: It was, do you want to
buy something that maybe needs

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.480
a little bit of
light cosmetic work,

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.729
so that as a tenant moves
out you can do a little work

00:54:40.729 --> 00:54:41.810
and increase the rents?

00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:42.230
CRAIG O'ROURKE: Yeah.

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:43.460
Again, risk equals reward.

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:45.380
If you don't mind
doing that, you'll

00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:48.835
get a property
that probably will

00:54:48.835 --> 00:54:50.710
be on the market for a
little bit less money.

00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:52.340
And when they move
out, as long as you

00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:54.490
have sort of that
slush fund going,

00:54:54.490 --> 00:54:56.240
and you're willing to
spend those dollars.

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.440
Because when they
move out you will

00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.340
need to spend those dollars.

00:54:58.340 --> 00:54:59.120
You will need to paint.

00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.119
You will need to carpet.

00:55:00.119 --> 00:55:02.330
You will need to bring it
up to whatever the level is

00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:03.720
of that rental market.

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.470
So you have to really keep
those dollars on hand.

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:09.240
And depending on
what the property is,

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:10.865
depending on the
value of the property,

00:55:10.865 --> 00:55:13.130
it's healthy to keep a pretty
handy slush fund around,

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:14.090
because you never know.

00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:18.220
If all of a sudden three or
four people go dark at once

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:21.456
in a 10 unit building, that's
a lot of money going away.

00:55:21.456 --> 00:55:22.580
So you have to be prepared.

00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:24.890
Not only do you have to keep
your mortgage going, right?

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:26.300
Your taxes, your
insurance, all that.

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:27.840
But now you've got to
rehab all these units.

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.060
It usually doesn't
happen like that.

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:30.450
Usually people move
out one at a time.

00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:31.400
Usually they're
giving you notice.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.608
Usually it's lot more smooth.

00:55:32.608 --> 00:55:33.620
But you never know.

00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:34.620
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:35.120
Thank you.

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:37.870
