MALE SPEAKER: Hey, everyone.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:04.930
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.480
I'm from the privacy team
here at Google.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.770
Thank you for coming to this
Authors At Google talk.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.620
Let me tell you a little bit
about our guest today.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.670
He was born and raised just down
the road in Palo Alto.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.160
Tad Williams has held more
jobs than any sane person

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.200
would care to admit to.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.160
He's done singing in a band,
selling shoes, managing a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.800
financial institution, throwing
newspapers, and

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.320
designing military manuals,
just to name a few.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.090
As a writer, he has been one of
fantasy's most beloved and

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.770
brightest stars over 30 years,
and has written such

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.810
bestsellers as "Memory, Sorrow,
and Thorn" series, the

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.490
"Otherland" series, and the
"Shadowmarch" series.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.130
He's here today to talk to us
about "Happy Hour in Hell,"

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.250
the latest book in his
critically acclaimed "Bobby

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.110
Dollar" series.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.110
Please welcome Tad Williams.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.360
TAD WILLIAMS: Thank you.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.360
What I'm actually here today to
talk to you guys about is

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.440
pretty much anything we
want to talk about.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.760
I have some slightly formal type
things I could do, like

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.220
actually do a reading, but I'm
also perfectly happy just to

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.340
answer questions.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.630
I can ask questions, actually.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.460
I can do that, too.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.585
So I'm fairly casual
any which way.

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:20.350
Do you guys want to hear some
reading, or you want me just

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.810
to talk about stuff?

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.230
I mean, I'm very informal
with these things.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.380
Some of you seem to be familiar
with my work already.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.210
The gentleman here has already
made a sarcastic remark about

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.850
my inability to make deadlines,
so he clearly knows

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.020
something about me.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.910
So I'm just curious if anybody
has any preferences in terms

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.720
of what they want.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.780
I'm putting you on the
spot early, OK?

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.120
So I'm going to expect
feedback here.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.455
Anybody want a reading?

00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:48.400
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.700
TAD WILLIAMS: Yeah?

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.080
OK.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.590
I'll read a little section from
the first "Bobby Dollar"

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.740
book, because then I don't
have to explain all the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.210
different things.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.010
Well, I still have to explain,
but I don't have

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.470
to explain as much.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.160
The most important thing to
realize about these books--

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.410
the main character--

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.990
oh, that's my badge.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.360
That is not on the cover of
every book, I promise you.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.860
The main character in these
books is an angel.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.110
He's an Earthbound angel.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.570
He works for the heavenly
bureaucracy, and his job is

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.410
more or less to act as an
advocate or a public defender

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.000
for the souls of the
recently dead.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.360
And in the course of doing
this, normally, he has a

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.050
fairly normal sort
of on Earth life.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.700
He has an Earth body, he has
Earth friends, but he mostly

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.700
hangs out with other angels
who are doing the

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.560
same kind of thing.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.420
The book also takes place,
just in case there's

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.730
references to it, in the
peninsula area, but it is an

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.850
imaginary version where, for
my own sake-- because I was

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.770
writing a kind of a noir
crime-ish thing, I needed an

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.680
urban area.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.120
I needed a city to be a good
setting for anything that has

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.020
kind of a noir tint to it.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.690
And because of that, I invented
a city, because I

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.550
grew up in the suburbs, and it
just doesn't work for noir.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.020
Because then if you stand on a
corner looking mysterious in

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.280
the suburbs, the police
come over and go,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.350
what are you doing?

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.520
So I invented a city
called San Judas.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.590
I basically took San Jose kind
of a million strong and kind

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.290
of dragged it up to the Redwood
City Palo Alto area,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.340
which is what I'm most
familiar with.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.710
Anyway so Bobby in this--

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.640
I think the other character
that shows up in this is

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.670
Clarence, who is a young
journeyman angel.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.980
And Clarence has lots of
questions, because he's just

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.440
learning how to do this stuff.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.750
OK, so Bobby has just finished
arguing on behalf of a

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.400
recently deceased soul,
and that's what's

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.060
going on at the moment.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.030
And Clarence is accompanying
him because

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.990
Clarence is a new angel.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.020
"But he wasn't a bad guy,"
Clarence told me afterward as

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.470
we grabbed a burger at
a roadside diner.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.030
"Why did you agree
to purgatory?"

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.430
"Because even though it was only
a property crime, it was

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.010
a breach of trust and those
can go pretty severely.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.620
You don't know Ramiel the way
I do." Ramiel was the judge

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.650
who'd been assigned
to Crosley's case.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.170
For a being made entirely of
holy light, he kind of had a

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.850
stick up his ass.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.540
"Trust me, our boy will do
that time in purgatory

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.890
standing on his head."

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.490
"But these are people's lives,"
Clarence said, so

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.980
concerned to make his point he
didn't notice the tomato and

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.540
onions sliding out the back of
his burger into his lap.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.540
"No, they're whole eternities in
our hands." He looked down

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.290
and frowned, then began trying
to wipe the mess away with a

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.900
pitifully inadequate napkin.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.110
"Exactly," I said. "They're
in our hands.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.960
In fact, that's kind of
the job description.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.100
So it's better to lose small
than take a risk of losing

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.950
big." I did my best to explain
to him that I'd tried it his

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.920
way first, going after each
case like a high school

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.950
football coach trying
to lead his underdog

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.880
team to a big win.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.010
But I could tell by the way he
looked at me that it just

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.550
wasn't getting through.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.560
He couldn't see it.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.990
Which meant that if Clarence was
really what they claimed

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.740
he was-- a new advocate in
training-- he'd have to learn

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.610
the hard way like the
rest of us had.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.660
See, heaven's judges have their
own ideas, and don't

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.740
like being lectured on how
morality should work.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.120
In fact, they pretty much
consider themselves to be the

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.590
literal definition of morality,
and they have the

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.590
power to back that up.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.180
A series of agonizing failures
taught me the most important

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.200
lesson of all, which is do what
you can, take what you

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.210
can get, try to grow scar
tissue over the

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.980
parts that get hurt.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.300
If you can't get the judge to
see it your way, you must take

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.400
any little victory
you can get.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.520
I mean, nobody likes to settle
for purgatory, but it beats

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.900
the hell out of betting on
a long shot and losing.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.690
Because these are people
we're gambling on.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.480
Human souls.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.240
It hurts bad when I lose a case,
but it hurts them much

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.620
worse than it does me.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.240
"Hey, Clarence," I asked as I
pulled my jacket on. "You want

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.560
a ride home?"

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.020
"I wish you'd stop calling
me that," he said.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.960
"I've seen "It's A Wonderful
Life," you know.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.690
I mean, I get it."

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.070
"And when you earn your wings,
we'll stop calling you

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.950
Clarence and start calling you
Harold or Harry or whatever

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.770
your name's supposed to be."

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.250
"Harrison," he said,
sulking a little.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.240
"Harrison Eli.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.830
Yeah, I guess I'd
like a ride."

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.080
It turned out that poor Clarence
actually rode the bus

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.630
to work when Sam didn't
pick him up.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.880
An angel on one of those smog
belching city buses.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.920
Can you imagine?

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.460
I swear I'd walk first.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.060
And then skipping just ahead a
little bit, and now Bobby is

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.550
returning to his apartment.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.790
The moment I walked through the
door of my motel room, I

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.110
could feel the baking heat, as
if I had left the thermostat

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.130
set at 125 when I went out.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.150
Then the smell hit me, so savage
and so wrong that I

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.610
took a couple of stumbling steps
backward through the

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.910
doorway, waving my hand
in front of my face.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.040
And that was what saved me.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.650
The thing waiting in the room
smashed into the half open

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.550
door, and the impact tore the
top hinge out of the wall so

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.045
that the door sagged crookedly
in its frame.

00:07:28.045 --> 00:07:30.960
An instant later, my visitor
stepped on the broken door and

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.090
crushed it into a splintering
mess as it forced its way out

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.850
onto the concrete walkway like
an octopus flowing out of a

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.020
tiny crevice in the rocks.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.920
But this was no octopus or
anything else I'd ever seen.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.340
It was vaguely man shaped,
but huge--

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.190
almost eight feet tall-- and
so dark that even by the

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.230
parking lot lights, I could
barely make it out except for

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.590
spreading horns on its head
and a sloping, complicated

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.160
muzzle that made it look a bit
like some abstract sculpture

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.780
of a minotaur.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.220
Even from a few feet away,
the heat it threw off was

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.630
painfully intense.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.460
There was no question of
trying to stand up to

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.940
something like this.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.370
I turned and sprinted across
the motel parking lot.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.970
I could hear it galloping right
behind me, shedding bits

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:20.040
of splintered door as it came,
so I dove under somebody's

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.530
sports wagon and desperately
tried to claw my gun out of my

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.730
waistband holster, which is no
easy trick while you're lying

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.290
on your belly crammed
under a greasy SUV.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.580
The thing still wasn't making
a noise except for its deep

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.789
grunting breaths.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:37.010
That's good, I thought.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.350
If it's breathing, maybe
it can be hurt.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.460
But it knew exactly where
I was, and it was very

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.000
interested.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.520
It circled the wagon, then a
big, hot hand suddenly swept

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.200
underneath and missed my head
by only a few inches.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.180
I swear I felt my eyebrows
crisping, as if someone had

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.820
tried to close a waffle
iron on my face.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.590
An instant later, the thing
simply bent down and heaved

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.640
the whole car up in the air,
lifting it so that only two

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.040
wheels still touched
the ground.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.410
I didn't want to find out what
would happen if it dropped it

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.900
again with me underneath, so I
rolled to one side and finally

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.770
was able to pull my revolver.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:19.100
I emptied it into the middle of
the thing, all five slugs.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.550
I can't believe I missed from
that close, but as far as I

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.100
could tell, it did nothing but
stagger the creature a bit and

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.140
startle it into dropping the
wagon, which bounced on its

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.040
big tires as I took the
opportunity to scramble

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.000
farther away.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.950
We were making a lot of noise.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.450
As the echoes of my shots died,
lights were coming on

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.090
all over the building.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.450
I had no idea what was after
me, but I didn't want any

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.810
ordinary people getting
mixed up in this.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.790
From what I'd seen, my assailant
would go through

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.670
them like they were
made of butter.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.310
My decision was hastened by a
huge, horned shadow scrambling

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.490
over the wagon toward me.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.230
Later on, the police who
investigated the scene would

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.500
decide that the car had been
vandalized with a blowtorch

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.200
and a pickaxe, but
I was there.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.420
Those marks were made by fingers
and toes, or hooves,

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.750
or whatever it ran around on.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.050
The screech of punctured metal
was enough to tell me what

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.960
would happen if it ever grabbed
me, so I jumped up and

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.430
sprinted across the parking lot
and out into the lights of

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.970
the busy Camino Real, fumbling
for my speed loader as I

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.180
dodged startled, honking
motorists.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.066
This.

00:10:24.066 --> 00:10:26.700
This is why I hate carrying
a gun, by the way.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.880
As soon as I've got it, I
suddenly keep needing it.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.430
Most witness reports afterward
describe something like a

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.520
gigantic black bear in a
Halloween wig chasing a man

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.610
through traffic, and at one
point leaping over an entire

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.950
cab, which had fishtailed to
a stop behind a clutch of

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.780
startled drivers.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.710
A lone dissenter insisted that
not only had the man also

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.970
jumped over the cab--

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.750
he was being chased not by a
bear, but, quote, "by a giant

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:56.690
gorilla in some kind of
Viking hat," unquote.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.290
Other than that guy, nobody but
me seemed to have noticed

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.330
the impressive sweep of horns.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.960
I reached the other side of the
Camino Real about a second

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.500
and a half in front of the
burning black shape.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.360
I was almost weeping with anger
at my own stupidity in

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.250
having stayed in the same place
two nights in a row, and

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.920
I was gasping for air as well.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.100
But I didn't dare stop.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.480
I was pretty certain my aim
hadn't been the problem with

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.190
my shoot the fucking thing idea,
and I didn't have a new

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.160
idea yet, so I kept running
until I reached the used car

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.210
lot across the street.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.410
Instead of diving under
another vehicle--

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.130
I didn't trust the clearance on
any of the economy models

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.130
sitting there--

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.450
I ran right toward the showroom
window, feeling the

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.050
thing closing on me from behind
as if it were a rolling

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.110
ball of lightning.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.830
A set of talons as wide across
as a garden rake

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.880
wooshed over my head.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.740
As I felt my hair sizzle, I
reflected that at least I had

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.750
a pretty good idea now what
had marked my door.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.820
At the last moment, I juked
sideways, and by some miracle

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.770
kept my feet.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.990
But the monstrous whatever it
was had too much mass to turn

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:02.530
that quickly, and crashed full
on into the 10 by 30 plate

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.170
glass window with a noise
like a bomb going off in

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:05.620
[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.100
Cathedral.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.120
By the time the thing dug its
way out of the wreckage, I was

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.980
crouching on the bumper of the
number 35 bus on the other

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.100
side of the Camino Real,
heading south.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.820
I could dimly see the shadow
snorting and sniffing in the

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.890
ruins of the showroom, but
apparently, it didn't see me

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:25.950
clinging to the bus's rear
quarter panel, struggling for

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.440
breath while I bled gently down
the Cal Trans logo and

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.170
onto the asphalt that was
sliding away beneath me.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.500
It doesn't really count as
riding the bus, because I

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.630
didn't buy a ticket.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.580
TAD WILLIAMS: Now, I'm very
happy to talk about anything,

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:48.460
whether about the stuff I'm
writing now, other things I've

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.490
written, writing in general,
science fiction, fantasy,

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:52.550
anything anybody wants.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.190
So anybody have a question?

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.900
Any kind whatsoever?

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.005
AUDIENCE: One question.

00:12:57.005 --> 00:13:00.375
How do you keep the personality
of characters

00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:00.840
individual?

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.295
Because at some points, it
must be hard [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:05.295 --> 00:13:08.530
always reflect your own
personality or blend together?

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.280
TAD WILLIAMS: I think it is.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.690
The question is, how do you keep
characters separate and

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.610
individual?

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.330
And the thing is, in most cases,
that is more of an

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.770
issue in the "Bobby Dollar"
books, more, probably, than

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.050
any character I've written,
he is very similar to me.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:30.830
He's not exactly me by any
means, but his approach, his

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:35.960
way of looking at the world, his
habit of using humor as a

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.140
way to cope with things,
is very much mine.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.310
As far as in general, when
characters are not me or not

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:49.760
like me, what really has to
happen is you have to give the

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.400
character their credibility.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.710
Once you create somebody--
once you have the basic

00:13:55.710 --> 00:14:00.690
integuments of that character,
you have to treat them as

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.270
though they are real people.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.960
So what that means is once you
form the basics of their

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.490
character, you have to let them
begin to make their own

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.150
choices, or at least tell you
what they would be likely to

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.280
do in that situation.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.930
Which can be a real pain in the
ass, believe me, because

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.510
there are times when you invent
a character solely for

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:24.870
some purpose far off in the
story-- like, especially in

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.760
some climactic moment where
they're going to jump in front

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.630
of the main character and take
a spear or something and save

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.220
your main character.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.630
And so you can't just
invent them at the

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:36.640
last moment, right?

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.650
I mean, that's the Star
Trek red shirt thing.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:39.830
Everybody knows that.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.470
You have to put them in
the story earlier.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.300
And if they have no personality,
than everybody's

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.680
going to either spot them as
a born to die character, or

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.120
they're just not going to care,
because they're clearly

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.010
a spear carrier there--

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.150
a walk on.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.750
So you also have to start
early and give them a

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.670
personality and let them
begin to develop.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.740
Which is all cool, except the
problem is then sometimes you

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.680
get to that point near the end
of the story and the character

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.410
essentially will talk to you
and say, I ain't jumping in

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.410
front of nobody.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.150
Just not going to happen here.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.730
Which is why I have lots of
other characters, because you

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.955
jerk some other poor idiot
out of the back row and

00:15:18.955 --> 00:15:19.970
go, you're a star!

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:20.390
Boom.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.560
And put them in there
to take the spear.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.360
But no, it does happen.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.810
But it's vital.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.570
You have to take that chance
that a character will not do

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.890
what you want to keep the
characters idiosyncratic, to

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.340
keep them real, to let the
little weird little things you

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.810
thought of in the beginning
really take shape and inform

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.860
that character.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.600
But the nice thing is once you
do start writing them, once

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.530
you give them these basic
elements, they do start to

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.430
become real to you.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:54.870
They become real in such a way
that you can kind of let them

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.230
make their choices or show you
what they do or suggest what

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.000
their own backstory is.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.740
And I have oftentimes literally
found out who the

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:07.040
character was by sort of doing
a psychological overview of

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.350
who they are, and that's told
me, OK, they must have come

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:14.590
from this kind of a history and
had this kind of a outlook

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.600
on the world because of
things that happened

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.530
when they were young.

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.880
And so there's a real value
to it, and to letting

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.252
them have their way.

00:16:22.252 --> 00:16:24.980
AUDIENCE: So when you write
a story with multiple main

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.204
characters, do you tend to--

00:16:28.204 --> 00:16:30.980
mostly from the perspective of
one, and then you revise it by

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.083
saying, does that make
sense from the

00:16:33.083 --> 00:16:33.950
perspective of the other?

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.690
Or you're a third party that
looks at both of them as

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:36.870
you're writing?

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.010
TAD WILLIAMS: Do I see it mostly
through the perspective

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:42.220
of the main character?

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:42.460
No.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.580
What actually happens--

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.530
and if you look at the kind of
stuff I do, especially the big

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:54.220
books, that what usually will
happen is that I will

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.910
deliberately create focal point
characters so that I can

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:01.470
be in lots of different
theaters of operation.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:06.150
When I'm doing one of my big
epics, what I like to do is to

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:12.339
show the size of things by
personalizing them, because I

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:15.690
discovered early on that unlike,
say, Tolkien or some

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:19.650
other writers, I don't
particularly feel comfortable

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:23.420
in the all seeing narrator voice
and standing back and

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.680
describing to the reader
from a godly point

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.300
of view what's happening.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.210
That has never been as
interesting for me, for one,

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.790
because I probably just don't
know enough to do that.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:38.100
So what I've always done instead
is try to find a

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.900
character to tell it through.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.300
So then all those different
locales or viewpoints or

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:49.710
plotlines become very
personalized, and they take on

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.120
the lens of the character
who's viewing them.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.030
So for me, it's very easy to
step into that character,

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:58.070
then, and continue that
story, because they

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.580
have their own story.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.380
They have their own arc.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.600
And it's just like writing many,
many books and weaving

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.570
them together, I guess,
for lack of a better

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.730
way to phrase it.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.260
AUDIENCE: So when you're writing
a multipart series, as

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:16.490
you are now, how much do you
know now about what's going to

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.780
be happening towards
the end of it?

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.830
How much is it planned out in
advance versus how much are

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.490
you making up as you go along?

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:28.300
And how do you keep it so that
each book has its own

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.770
personality, and it's not just
like an episode of a comic

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:32.530
book series?

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:36.600
It isn't just one small piece
that feels kind of

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.840
unfulfilling all by itself?

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.790
TAD WILLIAMS: Well,
that, actually--

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.840
that's a very big question.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.240
It's kind of a set of
nesting questions.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.210
And they are in fact kind of at
the heart of writing big,

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.560
epic stories of any kind.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.800
And the answer to the first
part, which is about plotting

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.340
everything ahead of time versus
not plotting everything

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:06.020
ahead of time is that it really
is a highwire act.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.260
It's a balancing act.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.600
You think of the guys or gals,
in some cases, that are

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.880
walking on highwires with those
big weighted poles.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.110
And as soon as they start to
go one way, then they're

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.730
compensating to bring themselves
back to an upright

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.880
gyroscopic position,
or whatever.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.090
And that's very much what I'm
doing also with writing a

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:32.310
really big book, and the reason
is because you cannot

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.490
plan everything.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:35.270
If you're writing something
that's going to take you four

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:39.720
or five years, it's going to be
half a million words in one

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:44.530
volume alone, maybe, you cannot
think all of that up

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:45.220
ahead of time.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.170
You can, but it will be
extremely forced.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.170
My outlines have been getting
shorter and shorter throughout

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.500
my career, because I realized
that that's a real waste of

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.850
time trying to figure everything
out ahead of time

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.530
just to tell my publishers
so they'll give me money.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.770
So now I just tell them, just
give me money and trust me.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.320
That works much better for me.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.550
I'm not sure about the
publisher so much.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:11.530
But the reason is that first of
all, during the course of

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:14.250
writing a very long
story or a set of

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:18.750
connected stories, I change.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.880
I find out more things
about the world.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.900
I bump into interesting
conversations.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:27.170
I meet people who serve as
inspiration for characters

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.630
whatever it may be.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:34.660
But also just the simple fact
of the emergent order that

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.050
comes out of complexity
and chaos--

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.710
or at least seeming chaos--

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:42.210
is that to an extent, the
story writes itself.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.900
It goes back to the issue we
were talking about with

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:49.040
characters is that you get
enough variables going on, and

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.350
at a certain point, some of
them, you're going, oh my god,

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.720
wait a minute.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.220
These guys and these guys are
going to come together, and

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.380
these guys have that goal, but
these guys have that goal.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.580
So right away, there's going
to be tension in this

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.480
particular thing.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.790
Who are the personalities
involved?

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.140
How is that going to affect
whether this group is going to

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.200
stay together, split, if they're
going to do this, if

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:07.720
they're going to do that,
they're going

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.450
to kill each other.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.660
You know?

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.590
So part of it is needing to have
that space for that kind

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:19.130
of order to arise out of a
sufficient amount of chaos.

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:22.670
So you want to keep a lot of
things at bay as long as you

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:25.100
can until they start
to click together.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:29.450
Unfortunately, the flip side of
that, or the other extreme,

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:34.240
is if you don't plan at all,
then you're going to have real

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:42.060
trouble with things like, say,
foreshadowing, because,

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.260
although I write multiple volume
stories, that for me,

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.360
they're all single stories.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.480
They're not series books.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.420
So I'm writing them with the
idea that basically you could

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.750
sit down at the beginning and
read it all through as though

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.930
it was one book.

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:01.180
But publishing and printing
technology of the previous

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.620
century did not allow that.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.150
So I began making multi-volume
books.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:11.580
However, because they are, for
me, one story, I want to be

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.680
able to foreshadow like I would
in a normal book, or

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:20.030
begin to introduce themes or
symbols early on the stories.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:23.390
Which means you have to know
something about the ending,

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:26.490
and you have to know some of the
highlights of things that

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:28.960
are going to happen along the
way, otherwise you're going to

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.820
make terrible, terrible,
terrible mistakes where you

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.900
will get to the ending and find
out, like, oh my god.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.910
I should never have killed
that guy off.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:38.150
I'm in serious trouble now.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:43.390
And short of going door to door
with a red pen, borrowing

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.380
your books back-- can I have
that for a second?

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.490
See where this guy
says he dies?

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.380
He's dead?

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.400
No, I'm going to cross
out dead and put

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.650
breathing very shallowly.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.960
That's not really practical,
especially not if you're going

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.720
to sell enough books to
make a living off of.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.740
So what I have to do is, again,
we go back to the

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:07.480
balancing act, where I have to
make some decisions early with

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.700
an idea of, OK, this is going to
come back later on in some

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.580
shape or form, even if I
don't know exactly how.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.710
I'm going to establish
it as a point.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:18.370
The readers will note.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.680
They will say, ah, clearly
a significant moment.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.570
He must have plans
for this guy.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.200
Well, I do, but I have no
idea what they are.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.840
But that's OK, because if I do
this all carefully, one of the

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.390
things that happens when things
start to lock up is my

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.530
subconscious often will go,
oh, now we're going to get

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:34.480
this guy and deal with that.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.700
Remember, we set that up and
we had no idea what we were

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.590
doing back there?

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:38.650
Now we know.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:39.910
And click, it will come in.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:43.290
And hopefully, I get to
the final volume and

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:45.111
everybody goes, wow.

00:23:45.111 --> 00:23:46.050
How did he know, man?

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.760
He just fitted all that
stuff back together.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.140
And it's mostly smoke
and mirrors.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.640
So that answers the
first part.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.040
Was there anything else
there in that

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.440
question that I didn't?

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.640
AUDIENCE: My second part of the
question was about making

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.900
sure that each volume of a
multi-part series has its own

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.720
personality and it doesn't
just feel like a small

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.900
fraction of a whole story.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.805
But you went on to say, well,
it is a small fraction of a

00:24:08.805 --> 00:24:09.100
whole story.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:09.990
TAD WILLIAMS: Well,
but also, no.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:13.910
But that's actually a good
point, too, because you have

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.000
to put them together in such a
way that somebody can pick up

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.190
a book and feel like they've
read a book instead of just

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:23.460
the middle section of something
with no resolve or

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.220
no resolutions of any kind.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.750
So I do shape them a bit to
give them that feeling.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.370
The thing about that, though,
is I oftentimes don't really

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.920
know what separates that book
out from the previous book

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.590
until I'm well into it, and
that's when theme material

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:42.170
begins to rise, I begin to see
my own patterns, I begin to

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:46.620
go, oh, OK, this book
is more of the

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.710
travelogue of the country.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.690
This is the book about moving
through this and learning what

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.380
there is, or whatever it
might be that turns

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.370
out to be the theme.

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.180
So those often come
to me later.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:01.130
But I do try to shape each one
so at least the reader doesn't

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.000
feel like they've just
been dropped off a

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.820
cliff at the end.

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.620
That there's some kind of--

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.550
AUDIENCE: So asking a little bit
about you mentioned that

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.230
you got better at deadlines
throughout your career and so

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.740
on, so I'm curious about
how do you work?

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:18.140
So is it Monday to Friday, 8:00
AM to 5:00 PM on your

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.590
desk at home every day, or are
you flexible to just write

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:23.620
while you're traveling?

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.420
Is that what you prefer?

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:29.460
And also, if you think you could
be a full time author,

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:33.510
or at least write a real book
while working another job,

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.620
like a software engineer,
for example.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.430
TAD WILLIAMS: Well, OK.

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:38.230
A couple of different questions
there, so I'll do

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.480
the more historical one first.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:44.750
My first several books were
written while I was working

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:45.210
other jobs.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:49.200
I wrote my very first book while
working two or three

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.760
other jobs, as a
matter of fact.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.540
I was waiting tables, I was
answering phones at an all

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:58.220
night answering service, and I
may still have been throwing

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.330
newspapers at that point.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:00.000
I can't remember.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.760
But the kind of absolutely
pathetic sad-ass jobs where

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.380
you couldn't just have one.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.210
I had to have two or three
pathetic jobs all at the same

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.430
time just to scrape together
enough money to survive.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.300
So I wrote my first book, which
was the cat book, while

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.540
I was doing many, many jobs.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:22.620
And I wrote the next set of
books while I was primarily

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.120
working at Apple, because
I worked at

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.860
Apple in the late 1980s.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.570
But it was only half time.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:32.220
But that was the last normal
job that I had.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:36.490
Speaking of, as people here who
work at a very, very nice

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:38.980
company with great benefits and
all that kind of stuff,

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.900
you'll be amused by what--

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.360
because I had great benefits
at Apple, too.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.710
In fact, they were paying
me full time benefits.

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:47.650
I was working 20 hours a week,
and they had me scheduled into

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:49.820
14 hours of meetings.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.480
So they were basically giving me
full time Apple benefits in

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.470
the 1980s for 6 hours a week of
actual expected work, which

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:57.910
I still managed to avoid doing.

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:01.000
So yay me.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.940
Anyway, so yeah, I have had that
experience of working.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:08.450
And the only thing that really
helps with that is that you

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:12.060
just have to look on the writing
as something quite

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:16.150
separate, and you need to
have it be something

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:17.120
positive for you.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.070
It is very difficult to write
after a writing job.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:23.520
It is very difficult sometimes
to write if you have a really

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.690
physically exhausting job.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:28.930
But if you are going to do it
while you're doing something

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:30.410
else, it has to be a refuge.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:34.580
It has to be like playing a
sport or doing something you

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.840
really love doing.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:43.300
As far as how I work now, first
of all, when I first

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:47.110
went full time-- which was
about 1990, I think--

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:49.870
and I first became a full time
writer, I was terrified,

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:53.000
because I was really, really
worried that I was going to

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.860
wind up watching daytime
television.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.430
It's like, now I have freedom?

00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:59.480
Oh my God.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.140
And I've always thought of
myself as being very lazy.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.790
I'm sure I'm just going to be
watching Wheel of Fortune all

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:08.350
day, and horrible shit like
that-- drinking beers and

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:11.160
watching Oprah or whatever.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.520
In fact, no.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:16.930
The tragic truth is that now
I'm never not working.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:20.310
So that's one thing.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:24.070
It's going on all the time, and
I have to suppress it to

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:27.150
do other things-- to
have a normal life.

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:30.380
To remember to get the kids to
clean their rooms or whatever,

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.780
I have to go, turn off the
story for a minute.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.580
Go do this.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:39.590
In terms of how I actually
physically make books, I

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:43.180
really work most days, at least
somewhat, even if I have

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.760
a day when I don't write
anything, I will invariably

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.730
spend a lot of thinking time.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.820
But on a normal writing day,
which I try to do four to five

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:55.140
days a week, I will
get up and do my

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.580
correspondence and things.

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:01.870
I will then purposefully go
away from the computer and

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:03.535
will just think.

00:29:03.535 --> 00:29:05.840
And I'll think about what I'm
working on, and I'll think

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.850
about maybe some bits that are
up the road, but I will also

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.640
very definitely plan the section
that I'm working on.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.710
Because for me, everything
works better

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:16.000
if it's in my head.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.120
So I like to just keep it all
loose and fluid, and it makes

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.980
it much easier to try different
possibilities--

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.610
to try little different
branching things, and go,

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:27.980
well, if I do this, then
that turns into this.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.810
But then I can't go over here
quite so easily, so let's pull

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:31.910
that one apart.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:33.320
So it's just basically that.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.190
I'm sure it's very similar to
programming and a lot of other

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.212
kinds of creative things.

00:29:38.212 --> 00:29:40.360
You do thought experiments.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.840
So I will usually do that until
lunchtime, sometimes

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.940
actually lying down.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.180
It took me years to get my
family trained to understand

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.590
that, yes, sometimes
Dad is just lazy.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.990
Sometimes Dad is taking a nap.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:54.660
But oftentimes, Dad was lying
down because that is the most

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.180
comfortable position
in which to think.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:01.920
So I'll do that until lunchtime,
have some lunch,

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.080
maybe think a little bit more.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.720
And then I usually sit down and
do all my writing in maybe

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.450
three hours of actual writing,
because I'm prepped.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.280
I'm not sitting there
staring at a screen.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.450
I'm going in with an idea of
what I'm going to do, what the

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.030
shape of maybe that chapter
is going to be, who the

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:20.030
characters are, what highlights
I want in it, and

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.140
I've really thought
it through.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.880
And usually, I've even played
around with it a little bit to

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.880
make things happen in the
most dramatic order.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.600
So that's a good thing to do in
your head instead of having

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.930
to rewrite is just saying, OK,
well, if this happens first,

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:35.610
then we've shot the wad at the
beginning of the section.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:37.220
So let's hold that back
a little bit.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.590
Let's build the tension.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:39.390
So what else could happen?

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:40.810
Well, this could happen,
and that would

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.330
further another need.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.240
So that's basically it
for me most days.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:50.400
And I'm usually done by 4:00
or 5:00 in the afternoon.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.430
But, again, I'm almost
always working.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:58.010
So after dinner or whatever, I
will oftentimes just go and

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:01.170
think, or make a few notes if
there's something that I want

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:05.130
to hang onto that's concrete,
like I've thought a good name

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.510
for a character and I want to
get that down somewhere.

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.460
And I lie in bed at
night thinking

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:11.470
about this stuff, too.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:13.870
So it never really goes away.

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:15.750
It's kind of there seven
days a week.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.280
And I do a lot of driving
because of it, because it's a

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.260
good time to think.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.250
There's just enough occupation
for the body that the mind--

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.706
my mind, anyway-- can
sort of roam free.

00:31:25.706 --> 00:31:29.570
AUDIENCE: Do you see yourself
rewriting less over the years?

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:31.510
Is that something that you used
to do more and you do

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.780
less now, or is that still
part of your workflow?

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:36.770
TAD WILLIAMS: Interestingly
enough, that's almost entirely

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.260
project dependent.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.770
With the really, really,
really big books-- the

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:43.690
multi-volume series, with, as
I mentioned, with all the

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.350
complications of how do
you channel everything

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.010
together at the end?

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:51.990
Those books, like 90% of the
work is in the first draft,

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.530
because I have to weave
everything carefully, and I've

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:57.350
got all these different
timelines and things which I'm

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:58.300
holding in my head.

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.040
And I'm going, OK, this and
then this, and then we'll

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.790
weave this in, and
then this bit.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:05.320
So those are hell to
pull apart if you

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.310
get something wrong.

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:09.270
If you have to pull out a
timeline, it's like ivy.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.540
You're going to have to rip out
the entire plant to get

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:14.030
rid of that one part.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:17.995
So I really, really plan those
out very carefully, and I do

00:32:17.995 --> 00:32:22.760
an even more intensive thinking
to writing ratio.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.880
But with something like the
"Bobby Dollar" books that I'm

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.320
working on now, because they're
told by the main

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.670
character, because I don't have
to worry about the things

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:35.060
that are happening offscreen, as
it were, I can be much more

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.610
direct and fix things
in rewrite.

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:39.530
So I just storm through
those, and I write

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:41.630
faster because of that.

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:44.060
But I also do more work in the
rewrite, because I will

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.990
actually say, eh, now that I'm
reading this, I think this

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:48.370
section needs to come earlier.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:50.830
It's kind of a slow down here,
and I need to do it right

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.875
after something exciting
has happened.

00:32:52.875 --> 00:32:55.520
And I move things around,
because it's only that one

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.140
character and his viewpoint.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.010
So it's much easier that way.

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:02.130
So it's project related.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.110
AUDIENCE: You talked a lot about
process, but I'm really

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:08.640
interested in the earlier
stages of it.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.480
I've read most of your books,
and you have some very, very

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.410
completely different worlds.

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:15.700
How does that start?

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:19.120
Like, how do you take that spark
of an idea and turn it

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:24.400
into a framework for a
world and a story?

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.090
TAD WILLIAMS: Well, as far as
what happens with the idea is

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:29.910
it's actually, it's funny.

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.230
And I guess in different ways,
different people--

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.490
there are other people who are
this way, too-- but I am

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:38.040
somebody who the ideas are
always popping up.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.860
They are a constant thing.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.490
My mental image of my own brain
is like, remember those

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:46.790
little corn popper toys you used
to push you around when

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:47.940
you were a kid?

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:48.880
That's what it looks like.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.462
There's these little colored
plastic balls going pop, pop,

00:33:51.462 --> 00:33:53.020
pop, pop in there.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:56.460
Ideas are a given, just
because of the fact

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.280
that I am who I am.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.500
I was raised the way
I was raised.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.030
I love them, and I've found
a way to make a

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:03.540
living off of them.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.540
But what has to happen, there's
a big long stretch

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.030
between having an idea.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:12.429
And so what tends to happen
is that there's kind of a

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:13.639
mulching process--

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:17.300
a composting process, where
when I have an idea that I

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:20.230
actually notice and go, ooh,
tha'ts interesting, I'll just

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.800
kind of throw it in the hopper
and leave it there.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.889
And what happens is there's this
whole process going on in

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:30.130
the subconscious where really
good ideas will stick around,

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:34.750
and they will often begin to
agglomerate with other ideas.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:40.290
And in fact, sometimes they'll
eat smaller, weaker ideas, and

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:42.976
they'll go, you're not enough
of an idea on your own, so

00:34:42.976 --> 00:34:43.530
I'll just swallow you.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:45.940
But now you're part
of this idea.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:49.449
And what happens after a certain
length of time is that

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:55.699
some ideas are so involved and
complex and alive is the best

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:58.390
way I can say it-- so sort
of throbbingly alive--

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:01.280
that they want to be written.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.890
They have gone past the
first threshold.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:05.940
They are not just a little idea
that's sitting around

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.380
there like, ooh, that'll
be fun someday.

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:11.480
And they become an actual idea
that is like a story.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.600
That, for me, is the
first threshold.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.170
And at that point, I will
play around with it.

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.410
I will analyze is this
a short story?

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:19.680
Is this a film script?

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.330
Is this a novel?

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:24.440
If it's a novel, like, do I
even really want to start

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.090
thinking about it?

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:26.770
Because I've already
got three of them

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:29.340
ahead of me or whatever.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:33.680
But again, it's basically a
Hobbesian nightmare in there.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.040
It's nature red in tooth and
claw, and the ideas are

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.770
fighting with each other for my
very limited amount of time

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:41.260
to actually work.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.570
And at any given time, there are
two or three novel ideas

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:46.840
in my head that will probably
never get written.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.160
They will just stay in the
background, and if they stay

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.370
in the background long enough,
eventually, they will just

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:54.490
kind of slide off.

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:57.770
Because only once a year at
the most do I ever get to

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:00.780
choose what new book I'm going
to do, and usually, I already

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:04.770
know, because either I'm doing
a series or I've been wanting

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:07.920
to write this one for so many
years that the next open slot.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.000
So it's a limited
amount of space.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.530
That's why I like to do shorter
fiction sometimes and

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:14.250
things, just to get some
of those ideas.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.870
And in fact, the "Otherland"
books-- if you've read a lot

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:20.030
of my stuff, the "Otherland"
books had a huge amount of

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:22.680
beloved ideas of mine that I was
worried I was never going

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.410
to get to write.

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:26.890
So like, the house world, the
world that's an endless house,

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:29.240
that was something I'd been
wanting to do for a long time

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:32.830
and I folded into "Otherland,"
which was very much a

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:34.220
kitchen sink book.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.380
Which is why I even had a
kitchen in it with a giant

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:40.340
kitchen sink, was kind of to
show you how shameless I am

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:42.940
about this stuff.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.370
So did we get all that?

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:46.330
AUDIENCE: For someone who
doesn't have the time to do

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:49.810
this professionally and occupy
their entire time, like, I

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:53.010
know I've found I get ideas like
that and I let them churn

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:57.290
and mulch for a while, but by
the time I've gotten around to

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:58.790
have the time to sit down
and do something

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.950
with it, it's gone.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:03.590
Are there any tricks to keeping
track of this stuff?

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:05.140
TAD WILLIAMS: You need an
intermediate phase.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.330
You need an intermediate
phase.

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:11.910
Which is that you need a phase
where you concretize those

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:15.350
ideas in some way without it
having to be a full blown

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:17.490
writing process.

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:21.580
So what I would suggest is that,
for instance, that you

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.480
have something like the
equivalent of a story file.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.180
And every time you have an idea
like that, you put it

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.260
down in whatever
form you have.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:33.250
And then you go back to those
things as you add new ones,

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.630
but you keep looking at them.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:36.580
In other words, you develop
yourself an

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:37.770
indeterminate phase.

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:41.740
Whereas me, I've already got a
process in place that leads to

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.540
them getting finished, you need
to start developing one,

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:45.150
I would say.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:46.240
So yeah.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.060
But very important--

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.490
it has to be regular.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:54.910
Because to my way of thinking,
neural pathways, muscle

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:56.820
memory, it's all the same.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:00.280
Do stuff over and over again, it
becomes habit, you begin to

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:05.100
burn those neural routes, it
begins to become reflexive,

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.830
you have an automatic thing,
and you start to also see

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:11.320
things through the filter
of now having those

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.890
new pathways, too.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:16.630
So find some way to use it, even
if you're just posting

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:18.440
them on a blog or something.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.730
Just saying, here, I have
these really cool ideas.

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:21.930
Any of you like these?

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:23.310
Should I do one of these?

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:26.300
Anything you can do to make it
more formal and more real.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.680
That make sense?

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:28.910
TAD WILLIAMS: OK, good.

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:31.340
AUDIENCE: I've been reading a
short story collection by

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.720
Orson Scott Card, and he talks
about a lot of that same type

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.880
of stuff where he's just
trying out stories

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.930
to get ideas out.

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:39.890
And it really has been
fascinating, because he puts

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:43.060
that information in, and
to see that process.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.700
And on some of them,
he goes, yeah.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.780
This one I did, and I really
looked at and said, this was

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.060
really a bad idea.

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.520
No place to go with it.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:54.550
But my question was, can you
tell any type of specific

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:58.230
story where you have actually
written yourself into a corner

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:00.230
with, like you said, one of
these multi-parts, and then

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:02.770
what did you have to do to try
to get yourself back out of

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:04.920
that situation?

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.370
TAD WILLIAMS: Actually, more
than a lot of writers, I

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:12.200
think, I do that on purpose.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:12.860
No, seriously.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:17.500
Because like many of
my readers, I am

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.710
pretty widely read.

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:24.380
And I am pretty widely read in
all the genre upon which the

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.840
stuff that I like impinges.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.490
So I've read a lot of fantasy,
a lot of science fiction, a

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:33.050
lot of crime, a lot
of mystery.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:34.780
I also read a lot of
other kinds of--

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:38.000
I read a lot of nonfiction, a
lot of history and science.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.790
So I'm always writing for an
audience as much like myself

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:46.160
as I can deal with, because
I'm the only audience I

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.680
actually can test things
against, at least in time to

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.380
save myself from a tragic
publishing error.

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:58.820
So what I tend to do is when
I am testing the ideas on

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:06.070
myself, I find that quite
frequently, if I put my

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.170
character in a very difficult
situation--

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.780
and let's face it, when
you're writing--

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.150
let me go to the side here
for just a moment.

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:16.200
The whole thing about
genre fiction, okay?

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:21.460
Genre fiction is
not a quality.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.110
There is no such thing
as genre quality.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:27.260
Genre just means a type.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.170
And in my way of thinking,
what it actually

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.150
means is it's a bargain.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:34.680
It's a bargain between the
writer and reader, the

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.570
consumer, or the audience, or
whatever you want to call it.

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:41.060
And that bargain is if I have
told you, or if you believe

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:46.120
that you are getting a certain
kind of genre book or story,

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.570
that I will at least fulfill
enough of the genre

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:53.520
conventions that you will
not feel cheated.

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.390
Now, hopefully, I will do a lot
more with it than that,

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:58.870
too, and that's the great
thing about genre, and

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:03.210
especially science fiction and
fantasy is if you give the

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:06.645
reader enough of what they're
looking for, you can also be

00:41:06.645 --> 00:41:10.810
as experimental or as literary
or as anything as you want to.

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:14.990
So I always shorthand it as
every five pages, something

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:17.750
has to try to eat my
main character.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:19.800
But it's not literally that.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.140
Sometimes every five pages
something is trying to blow up

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:25.910
my main character, or to slime
my main character.

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:31.450
But the main thing is that I
need to work with those genre

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:34.260
conventions and realize that
the readers are expecting a

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.930
certain amount of
these things.

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:37.360
And it's like a thrill ride.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.020
If I don't deliver that part,
nothing else matters.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.610
Because first and foremost,
most of the readers are

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:44.500
expecting--

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:45.800
otherwise, they could
be reading anything.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.290
Why are they reading science
fiction and fantasy?

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:55.400
Now, once you deal with those
genre expectations, then you

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.490
are free to do whatever
you want.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:02.080
But I also figure that most
genre readers have read a ton

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:06.320
of the kind of stuff that I'm
writing, so I am constantly in

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.700
a mental struggle
with all of you.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.720
Any of you who are my readers,
you and I are at war.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.900
You may not realize that.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.870
No, seriously.

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:17.670
I'm going to key all your cars
in the parking lot, too,

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:18.680
because I'm bitter about it.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:22.370
No, but what is going on is that
I figure you guys are all

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.220
really smart, too, like me,
about this kind of stuff.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:28.520
That you've read a lot, that
you think creatively, and

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:33.670
therefore, if I can just off
the top my head set up a

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:36.010
really difficult problem that
can be solved by my main

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:40.280
character, the chances are,
anybody could solve that, and

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.730
therefore, nobody is going to
feel that's a sufficiently

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:45.660
difficult problem to hold
their attention.

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.190
They're going to come to it, and
they're going to go, oh,

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:48.940
well, crap, he's just
going to do this.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.100
I mean, that's what I'd do.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.980
So one of the ways to do with
that-- there are other ways to

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.420
deal with that, and one is just
to spend hours sitting

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:02.040
around thinking about it, trying
to make a problem with

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.990
a great, cool solution.

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:06.650
But what I find is a better way
to do it, oftentimes, is

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:09.210
just to write the character into
a situation that I can't

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.630
see any way to get
out of, right?

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:14.660
Because then I really, really,
really have to think about it.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.140
I have to say, oh my god,
he's got no nothing.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:21.520
He doesn't have a camping knife,
he doesn't have a piece

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:25.020
of string, he doesn't have a
rock to tie the string around.

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.520
He doesn't have anything.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.960
How is he going to
deal with this?

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.740
Or she, or whoever it is.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:34.700
And then I'm literally thinking
the same way the

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:37.550
reader is, but I have to come
up with a solution, because

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:40.000
I'm going to have to present
that solution, and it's going

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.540
to have to feel that way.

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.610
So that, for me is really fun.

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:46.280
I put myself in a situation
where I've got to dig my way

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.780
out, and that sometimes hypes up
the adrenaline as a writer

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:54.060
enough that it makes me more
close to what the character is

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:57.700
going through, more ready
to try anything.

00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:58.650
Nothing is too crazy.

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:00.070
What might work?

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:01.100
So yeah.

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.250
That happens all the time.

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:08.140
In the big books, not quite as
much, again, because I have to

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.770
fit all these things together
really intricately.

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:13.650
And I try to solve those
problems before I write them

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.930
down, because just otherwise--

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:18.830
Every now and then-- and this
has happened once or twice--

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:20.850
I've wound up writing myself
into situations that I

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:23.750
couldn't get back out of again,
and then I've actually

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:25.700
had to say, well, let's try
something different.

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.750
I'll put him in a slightly
different situation.

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:31.640
But generally, with the big
books, I try to solve that

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.690
ahead of time so I don't have
to rip out 200 pages of book

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:37.500
to remove that.

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.330
AUDIENCE: So you may say that
you don't want to do

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:40.260
something like this.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:42.690
But I'm curious which
of your epics--

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:47.910
"Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn,"
"Otherland," or "Shadowmarch"

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:51.440
would you want to work on and
put into the theater as three,

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.700
four, or eight movies.

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:53.870
Whatever it would take to do.

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:57.140
But which would you be most
excited to actually work on?

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:00.440
TAD WILLIAMS: Well, I can tell
you there's actually two

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:01.600
answers to that.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:06.470
One answer is that right at
the moment, with George

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:12.160
Martin's success with "Game of
Thrones," I'm going to be

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.450
forced to blow my own horn
slightly on this.

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:16.860
Actually, George has said
several times that one of the

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:21.350
reasons he wrote the "Game of
Thrones" series was because he

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:23.520
was involved in reading
my "Dragonbone

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.090
Chair," those books.

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:27.090
And I'll tell you
a funny story,

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:28.490
actually, in just a second.

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:30.860
And that was one of the things
that said to him, oh, you can

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:34.050
still do interesting things in
this genre, in this format.

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:36.560
And he's always been really
nice about that and

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.650
acknowledging that, even now
that he's richer than God.

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:43.070
And here's the quick short
story, and then I'll answer

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:43.990
the question.

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:48.250
The first time I met George in
person was at a Worldcon--

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:51.180
World Science Fiction Con, back
in the '80s, I think.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:56.470
And of course, George was not
yet famous like he is now, but

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:58.130
he was already a very
good writer.

00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:59.600
I had read several
things of his.

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.080
He'd had several award winning
short stories.

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:02.910
Great writer.

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:05.060
And those of you who knows what
George looks like, he

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:08.070
looked like that then, except
his beard was maybe a little

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:09.890
less gray and prospectory
looking.

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:13.240
But he was still a big guy, big
old grizzled beard, kind

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.340
of hat pulled down.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:18.390
And so there I was at
some convention.

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:19.532
There, somebody goes,
oh, and blah blah

00:46:19.532 --> 00:46:20.590
blah, and that's George.

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:21.556
And I went, oh my
God, that is.

00:46:21.556 --> 00:46:22.930
It's George Martin.

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:25.830
So I walked over to him and I
stuck my hand out and said,

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:27.170
"Hey, I'm Tad Williams.

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:28.280
Real pleasure to meet you."

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:34.020
And he goes, "Get the hell out
of here." I went, oh, jeez.

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:34.872
Um, um.

00:46:34.872 --> 00:46:37.320
And I thought, maybe
he's joking, right?

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.945
And I said, "Um, yeah.

00:46:39.945 --> 00:46:41.650
Yeah, anyway, I really
like your work.

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:42.600
I've always thought--"

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.270
"No, I'm serious.

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:46.520
Get the hell out of here."
And I'm like, oh my God.

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.650
What did I do?

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:52.200
And I went, "Oh, God, um, gee,
Mr. Martin, I'm sorry if I

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:52.980
offended you."

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.780
And he goes, "I'm waiting
for the damn next book.

00:46:54.780 --> 00:47:02.270
Go home and get writing." So
nightmare scenario suddenly

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.980
turns around.

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:06.800
And I would like it forever
endeared him to me, but I'm

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.190
still terrified of him.

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:10.570
I mean, I like George
very much.

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:12.265
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
same thing to him.

00:47:12.265 --> 00:47:13.750
TAD WILLIAMS: No, no, no.

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:15.000
I would now.

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:19.290
But anyway, great guy.

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:22.526
So what was the original
question?

00:47:22.526 --> 00:47:23.402
I had it.

00:47:23.402 --> 00:47:23.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:24.140
TAD WILLIAMS: Right.

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:24.620
OK.

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:27.730
So because of the success of
"Game of Thrones" and all

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:32.490
that, from a commercial point
of view, the "Dragonbone

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:36.510
Chair" books would
be very obvious.

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:39.030
And again, because of the
connection to George and all

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:40.960
that, and because they were
his inspiration, there's

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:44.720
characters in the "Game of
Thrones" that are named after

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:48.010
characters in those books
and stuff like that.

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:52.110
However, purely on the basis of
what I think would be the

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:55.740
most interesting, it would
be the "Otherland" books.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:48:00.590
In fact, we had an option with
Warner Brothers on the

00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:04.150
"Otherland" books, which
they let it lapse.

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:07.340
What I found that after they'd
got the option was that they

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:09.890
thought they might be able to
boil it down into one movie,

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:16.740
which is kind of like doing
the Bible and skipping

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:20.120
straight from Genesis to
Jesus or something.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.200
You're missing a lot of material
if you try and

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.800
shorten it that much.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.276
I'm not otherwise comparing
my work to the Bible.

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:33.940
But I think the "Otherland"
books, in a lot of ways, are

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:37.810
the most interesting and
original thing I've had a

00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:39.910
chance to write at length.

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:44.190
And I deliberately wrote them
to be a modern epic fantasy.

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:47.420
I was writing an epic fantasy
a la Tolkien, et cetera.

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.770
But I wanted to write something
that was of my era

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:52.550
and nobody else's era, and it
sprang very directly out of my

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:53.720
time at Apple.

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:55.420
I worked in interactive
multimedia.

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:58.560
I saw the early days
of [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:03.430
and the data glove and Autodesk
and Jet Propulsion

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:04.680
Laboratories, all this
kind of stuff.

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.770
I was doing the rounds.

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:09.950
And I remember actually being
very struck by something that

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:14.200
to this day has informed my
interest in interactive media,

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:18.480
which was one of the very first
interactive environments

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:22.370
that could have more than
one person in it.

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:25.075
And it was called Reality Built
for Two, I think, and

00:49:25.075 --> 00:49:27.370
this was done in
the late '80s.

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:30.030
And the guy who was doing a
presentation at the conference

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:32.870
said, OK, well once
we made this,

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:34.210
obviously we got in there.

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:36.530
And the first things you do is
start looking for games and

00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:37.240
stuff to play.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.580
So we had catch and all that.

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:44.780
And then because the people were
kind of polygonal, but

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:46.310
you could see that they were
people, and then there were a

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:48.310
lot of polygonal shapes
in there.

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:51.180
So the next thought everybody
had was, oh, we could play

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.810
hide and go seek, right?

00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:56.590
So people would start playing
hide and go seek in this

00:49:56.590 --> 00:50:00.600
Reality Built for Two, these
two interactives.

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.930
And then what the guy said
next just floored me.

00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:05.690
He said, but very quickly,
people discovered that the

00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:09.850
absolute best place to hide
was inside the guy you're

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:13.260
playing against's head.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.980
Because who ever thinks
to look in their own

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:16.140
head for the enemy?

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:20.400
Well, I could have told him
differently, but that was that

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:26.200
idea, that your avatar did not
have physical mass, so there

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.710
was nothing to prevent the other
character from jumping

00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:32.210
into the other player and just
staying inside you while

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:34.875
you're running around looking
everywhere going, where the

00:50:34.875 --> 00:50:35.526
hell is he?

00:50:35.526 --> 00:50:37.270
He's like, heeheehee,
in your head.

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:39.920
Or maybe that's just my head
where that voice happens.

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:41.020
Heeheehee.

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:44.680
But anyway, that really
struck me as like, oh,

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.810
OK, I get it now.

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:49.140
We're talking about a
new paradigm here.

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.540
We are not talking about the
same old three dimensional,

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:52.990
four dimensional crap.

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.990
This is different.

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:57.730
So ever since the beginning,
I thought, that's a really

00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:01.270
interesting thing to use as
a basis for a very modern

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:04.560
approach to fantasy, where
literally, we are what we

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:05.770
think we are.

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:08.520
And that's very science
fictional, but it also, to me,

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.220
was something I could make
it into an epic.

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:13.580
Because literally, everybody
could create the characters

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:17.110
that they wanted to be in
this interactive world.

00:51:17.110 --> 00:51:21.100
So how perfect for epic
fantasy quests?

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:25.450
So in that sense, I'd love to
see the "Otherland" books done

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:29.720
as like, a miniseries--
a cable miniseries or

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.280
something like that.

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.620
But I'll be honest with you.

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.420
Any of them are good,
because in this day

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:39.396
and age, it's really--

00:51:39.396 --> 00:51:43.560
if you've only been in books,
until you hit that next stage

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:47.070
where they have film and
other fodder out there

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:48.760
for people to find--

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.850
it's not that you develop
so many fans directly.

00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:53.440
It's just that you're talked
about more, and people begin

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.660
to know about you.

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:58.140
So I'd love to see any of those
things happen, and I

00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:00.220
want to see them finish the
"Otherland" game as well,

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:02.690
which is currently stalled at
the moment, while it's being

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:04.660
changed studios.

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:06.870
AUDIENCE: Going back to all
these different worlds you've

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:10.740
created, and some of these
epics, one of the things that

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:14.080
I've always thought was great
was you'd finish the series

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:16.880
and I still want more.

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:19.160
Do you ever consider going
back to these and

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:19.940
expanding on them?

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:26.500
I mean, there's the tradeoff
between the neverending story

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:31.060
that goes nowhere, but
sometimes, as a reader, I

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:33.050
really want more.

00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:36.170
TAD WILLIAMS: If you had asked
me that question 10 years ago,

00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:38.340
my answer would have been
very different.

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:40.530
If you'd asked me then,
I would have said,

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:42.890
I don't think so.

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:45.870
In part because, as you may have
gathered from some of the

00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:49.010
things I said earlier, I always
feel like I don't have

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:49.730
enough time.

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:52.040
I've got so many ideas
and not enough time.

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.880
On the other hand, though,
what has happened to me

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:57.930
recently, as I've gotten to a
point in my life where I am

00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:01.920
different enough now from the
person who wrote these--

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.960
I have lived in other countries
since then.

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:08.140
I have had kids since then,
which is a life changing

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:10.020
experience.

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:12.210
Some might call it
a life destroying

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:13.860
experience, but not me.

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.835
I am a braver man than that.

00:53:15.835 --> 00:53:17.500
No, I've loved having kids.

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:21.010
But, I mean, some of these
things, it's been going on 30

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:24.030
years, 25 years since some of
these books are written.

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:28.900
So I now could come to those
without feeling like I was

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:31.140
franchising my own material.

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:32.220
That's always been my thing.

00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:35.850
I hate when I feel like a writer
is writing something

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:39.550
because they've got something
that's making them money, and

00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:40.875
if they just keep
writing them--

00:53:40.875 --> 00:53:42.980
and it's been a problem
for me.

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:45.200
A lot of publishers have said,
Tad, if you would have just

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:48.990
kept doing Osten Ard "Dragonbone
Chair" books, or,

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:51.290
oh, everybody liked
"Tailchaser's Song," just keep

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:52.090
writing cat books.

00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:54.070
I mean, I've had that all
through, because I

00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:55.120
don't work that way.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.840
I follow the idea.

00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:00.150
But I am at a point now where
I am beginning to look at

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:05.100
things and say, yeah, I could
bring a perspective to this.

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:07.820
And for me, the cardinal rule
has always been, I will not

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:12.150
start anything without the story
coming first, including

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:15.032
something based in a world
I've already written.

00:54:15.032 --> 00:54:18.220
But that's kept me from a lot of
those, because I never had

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:19.090
any story ideas.

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:20.980
I'm always working
on something new.

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:21.530
Lately--

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:23.840
without going into
any details--

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:30.260
lately, some fairly coherent
story items have begun to find

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:33.980
each other and down a few
cosmos and get a little

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:39.060
friendly in the great cocktail
party that is the back of my

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:41.870
mind, based in one of
the worlds I've

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:43.900
already written about.

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:48.800
But because if I do do this,
it will be as close to

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:51.430
newsworthy as anything that ever
happens in my tiny little

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:54.900
world, I'm not ready
to announce yet.

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:58.780
But I'm definitely thinking
about it very seriously for

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:01.030
the first time in many years.

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.930
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:03.270
Thank you so much for
joining us, Tad.

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:05.230
TAD WILLIAMS: Well, thank you
very much for having me, and

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:06.270
very nice to meet you all.

00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:08.530
And anybody who wants to get a
book signed or anything, I'm

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:09.250
happy to do that.

00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:10.020
That's why I'm here.

00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:10.380
MALE SPEAKER: Excellent.

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:10.830
All right.

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:12.100
He'll be around for a
little bit longer.

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:13.000
Thank you.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.690
[APPLAUSE]
