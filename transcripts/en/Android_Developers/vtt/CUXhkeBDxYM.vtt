00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:13.599
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Android Developer Relations Office
Hours.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:19.200
I'm Sparky from Munich, Germany and I'm joined
by my colleagues, Matt and Nick and Rich in

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.980
London, UK, Matt with Google TV.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.070
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: In [INDISTINCT] Burrito Mike's
this week.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.070
So, we have...

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.450
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Burrito [INDISTINCT] he's okay.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.369
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: We have Richard, the editor of
GeekYouUp.com

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.369
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yup.

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.530
My account is for...

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.360
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And the android account is Matt.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.489
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Hi.

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:42.980
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: My clothes today are brought to
you by The Dutch Android User Group.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:50.789
We always do someone [INDISTINCT] and the
[INDISTINCT] GTALK [INDISTINCT] on the back.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.909
Nick brought to us by Christmas I think.

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.749
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yes, it's my Christmas jumper.

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:01.660
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Christmas jumper.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.579
And Matt by…

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:11.260
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Nothing goes wrong with a man's
style with Google S [INDISTINCT]

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.460
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I was going to say Matt--Matt and
I are in--are in uniform today, so.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.490
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: That's very good.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.500
&gt;&gt; RHODE: All right.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.500
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Someone had to be, Matthew.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.500
Sorry Sparky we high jacked your beautiful
intro.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.500
Carry on.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.500
&gt;&gt; RHODE: No, no, no.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.060
That was--that was far more interesting than
just having me say the usual thing.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.060
But anyway, welcome everybody.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.880
This is Android Developer Relations Office
Hours.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.920
We're here to talk to you about anything related
to android application development.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.800
Usual disclaimers apply which Rich will be
happy to deliver.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.300
Basically, we generally restrict ourselves
to SDK related issues.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.500
We don't talk about deep internals.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.530
We don't talk about unreleased products or
our future plans.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.940
But apart from that, we're happy to--we're
happy to basically, you know, see what you're

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.200
interested in, talk about what you're interested
in.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:13.799
I see we're already joined in the Hangout
by several people.

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.709
We got some folks who have contributed questions
in the Moderator.

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:19.709
Hi, Andrew.

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.709
&gt;&gt; KELLY: Hey.

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.239
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And Andrew has a camera because
his girlfriend or wife isn't watching X-Factor

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.239
today.

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.049
&gt;&gt; KELLY: I can't see myself though.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.139
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh.

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:32.230
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Interesting.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.859
&gt;&gt; KELLY: All right.

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:34.859
Yeah.

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:42.540
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I've always hope they put it in
Youtube live stream at the same time works

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.939
quite well, if you want to be 10 seconds behind
the rest of us.

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.389
Who's joined us on the far end side.

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:52.429
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It's Yossi.

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:53.429
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Oh, Yossi.

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:54.429
There we go.

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:55.429
Hi.

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:56.429
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Yossi?

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:57.429
We have Yossi here.

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:58.429
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yossi.

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:02.819
&gt;&gt; RHODE: And so he got the memo about the
facial hair.

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:03.819
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: Yup, excellent.

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.790
I'm about to start a team.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.219
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Join the club.

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:13.979
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: So we have Allan, Andy or Andrew
and Yossi all with us in the Hangout today.

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:15.159
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Okay.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.900
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Maybe [INDISTINCT] Good quality
camera for Elkrief.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.079
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Yeah.

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.639
So, what's on your mind everybody?

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:37.639
Who has something that you'd like to share
with us or want to--have a question you want

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:38.639
to ask?

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.909
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Well, I've got something I'd like
to share.

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.469
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Go Rich, go.

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:51.260
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It's just that we did for the
UK, specifically may have launched the 2,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.569
3, and 1s that went passed recently.

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.819
But the Nexus 7, tablet of the year.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.480
In fact--was it gadget of the year?

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.480
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Gadget.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.389
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Only one vote cast because it
beat out the Ipad 3 for tablet of year and

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.269
it won the overall, the big cache grade, the
gadget of the year.

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.959
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Gadget of the year is The Nexus
7.

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.500
So we've been having a few little parties
around with Google Office here to celebrate

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.500
that.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.790
Thank you very much to T3.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.690
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Doesn't an old tablet look good?

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.359
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Good indeed.

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:27.900
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I have to say, I mean it is a marvelous
device.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.919
The Nexus 7 is my--basically my go to android
device.

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:44.090
I mean I'll use my phone if I'm out and about
because I don't generally bring the tablet,

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.090
you know.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:58.460
I mean I'll even bring my Nexus 7 with me
but it's in my bag, the phone is in my pocket.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:06.069
But, you know, anywhere that I'm within range
of Wifi, the Nexus 7 is the device I want

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:07.069
to use.

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:08.069
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Uh-hmm.

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:09.069
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:10.069
&gt;&gt; BUTCHERS: Agreed.

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.259
So to developers out there, if you haven't
started looking at your apps and, you know,

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:21.390
if it's running well, if it's optimized for
the screen size and so on then, now is a good

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.390
time.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.390
&gt;&gt; Rhode: Yeah.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.540
Actually that reminds--that reminds me.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.500
Isn't this week Tablet Week?

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.700
Shouldn't we be talking a whole lot about
tablets today?

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.310
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, we got a bit early last
week?

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.020
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, we probably recorded online.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.699
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Oh, yeah.

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:40.910
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I missed it.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:41.910
I was...

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.389
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: I didn't call for a week and then
realized that it was Tablet Week.

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:46.440
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Is that Leslie?

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.790
Is that you?

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.490
&gt;&gt; DREWERY: Hey, how are you doing?

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.830
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: He's muting.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.980
And we'll say hello through sign language.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:02.770
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Now, last week while you guys were
talking tablets, I was out there--I was out

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.979
there celebrating Deutschen Einheit.

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.150
It's a national holiday here in Germany last
week.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.150
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.480
We're jumping again on tablets.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:18.320
Have you joined us today because you’ve
got some questions, Leslie, or you just come

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.770
along to hangout?

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.639
&gt;&gt; DREWERY: Just to hangout and see what's
happening.

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.080
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: All right, I see.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.169
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Welcome to the Hangout.

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:35.310
I see that also Richard Thompson has just
jumped on.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.539
Hello, Richard.

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.960
Do you have anything you want to talk about?

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.539
Maybe we'll give you a moment to get yourself
establish.

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:46.409
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, man.

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:48.020
Give him a chance.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.020
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.020
So, yeah.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:58.310
This is a point that anyone in the Hangout
can jump in and ask a question before we hit

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.310
the Moderator.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.639
If anyone has anything they'd like to discuss.

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:04.730
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yossi is showing off some rather
a fancy [INDISTINCT]

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.629
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Oh, is that a serious tree?

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:15.349
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: I wouldn't like not to interrupt
you but I just wanted to show you our office

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:16.770
and also these.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:17.770
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Nice.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.510
You've redecorated your entire office to be
android.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.400
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Excellent, you know.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.819
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Hey, cool.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:25.819
Nice sticks.

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:27.669
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Good work, Yossi.

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:28.669
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Explicit.

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:30.039
I like it.

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:31.999
I like it a lot.

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:33.560
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Interesting.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:40.710
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I'm sure that it enhances your
ability to do android development.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.860
Nice talking.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:51.610
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And just to catch up when we were
talking about tablets as well, I think the

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:57.860
reason we declared this Tablet Week is arbitrary
but it's also mostly to celebrate the new

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.419
quality guidelines we just released.

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:10.479
So it's a series of kind of checks you can
do to make sure your application is going

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:13.539
to look stellar on a--on larger devices.

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:16.970
So, hopefully you guys have all seen the blog
release on android-developers.blogspot.com

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:23.439
and seen the checklist and gone through that
and have a look at your apps and kind of seen

00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:29.979
do they make use of white space, are they
going to scale, are they going to be available

00:08:29.979 --> 00:08:33.159
on all devices which might have different
hardware configurations.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.730
So it's kind of what catalyze this week's
kind of theme.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:39.479
And Richard in the sidebar asks, "Will there
be Google TV quality guidelines?"

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:42.690
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I mean that’s--so we've got a
lot of…

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.839
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I'm going to pass to Matt.

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:49.170
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: …documentation on Google TV design
guidelines over at developers.google.com/tv.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:54.730
So, yeah, we've got a whole load of stuff
there about making it very cinematic and accounting

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:59.080
for [INDISTINCT] You're not--you're not really
going sort of--the interaction is more safer.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.940
It's less of a one to one kind of thing where
people are usually using a personal device.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.900
So, yeah, go check that out.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.510
Lots of info there.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:12.379
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So that's the checklist more of
kind of document or so?

00:09:12.379 --> 00:09:13.379
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:21.089
It's much more kind of along the lines of
like the new design stuff that android went

00:09:21.089 --> 00:09:25.420
through whereas it's more of--yeah, going
through the different sort of design patterns

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.770
you could follow and other aspects, so.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:39.649
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Has anyone on the--in the hangout
had a chance to have a look at the Tablet

00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:40.730
Quality Guidelines yet?

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.730
Any one?

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:42.730
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: Not yet.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.480
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah, I've had a quick look through
them.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.480
It looks cool.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.480
It's…

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.029
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Do you suppose it's the kind of
thing you can--you can see yourself running

00:09:52.029 --> 00:09:53.029
through?

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:54.029
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah, definitely.

00:09:54.029 --> 00:09:59.010
The checklist is definitely something I'm
going to run through in every app because

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.250
it's one of those things, you make assumptions
about stuff.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:11.519
You get caught up in the design and then you
sit there and I think, "Oh, I've forgotten

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:12.870
something fundamental."

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:17.050
So it's really useful to--so I see that checklist
is really useful to have.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.050
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.540
Especially when you're developing like you
are into like develop on device perhaps.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.440
You might get into a single device mindset
where you, you know, going through debug cycles

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.510
trying to like get this piece of functionality
working and shift it.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.410
And you sometimes don't think about the brackets
or stuff out there.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:35.510
So I think having this simple checklist is
really helpful.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.730
So have you guys seen it too?

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:42.070
And if you have any feedbacks or suggestions
then--to any android developers or one of

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.370
us and we can--we can suggest it.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.660
Everyone is getting their [INDISTINCT] heads
on.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.660
Look at this.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.660
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Yeah.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.840
That’s just the whole thing.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.050
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Cool.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:58.800
So, are there any live questions in the Hangout
or any other news that people want to share

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.519
before we kind of jump into the Moderator?

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:03.550
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Google TV is getting play.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.550
It's getting native play.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.550
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yes.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.550
Welcome to the club.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:07.550
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Which--yeah, I know.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.490
It's been a long--long awaiting.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:14.029
So, yeah, Google TV is finally getting native
play.

00:11:14.029 --> 00:11:23.990
So you can finally rent and buy movies and
play it straight to Google TV which is fantastic.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.270
We might grab on that.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.280
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So, any changes for developers?

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.020
Anything, like any different internal docs
or whatever they can use now that they couldn't

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.320
before or anything like that?

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.370
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: No, I'm unaware.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.459
We get subscription billing with the native
play.

00:11:35.459 --> 00:11:38.430
So when that’s come in, that’s one which
I think a lot of people been wanting for a

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.430
little while.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.430
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Cool.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.430
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: So, yeah.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.430
That's basically what's going on.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.430
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: So you have it up and running
right now and that’s going to take…

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:44.430
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:50.170
For the moment we just got enough billing,
no subscriptions.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.269
So that’s going to come out.

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:54.269
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: That's inevitable.

00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:56.290
Quite like last night, in fact.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.519
Free trials, no subscription.

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:58.519
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Uh-hmm.

00:11:58.519 --> 00:11:59.519
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Everyone caught that?

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:04.430
If you have a subscription-based product with
the [INDISTINCT] without the free period it's

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.350
kind of getting used as hooks.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.729
Oh, that seems--check down the sidebar.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:10.729
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Yeah.

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:12.889
So Leslie asked a question in the sidebar.

00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:20.500
He says, "How many companies are using the
accessibility framework and how does it sort

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.240
of stiffly refute all the good ones?"

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:29.370
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Well, you know, we certainly have
recommended many times in the past that people

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.730
should at least put the content description
on all of their HTML text.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:39.790
So it's just going to basically work but in
terms of using the entire accessibility framework,

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.920
I don't have a metric on that.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.920
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.070
I have no stats.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:52.269
I do know that Wolfram basically post a good
article on this lately.

00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:56.009
So if anyone reads Grokking android block--blog,
it's great, a typical blog.

00:12:56.009 --> 00:13:00.310
He recently did a very good post determining
how you would add accessibility towards your

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.310
apps, so.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.310
Yeah.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:03.440
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; DREWERY: Well, the actual question is who

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.019
uses it for anything other than the simple
content description?

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:12.399
I mean we use it quite extensively but the
solution to how powerful it really is to why

00:13:12.399 --> 00:13:13.920
people are using it?

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.370
I think Richard here is in Joint Club this
month.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:18.519
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Excuse me.

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:21.960
I've got a bit of a cough going on.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.310
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Which one, Joint Club UK?

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:25.880
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Joint Club UK?

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.060
&gt;&gt; DREWERY: UK, yeah.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.089
Yeah, let me get there.

00:13:29.089 --> 00:13:34.209
I'll give you an insight to what we use in
the framework form, then you'll understand

00:13:34.209 --> 00:13:35.930
the question in context to that.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:39.579
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It's a question of which context
will come three weeks later?

00:13:39.579 --> 00:13:40.579
&gt;&gt; DREWERY: Yeah.

00:13:40.579 --> 00:13:42.009
Well, remind me when you're there.

00:13:42.009 --> 00:13:46.820
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And I'll see if I can dig out
anything relevant for you of that quite as

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.010
well, then I'll see you at Joint Club.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.610
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Joint Club UK?

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.800
I guess I will be there as well.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.800
&gt;&gt; DREWERY: Yup.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.800
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Anyone else?

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.800
&gt;&gt; BANES: Hello.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.580
I'm going to be there.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:00.780
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Hi Chris.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.839
I see you pop in there and Matt as well.

00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:04.839
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yup.

00:14:04.839 --> 00:14:10.880
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: They'll be quite a few of us who'll
train from UK.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.880
Okay.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.200
So we jump into the Moderator then.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.670
Well, Sparky, people hangout for the next
question.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:17.700
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Yeah.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.129
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: He's going to do it.

00:14:20.129 --> 00:14:23.069
&gt;&gt; RHODE: First question is from Chris in
London.

00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:29.199
Is there a reason why Google does not release
updates to new android versions for all interested

00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:33.980
developers of Nexus 7 and Galaxy Nexus devices
right away outside along the [INDISTINCT]

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.509
cycle without having to route to the device,
etcetera.

00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:38.370
Well, of course, there's a reason.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:44.250
Oh, he says, "It would be--" He goes on to
say, "It would be convenient to have an option

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:49.310
of developer options where you app in to the
latest releases immediately rather than waiting

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:53.720
for your turn on the OTA," you know, sort
of phase rule out.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.010
And he says, "Yes, it's only basically a developer
thing.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:01.660
Not a lot of people would necessarily be using
it."

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:09.620
I actually think that's a great idea and I
like it so much that I opened the ticket in

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.700
our issue tracking systems saying we should
do this.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.560
So, I don't know that you would save a lot
of time because we don't really waste a lot

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.630
of time between, you know.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:24.230
And then, you've code freeze an OTA or perhaps
maybe the other way to turn around or just

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.699
say sometimes we have a scheduled [INDISTINCT]
deployment and we code right up into the last

00:15:27.699 --> 00:15:28.699
possible minute.

00:15:28.699 --> 00:15:29.699
But...

00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:33.930
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Plus it seems to me we do a release
and we normally release the recovery images,

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:34.930
right?

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.519
The--so you can grab one of those and flash
yourself.

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:37.519
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yup.

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:42.670
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Or as soon as it hits OTA, I'm
pretty sure you can find the link to download

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.670
it.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:50.880
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: People get the links and you don't
three devices to apply the official signs,

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.880
patches anyway.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:52.880
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Yeah.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.730
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: That's how we choose it.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:16:00.519
Is Chris, was this you Chris Banes or is there
a different Chris in London?

00:16:00.519 --> 00:16:02.450
&gt;&gt; BANES: Well, it was me.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.610
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Fair enough.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.920
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: What was the one Chris?

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.690
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I said Chris in London.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:13.380
There happens to be a Chris in here.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.339
Couldn't be in the same room?

00:16:15.339 --> 00:16:16.339
&gt;&gt; BANES: Right.

00:16:16.339 --> 00:16:18.220
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Actually, I'm not--and of course,
there's something like sometimes in the OTAs

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:26.589
if certain carriers require approval before
we apply patches to devices on the network.

00:16:26.589 --> 00:16:33.680
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yup, so a device that's developed
via straight from PLATO google.com and you

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.990
don't have a de--a carrier in between the
OTA service and to your device device.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.260
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: This reference code is there for
EMEA.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.779
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Right.

00:16:43.779 --> 00:16:53.480
But it's--so, the gist of my--the ticket that
I opened was I suggested that basically people

00:16:53.480 --> 00:17:02.500
who app in to this should be able to jump
to the head of the cue in the phase roll out

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.260
rather than, you know, waiting a few days.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:11.900
That way if you have an app that, you know,
maybe breaks on the near release you can fix

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.769
it asap rather than having to wait a couple
of days free of term to get something wrong.

00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:22.370
&gt;&gt; BANES: The trick of that is wouldn't everyone
just go, "Yeah, I'm a developer."

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:23.370
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:28.840
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I'm just thinking that maybe it
has to be like in the pub site or some...

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.840
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.840
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ...of that actually.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.039
You have to be...

00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:33.039
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Right.

00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:36.830
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Yeah, yeah, maybe enroll a device
through the developer console or something

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:37.830
like that.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:38.830
&gt;&gt; BANES: Uh-huh.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:39.830
Yeah, that's probably...

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.530
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT] through the play
console and you just grab the [INDISTINCT]

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.530
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:56.559
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: If you're a developer, you're
going to be happy enough with that I'm sure.

00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:57.559
Yeah.

00:17:57.559 --> 00:18:00.840
So, all good ideas.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:09.880
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: One of the--one of the ways I read
that is aren't they looking for a version

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.880
between releases?

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.880
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Uh-hmm.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.730
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: So, instead of waiting for a 4.10
to 4.11 or 4.1--4.0 to 4.1 without looking

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.100
for something between those two.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.100
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Uh-hmm.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:25.380
So that's what we did for the first time we
had Jelly bean, right?

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.190
We kind of had the developer preview.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:34.140
It was out there for awhile so you could run
it in the emulator and you could get to know

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:40.630
the new API's before we went to shifting runs
and with the shifting devices and the final

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:41.630
full image, right?

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:42.630
So I think that seems to be the direction
we're going.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:46.419
But I'd like to see us do it earlier if we
can but, you know, I don't make these decisions.

00:18:46.419 --> 00:18:47.419
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:48.419
Okay.

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:50.810
Well, seeing as no one is shouting, let's
switch on to the next question in the Moderator.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.580
We've got quite a few to get through today.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.380
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Let's jump to the next question.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:01.530
Mardon in Brayton, UK says, "I know it's still
a fair few amounts away but JAVA 8 is on the

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:02.530
horizon."

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:03.530
Okay.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:04.530
Al gave a very good answer to that.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:08.770
Al, do you want to--you want to reprise for
us want you said?

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:09.770
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Sure.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:15.110
Basically and Google is, you guys can't answer
forward looking statements about product development.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:23.440
But one of the things with lambda expressions
is they need a change in the virtual machine

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.730
which came in in JAVA 7 and the Dalvik virtual
machine which android uses isn't equivalent

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.780
to a JAVA virtual machine.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:45.740
So, you can't exactly say that version of
JAVA would be the same as the bytecode available

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:53.270
in the version of the Dalvik virtual machine.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:20:05.120
So, there would probably be some work to implement
the functionality needed in the Dalvik virtual

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:15.200
machine and I see that that doesn't seem to
have started to being happened.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:21.799
So, it might happen but its not going to be
for awhile yet would be pretty much is the

00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:22.860
gist of the answer.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:23.860
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Uh-hmm, interesting.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.860
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Right.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:34.529
And so the short version of Al's answer is
we're still in--we're still using JAVA 1.6

00:20:34.529 --> 00:20:38.080
as our target environment and targeted API
level.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.670
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah, pretty much.

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:42.450
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: What else is in JAVA 8?

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:46.140
I mean, I miss my lambda so much.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.120
I used to use lambdas a lot.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.120
What else is in 8?

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.160
There's not a lot in 7, right?

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.429
There's the diamond operator and that's about
it.

00:20:58.429 --> 00:21:01.650
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: There's a lot of stuff underneath
the hood in 7.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:06.380
There's--one of the--its Dynamicinvoke I think
is the bi-code that got introduced in JAVA

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:12.470
7 which allows support for none JAVA languages
to be compiled.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:13.470
That's...

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.900
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, like GVV and so on.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.010
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Exactly.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:23.110
And it's that which is needed to get lambda
expressions sorted as well.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.309
So I think a lot of the 7 was underneath the
hoods but...

00:21:26.309 --> 00:21:31.520
&gt;&gt; BANES: It's also a--Its Project Coin so
that was the whole rebound that fits in the

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.520
language.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.600
Just the thought you can use switch, a lot
of strings in switch statements and stuff

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.600
like that.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.179
I think that was pushed back from 7 to 8.

00:21:41.179 --> 00:21:42.620
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: That's right.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.240
&gt;&gt; BANES: But I can't remember the 8.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.240
So, yeah.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:51.630
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I was running that because a lot
of this stuff at lambda can--is often like

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:52.630
syntatical sugars.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:58.860
It's often stuff that might not have low down
changes but you might...

00:21:58.860 --> 00:21:59.980
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Uh-hmm.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.980
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ...give a go over [INDISTINCT]
or something.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.799
But I know nothing about that stuff.

00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:05.799
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah.

00:22:05.799 --> 00:22:12.770
I mean, you can achieve pretty much the same
stuff with using a list of classes and interphases.

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:16.930
And that's the whole thing that lambda expressions
are being sort of touted as replacing.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:17.930
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:22.860
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: So there's no absolute need for
them but it's one of those things.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.130
The less case you type, the happy your developers
are.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:27.130
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.070
Let's close maintain, let's boil the plate.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.500
It's easier to read samples.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.700
I think--I think lambda is a great [INDISTINCT]
mark but yeah, I'd like to see them.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.150
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Oh, no comment.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:38.150
Okay.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:42.230
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Well, I didn't know if it wasn't--if
and when they're coming but...

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:43.309
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: By December.

00:22:43.309 --> 00:22:44.400
Anymore for anymore?

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.500
Anything in the chat?

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.210
Anything in the Google+ thread?

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.000
Is anyone through in that?

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: No.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.700
I know we had it and now, I've lost--oh, got
it.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.700
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.160
Who's going to get that first?

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.160
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Okay.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.310
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: You haven't joined like...

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.909
&gt;&gt; RHODE: While you're checking Google+, I'll
read the next--the next Moderator question.

00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:07.409
Igo in Lviv, a great city where my previous
employer before at Google had an engineering

00:23:07.409 --> 00:23:12.000
team, says, "Have you heard of android annotations
transfuse squares dagger links included?

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.049
These are annotation based compile-time code
generation controls.

00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:17.040
What do we think of these?"

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.370
I mentioned a few more, RoboGuice, GreenDroid,
ORMLite.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.870
I think they're all perfectly fine.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:27.250
The problem basically is that every time you
introduce any kind of an obstruction layer

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.910
on top of an API, it has the potential to
simplify matters as long as you stay within

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:34.700
it but when you--when you start integrating
with the native other features of the system

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.070
sometimes it may not integrate quite so smoothly.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:42.500
So, I think they're all good ideas and I think
it's worth, maybe worth a little bit of time

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.840
investigating and see if it works for your
used case.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.620
I, you know, nothing against them.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:55.770
It's just a matter of is the, you know, is
the benefit that you gain from it worth the

00:23:55.770 --> 00:24:00.070
potential inconvenience of fitting it in together
with the rest of the system.

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:01.090
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Understood.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:10.289
In agreement to Sparky, one of the thing I'll
add to that is the reason I quite like the

00:24:10.289 --> 00:24:15.779
annotation based one is that there tend to
be a compile-time kind of stuff rather than

00:24:15.779 --> 00:24:17.610
looking at runtime things.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:24.640
Like looking at some of that RoboGuice for
example which offers great functionality but

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:39.540
you're going to take a hit at runtime using
the reflection and so on.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:48.930
So, I think that's one of the advances why
I'd probably look into something like dagger

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:51.260
or, you know, android annotations.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.539
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Uh-hmm.

00:24:52.539 --> 00:24:57.260
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Instead of the runtime ones just
because performance is such a consideration

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.399
on my book.

00:24:58.399 --> 00:25:00.929
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: So...

00:25:00.929 --> 00:25:04.309
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Any other comments?

00:25:04.309 --> 00:25:08.770
&gt;&gt; BANES: What you said--Sparky mentioned
the ORMLite and I mean that's a runtime one

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:14.270
so that's runtime annotations as [INDISTINCT]
GreenDroid whereas that's compile-time but

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.270
it has more work in it.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.770
So, I'm just--I'm not agreeing.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:20.770
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:26.470
My call on these things is they tend to be
awesome when you know how to use them.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.950
Like once you--if you're the developer of
the project or something.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:30.950
&gt;&gt; BANES: Yeah.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.850
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And you know it inside out, it's
like, "Look, how easy it is.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:37.380
I could just like annotate this one annotation
and just a billion things."

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:44.490
Well, I find them quite like quite hard to
learn, quite hard to pick up unless you have

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:50.290
that whole surface area of knowledge about
the--of what it is.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:55.570
And I find it can actually be hard to debug
sometimes if you don't know when stuff--especially

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.620
where there are tons of junctions.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:06.440
If you don't know when stuff is getting crazy
and substantiating where it's coming from,

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:17.610
you know, if you have this great team and
someone is trying to come and debug an issue

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:21.250
then it can make it more complicated.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:25.940
So, those are my only concerns about--around
these frameworks.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:34.280
Like if you have just some, you know, not
standard but, you know, an android developer

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:40.309
who is coming in and want to have experience
and it could put him off but otherwise I think

00:26:40.309 --> 00:26:48.330
that you have tons of benefits.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.330
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:54.669
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I'll also add just for the point,
just for the sake of adding it that GreenDroid

00:26:54.669 --> 00:26:58.019
comes from Munich, Germany so go Munich.

00:26:58.019 --> 00:26:59.460
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Go Munich.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:03.340
We've got another question at Google+ and
another question in the chat.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.920
So, Leslie asked in the chat.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.610
When will be able to add our own channels?

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:11.559
Maybe referring to--where's Leslie?

00:27:11.559 --> 00:27:14.309
Are you referring to Google Play Store?

00:27:14.309 --> 00:27:16.529
Yes, you can nod this way.

00:27:16.529 --> 00:27:20.679
&gt;&gt; DREWERY: Well, the problem with Google
TV is that I very would like it to be able

00:27:20.679 --> 00:27:23.090
to control my V+ box and stuff like that.

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:27.750
And I know the frequencies so I just want
to add them but without routing the device

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.519
that complicates the channel list.

00:27:29.519 --> 00:27:30.519
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Okay.

00:27:30.519 --> 00:27:31.519
So...

00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:32.519
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Over to Matt.

00:27:32.519 --> 00:27:36.390
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: So at the moment you can't access
the channel list in Europe.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:44.899
We're working to bring that over here because
over in the US it's a lot easier to get that

00:27:44.899 --> 00:27:46.200
data for the channels that you have access
to.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.640
When you start going internationally it depends
on which country you're in.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.350
There's a couple weird little quirks.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:54.309
Like people in Germany they can change the
order of the channels which they're not set

00:27:54.309 --> 00:27:57.650
out to update here, et cetera.

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:06.690
So basically we're trying to find a nice reliable
way to actually give you access to that information.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:13.700
But some of the stuff of you're talking about
just then, it remind of an API that we announced

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:19.020
at Google I/O called the immediate devices
API where you can then essentially pretend

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:26.200
it to be a set of top box or sort of create
a driver for an actual set of top box and

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.130
then you can start communicating between the
two.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:36.750
So that's going to come with a later version
of Google TV which we don't have a date for

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:37.750
yet.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:40.570
But hopefully it won't be too long.

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:41.760
So, yeah.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.929
So, I've answered your question I hope.

00:28:45.929 --> 00:28:48.320
&gt;&gt; DREWERY: Yeah, sort of.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.960
What [INDISTINCT] take to get that upgrade
though?

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.420
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I believe not much will take if
you will, I believe.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:56.420
&gt;&gt; DREWERY: Okay.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.420
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Fingers crossed.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.420
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yes.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.640
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So in the--in the corner feed,

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:06.150
Yan is asking about a layout guide for NEXUS
7 in landscape and template one tablets in

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:07.150
landscape.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.910
Well, like what would you want to know?

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:12.020
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I was thinking use the same layout.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:16.260
You can use the same for tablet [INDISTINCT]
and the Nexus 7.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.790
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: The answer is it depends.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:18.940
It depends what you're trying to layout.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:24.240
Like this is why we always say work through
your design because you kind of--there is

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:29.279
no magic law that says, this is the layout
that works on the phone that will work in

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:31.289
a 7 or work out on 7.

00:29:31.289 --> 00:29:33.960
What works on 7 will work on 10.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.299
There's nothing like that.

00:29:35.299 --> 00:29:38.470
It really depends on your content.

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:43.460
So, what I always end up doing when I'm trying
to like say mock up screens for Android Design

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:48.230
in Action, you might start with the phone
layout and then like see what it looks like

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:50.010
on 10 and it might be too empty, it might
be too dense.

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:53.960
It really is like a kind of a gut feeling
thing.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:30:00.290
You end up kind of trying on different size
layouts until you get the right amount and

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:04.620
the spacing, the right kind of density of
information.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.250
So there's no magic law.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:09.630
You kind of have to look at it and decide.

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:16.630
And in fact, if you look at the Nexus 7 at
the system master sheet where some of them

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:23.570
use the UI which switch shift on the phone
and some of them use the tablet UI.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:32.210
So, people application for example uses a
tablet based on UI and it, you know, use this

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.799
basically nicely without too confusing and
so on.

00:30:35.799 --> 00:30:41.390
But some of the applications like Google Play
Music for example who uses the frame UI.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:48.440
It's a decision made by each kind of an application
depending on the information they're trying

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:53.490
to show and just how well it works in that
given amount of space.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:56.010
So there is no answer to this.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:31:01.880
It's try and have a look to see if it works.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:09.940
If not, you might need to hint things, you
might need to change something, you might

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.210
need to add more space, bigger text sizes
and like that.

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:13.330
So there's no hard and fast rule.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:18.789
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: And the Nexus 7 falls into the
SW600dp bucket in the layouts as well.

00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:25.630
So you're going to have your--in a 10-inch
tablet you can put in the SW720s, your Nexus

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.159
7 and SW600s.

00:31:27.159 --> 00:31:33.680
And if you want the same layouts you can just
get rid of the shortest width 720 folder and

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.240
you just pick up size that says the 7-inch.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:41.730
But you can very easily distinguish between
a seven-inch and ten-inch tablets and decide

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:48.020
what goes in each one just by testing it and
what's best.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:54.120
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I find it quite interesting as
well that the Nexus 7 originally the launcher

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.260
was locked in portrait mode.

00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:07.540
And the latest release of Jelly Bean which
is out and about now allows you to do the

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:13.799
wonderful thing of having the launcher in
landscape as well.

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:17.129
So, I guess it's--it really is just...

00:32:17.129 --> 00:32:20.429
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [MAKES NOISE]
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yup, that's it.

00:32:20.429 --> 00:32:24.690
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I can do it on mine too.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:29.100
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: ...just a matter of...
&gt;&gt; RHODE: It's just wanting to get it right.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.100
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah.

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.680
So, it's just goes to show that there's a
lot of experimentation that you need to do

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.680
before you get things that you enjoy.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.680
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yes.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.620
&gt;&gt; RHODE: One thing that I've noticed recently
is I've been a little bit surprise that even

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:42.309
now, like we we're what, a year and a half
after Honeycomb?

00:32:42.309 --> 00:32:45.530
There's a lot of apps especially games adjust.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:52.230
Like even on a 10-inch tablet they just scale
up the phone UI and I think it's--in particular

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:57.970
for games it's more of a problem even than
some of the others.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:06.101
I mean yes, they don't have a problem with,
you know, huge amounts of white space because

00:33:06.101 --> 00:33:07.440
they're using OpenGL and scaling everything
proportionally.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:14.320
But some of these games used gestures where
the amount that you travel on screen matters

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.020
and it can actually be significantly harder
to play the same game on a tablet because

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:24.600
you have to move your finger that much faster
in the same amount or that much further in

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:25.600
the same amount of time.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.980
I’m thinking of games like Flight Control
or Flick Golf or something like that where

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:32.520
you train your, you know, you train your muscles
to work faster on a certain screen size and

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:39.929
then, you switch to a tablet and all of a
sudden everything is different.

00:33:39.929 --> 00:33:44.940
And, you know, there's a real fatigue factor
that comes in to dragging those airplanes

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.369
all the way across in your screen.

00:33:47.369 --> 00:33:48.419
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: It's interesting…

00:33:48.419 --> 00:33:49.419
&gt;&gt; RHODE: So…

00:33:49.419 --> 00:33:54.330
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: …that in the Tablet App Quality
Checklist sort of three or four the points

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:57.389
all go across the same thing you're just saying--been
saying, Sparky.

00:33:57.389 --> 00:34:03.289
By using fonts and touch targets and assets
designed for that kind of size of screen so

00:34:03.289 --> 00:34:06.950
hopefully it's something that the checklist
will hope reinforce with people.

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:07.950
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:14.390
The good news is it can be a bit scary because
you think about this continuous sort of like

00:34:14.390 --> 00:34:16.660
range of device sizes out there.

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:21.860
So, if you think about, "Oh, do I have to
allocate my layouts and make a layout that

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:30.390
works great on a, you know, a 4-inch phone,
a 5-inch phone, a 7-inch tablet and 8.9-inch

00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:31.390
tablet.

00:34:31.390 --> 00:34:38.870
The good thing about this is like there's
actually kind of a discrete number of switching

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.610
points at the moment.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:48.680
We kind of see a lot of the stuff kind of
setting around four, seven, and ten.

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:56.620
It's kind of like come in places and the variations
around that are not so huge that you can use

00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:01.730
a layout that works on like a seven-inch tablet
will probably work on someone's--on an eight-inch

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:02.730
tablet.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:08.470
And so the way system works, if you use these
SW qualifiers for your layouts then it will

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:11.950
get pick up by the kind of the one slightly
larger as well.

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:17.050
So, it's not actually tons and tons of stuff
you do but just by providing slightly say--like

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:21.790
you said, bigger touch targets or slightly
bigger font sizes for example in like a seven-inch

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:23.600
tablet can make all the difference.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.600
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Right.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:30.530
And then another bit of tablet wisdom is that,
you know, so you're going back to the game

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:37.930
model, you don't have to necessarily scale
up your game to fill the whole screen.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:43.000
You can have a fragment that varies it size
only a certain amount and then on the larger

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.100
screens just put more or less ancillary information
around--on the sides of it.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.100
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.100
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Indeed.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.100
We asked that one.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Who watched last night's Android
Live in Action which covers runtime.

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:54.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:55.546
This is--this is the topic we covered yesterday
on that.

00:35:55.546 --> 00:35:56.620
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It's a whole half hour of that.

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.710
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, yeah.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:02.260
Giving a few techniques you can use to design
around this issue.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:08.300
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: And it's--it was great that you
guys were looking at the I/O app which is

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.300
completely open source.

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:16.390
So you can just go in and grab the source
and copy whatever it's been done in that wonderful

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:17.390
software.

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:23.760
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yes, the new templates in the--the
android templates and that we use.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:29.320
We create new project and clips rather than
getting into that.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:32.360
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And Jan has joined us.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.360
Hello.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.400
Did that answer your question?

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.410
You're muted.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:39.450
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Is John talking or not?

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.470
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: You're not talking.

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:42.480
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.510
&gt;&gt; SOUZA: Yes, thank you.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:45.520
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.540
You got into Hangout.

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:51.090
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh, well, thanks for joining us.

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:52.100
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:56.540
Let's jump to the next one in the Moderator.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.170
&gt;&gt; RHODE: All right then.

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.250
Yeah, there's--this is Yan's question in the
Moderator.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:04.619
Yan, do you want me to ask your question?

00:37:04.619 --> 00:37:06.070
I don't see...

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:08.470
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Okay.

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:10.880
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT] lip sync.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.080
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Right.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.080
Okay.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:25.090
So, right--Yan in the Hangout is asking, is
it a good approach to in-app purchasing to

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:34.590
remove ads versus, you know, within 1ABK versus
maintaining two applications, one with and

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:35.810
one without?

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:42.320
And I said it's a great idea to use an application
purchasing to remove ads.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.320
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Uh-hmm.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:49.000
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Then--and provided this developer
that android link for a little more information.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.900
You know, since you can make it a managed
purchase, you can query the server anytime

00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:01.400
and find out whether to--whether that user
has purchased the right to have the whatever

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:05.000
unlocked ad free premium pro-version of the
app.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.510
There's--I think there's significant benefit
in not maintaining two different APKs.

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:20.640
You--to a certain extent, you're exposing
your app potentially to a little more risk

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:34.360
in that, you know, the code that queries the
license server or the, in-app purchasing server

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:42.430
is another attached surface, but I don't really
don't think it opens you up anymore than just

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:51.140
having a separate pro-version of the APK where
somebody can just, you know, redistribute

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.140
that.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.900
So, I think that the--without a lot of extra
headaches involved, you can really save yourself

00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:04.270
some trouble just by not maintaining two different
APKs for the same application.

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:05.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:11.110
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And two other points to add to
that.

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:16.930
Is a--sorry Chris, is suppose to [INDISTINCT]
so it goes out their jumping out to, you know

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:22.580
hit, I want to get [INDISTINCT] and you have
to then install a new app.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:27.130
I was like "Wait, what?

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:33.290
Now I have two apps installed, so I have to
uninstall an app and also any settings or

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:37.380
configurations I may have done it gets carried
over, since it's the same application.

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.430
I don't have to configure anything again.

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:47.870
So, that's a lot smoother and secondly, I'd
say you that all your reviews and comments

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:51.760
will be centralized in one place.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:59.750
And somewhat a good or bad thing, you can
go find that people who [INDISTINCT] for [INDISTINCT]

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:03.310
on your rating, because they paid money for
it.

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:06.120
They tend to like, justify that sales I think.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.290
Maybe that's just my idea.

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:15.400
And but--yeah, I think having them all in
one place is probably a better thing.

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:20.320
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: That's all so quite interesting.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.590
&gt;&gt; KELLY: Yeah, yeah, the...

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:28.090
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I'm sorry, Chris, good for me.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:32.010
&gt;&gt; BANES: No, I'm just saying, you know, I
did this for FriendCaster.

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:38.640
I had made this before in-app purchasing was
invaluable so two separate ones the free and

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.640
the pro.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:47.320
And I use to spend a good 10 to 15% of my
time merging code across because you'd have

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:52.180
to--you'd have to do it in one code device
then copy it across.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:55.510
And what you find is you're trying--you wouldn't
copy it across, correct?

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:58.260
So, you have to spend time fixing lamps and
stuff.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:00.930
So, in the end [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: More library projects.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:01.930
&gt;&gt; BANES: Pardon?

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:04.100
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Was that before library projects
or...

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.100
&gt;&gt; BANES: Yeah.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:11.410
So, once library projects come out which then
I can stop moving color code into that and

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:12.670
then sharing it.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:19.010
It just--it still took time and so, yeah,
and I've always go now with one APK.

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:23.090
And other thing is also is that--because it
will look--because you have the free versions

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:28.820
in your listening, people will be more inclined
to download it because it's not paid app.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:29.820
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Uh-hmm.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:35.110
&gt;&gt; BANES: So, and then they can then do the
in-app purchase where if they want to so in

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:36.510
other words they're not minor.

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:40.650
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah, that was one of the interesting
things from IO is that there was some discussion

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:46.500
around monetizing app and all of the data
seem to point to having an in-app purchase

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:52.520
as being a better way and a more consistent
way of getting users to buy your app and it

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:59.600
tends to result in more purchases than trying
to get them to download a separate APK and

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.270
pay for that separately.

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:04.080
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Just Devil's Advocate as a slight
[INDISTINCT].

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.010
I'd say some people just hate in-app purchases.

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:13.200
You'll see comments in the market saying "They're
trying to nickel and dime for everything,

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.540
blah, blah, blah," and some people are just
much happier paying one app price up front.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:22.310
I'm not not saying this is many users or most
users, so some people just don't like that

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:26.930
and the second point is having a paid out,
let's you put this way in some kind of like

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:28.450
sales and promotions, so for example...

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:29.450
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Uh-hmm.

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:32.160
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ...our recent 25 billion promotion
was--where were put a bunch of applications

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:42.730
on sale like if you only had a free application
then, that would have been available to use.

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:46.210
So, I'm not saying these great reasons and
perhaps you might have both available.

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:51.370
So, you know, a free version with in-app to
attach [INDISTINCT] first or like a premium

00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:55.950
version or whatever that is just like all
in-app purchases already included in the different

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:59.830
costs for example for those people who just
really hate it.

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:06.870
It's up you, you know, it depends on who you're
going for and what the market is and so, but.

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:10.180
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah, I think there's a lot of
work that needs to be done in terms of user

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:14.780
experience on the developer side because I
think it was Yahani point--pointed out an

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:20.600
application that basically was a free application
but the moment you run it, it said buy coins

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:28.590
and you couldn't do anything without making
an in-app purchase and that's a straight turn

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:32.720
off for users, it's going to be a bit more
subtle.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.640
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Oh, I hate those.

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.721
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: It's the easiest.

00:43:35.721 --> 00:43:37.840
One wasn't the only that you found was there?

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:42.200
I guess there are few out there, but it has
to sparky response and people just turn off

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.440
straight away, say trying to force people
down in an in-app purchase is a way around

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.080
paid app.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:56.340
It's seems to be--yeah, more of a quick way
to annoy the user than to get sales.

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.930
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Crappy thing to do.

00:43:57.930 --> 00:43:58.930
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:04.960
&gt;&gt; RHODE: So, the applications, let's say,
you get ten moves and if you send us a couple

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:12.290
of bucks, we'll give you another hundred.

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:14.870
I hate those, I hate those.

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:20.630
But the apps that say, you know, you can--you
can unlock the first 10 levels of this puzzle

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:24.780
game for free and then, you know, pay us a
couple of bucks and we'll give you the next

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:30.930
hundred levels and you can, you know, you
can play as much as little as you like.

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:36.980
We're not metering your play, we're just giving
you access to the whole thing, those I love.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:45.060
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, I think the mail, are one
of the coolest ones I've seen is the timed

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:46.060
office.

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:53.970
It's like a wind up night which gives you--lets
you play for your first 10 levels or something

00:44:53.970 --> 00:45:02.000
like that and then it says, "Hey, one time
early offer, unlock the rest of this game

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.200
for this one price won't be offering again
kind of thing."

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.930
I mean that kind of taps into the human psyche
wanting a bargain right like you can get,

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:11.930
okay?

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:12.930
You're just one chance to play.

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:18.620
I thought that was pretty clever and I think
[INDISTINCT] just came on to the show on US

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:25.850
and said that one item was the bulk of their
revenue, I think.

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:26.850
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Uh-hmm.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:27.850
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Uh-hmm.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:30.240
&gt;&gt; BANES: Just the app, App Store as well?

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.660
&gt;&gt; KELLY: The other good thing...

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:32.660
&gt;&gt; BANES: Sorry, mate.

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:33.660
&gt;&gt; KELLY: Sorry.

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:37.700
I was just going to say quickly, the other
good thing about the in-app billing stuff

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:42.670
is that you make a purchase on one device
that alone market for all your other devices

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:43.670
as well.

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:44.670
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh, yeah.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:45.670
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Right.

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:46.670
Well, I hadn't even thought of that.

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:48.670
I mean, talking about saving your download
trouble.

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:53.680
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah, you can have it everywhere
and you're going to have the free install

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.680
everywhere and then.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.440
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Free install, yeah, times end.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:03.560
&gt;&gt; And then you have to go back and reinstall
the new one, yeah.

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:04.610
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: The clip.

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:06.900
Chris, so you're saying as well?

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:14.170
&gt;&gt; BANES: I'm saying as with the App Store--I
mean, I can't even say it.

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:22.490
But the App Store on iOS you can't actually
see what the in-app purchase are.

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:27.190
When you download something was our comment
on Google Play.

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:29.730
I could be wrong, but none.

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:30.730
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Interesting.

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:37.750
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: You can see it is needs the in-app
billing permission, so you can go with out

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:39.860
the in-app payments in there somewhere.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.910
&gt;&gt; BANES: Right, but if you download and see
there's an in-app purchase for playing rest

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:48.170
of game or something then you know it's going
to be dodging.

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:52.070
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Play whole of game.

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:53.630
&gt;&gt; BANES: Yeah.

00:46:53.630 --> 00:47:01.050
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: But there's a lot--there's a lot
of things around that because one other things

00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:10.750
I've seen done in the iOS Store is some of
the in-app purchases makes no sense until

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:19.790
you start using the application itself, like
I think there's an application that converts

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:27.820
photos into cartoons and everything is like
the splat in-app purchase and the glam in-app

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:35.680
purchase which it--you kind to sit there and
I'm thinking, do I really need to buy this

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:42.760
to put the word glam on screen and it's--it--it's
kind of a double edge sword.

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:47.080
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, I'm not sure if I see the
value on that.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.710
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I think it's the value in it if
you make it cheap enough.

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:51.710
I mean...

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:54.320
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I know, and [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; RHODE: ...it's below the threshold where

00:47:54.320 --> 00:48:04.260
I'll just say, oh, what the heck, from one
photo, I am willing to spend ten cents, click.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.400
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No, no, I can see the value.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:14.530
I don't see the value in listing them up front
when it's completely out of context.

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:16.100
&gt;. RHODE: Okay, sorry.

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:21.680
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Well one of the ones that I quite
like is a German game [INDISTINCT] which we

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:29.620
know who has the ads and this little X next
to it to dismiss them and that launches the

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.200
in-app purchase switches an interesting location.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.760
I think we've done that one to [INDISTINCT].

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:36.020
&gt;&gt; BANES: Lots of [INDISTINCT] in-app purchase.

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:41.880
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Does anyone here live in the Hangout
want to bring up something of interest to

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:47.110
them before we go back to the Moderator or
were there questions in the Google+ stream

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:49.230
that we haven't gotten to yet?

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:51.240
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: There's one [INDISTINCT] today.

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.839
&gt;&gt; SOUZA: Right, excuse me?

00:48:52.839 --> 00:48:56.940
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: There's one for Matt in the comments
of the Google+ page.

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.040
&gt;. HYNDMAN: We again got another question
here.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.040
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Let's take a live question.

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.150
&gt;&gt; SOUZA: Yes.

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:04.330
It's not a question but feature request.

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:07.480
I like you to include the feature graphic
on my [INDISTINCT].

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:11.080
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Sorry, say that again, I missed
that.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.470
&gt;&gt; SOUZA: Feature graphic.

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:13.470
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Uh-huh.

00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:16.640
&gt;&gt; SOUZA: On my application, my [INDISTINCT]
because...

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:21.260
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: You would like to localize the
feature behind, correct?

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:22.260
&gt;&gt; SOUZA: Yes.

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.260
This one...

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:30.630
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Just the same or one of this [INDISTINCT]
is on the--it's on the team's list of stuff

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:32.180
to do.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:37.600
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It is crazy right now, right?

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:42.400
You can localize all the descriptions but
if you want to localize the great big graphic

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.510
that everyone sees...

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:45.360
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And screen shots, uh-hmm.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.690
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: ...and screen shots and all that
stuffs, yes.

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:52.170
You must list things and target them into
countries so that's...

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:57.130
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It's very, very much on the radar,
it's just when it gets shift.

00:49:57.130 --> 00:49:58.290
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Should we?

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:01.020
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: We hear you, we hear you.

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:02.020
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:07.520
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Sorry, did you want to read the
question tonight in the comments, shall I

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:08.520
read it?

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.780
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah, Go for it.

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:16.200
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So, I was trying to get that comic
app with in-app billing working on Google

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200
TV.

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:23.440
They have to send you box, I always get stuck
at the billing process or froze in purchase

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.650
up to 30 seconds this application stops responding.

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:29.350
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: So, I've actually replied to the
stock over flow question with a blunt face.

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:30.350
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It's not.

00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:32.270
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: So, essentially, there's--because
we don't support subscription billing, the

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:35.060
dungeons and subscriptions sample doesn't
work as is.

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:42.200
Needs a little bit of tweaking to change the
trial version number as well as some of the

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:55.280
extra variables that you add in, so payment
type, you don't do that or otherwise API starts

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.580
having some problems.

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:08.030
So, you need to that and plus when I start
doing this, I have a couple of issues that's

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:11.690
just the Google Play service and making it
work.

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:17.340
So I had to leave it for a little while.

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:25.120
Which I admit is a bit of a bore thing but
I do essentially have one bit of code left

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:28.430
for it before they came back and then it just
started working as it should do.

00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:29.650
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, that happens to me too.

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:34.890
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I think it was just the propagating
the items that you are adding to Google Play

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:37.380
and make sure that it works and authenticate
et cera.

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:47.030
So check out the blog post , go through all
of that, check that are working with your

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:55.020
items and then hopefully you should be able
to figure out what's going wrong.

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:56.780
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yup.

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.590
All the standard things apply.

00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:08.990
Don't test it with the same account you uploaded
the app to Play Store you can't buy them for

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:10.910
yourselves.

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:26.990
There's a list of five things you each need
to check when you're testing in acronym in

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:28.700
the testing--acronym document.

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:29.840
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yup.

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.130
Documentation is ridiculously useful.

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:35.550
So, yeah, still do check that.

00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:40.980
It's just the sample which needs some differences
which what my blog post is focusing on.

00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:41.980
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Okay.

00:52:41.980 --> 00:53:05.180
And there's a question in there G+ as well.

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:32.560
Robert is asking why in the 4.12 update for
seven-inch tablets, why search bar angled

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:36.360
on the landscape put an option on portrait?

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.560
None of us here know the answer.

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:42.680
I'm going to speculate here that it's a UX
decision.

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:50.430
That in landscape you have so much less vertical
space that you don't really want as many angled

00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:51.430
items.

00:53:51.430 --> 00:54:01.640
I'm going to guess that that being the reason
but I don't know for sure.

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:06.960
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I don't believe it's actually a
widget in landscape mode.

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:12.130
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No, it's part of the home screen,
right?

00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:17.180
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah, where as in portrait mode
it's actually a widget that seems to be used.

00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:18.420
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Is it?

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.770
I don't think it is.

00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:25.020
I think it's--you can't pick it up or anything.

00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:26.300
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: You can't regardless...

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.300
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Right.

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.570
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: ...I'm slightly confused by this
question.

00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:32.850
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: We're all just staring at the seven-inch

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:33.850
tablet.

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:35.390
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT] can anyone replicate
this?

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:38.960
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So, I think it's--I don't think
it's a widget.

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:41.480
I think it's part of the home screen.

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:43.910
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I think it's part of the launcher,
yeah.

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:44.910
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Right.

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:45.910
I think so too.

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:52.970
I mean, I don't think it's like when you drag
a new widget onto the screen.

00:54:52.970 --> 00:55:02.650
It seems to me like that search box is out
of the accessible space.

00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:05.050
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Can you move it right on yours?

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:06.050
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:11.490
And when you drag an icon around here, it
disappears to make room for the app info and

00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:13.680
the delete button whatnot.

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:19.440
I don't actually think its part of the home
screen like work spaces.

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:23.660
Where I think it's kind of decoration around
it.

00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:27.420
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah, I can't actually drag mine
around.

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:29.470
It's just a bit confusing.

00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:34.280
Instead it's anchored in landscape but optional
in portrait.

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.340
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:38.010
I have--I can replicate that.

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:43.820
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I read that as it's kind of always
there in portrait.

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:53.440
But when you go to landscape you just have
to Google now and the--and the voice action,

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.050
it's a voice search buttons, right?

00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:57.050
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Right.

00:55:57.050 --> 00:55:58.050
Yeah.

00:55:58.050 --> 00:56:00.470
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It would be neat if you had a
vertical text bar.

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:01.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, exactly.

00:56:01.619 --> 00:56:03.510
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I think that's about.

00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:04.510
Anyway.

00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:05.510
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:06.510
So, yeah.

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:08.620
So, basically I'm saying.

00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:12.541
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, you wouldn't ever have like

00:56:12.541 --> 00:56:16.250
a vertical search box because that would look
crazy.

00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:17.540
I probably wouldn't.

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:24.470
And so I'll like postulate that they didn't
want to have another reserved error space

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:28.900
in already limited amount of room when you're
in landscape would be my guess.

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:30.110
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Well, I concur.

00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:31.110
Excellent.

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:32.150
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I think that's a really good guess.

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:33.150
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Why thank you.

00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:37.110
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Since you mentioned Google now,
this is just kind of a random, what it occurs

00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:38.110
to me.

00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:43.560
I'm curious to know, who here brings up Google
now by accident more often than on purpose.

00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:44.650
Because I know I…

00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:45.900
&gt;&gt; BANES: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Interesting.

00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:46.900
All right.

00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.040
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Going back to that flight control
again.

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.240
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Making those little airplanes around

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.240
the screen.

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.240
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I can suggest one solution.

00:56:54.240 --> 00:57:00.020
If you have that problem with your Nexus 7
put it in a case because it's really hard

00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:03.670
to bring up the tall ones to the case.

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:05.680
&gt;&gt; BANES: Is that the official Google answer?

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.010
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Of course it is, Chris.

00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:08.010
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT] answer.

00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:10.500
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: That's one of the downside of those
cheap third party cases.

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:16.990
You get the official aces while then it leaves
you enough screen space to get the swipe from

00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.990
the problem working.

00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:19.940
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT] and that it certainly
doesn't.

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.090
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah, this was 25 [INDISTINCT]
from PC World.

00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:23.579
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT] magnet in it though.

00:57:23.579 --> 00:57:24.579
&gt;&gt; SUTTION: Nope.

00:57:24.579 --> 00:57:26.290
You pay 25 [INDISTINCT] you…

00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:29.650
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: …you don't even get the close

00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:30.650
magnet.

00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:39.210
&gt;&gt; BANES: I've got a smart cover [INDISTINCT]
or it's like a natural--it flaps over and

00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:40.210
stuff.

00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:41.210
It's pretty good.

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:42.210
It's like a ten ounce.

00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:44.910
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I've got one of those as well for
my Samsung Tablet.

00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:47.650
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Well, for the--for the Nexus 7
I guess.

00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:48.650
&gt;&gt; BANES: Yeah.

00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:53.840
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I think my next purchase from Amazon
is going to be some [INDISTINCT] tape and

00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:54.840
a magnet.

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:56.960
How are we getting on the Moderator questions?

00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.670
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, how are we getting on Moderator
question?

00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:59.670
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I'm taking a look.

00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:01.670
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: We've got fifteen minutes left.

00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:02.670
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Okay.

00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:05.000
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Andre in Czech Republic wants to

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.960
know, is there a way how to correctly detect
if a tablet has a mobile, it's like [INDISTINCT]

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:12.280
3G interface.

00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:17.130
I need to hide or display some features based
on that.

00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:22.150
Feature telephony and connectivity manager,
get all network info aren't reliable enough.

00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:23.410
I don't know.

00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:29.230
I think I don't--I think I don't have the
best answer to that one.

00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:32.600
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: It was--I was kind of confused
because he is saying feature telephony isn't

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.600
reliable enough.

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:36.690
And I was wondering whether he is already
using PackageManager.system feature to detect

00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:38.050
whether it's on the device.

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:40.880
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I'm wondering if maybe he just means
it's not precise enough.

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:41.880
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Right.

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:46.020
Because there are some features [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: We've got an extra comments in

00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:47.130
the bottom here.

00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:51.630
Thanks for your responses but unfortunately
there are some tablets that don't report feature

00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:54.560
telephony as one of the system features.

00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:55.560
I imagine things like…

00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:56.560
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Wifi only devices.

00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:01.580
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: …out of the--no the Galaxy Tab
10.1 may have 3G but no telephony because

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:03.849
it doesn't--you can't make phone calls.

00:59:03.849 --> 00:59:04.849
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Right.

00:59:04.849 --> 00:59:11.070
But the feature should be as said that the
device has a telephony radio with data communication

00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:12.070
support.

00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:14.600
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Which to me would indicate it should

00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:15.600
be present…

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:19.570
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: …if just got a data modem on

00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:20.570
it.

00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:24.900
It doesn't necessarily need to have a voice
codec as well to handle calls.

00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:25.900
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Interesting.

00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:26.900
Yeah, I can't remember.

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:33.030
If the input requires telephony in the manifest
whether it would appear for a 3G Tab or not,

00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:34.500
I thought it didn't.

00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:35.970
&gt;&gt; RHODE: There you go.

00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:41.100
I do think maybe there's potential in this
TelephonyManager get network type, which should

00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:45.770
tell you like exactly what kind of radio you're
talking to at the moment.

00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:48.180
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: But that's what's on at the moment,
not what's available, right?

00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:49.180
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:51.200
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Lastly saying, querying the SIM
is a good way to go.

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.200
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Querying the SIM?

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:56.080
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Which class would you use to do
that [INDISTINCT] we'll give him--I'll read

00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:57.170
out the URL.

00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:58.170
&gt;&gt; DREWERY: Yeah.

00:59:58.170 --> 00:59:59.210
You could actually use some tools libraries
to do it.

00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:00.210
We had this problem in HTC.

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:02.820
Where if you got a SIM that supports 2G but
doesn't support 3G it caused a bit of confusion,

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:03.820
we had to actually query directly.

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:04.820
Our HTC now could find the--on HTC devices
the custom API that we used.

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:10.020
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Well, but there is in TelephonyManager
it gets subscriber ID which is supposed to

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.510
return an IMSI number.

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:13.180
I guess--I would guess, if there's no 3G or
no telephony component then you wouldn't get

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.180
an IMSI back.

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.180
I think you get nulled back in that situation.

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:16.180
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: It's interesting.

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.180
I've seen a custom ROMS that do return IMSI
or even fake data just to pass some test on

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.180
the TelephonyManager.

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.180
So I'll try to do some--try to catch over
there enough on false data.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.180
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.180
I think I know we've kind of had a similar
question last week.

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:22.180
It comes down to why you're trying to do that
exactly like--I guess the main thing you want

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:23.180
to do is like work out.

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:24.180
Do you have a data connection, right?

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:25.640
Which you can use to get connectivity [INDISTINCT]
but it's connected.

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.770
It's pretty much on your major check.

01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:29.310
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I was thinking [INDISTINCT] had
also a setting which said--let's say it was

01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:31.510
ooVoo and it wanted to allow calls over 3G.

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:35.170
You wouldn't want that setting there at all
if you have 3G device.

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:38.840
But you do have 3G, one that particular if
you have or not.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.780
It could make sense to have a [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I know, I exceptionally use it.

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.910
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, it's up to you because [INDISTINCT]
in the 3G but [INDISTINCT] I think its 3G

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:43.910
and Wifi.

01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:45.610
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: But you only want to show the option
when you have 3G as an actual option to take

01:00:45.610 --> 01:00:46.610
away [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT]

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:47.750
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: But you can [INDISTINCT] if you're
on cellular or you're on Wifi [INDISTINCT]

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:48.750
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: No, no, just 3G.

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:49.750
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BANES: [INDISTINCT]

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:50.750
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: If you're on it at the time [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; DREWERY: You forgot one thing guys.

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:51.750
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:52.750
&gt;&gt; DREWERY: The same competence of certain
[INDISTINCT] in this country will allow you

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:53.750
to connect to the 3G network, but not use
it.

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:54.750
I won't mention any names as a dropping sales,
so what that means is that you might have

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:59.400
a 3G subscription but it will allow you to
connect to 3G matrix saying you got 3G but

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.250
you can't actually send any data up.

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:05.250
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: That's also another issue which
makes the whole thing a bit an unreliable

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:06.410
is the use of Mifi devices.

01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:12.270
So I've got a Wifi tablet and I'm connecting
it to my portable hot spot on the phone in

01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:13.270
my pocket.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:17.253
The tablet it thinks it's got a Wifi connection
but the actual end connection is a 3G cellular

01:01:17.253 --> 01:01:18.253
on the other one.

01:01:18.253 --> 01:01:21.860
That's how I got around the [INDISTINCT] as
an original restriction of only allowing streaming

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.620
on Wifi which is to use a Mifi device.

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:26.470
Do some tethering between the tablet and the
Mifi device and then you get around any restrictions.

01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:28.170
Although it may be possible it's not a good
thing to rely on looping [INDISTINCT]

01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:29.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:30.170
I can see where [INDISTINCT] it would be nice
for those [INDISTINCT] I would still use [INDISTINCT]

01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:31.170
correctly then so be it.

01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:32.170
But you want to know whether the [INDISTINCT]
in there you want to know if the hardware

01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:33.170
supports that capability then I would go to
the feature telephony.

01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:34.170
It's got to be [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; RHODE: As oppose to its quality of users

01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:35.170
experience issue.

01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:36.170
Say maybe you know if you can't pull one megabit
you don't want to offer video or something

01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:37.170
like that just do a little performance test
at run time.

01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:38.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:39.170
You can do--when you're connected you know
what network you're connected on.

01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:40.170
It's just you just don't know which networks
are necessarily available to you.

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:41.170
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: The performance test would be the
best way to go definitely because of Wifi

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:42.170
situations like IO.

01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:43.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:44.170
And definitely I think about not making a
setting as well.

01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:45.170
Think about just doing a test and you get
a warning.

01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:46.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Uh-hmm.

01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:47.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Like saying you know signal strength
looks weak.

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:48.170
You sure you want to do a video call or whatever
it might be.

01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:49.170
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: Yeah, that's what we do.

01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:50.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Just making a setting isn't always
the answers.

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:51.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Read Reto's blog post on magic
boxes as well.

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:52.170
What's the problem with network?

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:53.170
You probably don't get sub type.

01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:54.170
Maybe you have to be connected to that network
at the time, you know.

01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:55.170
He--what do we have here?

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:56.170
He has said he's using network [INDISTINCT].

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:57.170
Have we got anymore in the Moderator?

01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:58.170
&gt;&gt; SPARKY: We do.

01:01:58.170 --> 01:01:59.170
And we have a couple more.

01:01:59.170 --> 01:02:00.170
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: And questions from Andrew Kelly
in there

01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:01.170
&gt;&gt; SPARKY: Andrew Kelly, yes indeed.

01:02:01.170 --> 01:02:02.170
About ViewPager, a list of pages, Andrew do
you want to ask?

01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:03.170
&gt;&gt; KELLY: Yes, since we are--I've got an app
that I'm writing for a client at the moment

01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:04.170
and I got a listview that goes into a ViewPager
kind of mode when they want it drilled down

01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:05.170
into the details of the list.

01:02:05.170 --> 01:02:06.170
And so, in the listview I want to show all
the items available.

01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:07.170
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Uh-hmm.

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:08.170
&gt;&gt; KELLY: But in this the detail mode running
on the ViewPager, I want to skip over items

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:09.170
that don't have any further details.

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:10.170
And so, I'm just trying to work out if there's
a way of skipping with the fourth element

01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:11.170
of the array without actually having to create
a new array with that fourth element missing.

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:12.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, well that's in the Adapter,
right?

01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:13.170
In the get size and method.

01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:14.170
So, these...

01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:15.170
&gt;&gt; KELLY: Yeah, so I got my get count reduced--returns
a fewer number of--yeah, a lower value based

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:16.170
on how many rows there are.

01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:17.170
The get item still gets called for the place
holders that I don't want to--the ones I want

01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:18.170
to skip over, so if I want to skip over element
number four.

01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:19.170
&gt;&gt; Uh-hmm.

01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:20.170
&gt;&gt; KELLY: Element, you know, get out and still
gets called for element four.

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:21.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, you know.

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:22.170
You're always going to get passed in the time
being increasing position numbers, but I think

01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:23.170
you're going to have to maintain your own
mapping from position to the real item index

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:24.170
in your--in your data.

01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:25.170
&gt;&gt; KELLY: Yeah.

01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:26.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Correct.

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:27.170
&gt;&gt; BANES: [INDISTINCT] it sound like you need
to--you get them and you just need to--each

01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:28.170
time iterate from the start and can't until
you find x numbers of items which don't have

01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:29.170
a flat board do [INDISTINCT] whatever.

01:02:29.170 --> 01:02:30.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:31.170
&gt;&gt; KELLY: Yeah, I 'm just trying to avoid
the constant to be going looping with the

01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:32.170
array...

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:33.170
&gt;&gt; BANES: Yeah.

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:34.170
&gt;&gt; KELLY: ...again and again and again to
where that [INDISTINCT] was.

01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:35.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT] trying to.

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:36.170
Yeah, can you just do that once?

01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:37.170
Can you do so the first fast item is index
one, second item is index four, the third

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:38.170
item is index five or...

01:02:38.170 --> 01:02:39.170
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: No, maybe he has a HashMap.

01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:40.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:41.170
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: Only in one second, you have all
the index's made through the items with the

01:02:41.170 --> 01:02:42.170
details.

01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:43.170
And then, when you use the get item than you'll
just need to verify that you have the index

01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:44.170
on your attachment or some sort.

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:45.170
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Well you could even--if you put--put
it into a HashMap, you could then get the

01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:46.170
entry set back and iterate over the entry
set.

01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:47.170
&gt;&gt; KELLY: Yeah, some adjustments.

01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:48.170
That's a good idea.

01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:49.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, you just run through once.

01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:50.170
Are we talking about an enormous list here
though?

01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:51.170
Is this something you need to be relaxed?

01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:52.170
&gt;&gt; KELLY: No, at 20 at most so...

01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:53.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: You know, I just run through it
to be honest.

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:54.170
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah.

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:55.170
They said the possibility for some of the
items to change.

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:56.170
So, could item number two be populated then
later down the line then item two could not

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:57.170
be populated?

01:02:57.170 --> 01:02:58.170
&gt;&gt; KELLY: Not with out going all the way back
out and all the way back in through the original

01:02:58.170 --> 01:02:59.170
on a summary list.

01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:00.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It's now [INDISTINCT] go take
a hit and did it once...

01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:01.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:02.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ...and have this simple of HashMap
or something.

01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:03.170
&gt;&gt; KEELY: Yeah, and that was.

01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:04.170
&gt;&gt; BANES: It's currently [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; KELLY: And I thought it might be having

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.170
some sort of--is enabled kind of true or false,
kind of method that I could just call for

01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:06.170
the ones that I want to skip over.

01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:07.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: No.

01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:08.170
I mean, you have full control of your Adapter,
it wouldn't...

01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:09.170
&gt;&gt; KELLY: Yeah.

01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:10.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: ...pass the Adapter then ignore
it.

01:03:10.170 --> 01:03:11.170
It would--self service, sorry.

01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:12.170
&gt;&gt; KELLY: That's right.

01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:13.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Well, you can extend ViewPager
and make your own implementation in that...

01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:14.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Ignoring the item in ViewPager.

01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:15.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:16.170
&gt;&gt; Sends the bytes and sends it.

01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:17.170
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Yeah.

01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:18.170
The reason that I pointed to the Sherlock
demo that's out there on code.google.com is

01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:19.170
because the ViewPager implementation on that
little sample app basically it, you know although

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:20.170
ViewPager sequential, it basically just pokes
a random access value into the tab manager.

01:03:20.170 --> 01:03:21.170
And you see--because it's mashing up ViewPager
in tabs together.

01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:22.170
And so it's kind of a way to jump from your
sequential access of the ViewPager into the

01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:23.170
random access, and all you have to do is intervene
at that point to tell it which you know, page

01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:24.170
or tab to show.

01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:25.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, you could do it so that
when you go to item number four, it will also

01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:26.170
scroll down.

01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:27.170
You'd scroll to four and then it would automatically
just move onwards because it's an empty item.

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:28.170
Basically, would know they've gone past item
four.

01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:29.170
This page is intentionally left blank, something.

01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:30.170
No, but I think...

01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:31.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No, don't do that.

01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:32.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: No.

01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:33.170
[INDISTINCT] I would definitely go with what
you said before.

01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:34.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Five minutes left.

01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:35.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: We're squeezing the last--how
many have we got left in the Moderator [INDISTINCT]

01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:36.170
can get the next [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Four, four more.

01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:37.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Four more and four minutes, go.

01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:38.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Go.

01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:39.170
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Where in the source code can I find
the 4.1 lock screen, Google it.

01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:40.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Did you read all of it?

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:41.170
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I read also that the developer.android.com
documentation is part of AOSP.

01:03:41.170 --> 01:03:42.170
I assume so, it's--I mean we put the AOSP
copyright in our sample code and stuff.

01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:43.170
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: It is.

01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:44.170
I'll put a link to the location in the notes.

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:45.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, and I think the lock screens
is called the key guard, so if you grab codes

01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:46.170
with key guard, I think it's the thing you're
looking for.

01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:47.170
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Sounds right to me.

01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:48.170
Plus one.

01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:49.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Next question.

01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:50.170
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Can I retrieve data from Google
Maps APIs so I can use it for my location

01:03:50.170 --> 01:03:51.170
based service.

01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:52.170
Yes, use the Google Maps API.

01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:53.170
Developers.google.com/maps.

01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:54.170
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Next muffin.

01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:55.170
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I have a device with only Ethernet
connection, how can I find if device is really

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:56.170
connected to the network.

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:57.170
Try to push some traffic through.

01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:58.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Hit, [INDISTINCT] it will get
active in a minute.

01:03:58.170 --> 01:03:59.170
Network [INDISTINCT] is connected.

01:03:59.170 --> 01:04:00.170
Next.

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:01.170
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Try to connect to Google's webpage.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No, if it's connected it will
do that, right?

01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:03.170
It's connected; it's like the blue, you know,
how your Wifi turns blue when there's really

01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:04.170
bits flowing.

01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:05.170
I'm pretty sure it's based on the same logic.

01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:06.170
&gt;&gt; RHODE: And this just--sort of code features
prominently I believe in Reto blog article

01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:07.170
about writing battery friendly apps.

01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:08.170
So, yeah.

01:04:08.170 --> 01:04:09.170
You can search for it on developer.android.com.

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:10.170
We got blog articles and Google IO talks that
all touch on this.

01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:11.170
Is anybody aware on how Android handles Daylight
Savings Time changes?

01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:12.170
It does, also...

01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:13.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Even if the code...

01:04:13.170 --> 01:04:14.170
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Even if it, even if it didn't, I
mean generally speaking you want your device

01:04:14.170 --> 01:04:15.170
to get it's time of day from either your phone
network or NTP, in with and in either of those

01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:16.170
cases.

01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:17.170
You know, their smart to know--smart enough
to know about Daylight Savings Time and when

01:04:17.170 --> 01:04:18.170
it happens, then it--your device will notice
that it's out of sync and it will reset itself.

01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:19.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: But they are also asking which
part of the source code deals with this, so

01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:20.170
it looks like they want to get some, pull
something out and reuse maybe.

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:21.170
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I think that's actually kind...

01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:22.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Time is hard.

01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:23.170
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah, I think that's actually handled
by a lot of the lower level Linux stuff that's

01:04:23.170 --> 01:04:24.170
underneath Android.

01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:25.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I wouldn't be too surprised.

01:04:25.170 --> 01:04:26.170
Java deals with a pretty...

01:04:26.170 --> 01:04:27.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, maybe, no.

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:28.170
Java does it horribly.

01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:29.170
Look at like [INDISTINCT] the time or something
like that perhaps.

01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:30.170
&gt;&gt; BANES: Don't you share the time, it's massive.

01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:31.170
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I seem to remember, in the run off
to Jelly Bean for a little while we actually

01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:32.170
had a bug where the NTP fallback wasn't working
right.

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:33.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Uh-hmm.

01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:34.170
&gt;&gt; RHODE: So.

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:35.170
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Android actually has a utility
class which re-implements and the getting

01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:36.170
the number of milliseconds from the APK.

01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:37.170
Because it's so unreliable incident past the
Java, so.

01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:38.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Was that in system.get current
Millis or...

01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:39.170
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: There's a--I can dig out the method
for this.

01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:40.170
There's actually an Android version of system.get
current time in Millis which is used for key

01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:41.170
events.

01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:42.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Uh-hmm.

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:43.170
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: And you can pick that out and basically
it does the same thing but I'm guessing it's

01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:44.170
there because there's some discrepancies about
how it gets reported through.

01:04:44.170 --> 01:04:45.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It was interesting because I read
about the three or four different ways you

01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:46.170
get the current time.

01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:47.170
I think the most accurate one was someone
from the Kernel which is exposed at for a

01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:48.170
native [INDISTINCT] think you can do.

01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:49.170
[INDISTINCT] trying to get out.

01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:50.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: And with that.

01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:51.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Are we done?

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:52.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I think we are done.

01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:53.170
&gt;&gt; RHODE: That's it from the Moderator.

01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:54.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Tablets.

01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:55.170
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Tablets.

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:56.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: We were going to say tablets ten
times we didn't say enough the last time.

01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:57.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Not enough time.

01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:58.170
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: Even to, speaking to.

01:04:58.170 --> 01:04:59.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Damn it.

01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:00.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Any last minute questions from
the Hang Out?

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:01.170
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: Yeah, just a little question about
the subscription and trial version periods.

01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:02.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yes.

01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:03.170
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: If I want to do and app 12 for
a trial period, but it's not--this is basically

01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:04.170
a subscription app.

01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:05.170
Say you want to do like a snooze button or
a silent button widget and instead of doing

01:05:05.170 --> 01:05:06.170
it into a paid app or something like that,
can I operate on a trial version with some

01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:07.170
sort of subscription?

01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:08.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Do you have anything--if you're
not using subscriptions, the only option would

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.170
be to not [INDISTINCT] and then pop up a dialogue
after 30 days or however long you want to

01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:10.170
the free period to be.

01:05:10.170 --> 01:05:11.170
Subscription is the only part of Google Play
that offers a free trial period for you.

01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:12.170
And for that free trial, you have to sign
up to the subscription, you have to have the

01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:13.170
valid kind of details in place, and at the
first billing cycle is completed and starts

01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:14.170
charging you.

01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:15.170
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: Uh-hmm.

01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:16.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: So, yeah...

01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:17.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It's cool.

01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:18.170
All right.

01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:19.170
I think that's all we had time...

01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:20.170
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: Do you want to see more Androids
on my offices?

01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:21.170
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: [INDISTINCT] after that.

01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:22.170
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: Will close up with a tour of the
Google office.

01:05:22.170 --> 01:05:23.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Hey, how about that?

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:24.170
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: Oh, and over there we have...

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:25.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Well, there's an Apple.

01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:26.170
What's that [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: No, yeah, it's--at the bathing

01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:27.170
room, you know, everybody is fighting so;
we're doing it, so.

01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:28.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Have fun.

01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:29.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Cool, we just did.

01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:30.170
Thank you very much for joining us today.

01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:31.170
We will be back again next week.

01:05:31.170 --> 01:05:32.170
&gt;&gt; ELKRIEF: Will be back.

01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:33.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, so hopefully you'll maybe
see some people watching in Défis, Berlin

01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:34.170
this weekend.

01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:35.170
Matt you're going to be in Paris tomorrow,
you'll speaking to the wonderful [INDISTINCT].

01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:36.170
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Paris on Friday, yeah.

01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:37.170
Berlin on Saturday.

01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:38.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Don't forget there are some great
shows on Friday.

01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:39.170
There's the App Clinic and the Friday Games
Review and join us next Tuesday Center Line

01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:40.170
Action or see you all next week, next Wednesday
hopefully for more Office Hours.

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:41.170
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: And as Ray turns one [INDISTINCT]
three and everything that's going on [INDISTINCT]

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:42.170
in the way.

01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:43.170
I swear in last week he was offering badges.

01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:44.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Bye.

01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:45.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Bye.

01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:45.172
&gt;&gt; Bye
23
