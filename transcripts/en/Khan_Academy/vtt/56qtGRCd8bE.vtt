00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.620
- [Instructor] So right over here,

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.620
we have the graph of y is
equal to one over x squared.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.810
And my question to you
is what is the limit

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.610
of one over x squared
as x approaches zero?

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.283
Pause this video, and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.890
Well, when you try to figure it out,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.700
you immediately see something interesting

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.010
happening at x equals zero.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.270
The closer we get to zero from the left,

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.980
you take one over x squared,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.170
it just gets larger and larger and larger.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.450
It doesn't approach some finite value.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.840
It's unbounded, has no bound.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.310
And the same thing is happening

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.850
as we approach from the right.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.640
As we get values closer and
closer to zero from the right,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.260
we get larger and larger values

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.390
for one over x squared without bound.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.200
So terminology that
folks will sometimes use,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.720
where they're both going
in the same direction,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.530
but it's unbounded, is they'll
say this limit is unbounded.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.520
In some context, you
might hear teachers say

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.310
that this limit does not exist or,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.460
and it definitely does not
exist if you're thinking about

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.370
approaching a finite value.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.930
In future videos, we'll start
to introduce ideas of infinity

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.330
and notations around limits and infinity,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.870
where we can get a
little bit more specific

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.140
about what type of limit this is.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.973
But with that out of the way,

00:01:16.973 --> 00:01:18.480
let's look at another scenario.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.510
This right over here, you might recognize

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.710
as the graph of y is equal to one over x.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.270
So I'm going to ask you the same question.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.090
Pause this video, and think about

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.210
what's the limit of one
over x as x approaches zero?

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.010
Pause this video, and figure it out.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.810
All right, so here, when
we approach from the left,

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.260
we get more and more and
more negative values.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.170
While we, when we approach from the right,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.560
we're getting more and
more positive values.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.720
So in this situation,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.140
where we're not getting
unbounded in the same direction,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.690
the previous example, we were both,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.040
we were being unbounded
in the positive direction.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.420
But here, on the, from the left,

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.460
we're getting unbounded
in the negative direction.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.160
While from the right,
we're getting unbounded

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.580
in the positive direction.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.070
And so when you're
thinking about the limit

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.100
as you approach a point, if
it's not even approaching

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.790
the same value or even the same direction,

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.890
you would just clearly say
that this limit does not exist,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.230
does

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.870
not

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.120
exist.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.160
So this is a situation,
where you would not even say

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.660
that this is an unbounded limit

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.160
or that the limit is unbounded.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.580
Because you're going in two
different directions when you

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.180
approach from the right and
when you approach from the left,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.563
you would just clearly say does not exist.
