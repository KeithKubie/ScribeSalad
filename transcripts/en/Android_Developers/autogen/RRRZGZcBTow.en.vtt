00:15:04.999 --> 00:15:05.009
and the dalvik virtual machine which
 

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:08.090
and the dalvik virtual machine which
Android uses isn't equivalent to a java

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:08.100
Android uses isn't equivalent to a java
 

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.609
Android uses isn't equivalent to a java
virtual machine so you can't exactly say

00:15:10.609 --> 00:15:10.619
virtual machine so you can't exactly say
 

00:15:10.619 --> 00:15:12.470
virtual machine so you can't exactly say
that version of Java would be the same

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480
that version of Java would be the same
 

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.020
that version of Java would be the same
as the bytecode available

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:14.030
as the bytecode available
 

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.390
as the bytecode available
version of the dalvik virtual machine so

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:16.400
version of the dalvik virtual machine so
 

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.250
version of the dalvik virtual machine so
there would probably be some work to

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:18.260
there would probably be some work to
 

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.620
there would probably be some work to
implement the functionality needed in

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:20.630
implement the functionality needed in
 

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.120
implement the functionality needed in
the dalvik virtual machine and as yet

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:22.130
the dalvik virtual machine and as yet
 

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.650
the dalvik virtual machine and as yet
that doesn't seem to have started to

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:23.660
that doesn't seem to have started to
 

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.230
that doesn't seem to have started to
being happen so it may happen but it's

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240
being happen so it may happen but it's
 

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.610
being happen so it may happen but it's
not going to be for a while yet would be

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:27.620
not going to be for a while yet would be
 

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.750
not going to be for a while yet would be
pretty much the gist of the answer and

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:31.760
pretty much the gist of the answer and
 

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.090
pretty much the gist of the answer and
so so the short version of l's answer is

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:34.100
so so the short version of l's answer is
 

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.070
so so the short version of l's answer is
we're stealing we're still using java

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:36.080
we're stealing we're still using java
 

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.260

lot what else is in eight there's not 17

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:51.260

right there's the diamond operator and

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:52.760
right there's the diamond operator and
 

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.880
right there's the diamond operator and
that's about it there's a lot of stuff

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:54.890
that's about it there's a lot of stuff
 

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.040
that's about it there's a lot of stuff
underneath the hood in seven there's one

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:57.050
underneath the hood in seven there's one
 

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.440
underneath the hood in seven there's one
of its dynamic invoke i think is the

00:15:59.440 --> 00:15:59.450
of its dynamic invoke i think is the
 

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.240
of its dynamic invoke i think is the
bytecode that got introduced in java 7

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:01.250
bytecode that got introduced in java 7
 

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.900
bytecode that got introduced in java 7
which allows support for non java

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:04.910
which allows support for non java
 

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.600
which allows support for non java
languages to be called a mini and so on

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:07.610
languages to be called a mini and so on
 

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.540
languages to be called a mini and so on
exactly and it's that which is needed to

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:10.550
exactly and it's that which is needed to
 

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.970
exactly and it's that which is needed to
get lambda expression sorted as well so

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:12.980
get lambda expression sorted as well so
 

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.290
get lambda expression sorted as well so
i think a lot of the seven was

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:14.300
i think a lot of the seven was
 

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.110
i think a lot of the seven was
underneath the hood but it's also its

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120
underneath the hood but it's also its
 

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.360
underneath the hood but it's also its
project coin so that was the whole

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:19.370
project coin so that was the whole
 

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.820
project coin so that was the whole

you can use switch light strings and

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:23.810
you can use switch light strings and
 

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.380
you can use switch light strings and
switch statements and stuff uh I mean

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:26.390
switch statements and stuff uh I mean
 

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:27.760

that's right a quorum d yeah I was

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:38.150
that's right a quorum d yeah I was
 

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.980
that's right a quorum d yeah I was
learning though because a lot of this

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:38.990

stuff like Landers can is often like

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880
stuff like Landers can is often like
 

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.050
stuff like Landers can is often like
syntactical sugar isn't it it's often

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:43.060

step or something yeah I mean you can

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:51.710
step or something yeah I mean you can
 

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.430
step or something yeah I mean you can
achieve pretty much the same stuff with

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440
achieve pretty much the same stuff with
 

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.600
achieve pretty much the same stuff with
using lists and of classes and

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:55.610
using lists and of classes and
 

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:56.680
using lists and of classes and
interfaces and that's the whole thing

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:56.690
interfaces and that's the whole thing
 

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.140

that lambda expressions are being sort

00:16:59.140 --> 00:16:59.150

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:50.870
harder to play the same game on a tablet
 

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:52.090
harder to play the same game on a tablet
because you have to move your finger

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:52.100
because you have to move your finger
 

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.770
because you have to move your finger
that much faster and the same Mr that

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:53.780
that much faster and the same Mr that
 

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.000
that much faster and the same Mr that
much further in the same amount of time

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:55.010
much further in the same amount of time
 

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.909
much further in the same amount of time
I'm thinking games like like flight

00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919
I'm thinking games like like flight
 

00:25:57.919 --> 00:26:00.520
I'm thinking games like like flight
control or flick golf or something like

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:00.530
control or flick golf or something like
 

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.529
control or flick golf or something like
that where you train your you train your

00:26:02.529 --> 00:26:02.539
that where you train your you train your
 

00:26:02.539 --> 00:26:04.060
that where you train your you train your
muscles to work on a certain screen size

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:04.070
muscles to work on a certain screen size
 

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.500
muscles to work on a certain screen size
and then you switch to a tablet and all

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:05.510
and then you switch to a tablet and all
 

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.000
and then you switch to a tablet and all
of a sudden everything's different and

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:08.010
of a sudden everything's different and
 

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.010
of a sudden everything's different and
there's like a real fatigue factor that

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.020
there's like a real fatigue factor that
 

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.690
there's like a real fatigue factor that
comes into dragging those airplanes all

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:11.700
comes into dragging those airplanes all
 

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.980
comes into dragging those airplanes all
the way across the center screen it's

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:15.990
the way across the center screen it's
 

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:18.980
the way across the center screen it's
interesting in the tablet app quality

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:18.990
interesting in the tablet app quality
 

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:21.740
interesting in the tablet app quality
checklist three or four of the points

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:21.750
checklist three or four of the points
 

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.420
checklist three or four of the points
all go across the same same thing you

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:23.430
all go across the same same thing you
 

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.750
all go across the same same thing you
just rang in saying Sparky by using

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760
just rang in saying Sparky by using
 

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.480
just rang in saying Sparky by using
fonts and touch targets and assets that

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:29.490
fonts and touch targets and assets that
 

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:30.830
fonts and touch targets and assets that
are designed for that kind of size of

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840
are designed for that kind of size of
 

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.420
are designed for that kind of size of
screen so hopefully it's something that

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:32.430
screen so hopefully it's something that
 

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.160
screen so hopefully it's something that
the checklist will help reinforce for

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:34.170
the checklist will help reinforce for
 

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:36.830
the checklist will help reinforce for
people yeah the good news is it can be a

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840
people yeah the good news is it can be a
 

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.030
people yeah the good news is it can be a
bit scary because you think the vet is

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:38.040
bit scary because you think the vet is
 

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.780
bit scary because you think the vet is
continuous like range of device sizes

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:41.790
continuous like range of device sizes
 

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:44.300
continuous like range of device sizes
out there so if you think about oh do I

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:44.310
out there so if you think about oh do I
 

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.730
out there so if you think about oh do I
have to hit my layouts and make a layout

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:46.740
have to hit my layouts and make a layout
 

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.010
have to hit my layouts and make a layout
that works great on a you know 4-inch

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.020
that works great on a you know 4-inch
 

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.680

phone 5 inch phone a 7 inch tablet and

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:51.690
phone 5 inch phone a 7 inch tablet and
 

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.810
phone 5 inch phone a 7 inch tablet and
8.9 inch tablet like good thing about

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:53.820
8.9 inch tablet like good thing about
 

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.600
8.9 inch tablet like good thing about
this is like there's actually kind of a

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:56.610
this is like there's actually kind of a
 

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:58.460
this is like there's actually kind of a
discrete number of switching points at

00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:58.470
discrete number of switching points at
 

00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:59.900
discrete number of switching points at
the moment we kind of see a lot of the

00:26:59.900 --> 00:26:59.910
the moment we kind of see a lot of the
 

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:03.380
the moment we kind of see a lot of the
stuff kind of setting around 4 7 and 10

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:03.390
stuff kind of setting around 4 7 and 10
 

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:05.330
stuff kind of setting around 4 7 and 10
is kind of like common places and that

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:05.340
is kind of like common places and that
 

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.840
is kind of like common places and that
the variations around there are not so

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:08.850
the variations around there are not so
 

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:10.220
the variations around there are not so
huge that you can use a layout that

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:10.230
huge that you can use a layout that
 

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:11.810
huge that you can use a layout that
works on like a 7-inch tablet will

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:11.820
works on like a 7-inch tablet will
 

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.580
works on like a 7-inch tablet will
probably work on someone from random

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:13.590
probably work on someone from random
 

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.830

8-inch tablet so the way the system

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840
8-inch tablet so the way the system
 

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.870
8-inch tablet so the way the system
works if you use these SW qualifies for

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880
works if you use these SW qualifies for
 

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.760
works if you use these SW qualifies for
your layouts then they'll get picked up

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:19.770
your layouts then they'll get picked up
 

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.290
your layouts then they'll get picked up
by the kind of the one slightly larger

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:21.300
by the kind of the one slightly larger
 

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.690
by the kind of the one slightly larger
as well so it's not actually tons and

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:23.700
as well so it's not actually tons and
 

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:24.890
as well so it's not actually tons and
tons of stuff you do but just by

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:24.900
tons of stuff you do but just by
 

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.480
tons of stuff you do but just by
providing slightly say like you say

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:26.490
providing slightly say like you say
 

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:28.580
providing slightly say like you say
bigger touch targets or slightly bigger

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:28.590
bigger touch targets or slightly bigger
 

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:30.650
bigger touch targets or slightly bigger
font sizes for example unlike a 7-inch

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:30.660
font sizes for example unlike a 7-inch
 

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:34.840
font sizes for example unlike a 7-inch
tablet can make a world of difference I

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:34.850
 

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.400
live another another bit of tablet

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:37.410
live another another bit of tablet
 

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:39.440
live another another bit of tablet
wisdom is that you know say going back

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:39.450
wisdom is that you know say going back
 

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.360
wisdom is that you know say going back
to the game model you don't have to

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:41.370
to the game model you don't have to
 

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.010
to the game model you don't have to
necessarily scale up your game to fill

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:43.020
necessarily scale up your game to fill
 

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:44.660
necessarily scale up your game to fill
the whole screen you can have a fragment

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:44.670
the whole screen you can have a fragment
 

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.300
the whole screen you can have a fragment
that that varies its eyes only a certain

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:47.310
that that varies its eyes only a certain
 

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.740
that that varies its eyes only a certain
amount and then on the larger screens

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:48.750
amount and then on the larger screens
 

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.110
amount and then on the larger screens
just put more or less ancillary

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120
just put more or less ancillary
 

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:55.990
just put more or less ancillary
information about on the sides of it

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000
 

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.280

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:13.590
don't have any further details and so
 

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:14.840
don't have any further details and so
just trying to work out if there's a way

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:14.850
just trying to work out if there's a way
 

00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:17.090
just trying to work out if there's a way
of skipping your the fourth element of

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:17.100
of skipping your the fourth element of
 

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:18.800
of skipping your the fourth element of
the array without actually having to

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:18.810
the array without actually having to
 

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:21.560
the array without actually having to
create a new array with that fourth

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:21.570
create a new array with that fourth
 

00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:25.280
create a new array with that fourth
element missing yeah well that's in your

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:25.290
element missing yeah well that's in your
 

00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:28.340
element missing yeah well that's in your
doctor right in the get item method so

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:28.350
doctor right in the get item method so
 

00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:29.930
doctor right in the get item method so
yeah so I've got my get count reduce

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:29.940
yeah so I've got my get count reduce
 

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:35.960
yeah so I've got my get count reduce
returns a fewer number of a lower value

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:35.970
returns a fewer number of a lower value
 

00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:39.170
returns a fewer number of a lower value

can't you do so the first item is index

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:24.210
can't you do so the first item is index

hashmap am and once and then you'll have

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:31.260
hashmap am and once and then you'll have
 

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:34.520

details and then when you use the get
 

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.849

item then you'll just need to verify

00:52:40.849 --> 00:52:40.859
item then you'll just need to verify
 

00:52:40.859 --> 00:52:42.960
item then you'll just need to verify
that you have the index

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:42.970
that you have the index
 

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:46.230

even if you put it put it into a hashmap
you could then get the entry setback and

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:50.530
you could then get the entry setback and
 

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:53.400
you could then get the entry setback and
iterate over the entry set yeah it

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:53.410
iterate over the entry set yeah it
 

00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:55.890

view pager and tabs together and so it's
 

00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:21.480

kind of a way to to jump from your

kind of a way to to jump from your

sequential access of the viewpager into
the random access and all you have to do

00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:24.940
the random access and all you have to do
 

00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:27.870
the random access and all you have to do
is intervene at that point to tell it

00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:27.880
is intervene at that point to tell it
 

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:31.220
is intervene at that point to tell it

which which you know page or tab to show
 

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:33.720
which which you know page or tab to show
yeah you could do it so that when you go

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:33.730
yeah you could do it so that when you go
 

00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:36.180
yeah you could do it so that when you go
to item number for auto scroll down he'd

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:36.190
to item number for auto scroll down he'd
 

00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:37.440
to item number for auto scroll down he'd
scroll 24 and then it would ultimately

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:37.450
scroll 24 and then it would ultimately
 

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:39.180
scroll 24 and then it would ultimately
just move on which because it's an empty

00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:39.190
just move on which because it's an empty
