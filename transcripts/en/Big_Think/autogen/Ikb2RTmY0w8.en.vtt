the announcement was made that we
 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.730
the announcement was made that we
detected a gravity wave from a distant

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740

experiments on light to detect particles
 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.490
experiments on light to detect particles
we detect particles of light when we do

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500

experiments on light to detect waves we

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320
experiments on light to detect waves we
 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.139
experiments on light to detect waves we
detect waves of light when we look at

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149
detect waves of light when we look at
 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.389
detect waves of light when we look at

force over a distance is the
 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.190
force over a distance is the
transmission of energy so we can find

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200
transmission of energy so we can find
 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.930

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220
were able to detect this small movement
 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.490
were able to detect this small movement
these small movements and so what does
