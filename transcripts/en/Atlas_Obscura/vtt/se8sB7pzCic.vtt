00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.090
Hi, I'm Eric Grundhauser,

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.940
community editor at Atlas Obscura.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.400
And today I'm at Syndaver,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.983
home of the synthetic
cadaver, where, whoa!

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.180
Operating out of an unassuming office park

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.950
in Tampa, Florida,
Syndaver is in the business

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.480
of making bodies.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.770
Syndaver was founded in the early 2000s

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.470
by non-medical doctor
Christopher Sakezles,

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.530
originally in an effort
to find an alternative

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.850
to the sad practice of using sedated cats

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.850
in medical training.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.710
Finding the available
anatomical training tools

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.650
cold, mechanical, and
nothing like the real thing,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.630
Sakezles developed a unique
formula for fake tissue

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.100
that's little more than a
special mixture of water,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.440
salt, and other ingredients.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.720
The company now makes cats,
dogs, humans, and more,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.270
all totally synthetic,
and uncannily authentic.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.143
Believe me: We went there,
and it was visceral.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.140
For as sci-fi a concept as
chemical flesh might be,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.210
the process of creating
the company's cadavers

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.610
is more Frankenstein than "Westworld."

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.020
Sure, there are 3D
printers running off bones

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.890
and prototypes in hard plastic,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.340
but almost every component
of Syndaver's products

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.363
are assembled by teams of artisans.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.008
Sculptors, tailors, painters,
and other creative types

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:20.090
working together to create cadavers

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.090
that look like they were made by robots.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.670
The facility even smells
like an art studio.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.010
The scent of alginate, clay,

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.100
and other unidentifiable
chemical materials

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.250
hit you from the second
you open the doors.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.720
Throughout Syndaver's facility,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.140
workers were hunched over tables,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.200
meticulously building
biology from scratch.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.280
Teams of two were busy assembling
molded muscle and tissue,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.340
sewing away like gruesome tailors.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.530
They stitch the parts together
using waxed dental floss.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.943
(Mint. Never cinnamon.)

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.870
Down the hall, Syndaver's
primary veterinary advisor

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.360
was intubating a canine model

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.170
to show how they could inflate the lungs.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.720
This high level of artisanal care

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.440
is all in service of what they
call the "empathy effect,"

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.070
that innate emotional connection

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.450
to other living creatures,

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.450
which other training devices often forgo

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.463
in favor of a cold efficiency.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.210
And this handcrafted
realism doesn't come cheap.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.550
Even the least expensive
Syndaver human cadaver

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.090
costs around $45,000,

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.470
which might seem somewhat
crazy for a training aid,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.410
but compared to real human cadavers,

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.310
it's actually pretty inexpensive.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.260
Cadavers require iron-clad
approval documentation,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.320
dedicated infrastructure and facilities

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.010
to store and handle
them, and then of course

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.230
there's the shelf life.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.981
Flesh cadavers aren't exactly reusable.

00:02:34.981 --> 00:02:37.090
In the long run, a Syndaver cadaver,

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.180
with its replaceable parts

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.310
and nearly limitless shelf life,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.330
has the potential to save
schools millions of dollars

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.630
in infrastructure costs alone.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.210
Each model can also be customized

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.880
to various purposes and
levels of complexity.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.680
They can be made to
breathe or bleed as needed,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.630
and Syndaver's models are now finding uses

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.710
outside of the world of medical training,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.623
including as military and
ballistics testing dummies.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.100
When we look to the
future of human simulacra,

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.100
we tend to think that
the next quantum leap

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.400
towards lifelike synthetic biology

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.680
will come from the world of robotics,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.520
but Syndaver's focus on recreating

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.900
the sensual experience of interacting

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.660
with a formerly living thing

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.760
might just be a next step.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.520
They might not walk around,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.660
but they look like they could.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.500
And time will tell whether
Syndaver's products

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.970
will end up taking all of the jobs

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.010
from hard-working flesh cadavers,

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.050
but in the meantime it sure is fascinating

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.550
to watch them try.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.960
Hey, thanks for watching.
