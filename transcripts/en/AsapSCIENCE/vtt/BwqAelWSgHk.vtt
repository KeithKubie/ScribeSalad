Indulging in food is a favorite pastime for many.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:11.740
But considering that â…” of Americans, or approximately 207337021 are overweight?

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.880
Perhaps we enjoy food a bit too much.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.240
So, why can't we stop ourselves from consuming so much fatty and sugary food?

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.200
How do we beat overeating?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.640
When your stomach is empty it releases a hormone called ghrelin.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.360
Ghrelin interacts in the brain with the neurotransmitter NPY and turns on the desire to eat.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.580
Once you satisfy this desire by eating, ghrelin levels drop back down and hunger subsides.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:44.820
Conversely, after eating, a different hormone, leptin, is released from the stomach and fat cells, and interferes with NPY, further turning off the desire to eat, and making you feel full.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.260
But if this hunger regulation system is in place, why can't we say no to that piece of cake, or second helping of chips?

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.680
Many food psychologists believe that in the past, energy-rich foods such as those with lots of fat and sugar, were hard to come by.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.040
As hunter-gatherers, the human body needed to take advantage of these meals for survival, and as a result, they became extremely desirable.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.000
But in today's world, we can get a high fat and sugary meal on any corner at any hour.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.760
The problem is, the instinct and desire still remains, and so we struggle to stop eating these meals.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.800
Recently, it's been discovered that the continual intake of fat and sugar overrides the regulatory system of ghrelin and leptin.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.820
The signalling pathway is insufficient to control our new diet, and so our initial evolutionary desire now plagues our ability to choose wisely and eat healthy.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.260
It's a self-perpetuating problem.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.880
The more unhealthy food you eat, the more you desire food.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.340
Got a burning question you want answered?
