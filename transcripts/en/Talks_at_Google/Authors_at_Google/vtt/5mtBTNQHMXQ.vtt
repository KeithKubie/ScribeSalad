00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So good afternoon everyone.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Welcome to the authors at Google series.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.719
My name is Scott Sheffer and itís my pleasure
to introduce Professor Edith Sheffer to all

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:11.719
of you.

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:12.969
Yes weíre married.

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.849
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So thatís the connection, thatís

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.610
how we got her to come to Google.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.910
Edithís an assistant Professor of history
at Stanford University.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.600
She graduated summa cum laude from Harvard
University with a BA in history and literature

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.570
and then attended Berkeley for her PhD studying
under Jerry Feldman.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.250
She was a Mellon Fellow in the history department
at Stanford before joining the faculty as

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.170
an assistant Professor in September of 2010.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.109
Sheís also the winner of several teaching
awards at Berkeley and Stanford and published

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:45.059
an article in the Chronicle called ìHigher
Educationî in 2009 on her revolutionary teaching

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.589
methods.

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.999
These methods are now actually being adopted
in high schools, community colleges and universities

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.309
around the world.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.300
Her recently completed book Burned Bridge:
How East and West Germans Made the Iron Curtain

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.050
challenges the conventional history of the
iron curtain suggesting how the physical barrier

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.210
that was imposed between East and West Germany
was not just imposed by cold war super powers

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.450
but was an outgrowth of anxious activities
and anxious people on the ground.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.990
The book examines the growth and genesis of
the border through the lens of two adjacent

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.700
cities; Neustadt bei Coburg and Sonneberg
that were the largest separated population

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.340
outside of Berlin.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.950
It was, in fact, the American military that
erected the first border barriers between

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.310
the two East, West Germanys.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.680
Iíll leave other juicy anecdotes to Edith
but be prepared to be surprised about what

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.240
happened at the beginnings of the iron curtain.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.770
Without further ado Iíll turn it over to
Edith and weíll have some Q&amp;A afterward.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.820
[Applause]

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.050
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: Thank you, Scott.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.440
Thank you all so much for coming here today.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.390
I really look forward to telling you about
my research and, as Scott said, what I find

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.770
to be surprising and exciting stories.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.350
Today, as Scott indicated, Iíll be taking
a rather unconventional look at the creation

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.560
of the wall between East and West Germany
and this research is really the first social

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.180
history of the iron curtain.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.750
We have a lot of military and diplomatic histories
of how this barrier was built, but I wonít

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.440
be looking at the role of high politics, rather,
Iíll be looking at the role of the residents

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.480
who lived on either side of this fence.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:31.010
And, so, Iíll be spotlighting today how one
cohesive community in the absence of linguistic,

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.900
religious or cultural differences began to
see people, right on the opposite side of

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.840
this fence, as other.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.760
Creating difference where there was no difference.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.370
So although Germany had been united, it was
one country and under Hitler it was supposed

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.930
to be a thousand year Reich, right at the
end of World War Two the allies imposed a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.900
temporary demarcation line which then gradually
became the creation of difference where there

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.560
was no difference.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.939
The institutionalization of violence among
neighbors and popular participation in a system

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:06.939
that was deeply unpopular.

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:13.510
And what I think is so fascinating about this
story is how so quickly people normalized

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.730
a monstrosity in their midst.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.470
So my central claim in a nutshell is that
the lethal barrier between East and West Germany

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.610
was not simply imposed by Communism, as we
tend to think, but that it emerged haphazardly

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.360
from both East and West and that ordinary
people played a significant role in its creation.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.030
So, let me just give you an overview of the
talk today.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.520
First Iíll begin with the broader context
of this project, giving an outline of the

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.710
book as a whole which I see was given out
freely and then Iíll delve into two examples

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.840
from my research at very different points
in time, one from the late 1940s when the

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.579
border was still an invisible line and one
from the 1980s when the border was at its

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:00.829
absolute height.

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.599
And Iíll conclude with the implications of
this work, not only for an understanding of

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:12.519
Germany and the Cold War but, also, for understanding
borders, partitions and identities today.

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:19.680
And, above all, throughout this talk Iíll
be emphasizing the importance of social fabric,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.250
describing how the strength of Germanyís
wall and many of the institutions we take

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.450
for granted today, come as much from concrete
as it does from the society that supports

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.680
their creation.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.350
So as fortified borders proliferate around
the world today such as those between the

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.770
U.S. and Mexico or the security fence in Israel,
Germanyís story, I think, warns us that walls

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.940
can permeate the culture with enduring and
even deadly consequences.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.710
Micro steps can have far reaching results.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.970
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: So, compared to international

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.660
relations today, the Cold War, in retrospect,
can appear to be a simpler, steadier time.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.050
And nothing represents this so clearly as
the Berlin Wall which remains the stark symbol

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.050
of East, West conflict, conflict.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.290
And, in popular imagination as well as in
scholarship, the iron curtain appears to be

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.660
monolithic.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.750
It was imposed unilaterally by Communism,
imprisoning East Germans from escaping to

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.100
freedom in the West; weíve all heard this
story.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.500
And for the West during the Cold War, the
Berlin Wall underpinned a moral consensus

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.550
against Communism.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:43.120
From JFK, you see him in the lower left there,
his Ich bin ein Berliner speech as well as

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.790
Ronald Reaganís, ìMr. Gorbachev tear down
this wall!î These are iconic moments in the

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.030
Cold War.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.180
But today Iíd like to turn this on its head
and present a very different, story revealing

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:01.770
the human underpinnings of the supposedly
iron barrier.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:10.210
This is the, uh, the celebrations of in 19,
in 2009 of its fall, I think only underscores

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:16.900
have the symbolic significance of the Berlin
Wall has transcended the Cold War.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.590
So yes, the Berlin Wall did go up overnight
in 1961.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.190
But what happened in Berlin, Iíll be arguing,
is just one part of a much longer story of

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.289
the entire iron curtain.

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:36.830
The Berlin Wall was only the final and most
famous portion of the iron curtain to be built.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.850
The Berlin Wall had a very complicated genealogy.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:46.639
Before it appeared another longer barrier
had been growing between the Germanys for

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:47.930
16 years.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.680
So after World War Two the allies divided
Germany into four occupation zones.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.509
You see the Soviet Zone, the US Zone, the
British Zone and the French Zone and each

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:01.629
of these zones had demarcation lines between
them and the laws were the same on each of

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.240
these borders.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.879
Very quickly, this border between the Western
zones and the Soviet zones became incredibly

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:10.139
problematic.

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:15.699
Soviet soldiers were prone to theft and rape
over the border and very soon economic imbalances

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:22.389
between the two sides led to a lot of smuggling
and migration.

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:27.580
So this developed into a fourteen hundred
kilometer border which if you cut the US in

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.270
half itís roughly the distance from Chicago
to New Orleans.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:35.919
So, as you can see, much longer than what
happened in Berlin which remained occupied

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:42.920
by the four powers until 1961 and Berlin remained
open until then.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:50.669
So, I am not sure why this longer border has
claimed so much less attention to the, than

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:51.669
the Berlin Wall.

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:54.129
Iíd be curious to hear your thoughts as to
why.

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:59.050
But there are very few books written about
this other longer barrier.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:04.259
The books that we have really portray this
border as a military installation imposed

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:09.830
by Communism with the populace having very
little to do with its construction.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.599
This is a military impassable barrier.

00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:19.270
Now there are several scholarly works under
way in Germany and in the US and Iíll be

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:23.250
curious to see how this image of the border
changes over time.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:29.139
But when I began my research it was certainly
eye opening to see just how dynamic this border

00:08:29.139 --> 00:08:30.550
was.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:36.600
The archives revealed how civilians and local
officials participated in its construction

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.450
and how this barrier was really woven into
the fabric of local communities.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:49.760
So here, on the left, you see a brigade of
civilians in 1952 clearing logs to build border

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.100
fortifications.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.240
Now, this is a tricky photo to read.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.410
How can we, in a coercive brutal regime like
East Germany, how can we tell what these people

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:05.230
are actually thinking, what their motivations,
to what extent are they being coerced and

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.780
who are we to evaluate them?

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:13.782
So, in going to the archives and researching
this deeply, it does become clear that there

00:09:13.782 --> 00:09:18.600
are several acts of resistance, that it was
possible to walk off a job like this with

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.980
and without repercussions.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:25.420
Did people, were people aware to the extent
that this was possible?

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.440
How do we know?

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:32.840
It is also clear from the archives that there
were widespread complicity and compliance.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:40.690
East German civilians wound up initiating
one in five of all escape arrests as denunciations

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.600
or as voluntary border helpers.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:49.250
So my question became, how did people accept
and even perpetuate this strange dividing

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.500
line that suddenly appeared in their midst?

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:58.690
So my research has yielded three interrelated
answers to this question which Iíll be going

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:03.750
into in more depth but Iíll be showing how
the early form of the border was extremely

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.100
open ended.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:10.210
Neither East nor West had a coherent plan
for this thing let alone a strategy.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:15.460
And their policies continued to develop ad
hoc in response to each otherís moves and

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.970
counter moves.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:22.860
So the border emerged bit by bit more in response
to conditions on the ground.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:29.920
Second, I argue that Germanyís division ran
deeper than as realized, penetrating mentalities.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.880
Germanyís, Germans rapidly formed oppositional
identities within a few years as Easterners

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.690
and Westerners attributing entirely different
values in characteristics to people on each

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.410
side.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:47.670
So although the actual shape of the border
was in extreme flux people perceived it to

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:52.643
be a fete accompli and it, sort of, preemptively
anticipating the borders a fete accompli,

00:10:52.643 --> 00:10:55.450
it made it happen.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:01.120
So Iíll be going through some instances of
how this happened as we go on.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:08.480
So poignantly, frontier populations adjusted
to something that was not static and in so

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.530
doing, made it a reality that most did not
want.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:20.820
So, as Scott had mentioned, my research centers
upon these two towns and I picked them because

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.990
theyíre almost identical.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.590
Itís a perfect political science experiment.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:29.950
These towns are the same size, about 25,000
people each and socioeconomically incredibly

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.260
similar.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:37.720
The American army occupied Neustadt at the
end of World War Two and the Soviet army occupied

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.720
Sonneberg.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:44.590
And very quickly, the two military governments
imposed very different systems of laws on

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.880
each side.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.701
So because my argument is, oh and I canít
leave out Burned Bridge was the name of the

00:11:52.701 --> 00:11:55.300
check point that was established between the
two towns.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:00.900
It was named after the road crossing between
them, conveniently for me itís also a great

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.210
metaphor for what I believe happened there.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:09.020
So because my argument is about all the little
ways that the iron curtain became effect,

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.720
my approach was basically to canvas all available
sources.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:19.130
I went to 14 different archives in both East
and West looking at city, county, state and

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:24.680
national records including secret police files
and American military records.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:30.800
I went through local newspaper, journals,
periodicals, uh, school work assignment, anything

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.560
I could get my hands on to kind of portray
this multiplicity of perspectives.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.920
I lived in these places.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:42.680
I conducted interviews with over 50 people
ranging from border officials to border victims

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.570
and I also conducted a mailed survey to 500
people.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:54.910
And because of this multilayered approach,
for any given event I have different perspectives

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:58.390
that often present very conflicting narratives.

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:04.250
And itís precisely these gaps in these different
perspectives that I think speaks volumes and

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:11.620
really conveys the uncertainty and confusion
that I believe drove much of the borders development.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:18.250
So, before going into my examples, Iíd like
to give you a quick overview of the development

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.860
of the iron curtain.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:25.990
The thickness of this line denotes the thickness
of the barrier at any point in time.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.460
And Iíve periodized it into three phases.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:35.710
In the late 1940s, right after the military
governments are established, Burned Bridge

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:36.880
was a busy check point.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.440
there was a customs house right here.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:46.560
The demarcation was unfenced, it was invisible,
poorly guarded and was basically a chaotic

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.580
crime zone.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:52.670
And, as Scott had said, it was basically the
American military who built the first barriers

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:57.340
here to contain this crime zone.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:05.100
Then in the 1950s and 52í, East Germany first
decided to build the first extensive fence

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.360
network.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:13.810
Not so much to keep people in, escape was
not the primary concern in 1952.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:18.200
The motive here was to stabilize what had
been such a chaotic region.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:23.330
So residents could still cross very easily,
though, people on both sides progressively

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:31.920
internalized this and this period is what
I call, a period of a living wall which was

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.580
what, actually, the West German minister for
all German questions wanted it to be.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.290
The population was supposed to constitute
a living wall.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:49.810
Then in the 1960s, by the time East Germany
built the Berlin Wall in 1961, a lethal border

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:50.810
was already in place.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:56.830
And you can see here, that house had been
bulldozed and you see multiple layers of barbed

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.540
wire at Burned Bridge.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:06.010
And the modern border continued to grow, you
get land mines, dog run, signal fences and

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.800
trip wires, this is a formidable barrier now.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:17.070
So much so that when the iron curtain finally
fell in 1989, people were euphoric and it

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.650
was a bewildering experience.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:30.330
And now Burned Bridge is a bustling commercial
center with Ronald presiding over two competing

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:35.980
malls on each side.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:41.020
So since the book talks about the aggregate
effects of small decisions and small adjustments,

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.830
it is difficult to convey in a talk like this
the sheer breadth of everyday actions and

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.220
mentalities that I believe gave rise to the
border.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:54.130
It is also difficult to convey exactly what
I mean by people when I say people made the

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:55.610
iron curtain.

00:15:55.610 --> 00:16:01.170
I do not mean to suggest that local people
uniformly wanted this border to exist, far

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.170
from it.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:08.000
Rather, I mean a range of people acting at
different times for a range of different reasons,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.270
added up together to a structure that no one
intended.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:16.340
So to give you an example of the kinds of
evidence Iím looking at and to differentiate

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:22.710
these people so much, somewhat, letís return
to the time of the American and Soviet military

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.490
occupations.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:30.990
The border, as Iíd said, was a sight of endemic
theft, abduction, rape and shootings and it

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:36.790
was technically illegal to cross but locals
still went back and forth all the time, especially

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:41.330
Eastern smugglers, undocumented workers and
migrants.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.180
So here is an East German woman caught by
a Western border guard.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:49.540
Sheís smuggling toy ornaments which were
masses produced in the area Iím studying.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.480
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: And then here you have workers

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.890
crossing illegally.

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:57.580
And hundreds and hundreds of people were crossing
every day in the late 1940s.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:03.220
So increasingly, West Germans began resenting
these Eastern crossers who were poorer, they

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.670
were dressed worse and they were taking their
jobs.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:06.670
This sounds familiar.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.530
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: And, in fact, the dynamic

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:14.959
of this early border was not dissimilar to
the US, Mexican border today.

00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:19.120
Where there is local impetus to increase border
escalations.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:24.980
So, Western border residents undertook a wide
range of actions against these Eastern border

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:25.980
goers.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:33.310
And, today, I just wanna give you an example
of what happened in judicial prosecutions.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:39.170
So three years after the demarcation line
first appears the Western mayor of Neustadt

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:44.320
calls for quote, I know this is difficult
to read, ìThe immediate strengthening of

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.850
the Border Police and the creation of an effective
system of summary courts."

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:55.610
And then he called a meeting with Bavarian
official, American officials to define border

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:56.610
crime.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.430
What is a border crime?

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:04.010
So the Neustadt border court tried over a
thousand defendants over the next three years.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:09.270
And the local archives had actually slated
these border trials for destruction.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:13.360
Saying that they had little historical value
because there were so many of them and they

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.360
were meaningless.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:19.290
And I really argued for this not to happen
because I think that they reveal a lot about

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.160
this dynamic in the early period.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:28.350
So immediately after the mayorís initiative
Western law targeted Easterners.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:34.940
Over 90 percent of the courts defendants were
Eastern border smugglers and undocumented

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.080
workers mostly from the neighboring town of
Sonneberg.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.410
So their former neighbors are now getting
arrested for crossing and taking their jobs.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:50.060
Even more interesting, I think, is that the
definition of border crime then shifts abruptly.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:57.470
The economic situation began improving, anti
communism was growing and suddenly Western

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:01.480
leftists became the targets of prosecution.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.570
Westerners were attending communist events
in the east, they were transporting propaganda

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:11.150
and these are now the people who become arrested.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.850
So what does this mean?

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:18.190
When I present my work I often get the question,
ìWasnít this border inevitable?

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:22.360
Come on, you have the US army on one side,
the Soviet army on the other side, what is

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:27.610
it, really, that I expect local people to
have done?î And my response is, of course

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:33.760
no one would have denied the geopolitical
conditions created the conditions in which

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:38.700
the iron curtain arose, I donít mean to imply
that they donít.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:43.480
But we already know a lot about high level
decision making and structural differences

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.310
between East and West.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:49.440
So what Iím saying is that while states created
the condition for the border they did not

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.260
control its outcome.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:56.380
And local responses like this are vital to
understanding how it actually developed into

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.630
what national bodies were responding to.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:04.050
So, especially, in this early period, the
American and Soviet military governments had

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.410
no plans for this border.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.300
They were busy catching Naziís
[Laughs]

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:11.400
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: They were busy rebuilding
the economy, they were busy implementing new

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.280
systems of government, the border was not
a priority.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:21.150
And, so, because of this vacuum of power this
allowed local government to take initiative

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:25.620
and shape what this border actually meant.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:32.500
So here, because the US military was not doing
its job, this Western mayor took over.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:37.920
So this is just one example of many suggesting
how such actions combined with others and

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.060
others and others, in aggregate could have
created this phenomenon.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:49.610
So Iíd like to give another example from
the 1940s which I think demonstrates the kind

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:53.170
of interactivity that was driving the borders
growth.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:55.670
So, this is a fun story.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:21:01.680
In July 1949 there was a soccer game near
Burned Bridge, between the two towns, and

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:08.300
the game was supposedly on the border so the
midfield line was the border so the people

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:12.740
could attend the game without applying for
inter zonal passes, though the players whoíd

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:17.420
be running in between the zones needed passes
in order to play the game.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.570
So the game was a major event.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:26.010
25,000 people came and it was experienced
and remembered as a demonstration of local

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:27.430
unity.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.720
But when you go to the archives, however,
you see a very different story.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.270
First it turns out the game was not actually
over the border but no one knew where the

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:36.270
border lay,
[Laughs]

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:41.050
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: So it was entirely within
the Soviet Zone because it was the Communist

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:44.240
party in the Soviet Zone that planned the
game.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.650
It was not a local initiative.

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:52.570
And Communists in the Soviet Zone were planning
border events all along the demarcation line

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:58.410
in order to unsettle the West, to sort of
foment activity on the border.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:05.500
So after the game, the Soviet commander of
Sonneberg announced that the demarcation line

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.000
would be open for the day.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.300
So you have Easterners lining up on the demarcation
line, this invisible line, and I find this

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.300
picture incredible.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:21.140
You have a crowd standing on an invisible
line not crossing.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.470
And then all of a sudden people begin to cross
and because thereís so many of them they

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:30.870
quickly overrun West German and American forces.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:36.050
So here theyíre rushing across and they soon
overwhelm border guards and they scream into

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:41.340
Neustadt, bartering, whatever it is they happened
to bring over.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:49.950
So, while at the same time, only 400 Westerners
reportedly crossed to the East.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:55.460
So you have this enormous display of enthusiasm
going from East to West but not West to East.

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:59.880
And, in fact, if you interview Westerners
about this event, theyíll say that although

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:04.290
it was great to see their friends and families
and neighbors again, the Eastern crowds were

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:09.460
much too much and they were happy when the
Sonnebergers went back home again.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:15.630
So the Soviet Zone then organized three more
mass crossings that fall, numbering about

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:16.740
20,000 people each.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:22.580
This was an incredibly huge event and this
made for good propaganda.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:30.170
Here, again, you see East Germans lined up
along an invisible line with Americans confronting

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.440
them with machine guns.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:38.710
And, so, this is a picture that was published
in a Soviet Zone newspaper to demonstrate,

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:43.520
you know, the fallacy of Western claims for
openness.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.390
And at the same time Westerner newspapers
portrayed this differently.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:53.820
The New York Times described the Easterners
as mobs of shabby people resembling a swarm

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.140
of locusts.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.730
Westerners complained about these repeat invasions
demanding state compensation cause their stores

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:06.380
were selling out of wares and local politicians
begged the US military government to increase

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:11.630
border controls to stop these mass crossings
from happening.

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:17.000
So Western authorities responded to this local
pressure and there were ramifications of these

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.780
crossings along the entire border.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.470
These crossings led to security escalations.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:29.260
So today, however, these crossings are remembered
very differently as spontaneous expressions

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.590
of neighborly solidarity.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:38.840
So in the survey I did, I threw in a question
about this and of 112 respondents that were

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:45.780
born before 1945, so theyíd have some living
memory of this, 81 percent remembered the

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.760
crossings as joint local initiatives.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.250
Only 9 percent said they were organized by
the communist party and the Soviet Zone.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:59.690
And, indeed, when I talk to locals about this
they look at me very skeptically because this

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.059
doesnít tally with their memory at all.

00:25:02.059 --> 00:25:07.190
And in a television interview about this soccer
game, one man from the region just rejected

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:10.580
it out of hand saying, ìNo, I donít believe
you.î

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:14.880
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: So the memory of the border

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.930
is as important to understanding it today
as what actually happened.

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:22.330
But what I think is most significant about
these mass crossings, hereís another picture

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:28.880
of the invisible line, is that they were extremely
one sided and extremely short lived.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:35.290
So just 4 years after the fall of the thousand
year Reich, thousands of Easterners were rushing

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:40.070
to Neustadt while only a few hundred Westerners
were going East.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.210
And they also reveal how partition had become
an established reality.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:48.930
The openings were exciting and disruptive
precisely because the border was an established

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:50.440
fact of everyday life.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:57.300
So, although these crowds easily overwhelmed
US and Western border forces, the next day

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.140
border discipline returned to normal each
time.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.410
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: So you have four mass crossings

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:08.250
and then four returns to normalcy which I
think makes the sensation of these mass crossings

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.860
all the more revealing.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:16.820
What is keeping crowds from doing this everyday
when thereís no real threat of force?

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:21.570
So I believe these 1949 mass crossings expose
not the strength of the physical barrier,

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:26.510
there is no physical barrier, but its dependence
upon local compliance.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:33.630
And you see local compliance just four years
after the end of the third Reich.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:39.330
So Germanyís divide was not a fortification
as much as it was a living wall.

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:43.670
And itís the adjustment of these post war
populations that then enabled the border to

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.830
persist and expand.

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.250
[Clears throat]
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: Now this argument is very

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:54.570
easy to make for the immediate post war period
when border policy and the two German states

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:55.710
were in extreme flux.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:27:01.690
But I believe the border residence played
an important role in later events as well.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:08.690
So, for example, in 1952 East Germany builds
the first fences and it deports in something

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:15.400
it names action vermin, over 8,000 border
residence who they deem unreliable for their

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.400
inland.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:21.340
So you have these local deportation actions
where local people are these sort of paramilitary

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:26.200
police units that go up to peopleís houses,
load their furniture and the residence on

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.681
a truck and drive them to new homes for their
inland.

00:27:28.681 --> 00:27:35.620
And what I think is interesting is with this
action vermin it came as a complete shock

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:38.800
and you see a wide range of responses.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.860
Some local officials helped draft the deportation
lists.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:48.110
No one in Berlin knew these peopleís names
so it was local officials that conducted this.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:52.700
At the same time, some officials would tip
off friends who were on the list so they could

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.830
escape.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:59.510
Some towns remained quiet when these trucks
pulled up, watching from the windows as their

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.560
neighbors were loaded on to these trucks.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.900
Some towns took to the streets and built barricades
and went out with pitchforks quashed only

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.790
by Soviet tanks, Soviet tanks went into some
of these places.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:17.750
One entire village named Libow escaped West
overnight, 63 people just moved across the

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.370
border at once.

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:26.320
So the outcome of action vermin in each community
depended largely upon the extent to which

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.500
locals caused trouble.

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:34.060
So if you go through the rates of deportation,
towns that remained relatively calm would

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:40.380
see deportation rates of 65 to 80 percent
where as towns that caused trouble could see

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.900
the ratio of removed victims as low as 0 to
10 percent.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:51.480
So, to me, this variability of response and
variability of consequences reveals just how

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:56.370
large a factor the border population was in
understanding its escalation.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:02.370
So, although, my point is that while the specific
border dynamic changes over time, this is

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:06.200
a very different event than, say, the mass
crossings I just described.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:12.040
There was always a dynamic at work here and
itís important to understanding how the iron

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.740
curtain actually evolved.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:20.240
So my book goes through each phase of the
Cold War but now Iíd like to skip ahead to

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.040
the height of the border where itís very
difficult to make this argument that the local

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.809
populations played a role in its creation.

00:29:27.809 --> 00:29:32.700
And this is probably the more controversial
aspect of my work to make this argument for

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:37.580
a time period where the border was already
established.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:43.830
So this is the same sight that we just saw
of the 1949 mass crossings, remember that

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.400
invisible line?

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.540
Now itís a mesh fence.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:57.940
Behind it are booby traps, mines, self firing
devices; dog runs, a lethal installation.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:03.260
So in thirty years life itself in Sonneberg
had dramatically changed.

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:08.900
East Germany had established a military zone
behind the fortifications so the people living

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:15.230
within 5 kilometers of the border, everyone
in this photograph lived in what was called

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.700
a prohibited zone.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:23.510
This encompassed about 2 percent of East Germanyís
entire population, about 400,000 people.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:28.270
So you can imagine the logistical undertaking
of 2 percent of the population living in a

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.640
prohibited zone.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.770
And you could only enter the prohibited zone
with a special permit.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:35.630
You faced a constant threat of deportation.

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:42.980
I estimate that about a thousand Sonnebergers
were deported over the years.

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:48.300
Within this zone was an even stricter 500
meter zone or protection strip.

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:53.450
Here you lived under tight curfews and a range
of daily prohibitions and you were part of

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:58.270
border enforcement, even your children were
trained in border enforcement.

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:03.549
You were supposed to report outsiders coming
in to the area and serve as volunteer border

00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:05.429
helpers.

00:31:05.429 --> 00:31:12.540
To compensate border residents for these hardships
East Germany paid residents 15 percent salary

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.540
bonuses.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:17.140
So if you lived here you got a higher salary.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.950
And this, incidentally, proved so popular
that some communities lobbied to be included

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:25.760
in the military zone in order to get these
bonuses.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:31.130
The dynamic in the border zone was fascinating
and Iím happy to talk about it in discussion

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:36.860
but Iím gonna move onto the rest of my story,
but how this was established is fascinating

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.820
in and of itself.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:48.510
So, because this border regime was so elaborate
it is hardly surprising that West Germans

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:53.160
seized upon East Germany's border as inhumane.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:58.120
But itís important to recognize how the West
German media and government exaggerated the

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.440
horrors of the border.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.410
Rhetoric of it as a concentration camp wall.

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:08.930
It helped strengthen West Germanyís western
alliances and was useful fodder for the Cold

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:10.690
War.

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:15.860
Newspapers were full of headlines about East
Germans trying to escape tyranny, getting

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:20.000
blown up, dying at the fortification and itís
true, of course this happened and these are

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.730
terrible tragic stories.

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:27.549
Yet the headlines were not always right.

00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:29.360
This headline is wrong on several accounts.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:34.790
I donít know if anyone in the audience speaks
German but this 16 year old boy, it describes,

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:41.000
was not escaping from the East he was escaping
to the East from an abusive childrenís home

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
in the West.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.150
And this happened, Westerners did escape east.

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:49.740
And he didnít die, as the headline claims
but he wound up in Sonnebergís hospital and

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:53.260
actually praised his treatment there by East
German officials.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.630
The government also exaggerated the strength
of the border.

00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:05.330
This is a publicized diagram from 1965 that
overstates and condenses the fortifications.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:07.740
The exaggeration continues today.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:12.900
This is a video reconstruction on YouTube
that was produced by Deutsche Welle, you know,

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:20.590
the main, yeah, news network by Germany today
and it shows only a very unusually fortified

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:22.120
section of the border.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.799
So itís not an exaggeration but itís a very
specialized place that had been on the iron

00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:28.980
curtain.

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:34.390
Western representations really reinforced
the image of the iron curtain as an inevitable,

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:36.660
inescapable reality.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:43.640
In turn, West Germany turned the border into
a tourist attraction.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.950
The government subsidized trips to the border
land.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:49.020
Border guards led border tours.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:56.220
You could take bus rides, visit museums, buy
postcards and ponder the horrors of totalitarianism

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.740
at Neustadtís booming border cafÈ.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:04.250
Thereís the iron curtain.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:09.710
So here we are defending, um, yeah.

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:12.780
These are East German images of the border.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.700
These are also ominous images but very different.

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:21.450
On a rare occasion the border was shown in
East Germany it appears not as a prison wall

00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:26.330
but as action shots of handsome soldiers in
combat, right, theyíre defending against

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:28.980
fascism in the west.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.740
But on both sides, basically, youíre presented
a formidable frontier.

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:40.159
I hope you can see this, this is, this border
really did work.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:48.669
This is the drop in escapes from 1961when
the border was seriously fortified and how

00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:53.530
the number drops to under 100 escapes a year
by the 1970s.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:59.600
So imagine a line from Chicago to New, New
Orleans only 100 people getting across that

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.600
every year.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:07.380
Thatís what these numbers suggest, incredibly
effective, right?

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:15.070
So, but if you look beyond the border forces
official reports you quickly get a different

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.470
picture than this number would suggest.

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:21.170
So letís take 1982 this is what Iíve highlighted.

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:25.040
There was 72 reported escapes, only 72.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:31.640
But, again, if you dig into this a little
deeper here is a letter from a woman in a

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:36.920
Sonneberg community in 1982 and she mentions
to her relatives in Neustadt that her son

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.340
quote, ìCame over the border again to visit
us today.î

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.920
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: And although this kind of

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:47.590
evidence is anecdotal there are such fragments
in peopleís attics and conversations that

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:52.250
local people were crossing.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:57.640
And what I think is even more interesting
is what border agencies knew about these local

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.640
crossings.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:04.470
For example, hereís a document from East
Germanyís stasi or secret police and it describes

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:11.980
the antics of three young men who within 6
months in 1982, crossed the border 45 times.

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:15.290
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: They were stealing mines

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:19.869
from the border fortifications and selling
them to West German and American service men

00:36:19.869 --> 00:36:22.290
on the other side.

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:30.880
So this document shows 45 crossings in 6 months,
contrast that with 72 reported escapes.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:35.430
So the irony with this story with the crossing
boys is that East German border forces didnít

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:39.460
even know the boys were crossing until they
were arrested in West Germany for selling

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.460
the mines.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:44.940
It was illegal in West Germany to vandalize
the fortifications.

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:50.510
So these cases raised the obvious question,
how much crossing was really happening over

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:52.260
the border?

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.370
And they also raise a question about reporting.

00:36:55.370 --> 00:37:00.640
Government agencies knew about these local
crossings but their number did not make it

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.430
into official tallies nor were they publicized
in the press.

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:05.430
Why?

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:10.320
Well, East Germany certainly had no interest
in admitting that the border was more vulnerable

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.760
than it projected and West Germany had a policy
of not publicizing crossings.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.560
It didnít want to endanger East German families
and it also didnít wanna lead East Germans

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:24.950
to believe that crossing was not a dangerous
possibility.

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:28.910
These locals knew what they were doing and
the outsiders did not.

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:33.940
But I do wonder if these numbers were publicized
in some fashion would it have changed peopleís

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:38.260
perception of the barrier and if people had
known the barrier was more porous would it

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.260
have changed its reality?

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:43.970
And what was the borderís reality, really?

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:46.450
How is it possible to cross this formidable
barrier?

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:52.670
And the short answer is local knowledge, that
the border was enmeshed in local life.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:59.020
This is a scrapbook from a border soldier
in the 1960s and it, to me, really speaks

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:02.850
to how border residents were part of the border
regime.

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:06.840
This was a living, breathing system that was
peopled by people.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:13.270
Here you see photos of his buddies chatting
with this local woman, Frieda, and hereís

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:17.260
his favorite pub in the area where he was
stationed.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:22.590
So, the border residents were part of the
system and knew how it worked.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:26.680
And the strength of the iron curtain really
depended upon these people.

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:33.200
As Iíd said, less than one fifth, or I hadnít
said this, less than one fifth of all escapes

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:38.990
were caught by border soldiers at the fortifications,
less than a fifth.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:43.850
The rest were caught by local and transport
police further inland and up to a quarter

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:50.610
were turned in by local civilians, these volunteer
border helpers and denunciations.

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:57.240
So in the story I just told one of the young
men that had crossed the border 23 times in

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.790
6 months, his mother was a cook for the border
troops and his dad actually worked for the

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:05.300
Stasi, East Germanyís secret police.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:08.790
So he knew the patrol routes and where the
fortifications were the weakest.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.700
He grew up in this kind of border regime.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:16.369
So what I think is so amazing is that the
very same people who were buttressing the

00:39:16.369 --> 00:39:23.030
iron curtain, making it function, making it
possible, were in a position to subvert it

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:29.950
and they did subvert it even though they would
denounce you or me if we walked into the border

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:31.300
zone.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:37.420
So here we have a bit of a paradox, we have
a strong border that was oddly porous to the

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:42.490
same people who were making it possible, who
had this inside knowledge but were keeping

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:46.010
it strong to outsiders.

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:49.580
So I donít wanna lead you astray, Iíve gotten
a lot of criticism for making this argument

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:52.040
as you might imagine.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:57.790
And I do wanna be clear, Iím not saying that
this border wasnít incredibly dangerous and

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:01.850
plenty of the locals, even if they did know
the terrain would lose their lives and limbs

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:04.369
in attempt to cross it.

00:40:04.369 --> 00:40:07.680
The border was absolutely horrific and I do
not mean to diminish that.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:11.120
If you were an outsider that didnít know
how the system worked you would likely be

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.630
killed trying to cross it.

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:18.760
Iím just trying to spotlight these exceptions
to the rule to show what was actually possible

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.200
within the system.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:25.320
Given our overwhelming emphasis on the borders
horrors I think itís important to show this

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:29.920
other side of the coin.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:35.540
So here, again, is a sketch by one young man
who befriended a border soldier at a bar,

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:40.340
he devised this elaborate plan to cross the
border and he did cross the border, 3 times

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:43.010
within a couple years in the 1980s.

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:48.470
And these kinds of documents are in peopleís
homes, they come out when you talk with them

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:51.310
and I canít give you any precise number for
them.

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:56.540
I really canít, I wish I could, so much of
this is anecdotal but their sheer existence,

00:40:56.540 --> 00:41:01.780
I believe, really shifts our understanding
of the border and I look forward to future

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:05.320
research revealing just what was happening
here.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.760
But the point is that East Germanyís physical
fortifications were far more fallible than

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.810
we tend to think.

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:17.820
In the 60s, especially, youíd get rotten
mine fields, the border was riddled with rust

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.820
and breakable barbed wire.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:27.720
This two and half year old toddled across
the border unscathed, losing a shoe, crossing

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:32.780
a mine field, crossing a mind field in four
layers of barbed wire.

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:37.730
His mother told me he simply wandered off
from a festival, wound up in the West, was

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:40.540
asleep when a couple found him.

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:45.490
So these, apparently he was too light to set
off the mines and thatís why this was possible

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:49.680
but still, this gives you a sense of what
was actually happening on the ground.

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.170
[Coughing]
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: Even in the 70s and 80s the

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:58.240
border was plagued by malfunctions, defunct
trip wires, signal fences, heavy snowfall

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:03.970
could trigger a bunch of land mines going
off, they were decoy cut outs of boulder,

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:07.370
border soldiers put in watch towers to give
the impression there were more soldiers on

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:10.010
the border than there were.

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:13.150
And locals would still cross impulsively.

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:18.150
These were mostly young men and teenagers,
just because, and theyíd be fighting with

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:23.290
parents, theyíd be fighting with a girlfriend,
theyíd get poor grades in school or they

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:27.190
were simply bored with life in a provincial
back water.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:33.350
In the 1960s, officials estimated that 90
percent of these local crossers were male,

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:40.400
over three quarters were under the age of
25, a third were in trouble with the law and

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.120
half were just plain drunk.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:45.540
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: Crossing on a dare or something

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.660
like that.

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:51.730
And there was a kind of border subculture
in the 1960s, especially, where the frontier

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:57.020
was kind of an adventure playground, teenagers
would improvise frontier hideaways and tree

00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:01.600
look outs, dare each other to cross, sneaking
west for day trips.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:05.560
But these crossings, again, did not make it
into official statistics.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:11.240
Iíve found a lot of these cases in the basement
of the Neustadt police archives, completely

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.510
neglected and who knows, perhaps slated for
destruction.

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:20.040
So Iíd like to suggest that while daring
escape stories of tunnels and homemade air

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:26.070
balloons dominated Western headlines, at least
as many crossings were not the considered

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:32.369
the attempts of people to try and flee tyranny
but the random exploits of local residents.

00:43:32.369 --> 00:43:38.550
So, in sum, I believe that this potential
for subversion suggests that the strength

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:45.200
of the iron curtain depended less upon its
physical defenses than, again, upon the accommodation

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:50.750
of border residents and this anticipatory
compliance.

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:56.640
So the ultimate fall of the Berlin Wall in
1989, I think, tells us something about what

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.350
helped sustain the iron curtain.

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:04.840
People had cumulatively feared and adjusted
to the iron curtain but when Gorbachev, Perestroika

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:10.860
and confusions in the East German leadership
made another reality seem possible on November

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.960
9th, 1989.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:18.849
The threshold of fear finally tipped and the
iron curtain unexpectedly collapsed.

00:44:18.849 --> 00:44:24.190
People walked to the Berlin Wall en masse
and assembled at check points, one of them

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:25.690
was here at the Behrenstrasse.

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:30.630
This is where the Berlin Wall first opened,
there was a crowd, there was an angry crowd

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:36.660
and border officials did not know what to
do and improvised and opened the Berlin Wall.

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.230
Thatís how the Berlin Wall fell.

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:41.510
There was a crowd that demanded it to be open.

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:48.200
And this, to me, suggests that the strength
of the iron curtain resided also within citizens

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.570
not just the concrete barriers.

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:57.340
So, to conclude, Iíve just given you a slice
of this research but I hope youíve gotten

00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:01.619
a sense for just how multilayered the iron
curtain actually was.

00:45:01.619 --> 00:45:07.910
This was no neat, tidy story of a monolithic
barrier, the story that we usually associate

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:09.740
with the Berlin Wall.

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:14.240
Rather, when you look at the full history
of the iron curtain, you see this jumble of

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.240
events.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:20.340
And although the vast majority of people did
not want this barrier, and this is the poignancy,

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:26.490
they wound up sustaining it through everyday
accommodations.

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:30.640
So I see three broader implications of this
story.

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:36.490
First it illustrates how geopolitical phenomena
are not just shaped by ideologies and state

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:40.490
powers but also by the people who live them.

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:45.250
I donít mean to deny the centrality of high
politics but this shows the intersection of

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:48.330
private choices and public events.

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:54.930
And Iím arguing for the geopolitical significance
of these small actions by everyday choices

00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:57.660
of ordinary people.

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:01.990
Second, Germany in the Cold War looked different
from this iron curtain.

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:06.210
Thereís the sense that Germany normalized
quickly after the third Reich.

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:11.270
West Germany became this model of Western
markets and democracy and the Berlin Wall

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:16.680
was a geopolitical tragedy that did not reflect
German society.

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:22.370
Iím not contending there is anything uniquely
German about the iron curtain, Iíd like to

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:26.550
be clear on this, but I do want to point out
that it did arise from a specific historical

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:27.860
context.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:34.720
After 12 years of Nazism in the third Reich,
6 years of war and foreign invasion, nervous

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:39.650
Germans came to enforce and accept border
against other Germans.

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:44.310
The barrier emerged from the Nazi past and
it remained tied to that past, it was called

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:49.180
the concentration camp wall in the West, it
was called an anti fascist defensive barrier

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:50.300
in the East.

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:56.230
And Germanyís post war development looks
a lot less peaceable from this iron curtain.

00:46:56.230 --> 00:47:00.960
Here was a belt of violence at the center
of Europe, a fault line between Communism

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:05.450
and capitalism, it was not at war but it was
also not at peace.

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:12.250
So, again, here you see the creating of difference
where there was no difference.

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:17.470
The institutionalization of violence among
neighbors and popular participation in a system

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:24.099
that was deeply unpopular, and, most shocking
to me, normalizing a monstrosity that is growing

00:47:24.099 --> 00:47:25.980
in your midst.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:32.090
And lastly, I think the story spotlights the
fragility of a society in crisis.

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:36.910
Enmeshed in a confusing chain of events where
outcomes are unclear and what the possibilities

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:38.540
of this are.

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:43.849
So the wall is not just a symbol of political
failure but also of social breakdown.

00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:50.420
And although Germans may wanna believe their
partition was made of iron, it was made of

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:53.640
something all too human; behavior and belief.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:57.339
This is why it was so quick to go up and so
quick to go down.

00:47:57.339 --> 00:48:03.240
And since the iron curtain is so often invoked
in debates about todayís walls such as in

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:12.250
the U.S. with Mexico and in the Middle East,
we should learn the lessons of its fortification.

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:17.060
Fortification was a short term response to
structural conflict that failed to solve underlying

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:21.190
problems and, as we see, created different
problems of its own.

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:28.610
It entrenched new forms of violence and magnified
divisions and it penetrated its society deeply.

00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:30.730
Micro steps can, indeed, have far reaching
results.

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:31.730
Thank you.

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:32.730
[Applause]

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:43.330
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So, if you have any questions
come on over to the mic cause weíre recording

00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:44.700
this.

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:56.290
&gt;&gt;female #1: So, I have a question about the
first phase in 1949 through 52.

00:48:56.290 --> 00:49:02.910
Did you get any sense from your interviews
or from your research about that fact that

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:04.750
people stayed because it was their home?

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:09.060
I mean, my house is here, my business is here,
my people are here, my familyís here, why

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.060
would I move?

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:13.600
Why would I go away?

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:18.430
Sort of motivating them to stay and not understanding
downstream the consequences of anything that

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:21.660
might happen out of that, can you say a little
bit more about that?

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:22.690
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: Yeah, absolutely.

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:27.170
And this, I think, speaks to the exact point;
nobody knew what was gonna happen.

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:31.170
And, so, when you talk, I assume youíre talking
about East Germans who stayed in Sonneberg

00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:33.020
and didnít go to the West.

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:38.010
Yeah, they would have a business, they would
have parents they were taking care of, they

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:42.040
would have a whole life, a whole community
where they were living and it wasnít clear

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.250
what was gonna happen.

00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:49.619
Many thought that this barrier was ridiculous
and it would be temporary and no one could

00:49:49.619 --> 00:49:52.540
imagine it could actually be permanent.

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:58.890
Then, ironically, as the border became stronger
and stronger it got harder to leave because

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:01.250
it implicated your relatives if you left.

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:05.280
They would pay the consequences in not being
able to attend universities or follow the

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.240
career of their choice.

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:13.140
So there were a lot of reasons that people
wound up staying and it was absolutely a very

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:14.230
complicated calculation.

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:20.540
And, as you said, in this early period it
was hard to know what was gonna happen.

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:27.869
&gt;&gt;male #1: I have a, first question, did the
formation of the wall and separation of the

00:50:27.869 --> 00:50:32.270
society change East Germany and West Germany
in ways other than the political system?

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:38.920
I had a German professor who said the language
was changing and what happened culturally

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:41.420
between the two halves because of the separation?

00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:45.260
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: Yeah and exactly as you say
itís amazing to me two different cultures

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.880
formed out of one formerly similar region.

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:51.530
And this happened in a variety of ways.

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:56.000
Germans talk about this famous wall in the
head, you may have heard about this, and people

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.040
say it still exists between East and West
Germans, thereís this wall in the head which

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.930
is not only a cultural divide but a mental
divide.

00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:08.430
Some people believe East and West Germans
walk differently, talk differently, have different

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:13.980
postures, eat different foods, think differently,
behave at work differently and these differences

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:16.720
persist twenty years after the wall.

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.010
How are they created?

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:23.160
Even something as simple as different brands
that you get in the supermarket create a sense

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:29.900
of identity and so some East German brands
that went out of business after the fall of

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:37.550
the wall have been reintroduced because there
was this "ostalgie" means East, nostalgia

00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:43.510
for these old brands and people felt this
loss of home because, you know, theyíve been

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:45.670
so enmeshed in this completely different culture.

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:46.670
So, yeah.

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:48.730
&gt;&gt;male #1: I have one more comment.

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:51.440
I happened to have seen three of these walls
in 1973

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.440
[Laughs]

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.440
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: Great.

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:57.920
&gt;&gt;male #1: I crossed the wall from Hamburg
to Berlin and then we came back on the Autobahn.

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:03.869
I was at the Brandenburg Gate and I swear
to God that we walked up on a sunny day and

00:52:03.869 --> 00:52:08.849
instantly dust and the winds and the clouds
came over and I felt more scared than Iíve

00:52:08.849 --> 00:52:10.550
ever felt before.

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:13.740
Walking around the campground we didnít have
any money we were camping, we came to this

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:17.210
sign in Russian, French and English saying
youíre now leaving the American zone.

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:20.011
And I went, well I wonít say exactly what
I said, but

00:52:20.011 --> 00:52:24.570
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;male #1: Oh my God, then I crossed the border

00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:30.930
into Mexico to build houses to Tijuana and
had very much the same feeling, standing on

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:36.400
both sides of that wall seeing what was written
on one side versus nothing on the American

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:43.690
side except, well the, and then this year
Iíve been to Palestine crossing from Jerusalem

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:52.550
to Bethlehem and seeing that, my question
is how do societies cope with separations

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:56.520
like this where people cannot meet each other
day to day basis and is it worse than things

00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:05.230
like apartheid or the discrimination system
in the United States where people were separated

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:09.790
by culture but met on a day to day basis?

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:11.369
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: wow.

00:53:11.369 --> 00:53:14.390
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: Yeah, youíve just made a

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:16.970
lot of really interesting linkages between
different phenomenonís.

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:21.900
Iím not sure I can synthesize everything
that youíre saying but youíre stimulating

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:24.310
a lot of interesting ideas.

00:53:24.310 --> 00:53:30.390
I think one thing that happened with division
in Germany that maybe isnít happening when

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:36.060
you have systems of apartheid or discrimination
is that you can romanticize the other size

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:41.630
and ascribe greater similarities or connections
than might actually exist.

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:46.460
So I think, unlike situations of difference
where youíre constantly bumping into the

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:51.380
other when you have an other thatís distant,
itís possible to imagine these connections

00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:55.770
and then in the case of Germany what happened
is that you have this romance that I think

00:53:55.770 --> 00:54:00.070
gets wildly disappointed when the two sides
are united again.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:07.869
And, so, yeah Iím not sure to what extent
this might hold for others cases of partition

00:54:07.869 --> 00:54:14.270
but, you know, I think as we think about what
might happen in Korea, you know, people are

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:19.970
already saying we should be cognizant of the
German example and what might happen, it might

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:21.780
not all be as rosy as we might expect.

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.180
These walls in the head may very well still
exist.

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:28.670
So, I think itís trickier when you get to
situations like the U.S. Mexican border and

00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:35.010
this security fence in the Middle East because
is there, was that a cohesive community to

00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:36.010
begin with?

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:39.290
Yeah, so, yeah but thank you.

00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:43.220
&gt;&gt;female #2: Yeah, actually that goes really
well with the question I was gonna ask about

00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:50.030
how this internalized duality seemed to define
citizenship as it was, or as it was experienced

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:55.869
by East and West Germans and I was gonna ask
the rate at which you saw that or which Germans

00:54:55.869 --> 00:55:00.320
saw that decline following the collapse of
the walls, which I guess you kind of spoke

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:04.830
to in your answer to the last question but
my follow up question would be to what extent,

00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:09.190
this is a generational experience weíre in,
folks born in the early 80s or late 80s or

00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:13.290
even 90s have no idea what some of these older
folks or members of their family are talking

00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:14.530
about when they speak of these things.

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:15.530
Like, walls in the head.

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:16.530
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: Yeah.

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:17.690
No, thatís a great question, too.

00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:23.390
So, I mean, if I get what youíre asking what
are the variables that are determining to

00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:29.230
what extent people still feel this disconnection
and a lot does have to do with generation

00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:30.230
but not all.

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:35.109
I think a lot depends on where you live, what
your socioeconomic status is, to what extent

00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:40.260
do you have your self opportunities and if
you donít, what extent might you blame that

00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:42.570
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Edith Sheffer: On the cause of people living

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:43.849
on the other side.

00:55:43.849 --> 00:55:49.030
So, whereas, if youíre young and in Berlin
you might have a very different outlook.

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:54.990
If you live in border region I studied, tensions
are rampant if anything, things are more tense

00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:58.150
than they were before the wall fell down.

00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:01.610
And, in fact, these identities have been inherited.

00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:08.031
So there was a poll a few years ago of teenagers
who had no living experience with the iron

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:14.829
curtain, they were all born after 1989 and
only 35 percent said they would readily date

00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:17.790
someone who lived in the opposite town.

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:24.099
So, and then when you poll their parents which
is what I did, you get these amazing biases

00:56:24.099 --> 00:56:28.820
about would you be okay with your child marrying
the child of someone born on the other side?

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:35.030
And I think only 56 percent of Westerners
said they would be okay with that and if you

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:40.800
can imagine an American being so open about
expressing that degree of prejudice thatís

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:41.920
rather interesting.

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:46.660
So I think the answer is in some pockets of
Germany, maybe in sort of a more depressed

00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:51.849
region like I studied thatís right on top
of these frictions, you get these inherited

00:56:51.849 --> 00:56:57.170
animosities but I think the real positive
thing is in the younger generation and these

00:56:57.170 --> 00:57:00.750
major urban centers the story looks very different.

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:02.160
[Pause]

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:07.820
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Okay, Thank you.

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:09.240
[Applause]
