00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: We are joined today by
chefs Anita Lo and April Bloomfield.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.889
Anita Lo is the chef and owner of Annisa,
which opened in 2000, right nearby in Greenwich

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:10.889
Village.

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.259
She appeared on "Top Chef Masters," finishing
in the final four of "24 Chefs."

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.510
And Chef Lo released her first cookbook, "Cooking
Without Borders," in October of 2011.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.990
And April Bloomfield is the executive chef
and co-owner of the Michelin-starred The Spotted

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.920
Pig, The Breslin, and the John Dory restaurants.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.970
She released her first cookbook, "A Girl and
Her Pig" in April of this year.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.010
Please join me in welcoming chefs Anita Lo
and April Bloomfield.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.700
[applause]

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.880
Well, thank you so much for being here at
Google.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.340
I was telling some friends about this panel
over the weekend.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.850
And interestingly, a few people asked me,
they're like, "Oh, so you're doing a panel

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.900
on women chefs."

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.290
I was like, "Well, no.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.610
We're doing a panel with a few chefs who happen
to be women."

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.980
And if people are wondering why did we bring
you in together, it was a few reasons.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.270
I mean, there's other reasons to bring you
in beside the fact that you're both amazing

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.909
chefs, that you have incredible cookbooks
that have come out that I hope many of you

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.060
have been able to buy and enjoy.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.590
You also have restaurants in the neighborhood
right nearby Google's offices, which I hope

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.560
to be able to get a table anytime I want.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.630
So, there's always that secret agenda in all
of our charading here at Google.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.740
And also, you happen to be great friends.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.700
So, we thought that would just be a really
great conversation.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.079
But I thought it really raised an interesting
question about gender in the kitchen and the

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.090
fact that people would react that way and
say, "Oh, it's a panel of women chefs."

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.920
Because if we had two guys up here, they wouldn't
say, "Well, it's a panel of male chefs."

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.070
And I was wondering, well I imagine you get
that a lot as two of the women at the forefront

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.969
of your industries.

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.829
How do you react to that when people say,
"Well, we'd like you on a panel on women chefs."

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.869
If I was calling this panel skirt steak, would
that change your approach to coming?

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:50.869
[laughter]

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.569
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: I don't know.

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.850
I don't know.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.819
I don't think about the men and women thing
very much.

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:06.600
I just do my thing and I just, Anita being
here as my friend.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.060
I don't see Anita as a woman.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.060
I do, but sorry.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.060
[laughter]

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.570
I didn't mean it like that.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.010
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: She always has these quips about
me.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.830
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: But I just don't think
about it.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.060
So, actually when you said that, I was like,
"Oh.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.060
Ok."

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.300
Now I'm thinking about it, but--.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.810
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: I think I've been forced to think
about it.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.080
We're constantly being asked like, about,
'cause we're such a minority.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.700
And just constantly being asked about it.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.170
And I think it's an interesting question.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.830
It's something, it's something, it's something
to think about.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:49.140
Yes, you always wanna just be a chef and be
recognized as a chef, as a good chef.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.570
But at the same time, there is that discrepancy.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.930
And it's interesting to think about why.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.860
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Well, I would love to
know about how you each got interested in

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.800
cooking, if you can just tell us a little
bit about that.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.570
Sort of, your journey.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.070
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: You can go.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.152
[laughs] I don't know.

00:03:10.152 --> 00:03:11.540
I came from a food obsessed family.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.480
We ate a lot of Chinese, which is if you're
Chinese, pretty much you're food obsessed.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.640
We were always talking about the next meal
and traveling just to go eat something.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.310
And yeah.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.210
I just always loved food.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.260
And I was trying to learn how to cook for
myself in college.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.930
And I just became obsessed with it.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:44.270
And I was studying French at the time in order
to immerse myself in the language.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.610
I went to France.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.360
And I ended up falling in love with that culture.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.890
And ended up going to cooking school there.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.400
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Well, my mother wasn't
a very good cook.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.900
So, I needed to learn to cook I think as a
way to survive.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.380
But my, if your mom's a bad cook, you'll understand.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.010
But I really went to school because I didn't
get into my chosen profession, which I wanted

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.000
to do, which was to be a police woman in the
Metropolitan Police Force.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.599
So, I had to do something to fall back on.

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.469
And my two sisters at the time were at cooking
school.

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:29.979
So, I just, I was like three weeks away from
leaving school and my mom sat me down and

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.530
was like, "What are you gonna do?"

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.550
So, I said, "Well, maybe I'll just cook, do
two years, and then maybe reapply for the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.550
police force."

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.289
And fortunately, that didn't happen.

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:47.780
Fortunately, I've had a great journey getting
where I am and yeah.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.780
That's how it all started.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.590
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, I'm glad you didn't
become part of a police force.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.520
I think everybody here would agree.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.550
The Spotted Pig was a much better choice.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.499
So, how did you actually find yourself at
The Spotted Pig?

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:00.830
That's a pretty interesting partnership with
Mario Batali and Ken Friedman.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.699
And I think a lot of people may not know that--

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:03.699
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Right.

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.699
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: that the three of you
are in that together.

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.090
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Basically, I was working
in a restaurant in England called the River

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.009
Cafe--fantastic place.

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:13.729
I really enjoyed working there.

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.949
If I hadn't got this opportunity in New York,
I'd probably still be there now.

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:19.949
But yeah.

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:20.949
I was working there.

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:21.999
I'd gone as far as I could.

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:28.379
And I got this call from a guy called Ken
Friedman, who is now my business partner at

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.190
The Spotted Pig.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.100
And he invited me over for a weekend.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:39.259
And I came over, met Mario Batali, ate in
like, ten restaurants in two days, wobbled

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:44.370
back on the plane after a huge meal.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.400
And yeah, I took the jump.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.070
And I'm really happy to be here.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.070
I love New York.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.879
Love the people, food.

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:56.030
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Well, you have this incredible
knack, it seems, for opening these off the

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.629
beaten path little places that become real
destinations.

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:00.759
Can you tell us a little bit about how that
happened?

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:05.699
Was that Mario Batali and Ken Friedman knowing
the neighborhoods and deciding this was where

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.879
we needed the Gastro Pub in the West Village?

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:12.069
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Well, it helped that Ken
lived opposite The Spotted Pig.

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:16.300
So, that worked 'cause he knew that area.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:23.559
But we've just opened a restaurant two years
ago called The Breslin on 29th and Broadway.

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:24.559
And that was a risk.

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:26.939
So, none of us knew that area very well.

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:35.509
But we got this great opportunity to work
with Ace Hotel and Alex, who is the founder

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.849
of the Ace Hotel brand.

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:43.150
And we just took a leap of faith and we felt
like it would work.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.370
And thank God it did.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.060
And opened another restaurant right there,
too.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.289
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: What about Annisa?

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.159
Can you tell us a little bit about how that
came to be?

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:56.469
It's been open now over ten years, twelve
years.

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:59.460
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: Twelve years.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:05.240
Well, I had been the chef of a restaurant
called Mirezi on 5th Avenue.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.169
And it was a restaurant that didn't survive.

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:14.090
And I was doing Pan Asian cuisine there.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:20.520
And I realized that I really wanted to just
do Contemporary American.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.319
I didn't wanna be defined by that.

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:25.749
And, 'cause that's really who I am.

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:28.589
I've been all over.

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:34.010
I grew up in the Midwest.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.180
So, and I'm French trained.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:44.080
So, I realized that in order to get full creative
freedom, I needed to open my place.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.080
And yeah.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.439
So, I met my partner--my business partner--Jen.

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:53.190
Had been my sous chef a long time ago.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:58.619
And we got together and found this little
place in the West Village.

00:07:58.619 --> 00:07:59.819
Made it happen.

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:01.009
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: OK.

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:05.180
Well, so Annisa tragically suffered a pretty
major fire a few years ago.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.479
And during that time, you went on "Top Chef
Masters," which is being discussed as, you're

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:12.749
number four, which is pretty amazing.

00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:17.360
How did that experience change your life or
your cooking?

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:23.189
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: Actually, we filmed "Top Chef
Masters" before the fire.

00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:25.819
And it actually aired like, two weeks after
the fire.

00:08:25.819 --> 00:08:31.559
So, it was kind of doubly tragic 'cause I
thought I would miss that whole wave of publicity

00:08:31.559 --> 00:08:35.279
and driving business to the restaurant.

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:36.709
We were closed for nine months.

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:43.229
I thought I had lost the restaurant on three
occasions just because it took forever to

00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:45.990
get the insurance money.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.589
And then, the insurance money wasn't enough.

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:52.440
And also, at the time, we had to renegotiate
our lease.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.930
So, yeah.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.240
It was really hard.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.389
I came back.

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:01.880
I don't think it changed my cooking.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.510
I think I'm still cooking the same way.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.810
It made me appreciate my restaurant more.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:12.550
It made me appreciate my staff.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:17.649
Every single one of my staff came back to
open that restaurant except for one.

00:09:17.649 --> 00:09:19.160
And so, I just was so grateful.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.899
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: That's incredible.

00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:25.060
Do you feel that "Top Chef Masters" and being
on that show has changed anything?

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.250
I mean, you said that you couldn't ride the
wave of that publicity in terms of the actual

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.250
restaurant.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.250
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: Oh, my gosh.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.250
Yeah.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.440
I mean, business is, people are still coming
in from it.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.149
It's so interesting because it aired so long
ago.

00:09:39.149 --> 00:09:40.680
And I guess it keeps re-airing.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.570
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: It's good to get that
second wave.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:44.860
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: Yeah.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.320
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And April, have you ever
thought about competing on a show like that?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.320
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: No.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.560
I'm not a very competitive person.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:59.949
I just, I like to just do what I do and just
hope that people like it.

00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:05.620
And I don't like that competitive energy that
you get.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.680
No.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.680
Not really.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.959
I did "Iron Chef" once and I didn't know whether
I should do it or not, so I asked my staff.

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:14.720
I said, "Look, what shall I do it?"

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.910
And they went like, "Yeah.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:16.910
Do it."

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:22.279
But when I got there on the day, I was like,
super nervous just like now actually.

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:28.280
So, I was a complete wreck and I got to the
kitchen stadium.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.839
And it was pretty daunting.

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:33.850
But then I saw my staff walk in to sit down.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.780
And I was like, "Oh, I can't do this."

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.820
I was about to like, run out the door.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.920
Anyway, I managed to focus.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:46.829
It's funny how when you start cooking, it's
very natural so you feel comfortable and you

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:48.779
get to this place where you're happy.

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:55.459
So, that, as soon as the timer went off, it
was like, it was almost like meditating.

00:10:55.459 --> 00:10:57.839
It was like, "OK, this is what I have to do."

00:10:57.839 --> 00:11:00.200
So, actually, I won.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:07.139
I managed to kick Michael Symon's butt on
olives and he's Greek.

00:11:07.139 --> 00:11:08.139
[applause]

00:11:08.139 --> 00:11:14.212
But I was very happy after it was finished.

00:11:14.212 --> 00:11:18.370
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And it just ends on a
high note, just to be able to say I won.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:19.370
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Yeah.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:20.970
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, talking about the
books.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.029
You both obviously have these incredible books
that just came out somewhat recently.

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:27.490
And I was wondering if you could tell us a
little bit about the inspiration for each

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:28.490
of your books.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.170
[April Bloomfield clears throat]

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:36.389
The pig, obviously, for Chef April was a big
inspiration since you're swathed in that massive

00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:37.389
beast.

00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:38.389
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Yeah.

00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:39.569
I mean, I love everything pork.

00:11:39.569 --> 00:11:46.420
But the inspiration was pretty much, there's
a lot of people that go through life that

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:51.779
don't acknowledge where they've learnt stuff
or who they've been influenced by.

00:11:51.779 --> 00:11:55.029
And I definitely didn't want to be or become
one of those people.

00:11:55.029 --> 00:12:02.200
So, it was like a nod and a thank you to the
people that I've learnt from and pretty much

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.440
inspired me and made me the person I am and
the chef I am.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.560
So, that was my vision for the book.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.670
And hopefully that comes across.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.300
I didn't wanna just do a restaurant book.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.129
So, this was kind of personal for me to do.

00:12:20.129 --> 00:12:28.319
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: I've been wanting to write this
book for almost two decades.

00:12:28.319 --> 00:12:30.250
I was turned down by agents.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:35.870
I went to three different agents.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:41.120
And the reason why I wanted to write this
book was 'cause it was about identity and

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:49.090
it was about what it means to be American
and how do you define an American cuisine.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:54.800
And I think a lot of people just didn't understand
what that was and didn't understand what Contemporary

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.440
American cuisine was.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:02.550
And I think a lot of people see me as just
Asian 'cause it's just obvious.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:07.330
But culturally, I'm very diverse.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.120
And I wanted to get that across in this book.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.290
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: That's great.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.100
So, what are each of your favorite recipes
in your books?

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.370
[Anita Lo laughs]

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.509
You have to pick one of your children.

00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:21.730
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: You have to stand by all of them
I think.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:22.730
Yeah.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.440
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Is there one that you
would recommend that Googlers try in their

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.040
tiny New York kitchens?

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.540
We don't have a staff.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.490
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: I love my Nannie's chicken paprikash.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:33.490
I grew up with that.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.540
I think it was one of the most delicious things
growing up.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.800
And it is so easy to make.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.300
It's a great, maybe not now, but it's a great
winter dish.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.670
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: I think oatmeal, if you
guys like oatmeal.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:51.019
I'm very passionate about my oatmeal, porridge.

00:13:51.019 --> 00:13:52.930
You should definitely try that.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.829
It's super easy actually.

00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:58.480
And it takes like 25 minutes to cook.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.839
Just start it on a cold, crisp morning before
you venture off to the office.

00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:05.839
It's like perfect.

00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:08.680
And actually, you can make it and then reheat
it the next day, too.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.470
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Have you cooked with each
others books?

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.860
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: I haven't.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:13.860
No.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.470
It's a fallacy that chefs cook at home.

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.870
I haven't managed to cook anything yet.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.520
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, Chef Lo, you mentioned
your Nannie's paprikash.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:28.149
And I was surprised to read about Hungarian
influence in your cuisine, not because I didn't

00:14:28.149 --> 00:14:34.600
know about your global influences, but that
was an unexpected influence from my perspective

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.810
in reading more about your work.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:43.810
And I'm curious if there's other unexpected
influences in your work, in your cooking.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:54.330
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: I think it's interesting that
I think Japanese cuisine is probably the biggest

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:59.790
influence from Asia that I have in my book.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.649
I know very little about Chinese cuisine.

00:15:01.649 --> 00:15:06.649
I'm constantly being asked to represent that.

00:15:06.649 --> 00:15:11.970
And I love Chinese cuisine, but it's like
a vast country.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.910
There's so many different cuisines within
it.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:21.629
And growing up not speaking the language,
my parents didn't teach me Chinese because

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:27.449
it was the '60s and they wanted me to assimilate.

00:15:27.449 --> 00:15:33.959
So, a lot of the names of dishes are all Chinese
and they're really just about the ingredient.

00:15:33.959 --> 00:15:37.249
So, it's a hard study.

00:15:37.249 --> 00:15:38.249
Yeah.

00:15:38.249 --> 00:15:43.990
I don't know if that's, I have a lot of influences.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.190
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: What about you?

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:52.459
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: I think my influences
come from mostly Europe, a little bit of Spanish,

00:15:52.459 --> 00:15:58.910
a lot of Italian, 'cause I was very influenced
by Rose and Ruth from The River Cafe.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:04.459
So, I do things that are quite layered and
rustic.

00:16:04.459 --> 00:16:10.850
So, lots of pan roasting and slow roasting,
pot roasting, all that kind of stuff.

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:13.759
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, what challenges you
now?

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:19.750
I mean, you have three restaurants now and
you've conquered "Top Chef Masters" and you

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.960
both are at the pinnacles of your career.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.700
What really inspires and challenges each of
you in your work now?

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:30.480
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Just to keep pushing,
keep motivating myself, learning new things.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.980
Traveling is a big influence on me.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:41.100
So, making sure that I get different flavors
and meet different people and eat different

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.100
food.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.920
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: Yeah, managing is always hard.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:49.660
I mean, I think that's probably the biggest
challenge on a day to day basis.

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:56.730
You always want your staff to be happy and
to be motivated.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.790
I still love to cook.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:04.560
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I guess I have a few fill
in the blanks for you.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.990
Just gonna give you a little phrase and ask
you just to finish my sentence for me.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.990
Ready?

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:11.110
Why are you laughing at me?

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:13.160
I haven't even started yet.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.160
OK.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.160
Ready?

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.160
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Right.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.180
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Nose to tail eating is--.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:21.780
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Good for your tummy.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.780
[laughter]

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.890
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Fusion cooking is--.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:32.330
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: Fusion cooking is yeah, delicious.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:35.030
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Junk food is--.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:39.110
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Delicious in moderation.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.120
[laughter]

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.970
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Food bloggers are--.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.080
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Lovely people.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.220
[laughter]

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.120
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: My favorite thing about
New York City is--.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.360
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: Diversity.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.390
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: The weather.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.170
I like the weather.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.190
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: You're coming out of London.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:01.980
A food trend I hate is--.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:06.320
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: There are no food trends that
I hate.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.320
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Yeah.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.940
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: A food trend I love is--.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.760
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Meatballs.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:13.760
I like meatballs.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.830
Who doesn't like meatballs?

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:15.830
[laughter]

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:19.000
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: That's kind of like a
trend.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Food trucks are--.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.250
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: I'm not answering that one.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.240
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Hey, you guys have a food
truck here.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.240
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: We do.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.240
We do.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.029
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: And it goes, it drives.

00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:34.280
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: It just drives to the
office.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.280
No, it doesn't really.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.440
It just stays in one place.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.870
It's more cosmetic, but I think it does function.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:39.370
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Yeah, I think it does,
yeah.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:41.760
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: But we don't take it on
the streets.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.320
It pretty much stays here.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.320
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Yeah.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.320
It looked very clean.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.370
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: It's very clean.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:47.600
Reality chef competitions are--.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.110
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: Stressful.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:54.780
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: I was gonna say the same
thing and I haven't done a competition.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:55.809
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Well, you did do one.

00:18:55.809 --> 00:18:56.870
Iron Chef.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:57.870
OK.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:02.570
So I have a few other rapid fires and we'll
open it up to the audience for questions.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.100
So, what do you eat when no one is looking?

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.660
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Chocolate.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.290
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: An entire bag of Doritos.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:11.290
[laughter]

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.200
Did I say that?

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.450
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: What is your favorite
restaurant that people should know about?

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:20.860
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Maialino in Gramercy Park.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.830
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: What should they order
there?

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:26.320
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: They should have the lumaconi,
the stuffed lumaconi.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.200
He does it with broccoli rabe and sausage.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.200
And it's just the most divine thing.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.340
And they're like this big and you can pop
the whole one in your mouth.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.340
It's delicious.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.340
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Nice.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.470
What do you eat when you're in the walk-in?

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.890
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Fruit.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.310
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: Yeah.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:44.930
Raw scallops.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:49.090
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Just pop them in like
candy?

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:50.940
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: To each his own.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.340
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: If I came to your house
for dinner--I'm not angling for an invitation.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.991
I'm free Thursday in case you're wondering.

00:19:56.991 --> 00:19:59.710
What would you make?

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.440
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Pasta.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.440
Yeah.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.580
With a bit of pig face and a little bit of
gravy.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.520
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Pasta and pig face.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.130
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: I don't know.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:11.130
Roast chicken.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.880
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: What do you cook to impress
your mom?

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:18.830
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Anything will impress
my mom.

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:19.830
[laughter]

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:20.830
Sorry, Mom.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.370
I'm just kidding.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:23.549
I'm kidding.

00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:26.270
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: What's in your fridge
right now?

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.250
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: Lots of condiments.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.630
Lots and lots of condiments.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.270
Beer, sake, and--.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:37.679
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Lots of condiments.

00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:40.792
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: The bottle of wine you brought
over last night.

00:20:40.792 --> 00:20:43.510
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I sense a theme.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:49.220
Well, I would love to open it up to questions
from the audience.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:53.429
And we have two mics set up and we are recording
for YouTube, so if you could go to one of

00:20:53.429 --> 00:20:57.380
the mics that would be great.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.380
[pause]

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.020
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Hi.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:06.850
So, I just wanted to say I do love The Spotted
Pig and if there's a special way to get reservations,

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.779
I'd love it.

00:21:08.779 --> 00:21:12.600
So I noticed that both of your cookbooks,
you each had co-authors.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:20.270
I'm curious if you could comment on like how
that plays in and where the roles divide and

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:23.190
what it's like writing with someone.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:24.570
Are they professional chefs?

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.500
Are you getting them more for the writing?

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.350
That sort of thing.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:33.160
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: I tried to write my own book for
two decades and then I realized I didn't have

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.160
time.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.630
It took me two decades.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:46.060
But I wrote maybe a quarter to a third of
it and then I sat down with my author for,

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:55.210
once a week and tap out recipes and etc.,
and came up with headnotes for that, for each

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.309
recipe that way.

00:21:58.309 --> 00:21:59.600
It was a lovely experience.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.400
Charlotte Druckman is an incredible writer.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.630
She is incredibly smart and is very knowledgeable
about food.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:10.760
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: I am the same as Anita.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:15.610
I don't think I would have never attempted
to write a cookbook without J.J.

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.960
He was a great partner to have.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.090
He loved to eat, which was really a great
thing.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.429
He could eat all my recipe testing.

00:22:24.429 --> 00:22:26.220
But he's a great writer.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.510
And he really captured my voice.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:29.640
We worked well.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.480
It was pretty much like a marriage.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:40.110
We spent a lot of time together and enjoyed
it so much, we're gonna do another book, which

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.110
is great.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.180
So, we're in that process now.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.110
And it's just, yeah.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:49.010
We feel really good together and we're like
good buddies.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:52.570
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: What's the theme of the
next book?

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.560
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Can anybody guess?

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.560
Vegetables.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.560
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Nice.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.560
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: That's awesome.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.560
I can't wait for this.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.400
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: You'll be draped in carrots
and beets.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.960
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Yes.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.960
Yeah.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.190
We were thinking of having like, a big beet
root or something.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:09.520
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Hi.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.700
Thank you both for coming.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.620
So, April, I'm engaged to a man from Yorkshire.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.710
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Oh, you did?

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:18.100
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I did do it.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.100
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Lovely.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.680
&gt;&gt;Female #1: And thank you very much for offering
a full English breakfast at The Breslin.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.690
We frequent that very often.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:29.920
So, the times when Russell is really missing
home and missing England, what can I make

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.210
from the book that might help that?

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.809
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: That's a good question.

00:23:35.809 --> 00:23:39.130
What do I have in there that's--?

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:40.130
Let's see.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:41.130
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I flipped through it.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:42.320
I saw a few little English things in there.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.669
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Can you remind--.

00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:44.669
Devils.

00:23:44.669 --> 00:23:45.669
Devils on Horseback.

00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:47.529
Now I've forgotten what's in my book.

00:23:47.529 --> 00:23:50.930
But Devils on Horseback, they're very classic
English.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:57.090
It's basically a re-hydrated prune that we
rehydrate in English breakfast tea.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.170
Can't get more English than that.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.659
And then, it's stuffed with a pickled pear
and then it's wrapped in bacon.

00:24:02.659 --> 00:24:06.409
And then, you just toast it under the broiler
until it gets all crispy.

00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:08.179
And caramel iced.

00:24:08.179 --> 00:24:12.820
The porridge, very English, too.

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.000
What else?

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.470
The meat pie, yeah.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:23.649
The beef and Stilton pie, actually, is a very
classic English dish.

00:24:23.649 --> 00:24:26.200
Delicious, very easy to make.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.200
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I'll get on it.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.200
Thank you so much.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.200
And then, real quick, I need--.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.750
I don't know if you know, but Taco Bell came
out with this Dorito thing.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:33.750
[laughter]

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:34.899
I don't know.

00:24:34.899 --> 00:24:35.899
I haven't tried it yet.

00:24:35.899 --> 00:24:36.899
It's like your number one thing.

00:24:36.899 --> 00:24:38.440
So, I need to tell you about it.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.440
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: I was intrigued.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.440
I saw that.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.260
I saw the commercial and I was totally thinking.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.870
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: It sounds amazing.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.429
I'm not gonna lie.

00:24:45.429 --> 00:24:46.600
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: Yeah.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.159
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: It's tempting.

00:24:48.159 --> 00:24:50.299
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Thanks again for being here.

00:24:50.299 --> 00:24:53.669
It's really inspirational to have you here
and to listen to all of your stories.

00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:58.250
I was wondering, other than the cookbook for
you April, is there anything else on the horizon

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:02.730
for either of you that you're able to share
with us today?

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:03.799
[pause]

00:25:03.799 --> 00:25:09.860
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: I think there's a few
projects in the work but nothing that I can

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:10.860
divulge, unfortunately.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.539
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: We won't tell anyone.

00:25:12.539 --> 00:25:14.159
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Yeah, I know.

00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:15.380
But yeah.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.340
Hopefully, they'll pan out and be exciting.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.550
I'm very excited about the projects.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:22.970
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And you'll come back and
tell us all about them?

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:23.970
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Oh, yes.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.549
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And then we can put it
out there.

00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:32.380
Anita, do you have anything else coming up
that's on the horizon that you could share?

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.769
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: Not at the moment.

00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:40.940
I'm focusing on this, I just bought out my
partner in the past two years and I'm focusing

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.940
on Annisa.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.240
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Thank you.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.100
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Again, thank you for being here.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.659
Chef Lo, I know when you were on "Top Chef
Masters" you did that for charity.

00:25:51.659 --> 00:25:57.250
And I know that you've also done some, you've
been at various charitable events with your

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.090
cooking, like The Garden Party, which is tonight.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:03.980
Can you talk a little bit about philanthropy
and what motivates you?

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.980
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: I think food is always about sharing.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:16.340
And it's just a shame that it's not being
distributed to everybody.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:22.660
It's, so a lot of the food charities are very
important to me.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:29.070
I was the executive chef for the first year,
first two years, of Walk Around Tasting that

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:34.250
we're gonna be doing in September for SHARE,
which is a breast and ovarian cancer support

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.500
group.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.950
And it's a wonderful event and I hope you'll
all buy tickets.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:45.460
It's the third Monday in September, I believe.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:53.630
And it's at Chelsea Piers and it's all women
chefs cooking to raise money for this.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.409
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Thank you.

00:26:56.409 --> 00:26:59.890
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Any more questions?

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:00.890
Great.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:02.649
Well, thank you both so much for being here.

00:27:02.649 --> 00:27:03.649
This is really--.

00:27:03.649 --> 00:27:04.649
&gt;&gt;April Bloomfield: Thank you.

00:27:04.649 --> 00:27:05.649
&gt;&gt;Anita Lo: Thank you so much.

00:27:05.649 --> 00:27:05.650
[applause]
