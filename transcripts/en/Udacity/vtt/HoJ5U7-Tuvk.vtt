00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.750
&gt;&gt; Okay, so inheritability it deals with the difference in height and how

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.140
much of that variation is genetic but how do we figure that out?

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.290
&gt;&gt; I thought you might ask that question. So I

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.370
asked my friend Taylor to come in and help us out.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.010
&gt;&gt; If you want to find out whether or not

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.300
a trait is influenced more by genetics or more by

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.210
environment, then you need to find a pair of people

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.000
who are identical. And see if they both have that trait.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.410
&gt;&gt; So, you mean like twins.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.910
&gt;&gt; Identical twins to be exact.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.630
&gt;&gt; Oh wow, you creeped me out.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.680
&gt;&gt; We get that.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.130
&gt;&gt; A lot.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.680
&gt;&gt; Identical twins are actually a really

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.970
useful tool for scientists to determine heritablity.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.180
&gt;&gt; But aren't there different types of twins?

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.550
&gt;&gt; Well there are. there are identical and there're fraternal

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.470
twins. We also refer to them as Monozygotic and Dizygotic.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.730
&gt;&gt; Wait mono what?

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.253
&gt;&gt; Monozygotic and dizygotic.

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:45.775
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:50.480
&gt;&gt; Monozygotic means that they came from same fertilized egg or zygote.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.810
Dizygotic means in a came from two different fertilized eggs or two different

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.092
zygotes. So genetically identical twins, do you

00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:03.460
think they would be dizygotic or monozygotic?
