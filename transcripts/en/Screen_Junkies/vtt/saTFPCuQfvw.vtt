00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.500
After seven King Kong movies,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.980
a new film will take the giant ape
in a brand new direction.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.980
What if...
Now bear with me,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.600
what if there was a King Kong movie,
but it was also...

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.180
The 70's? Huhhh?

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.620
Strap in for a period piece more retro than a Vietnam vet
blasting Black Sabbath on a reel-to-reel tape player.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.200
"(Black Sabbath music)"

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.500
In a monster flick that for once delivers
on the giant monster battles,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.700
but also tries to be an extended metaphor
for the Vietnam War.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.660
Where Skull Island is Nam...

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.900
Sam Jackson is the U.S....

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.760
Kong is the Viet Cong...

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.980
The giant lizards are uhh...
The South Vietnamese...

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.860
And Tom Hiddleston katana fighting
Dino-Birds is uhh...

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.780
You know what? I'm totally lost.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.300
Let's just watch the ape hit the dragon
with a boat propeller.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.180
"(screeches)"

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.140
Woohoo!

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.780
Suit up with Monarch, a company devoted
to launching a giant monster movie franchise. (YAY GODZILLA!)

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.280
"We specialize in the hunt
for massive organisms."

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.180
They'll travel to an island that's been
isolated since prehistoric times.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.580
A Jurassic World if you will...

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.060
Minus all the cheap nostalgia.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.900
A place where everything
that can go Kong,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.000
will go Kong.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.040
(ROMAN REIGNS WITH A SUPERMAN PUNCH)

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.400
Setting up a mad dash to turn this monster
into a sympathetic character

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.580
before he fights Godzilla in the sequel.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.440
Awww, he's not so bad.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.900
I mean, his parents are dead.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.180
So... He's basically Gorilla Batman, right?

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.820
Remember that time he helped that yak?

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.220
Get ready for a brand new version
of pop culture's best non-Donkey Kong.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.840
Complete with WWE wrestling moves...

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.540
Jungle parkour skills...

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.760
And the inexplicable ability
to sneak up on you

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.000
like a ninja.
(It's cos he's black)

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.140
He's a 100 foot tall ape.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.080
Why does no one see
or hear him coming? (That's what she said)

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.000
And shouldn't half the island be wrecked
from Kong just walking around?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.400
Jordan Vogt-Roberts: Really, guys?
This is the best you've got?

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.960
Huh? Who is that?

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.980
Oh, no, it's Skull Island director,
Jordan Vogt-Roberts! (what a beard)

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.700
Hello there.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.620
I should've known if we criticized
your movie long enough, you'd appear.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.580
Look, you guys can criticize
my movie all you want.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.700
All I ask is if you do it,
have some f*****g merit to it.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.880
You didn't let me finish though.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.420
I had a whole section ready on
King Kong's missing Ding Dong.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.900
It was golden! 
- Really?

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.180
The "Where's the Dick" joke again?

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.780
As if you didn't already do that
in the Honest Trailer for Zootopia,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.160
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,
and somehow Fantastic Four...

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.560
- Yeah! Well, it's... satire? 
- No, it's not.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.220
Satire is not bankruptcy.
You cannot just declare it.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.860
Relax, dude. It's just a joke.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.080
(footage of Loki meeting a Nova Corps General and sharing a good laugh, 1976, colourised)

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.200
Love film criticism.
It's an important part of this artform.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.740
But you want to know
who my biggest critic is? Me.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.500
You wanna know everything f*****g
wrong with Kong: Skull Island? I will f*****g tell you.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.000
Let's see here...

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.620
'Skull Island Honest Trailer 
by Jordan Vogt-Roberts'?

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.300
Ok... Here we go...

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.940
Try to enjoy a movie
with major structural problems.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.820
That spends the whole first act
bringing the cast together.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.320
Only to split everyone apart
10 minutes later...

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.140
That was going for the
emotional simplicity of Aliens.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.040
But ended up with the complexity
of Alien VS Predator. (GAME OVER, MAN!)

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.520
Ooh, harsh.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.920
Meet great human characters like: John C. Reilly...

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.040
"Everybody keep your wigs on now!"

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.880
Then meet more human characters.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.940
And more...

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.980
And more...

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.880
And more...

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.840
And more.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.000
Because most contemporary blockbusters
have too many characters.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.220
And most of them should
have been cut or consolidated.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.700
But hey, I'm the director.
That's on me.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.300
Like the living legend, John Goodman.
The guy you enter the movie with,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.380
then drops out cause he has
nothing to do but spout exposition.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.120
"(rambling exposition)"

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.160
Toby Kebbell, who's great as Kong,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.260
but as a human character is in a completely
different movie than anyone else.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.380
"Sometimes life just punch ya in the balls."

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.860
Tom Hiddleston, the Vietnam vet for hire
who always looks perfect.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.580
Forget the fact that he's supposed to be a 'Nam vet
in the 1970's. I mean, look at that perfect hair.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.720
He never even gets dirty
for crying out loud.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.760
And Brie Larson, a photographer
who's essentially playing Pokemon Snap.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.180
While all the interesting stuff
happens to other people.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.920
It's a movie that takes some of our best
and most talented working actors

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.420
and gives them nothing
that even resembles an arc.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.120
Jeez this is really honest.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.540
Yeah, I bathe in pain.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.780
So enjoy a movie that's way better
than it had any right to be.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.700
But is not without it's serious flaws.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.000
I mean it is a f***ing
monster movie after all.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.060
But it is not, I repeat,
not a problem

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.680
that it has
too many helicopters.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.580
Wait, what?

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.560
Look, everybody thinks that there's some issue where there's
more helicopters in the sky than there are on the boat

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.700
and then Kong takes down
an infinite amount of them.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.040
Guess what, you're wrong.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.120
There's a shot in the movie where the camera goes
around the boat and you see in the back of the boat.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.180
And guess what's in the back
of the f***ing boat...

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.240
Helicopters.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.260
What's inside of the boat?
More helicopters.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.600
What the boat f***ing made out of?
F***ing helicopters.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.120
You know why? Cause you want to see Kong.
Like the toy has, grabbing a f***ing helicopter.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.420
You want to pay $15 not to see him f***ing use
the helicopter like a f***ing baseball bat?

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.900
The helicopter math makes f***ing sense.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.200
Man, this is a really weird Honest Trailer.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.220
Deep breaths, dude.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.800
(exhales)

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.540
- Do you feel better now? 
- You know what? I do.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.980
Can you guys just do that
funny name thing that you do?

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.820
- You got it.
- Thanks, man.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.340
♫That kong-kong-kong-kong-kong♫

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.040
And a crap ton of anime references.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.300
Did you catch them all?

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.040
_

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.980
To any of you who think we're just
capitalizing on all the drama,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.400
we set this up over a month ago.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.580
"The thing that I'm not looking forward to is
your people dropping some Honest Trailer."

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.940
"Do you wanna help write it?"

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.400
- "I would love to."
- "Let's do it."

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.900
But to be honest, we're pretty lucky the timing
worked out to capitalize on all the drama.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.000
(A Nova Corps General cheers up his men during battle, 1976, colourised)

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.300
Thanks to director, Jordan Vogt-Roberts,
for his honest take on his own movie.
