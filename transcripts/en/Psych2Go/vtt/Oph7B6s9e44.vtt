00:00:05.995 --> 00:00:07.705
Anxiety.

00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:10.925
Some people hear the term and roll their eyes immediately,

00:00:10.925 --> 00:00:13.575
others know what an incredibly real

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:15.600
thing it is. Many people

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.905
who seem successful,

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:20.275
are actually suffering from High Functioning Anxiety.

00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:21.605
And just because

00:00:21.605 --> 00:00:24.485
it's not a formally recognized diagnosis,

00:00:24.485 --> 00:00:26.695
it shouldn't be something you have to live with.

00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:29.705
By this point, you may already know that your anxiety

00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:32.355
pushes you forward instead of holding you back.

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:35.995
While in certain circumstances, this can be helpful,

00:00:35.995 --> 00:00:39.065
that doesn't mean it isn't without its lasting

00:00:39.065 --> 00:00:41.765
effects. To help you understand this

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:44.435
condition, Psych2Go shares with you, 5 facts

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:47.245

1. It's not easy to see

00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:53.045
Often times, someone with High Functioning Anxiety

00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:55.955
appears very driven and successful.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.380
Your anxiety makes you efficient,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.860

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.520
you arrive early and are immaculately just,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.660
