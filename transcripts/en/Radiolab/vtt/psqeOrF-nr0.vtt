1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.460
Yeah, yeah. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich,

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.720
Radiolab and today we are desperately seeking symmetry.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.530
[inaudible] thus far we are failing desperately because maybe, maybe, you know,

4
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:10.920
if we took,

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.350
if we rejiggered our whole approach because symmetry know is really about love.

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.860
No, it's, it's what, even though we're changing the subject now,

7
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.890
it's about the way things look when they're flipped around or turned or rotated.

8
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.250
And this is where it gets really interesting. Reflected, reflected, yes.

9
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.460
Reflected because there was a map afflicted. Yes.

10
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.120
There was a mathematician at Oxford University named Charles Latoya. AJ Datsun.

11
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.750
There's a mathy named for you. Well, he had a different name as it happens.

12
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.910
Let Lewis Carroll. Oh, like the Alison Wonderland, the Alice in wonderland.

13
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:48.150
Dude, he is a mathematician. He was, I had really didn't know that.

14
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.030
Did you know that he wrote another book called through the looking glass?

15
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.250
Truthfully, I didn't know there were different books, you know,

16
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:57.000
very little in this particular [inaudible] but there's a part of the book where

17
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.420
Alice is standing in her room talking to her cat.

18
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.950
Now if you'll only attend kitty and to not talk so much.

19
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.120
I'll tell you all about my ideas about looking glass house.

20
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.300
This is Natasha gastric reading, and in this section of the book,

21
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.970
Alice is telling her cat like,

22
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.520
let's take a look at the difference between our world and that world right there

23
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.320
in the mirror. That's just the same as our drawing.

24
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.590
Only the things go the other way.

25
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.350
The books are something like our books. Only the words go the wrong way.

26
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.500
I know that because I've had at one of our books to the glass and then they hold

27
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.740
that when in the other room.

28
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.660
<v 1>How would you like to live in looking Glass House Katie?</v>

29
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.960
I one day think if you look in that

30
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.230
perhaps looking glass milk isn't good to drink. Perhaps

31
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.150
<v 0>your milk isn't good to drink.</v>

32
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.700
Why are you talking like that and what does that even mean? Well,

33
00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:00.820
you just stick with me on this. I think I will make it perfectly clear. Okay.

34
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.050
This is a very, as it turns out, yes. Difficult scientific question. Yes.

35
00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:08.880
They call it a [inaudible]. Okay. What this is Neil digraphs. Titan, Neil,

36
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.840
any I l d grass, small d e capital g. R a. S. S. E. Tyson.

37
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.780
He's an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History,

38
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.170
also the director of the Hayden Planetarium. Cool. And what is that?

39
00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:23.740
What is [inaudible]? Well, it's when you make a molecule,

40
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.890
there's no rule or law that says it has to be symmetric.

41
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.070
Neil says if you zoom into that bowl of milk,

42
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.580
which you're going to find is just chains of atoms that are stuck together in a

43
00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:38.560
very particular shape and that shape, it could curl in a particular way.

44
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.700
So for example, if you have a spring and you turn your finger in the direction,

45
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.140
the spring, a spring, like a coil of coil, but like the spring out of your,

46
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.640
your click pen, pull out that spring. All right,

47
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.910
you have a pen right here under your pen. Pull it out and got spring out.

48
00:02:51.911 --> 00:02:55.450
Here we go and look at the way the spring turns. Okay.

49
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.600
You get the spray and move your finger in the direction of her moving.

50
00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:00.740
My is turning cluck.

51
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.483
<v 1>Yes,</v>

52
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.790
<v 0>all the way up to the top. Okay.</v>

53
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.050
That spring is that way in it's life.

54
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.070
Whether it's right side up or upside down, doesn't matter. Oh, always clockwise.

55
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.770
If you had a mirror, Chad, you happen to have something. Do I have a mirror? No.

56
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.490
[inaudible] take your phone, which has a reflected the shiny thing. Okay.

57
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.090
Put Your um, spring in front of the shiny surface of the phone. Okay.

58
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.180
Trace the spring with your finger and tell me which direction is your finger

59
00:03:29.181 --> 00:03:30.170
going? Clockwise.

60
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.000
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.950
<v 0>No, you already did this in the reflection. Oh,</v>

62
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.950
in the phone to kind of tell that phone.

63
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.960
It's going the opposite way. Counter-Clockwise. Exactly.

64
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:45.070
And so now you have two oppositely turned springs.

65
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.930
You cannot turn one into the other.

66
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.400
They're built differently yet they are curiously identical.

67
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.030
So since molecules are just sequences of Adams,

68
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.950
imagine a molecule that has that shape.

69
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.850
If you put that molecule in front of the mirror, just the same as the spring,

70
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:05.350
you've got now two molecules built differently, but truly asley identical

71
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.670
<v 1>[inaudible] kind of</v>

72
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.650
<v 0>like your right hand and your left hand,</v>

73
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.860
your left hand and her right hand are related by a mirror image.

74
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.590
It's the same thing with these molecules. This is Marcello Glizer.

75
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:19.530
He's a physicist at Dartmouth college and according to Marcello,

76
00:04:19.531 --> 00:04:24.010
this is how scientists talk about molecules. They call them [inaudible].

77
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.600
Sometimes we call it the hand in this,

78
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:30.601
sometimes you get a little more fancy and we call it Keyer Allity because Cairo

79
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.060
Kiros in Greek means hands and Marcello says,

80
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.980
if you look at pebbles or granted or cement inanimate stuff,

81
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.410
when you look at the shape of things inside,

82
00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:45.120
it's a mixture of the two 50% lefthanded, 50% right-handed.

83
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.110
However, if you look at all the proteins are living things,

84
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.400
they are always lefthanded and no right-handed at all.

85
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.680
Really wife has chosen one over the other life as we know it has chosen.

86
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.520
When scientists look inside of living things, they, they always see it.

87
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.180
The molecules are pointing one way, right? So somehow,

88
00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.830
and this is what's really amazing,

89
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.070
somehow life is shooting a very specific shape for the molecules to make up

90
00:05:14.491 --> 00:05:18.200
stuff. That's correct. When you say life has chosen, well, that's good.

91
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.210
Let's take that sentence apart. Life,

92
00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:25.620
meaning everything that is that we know of on earth, every living thing.

93
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.460
Hence my phrase, life as we know it. Everything. That's what that means.

94
00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:32.730
The littlest things to the blue whale, that would be as we know,

95
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.720
the littlest clean. You think to the treat, the biggest tree,

96
00:05:36.721 --> 00:05:41.400
the giant sequoia, that would be as we know, every protein in you,

97
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.770
dogs, trees, you name it. It's filled with left-handed building blocks. Yes.

98
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.210
It's called the [inaudible] of life. The Kira Allity of life life.

99
00:05:51.211 --> 00:05:54.470
My friend is left hinted. Hmm.

100
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.420
That's pretty, that's a well, it feels cool, but let me just, uh,

101
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.180
like so what I mean, I don't want to put it bluntly, but I mean like w well,

102
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:09.000
other than the sheer surprise of having everything in life being shaped direct,

103
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.280
but I mean, what does it have to do with my life? Well, this bring one's life.

104
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:14.360
This brings the mirror thing.

105
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.310
This brings us back to the mirror mystery and Alice in the mirror milk. No, no,

106
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.100
because you, because you just told me that,

107
00:06:21.101 --> 00:06:24.810
that the milk is left-handed because milk is in all kind of living cow. Yeah,

108
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.340
I remember you said that life has lefty [inaudible] so there can't be any

109
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:30.230
right-handed milks to the mirror. Milk doesn't exist.

110
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.980
Well that's because I forgot to tell you that scientists all the time

111
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.120
manufactured mirror molecules. They do. Yeah. Yeah.

112
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:42.410
They go into their laboratories and they synthetically make mirror molecules of

113
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:46.580
all kinds of things. Can they do milk mirror metal about milk in particular?

114
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:50.240
But I do know that when I talked to an Oxford professor, Marcus does a toy,

115
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.460
right? Yeah. He told me, if you take the atoms, which built caraway seeds,

116
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.940
which is the spice they use in Rye bread, take a mirror image of them.

117
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.960
Suddenly you get something which tastes of, Huh? It's what's put on Wrigley,

118
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:06.740
spearmint gum. And in fact, there are some very dramatic examples of this,

119
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:10.420
not just where the taste changes, but um, uh,

120
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.790
lessons might remember a story about the thalidomide drug.

121
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:20.700
<v 3>In 1958, a West German pharmaceutical firm began marketing a new drug.</v>

122
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.900
<v 0>This is a new spot from the early 1960.</v>

123
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.290
<v 3>He said it though so effective and apparently harmless.</v>

124
00:07:25.291 --> 00:07:29.400
It quickly became one of the most widely used and prescribed drugs in west

125
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.330
Europe, illegitimate.

126
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.720
<v 0>Before long pregnant women started taking it as a way to come.</v>

127
00:07:33.721 --> 00:07:37.950
Morning sickness and most of us, well, we know what happened next.

128
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.750
Every a woman President Kennedy in a press conference in this country,

129
00:07:42.751 --> 00:07:46.650
I think must be aware that it's most important that they take this drug,

130
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.510
that they turn it in every citizen. Of course, I should be aware of the hazards.

131
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:55.320
All in all more than 12,000 children were born with arms and legs that were

132
00:07:55.321 --> 00:07:57.990
shortened or deformed or completely missing.

133
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.950
The strange thing according to Marcus is that we now know they're the drunk.

134
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.880
When they first made the Lydia mine, it was old one hand,

135
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.690
let's say it was lefthanded. Yeah, and it did actually cure me.

136
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.520
What morning sickness and was completely harmless,

137
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.660
but somewhere along the way, thalidomide flip.

138
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.100
We don't know whether this was in the drug making process or after,

139
00:08:20.101 --> 00:08:24.030
but we do know it's mirror image was incredibly poisonous.

140
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.340
So you know what this means jet but then in a show about symmetry,

141
00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:36.260
what we've just discovered is that life itself is actually deeply asymmetric.

142
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:39.620
Yeah. Unlike love where we started the program back with um,

143
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.360
Aristophanes when it comes to life, you don't want to meet the other half.

144
00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:48.020
Stay away man. [inaudible] anyhow,

145
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.530
that's well enough about me or no, no, no, no, no.

146
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.620
I think we can take this another step further. There is no further case.

147
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.130
I mean because

148
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.130
<v 4>something about this chemistry reflections thing resonates for me with the</v>

149
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:06.110
actual experience of standing in front of a mirror. How well, you know,

150
00:09:06.111 --> 00:09:08.930
you look at that guy and you're like, Eh oof.

151
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.690
I mean we talked about this on stage actually in DC at the Shakespeare theater.

152
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.990
I remember when I asked you that personal question, do you want to do that?

153
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.490
Oh yes we do. Psychologically. Let me ask psychologically,

154
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.140
do you enjoy looking in the mirror?

155
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.540
Is that a question you wanted to ask me?

156
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:30.000
And I thought that's a private question.

157
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.760
Surely you know though that you are a,

158
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.800
the difference between your true self in your mirror self is not trivial.

159
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.190
Like true. What did you mean about my true self? I don't know.

160
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.690
Well I'm going to tell you this story now about a guy named John Walter. Oh,

161
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:48.540
the, with a little muster from Baltimore. From the movies. No,

162
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:53.520
that's John Waters. Walter. He's a computer programmer in neuro.

163
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:57.420
Shell paid him a visit recently cause back when he was in college he sorta

164
00:09:57.421 --> 00:10:01.860
kindness switched places with the guy in the mirror. It was many years ago.

165
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.890
How old were you? 19. 19. So it was a long time ago.

166
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.130
We're talking late seventies here, but I was a, uh,

167
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.610
had already had some issues with the mirror. So let me set this up for you.

168
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:15.420
But thing to know about John is that as a kid he had a tough time.

169
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.440
Like so many of us, he would get bullied, beaten up on the playground.

170
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.220
It was no better when he got into his teens. And as a 19 year old,

171
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:28.221
his social life consisted of a series of stinging humiliations like the

172
00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:33.270
following. I remember at the time there was a lot of um, kids hanging out.

173
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.780
You know, there was a crew of people like, you know, 20, 30,

174
00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:39.210
40 kids would gather together at the aqua dock,

175
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:44.370
beautiful words of the aqueduct and go drink beers and smoke cigarettes.

176
00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:47.910
You know, I've walked into the group, I care what's up. And it's like, yeah,

177
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:52.260
whatever. Roundly rejected.

178
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:57.630
And that according to John was normal, that that was normal, very normal.

179
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.480
Like people would say, what's that guy doing here?

180
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.460
Maybe he was like wearing the wrong plaid pants or had like, you know,

181
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:09.360
mismatch socks. There might be some whatever. Don't you emphasize this guy?

182
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.990
Nobody wants to be 19 and be the Yucky person. However,

183
00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:17.990
the story that we'll follow centers on a revelation that John had that,

184
00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:21.960
uh, began just as he was about to start his summer job for con Ed.

185
00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:25.650
I was working for them as a painter and I had some pictures taken for

186
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.460
[inaudible] or ID photos. Yeah, there was an ID camera that had four lenses.

187
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.480
So when they took the negative, it was four of me. Boom, boom, boom, boom.

188
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:38.010
Like little squares, little squares, and I remember looking over and going,

189
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.550
why do I look so weird? Why do it look so weird?

190
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.410
Why do I have socks look so weird? Because here's the thing. I mean,

191
00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:51.411
the John in the pictures was not the John that he knew himself to be that John

192
00:11:52.891 --> 00:11:56.290
was kind of timid, nerdy, not cool.

193
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.880
Why do I look so weird in pictures? I look fine. What do you mean you look fine?

194
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:04.000
How do you know you look fine? Well, I thought I looked fine in the mirror.

195
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.880
You know when I looked at my course in the mirror, things on the left,

196
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:09.900
go to the right things on the right, go to the right, left. Wait a second.

197
00:12:09.901 --> 00:12:13.020
That's when it hit him. Hit Him.

198
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:18.720
It's the hair part. It's the one.

199
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:23.550
It's the hair part. It's the what? It's the hair part.

200
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.670
I could do this all night. It's the hair part. What does that mean? It's the,

201
00:12:26.671 --> 00:12:29.960
hey, I hear you. I hear you. That was that. Yeah, it's the hair part. Well,

202
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.360
in the picture, I saw a guy with a right hair apart in the mirror.

203
00:12:33.361 --> 00:12:37.440
I seen a guy with a left hair part, essentially John [inaudible] look,

204
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.450
which part? Which side am I here? Part it on. It's your left. Your left.

205
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.720
My left. John Thought he was a leftie too.

206
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.330
He would stand in front of the mirror and the mirror would tell him he was

207
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:46.920
parting it to the left,

208
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.950
but in fact he was partying it to the right in real life.

209
00:12:49.951 --> 00:12:52.750
Now the lefty guy in the mirror, he liked that guy.

210
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.650
I was fine with that guy who was cool. It was, there was nothing wrong with him,

211
00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.810
but he realized he was the only person seeing that guy, so he thought,

212
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:05.250
Oh, let me put my hair on the other side. Let me essentially swap,

213
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.270
reel me for mirror me. It was one of these things where, yeah,

214
00:13:09.271 --> 00:13:12.690
that looks really weird in the mirror, but at Betcha it looks good in real life.

215
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.860
Let me go find out. What did you do well that night

216
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:19.790
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

217
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:24.660
<v 4>it goes back to the aqueduct. Same posse is there, right in that same group.</v>

218
00:13:24.661 --> 00:13:25.494
Interesting enough,

219
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:29.070
had beat the crap out of me like three years earlier when I was in like ninth

220
00:13:29.071 --> 00:13:32.840
grade, but there he was now with his hair parted on the left and he says,

221
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.840
this time things were different. Somebody offered him a beer. I was like, wow.

222
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.190
But the thing that I knew made it better was when I left,

223
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.170
I got goodbyes.

224
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.850
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

225
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.370
<v 4>come on. Come on. God. I look God for the first time. I'm, no,</v>

226
00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.450
this is ridiculous that you would tell me a story about a man who is having

227
00:13:53.451 --> 00:13:58.310
social failures. University shifts is Arrow is remade. This is like,

228
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.840
it's his experience. It's very dull. It's too easy to dismiss,

229
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.390
but when you are ready, are you ready? I'm going to win you over.

230
00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.180
You're not ready for this. I don't think you're ready. Are you ready?

231
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.810
If you are asking me to be [inaudible] I'm going to show you a picture right

232
00:14:11.811 --> 00:14:15.500
now. All right. Okay. Have a look at, okay.

233
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.940
Who is that? It's Abraham Lincoln, our 16th president.

234
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.020
[inaudible] take him in. Taking deep into your consciousness. By the way.

235
00:14:24.021 --> 00:14:25.400
This next part, you can see the

236
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.440
pictures@radiolab.org it's worth checking out his eyes, his nose, his mouth.

237
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.220
Pay attention particularly to the hair part. Okay,

238
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:39.260
now look what happens when you flip Abraham [inaudible].

239
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.170
<v 1>Oh, that</v>

240
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.620
<v 4>there are no, no, no, no, no, no. Guys. Is this the same picture? Picture?</v>

241
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.680
Go back to the other picture. Go. All right, here's a,

242
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:56.510
now we'll do the other one. Oh, you see, so weird. Now here's the thing.

243
00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.200
This is what Abraham Lincoln would have seen when he looked in the mirror.

244
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:05.150
He would have seen this guy, not the other guy. The one we all see. Huh?

245
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.270
So there's something going on you. Would you not at least acknowledge me?

246
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.590
They find this big leap. Awesome. Yes. Okay. With your permission,

247
00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:13.490
Mr Sinek,

248
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.260
I will now rejoin John Who's about to get married and had three babies.

249
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.430
He said after, after he switched this part,

250
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:25.130
it just kept getting better and better and better all summer long.

251
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.260
He was suddenly invited to all of these parties,

252
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:29.840
but the very same people that used to beat him up and for the first time,

253
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:32.690
he says, I was clearly one of them. Now, whether you're not you buy that,

254
00:15:32.691 --> 00:15:35.210
this is in fact because of his hair that's on you. Okay,

255
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.970
but let's fast forward just a little bit. The next summer,

256
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.950
this would have been 1979 yeah,

257
00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:43.430
nine 79 John sitting in front of the TV and on comes.

258
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.410
<v 5>Good evening. This is a special night for me. The President Jimmy Carter,</v>

259
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.070
<v 4>make it a speech about how our nation is in a deep</v>

260
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:51.561
<v 5>fuck.</v>

261
00:15:51.561 --> 00:15:56.561
Why have we not been able to get together as a nation to resolve a serious

262
00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.390
energy problem? The malaise speech,

263
00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:02.020
you know that that infamous countries in malaise,

264
00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:05.600
it's clear that the true problems of our nation,

265
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.640
a much deeper,

266
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:13.010
deeper than gasoline lines or energy shortages, deeper even

267
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.710
<v 4>that inflation or recession. Yeah. As you know,</v>

268
00:16:15.711 --> 00:16:18.980
I'm sure you remember a lot of people would criticize Jimmy Carter for making

269
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:22.220
the speech because he's up there admitting flaws and they were like,

270
00:16:22.221 --> 00:16:23.240
come on Mr President.

271
00:16:23.241 --> 00:16:28.241
Don't be weak man up John meanwhile is sitting in front of the TV and he's

272
00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:31.330
thinking, dude, you've got to change your hair part.

273
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:37.010
[inaudible] until I wrote them cause I wrote to him, I wrote to him with Ac.

274
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:41.230
You said, wait, wait, wait. I think I just said,

275
00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.930
I think you should change your hair. Pardon? On the on the left.

276
00:16:43.931 --> 00:16:48.340
I did myself and found it to be much more powerful, much, much more successful.

277
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.660
And um, that six letter, I so wish I did. I don't have it. Um,

278
00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.670
and then about six weeks later, boom, he twitched. He switched. No, he,

279
00:16:56.671 --> 00:16:59.790
John wrote him a letter and President Carter switched. No,

280
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:02.320
it might not have been John's letter that didn't have no evidence.

281
00:17:02.321 --> 00:17:06.000
Think about how much I like what's involved in a president switching is here.

282
00:17:06.001 --> 00:17:08.610
There are focus groups. There are prayer meetings.

283
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.950
There's so much thought that goes into the, did anyone actually record this? Uh,

284
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:17.640
yes they did. I will. I will now read you a journalistic account from no,

285
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:22.080
no. A periodical. There you go. Washington book right there.

286
00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:26.550
You see Bam right there. Oh Man. Newsweek,

287
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:31.050
May 7th, 1979 at first, photographers thought they had their negatives reversed,

288
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.740
but no,

289
00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.760
Jimmy Carter has changed the partners here from the right side to the left.

290
00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.690
The Washington press score demanded an explanation. Right.

291
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.990
I remember that. You know,

292
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.530
as opposed to John who changes his here and then all the girls giving beers.

293
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:51.000
This guy, he was running against a haired man,

294
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.980
Megan. And it didn't matter. So he just, you know, we got crushed. Right.

295
00:17:55.981 --> 00:17:59.000
You know what? Forget smart. Forget the executive branch. Yeah.

296
00:17:59.010 --> 00:17:59.843
Stay with me now.

297
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:04.350
I was with John and he was showing me pictures of congressmen and of celebrities

298
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.220
and uh, I noticed something peaking out at the bottom of the pile.

299
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.390
I see peeking out underneath the stack of photos as a superman. Yeah.

300
00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.730
Can you show me a picture of Superman looking mighty in his superman suit?

301
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.720
Notice how he parts his hair. Yeah. It's a little bit on there. On that side.

302
00:18:21.721 --> 00:18:25.810
Yeah. No, and this is Clark cat. Uh,

303
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.860
and as we know from the movies clerk, Kent is fumbling sort of a dork.

304
00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.420
I was at first, really nervous about tonight.

305
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.750
So somebody made that movie,

306
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:44.550
maybe explicitly intuitively understood something about the difference that

307
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:47.250
maybe you know the right parts at one thing. But Clark Kent,

308
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:50.100
the left part said something about superman. In fact,

309
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.390
there is a scene in the movie where Clark kids were running down an alley.

310
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:55.800
He's about to turn into superman.

311
00:18:55.801 --> 00:19:00.801
He pulls his shirt open to reveal the s and literally mid-stride his hair goes

312
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:06.540
and turns from the hood to the left.

313
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:12.270
So you're saying that sophisticated popular cultural motion picture manufactures

314
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.840
at at least two presidents have been persuaded to this position at this very

315
00:19:16.841 --> 00:19:20.170
moment on a Saturday night. That is what I'm saying. All right.

316
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:25.270
Well for arguments sake that, what would you say, I hate to get into this,

317
00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:30.310
any paper explains the difference between putting the power of your hair on the

318
00:19:30.311 --> 00:19:32.960
left hand or the right hand. Well, if you ask John,

319
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.990
what he'll say is that the left hair part emphasizes strength and logic because

320
00:19:38.091 --> 00:19:43.091
it draws your attention to the logical and more masculine side of your face,

321
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:46.700
your brain. Cause it's a left brain kind of thing. But I, I don't really know.

322
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:47.150
Okay.

323
00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:50.450
So I decided I would actually take this seriously and figure out how to feel

324
00:19:50.451 --> 00:19:54.560
about it. So I call it this guy. Good. I jet. It's a nice name is Mike Nichols.

325
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.850
Oh, from the graduate. There's the Mike People. Very good.

326
00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.610
A psychology professor in Australia is an expert in symmetry. That Mike Nichols.

327
00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.540
Yes. I ran him through John's theory. Have you ever seen the superman movies?

328
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.220
Some of the earlier ones. I think,

329
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:11.180
you know how Clark Kent's hair is parked to the right and then [inaudible] ran

330
00:20:11.181 --> 00:20:13.100
through the whole thing. Yeah. Clark's on the rain.

331
00:20:13.101 --> 00:20:17.520
Maybe he's weeks you've met lev, maybe he's you stronger, more assertive, right.

332
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:23.090
Is there anything to that? Anything at all? Um, yeah, I mean possibly,

333
00:20:23.091 --> 00:20:27.030
you know, um, that's, um,

334
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.010
uh, but, but, but see,

335
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:36.170
he didn't say this, which is interesting. In focusing on the left.

336
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:40.040
John May be picking up on a particular bias that we,

337
00:20:40.041 --> 00:20:43.940
human beings have to our left side. For instance,

338
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.960
here's an experiment that he and his colleagues didn't like.

339
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.110
A snapshot of someone's face, um,

340
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:53.920
at baseline when they're showing no emotion blank face and then get them to try

341
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:58.921
to look as happy or sad as I could take happy guy and overlay him on to no

342
00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:01.240
expression guy and almost like a come to a map.

343
00:21:01.241 --> 00:21:03.610
You could actually look at the amount of change,

344
00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.830
amount of muscle movement and that it occurred,

345
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.040
which you will see if you measure the muscle movement in millimeters on each

346
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:09.551
side of the face.

347
00:21:09.551 --> 00:21:14.551
You'll see that the smile curves a few extra millimeters on the left side of the

348
00:21:14.711 --> 00:21:18.840
face. He says this is nearly always the case, always on the left side.

349
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.090
What is really telling you is that when somebody smiles or when they frown or

350
00:21:22.091 --> 00:21:25.960
whatever, they're doing it slightly more strongly on the left side of the face.

351
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:26.951
Now, if this is the case,

352
00:21:26.951 --> 00:21:30.310
that our left side is sort of saying more emotionally than our right side,

353
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:35.020
then if you think about the mirror, it's kind of a discombobulating thing,

354
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.320
you know, cause it's taken your left, which is sort of broadcasting emotion,

355
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.890
flipping it to your right, you're seeing yourself, you're all mixed up.

356
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.600
You don't know which part of you is where you're. So you're saying,

357
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.860
because I tend to address you as my attention on your left side,

358
00:21:47.861 --> 00:21:50.920
unbeknownst to me. And your left side is actually flipped over to your right.

359
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.830
Said I don't, I, it's a where are we sort of exactly. But John has, uh,

360
00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.280
has developed a solution to this problem.

361
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.160
We'll take this one apart now.

362
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.280
Makes and sells his own very special mirrors right out of his home.

363
00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:10.480
And this is where you make everything to get goes into the mirrors made here.

364
00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:14.170
Um, you see here, this is the machine that cuts the mirror.

365
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.090
He buys these giant sheets of reflective glass and he slices them into little

366
00:22:19.091 --> 00:22:19.924
pieces,

367
00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:29.410
clunk. And then I snap it. Now for each mirror,

368
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:33.100
uh, this is the key. He uses two pieces of mirror glass instead of one.

369
00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.200
What he'll do is he'll take these two pieces and he will place them together at

370
00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.990
a at right angles to mirrors at right angles like exactly at right angles.

371
00:22:40.991 --> 00:22:45.850
It has to be 90.0 degrees and let's just push this up a little bit.

372
00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.360
That's still not enough. And he gets when he finally gets it right,

373
00:22:49.361 --> 00:22:53.170
which can take hours. What he'll have is his v shaped mirror. He'll stand it up,

374
00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:55.480
put it in a box, and then Voila.

375
00:22:55.930 --> 00:23:00.930
What you have is a mirror that shows you a mirror image of a mirror image of you

376
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.630
takes the normally flipped guy that you'd see in the mirror,

377
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.590
re flips him so that what you are seeing is essentially,

378
00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.730
well for the first time in a mirror you see yourself as other people see you.

379
00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.270
Okay, so there you go. So what does this that you have in your, this is,

380
00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:20.380
this is a true mirror. This is a to the 12 inch model. And so when you like,

381
00:23:20.381 --> 00:23:24.090
this is actually what I look like at touch. You're right, I see.

382
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:28.690
It's actually on the right side. Oh my God, I'm that crazy. That's crazy.

383
00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.930
It is surprisingly weird to see yourself this way.

384
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.750
I feel like my nose is going the wrong way. Yeah.

385
00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:40.030
I never knew my nose went that way and this little flair in my eyebrows is on

386
00:23:40.031 --> 00:23:43.600
the wrong side or the right side as it were.

387
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:47.810
John claims that many a fair number. I probably would put you in this bunch.

388
00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.060
My cohost, when they stand in front of this mirror,

389
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.450
they a freak out many of them because they,

390
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.900
it's just their perception is shaken up a little bit. In fact,

391
00:23:56.901 --> 00:24:00.860
he sometimes takes his mirrors to these festivals and he will sort of set them

392
00:24:00.861 --> 00:24:03.920
up and have people look at themselves and then fill out comment cards

393
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:06.200
afterwards. You know what I mean? If you look at some of the comments,

394
00:24:06.201 --> 00:24:08.990
you know it's like monster,

395
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:10.483
<v 6>I am</v>

396

<v 4>monster anymore.</v>

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:17.263
