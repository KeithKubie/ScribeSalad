00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.120
- [Instructor] Earlier in
our mathematical adventures,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.680
we had expanded things like x plus y

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.610
times x minus y.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.950
Just as a but of review,

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.850
this is going to be equal to
x times x, which is x squared;

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.473
plus x times negative
y, which is negative xy;

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.623
plus y times x, which is plus xy;

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.730
and then minus y times y.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.260
Or you could say y times a negative y,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.770
so it's going to be minus y squared.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.170
Negative xy, positive xy, so
this is just going to simplify

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.870
to x squared minus y squared.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.150
And this is all review.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.750
We covered it, and when we
thought about factoring things

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.400
that are differences of squares,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.270
we thought about this when we were

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.430
first learning to multiply binomials.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.560
And what we're going to do now is

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.060
essentially just do the same thing,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.320
but do it with slightly more
complicated expressions.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.780
And so, another way of
expressing what we just did

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.200
is we could also write something like

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.200
a plus b times a minus b is
going to be equal to what?

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.280
Well, it's going to be equal
to a squared minus b squared.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.470
The only difference between what I did

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.590
up here and what I did over here

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.000
is instead of an x, I wrote an a;

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.390
and instead of a y, I wrote a b.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.440
So, given that, let's see if we can expand

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.200
and then combine like terms for,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.520
if I'm multiplying these two expressions.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.090
Say I'm multiplying three
plus 5x to the fourth

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.670
times three minus 5x to the fourth.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.923
Pause this video, and see
if you can work this out.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.070
Alright, well, there's
two ways to approach it.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.000
You could just approach it exactly the way

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.700
that I approached it up here,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.320
but we already know that
when we have this pattern

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.720
where we have something plus something

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.940
times that same original something

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.010
minus the other something,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.220
well that's going to be of the form

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.320
of this thing squared
minus this thing squared.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.620
And remember, the only
reason why I'm applying that

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.110
is I have a three right
over here and here,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.730
so the three is playing the role of the a.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.080
So, let me write that down, that is our a.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.920
And then the role of the b

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.100
is being played by 5x to the fourth.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.590
So, that is our b right over there.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.090
So, this is going to be equal
to a squared minus b squared.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.360
But our a is three,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.730
so it's going to be
equal to three squared,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.000
minus, and then our b is 5x to the fourth,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.360
minus 5x to the fourth squared.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.710
Now, what does all of this simplify to?

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.320
Well, this is going to be equal to,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.010
three squared is nine, and then minus

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.400
5x to the fourth squared.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.260
Let's see, 5 squared is 25.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.640
And then x to the fourth squared,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.410
well, that is just going
to be x to the fourth

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.170
times x to the fourth, which
is just x to the eighth.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.367
Another way to think about
it are exponent properties.

00:02:54.367 --> 00:02:56.160
This is the same thing as 5 squared

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.480
times x to the fourth squared.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.620
If I raise something to an exponent

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.980
and then raise that to another exponent,

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.400
I multiply the exponents.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.570
And there you have it.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.500
Let's do another example.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.180
Let's say that I were to ask you,

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.990
what is 3y squared

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.060
plus 2y to the fifth

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.340
times 3y squared

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.300
minus 2y to the fifth?

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.660
Pause this video, and see
if you can work that out.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.930
Well, we're going to do it the same way.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.700
You could, of course, always

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.430
just try to expand it out
the way we did originally.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.330
But we could recognize here that, hey,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.800
I have an a plus a b
times the a minus a b.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.210
So, that's going to be
equal to our a squared.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.320
So, what's 3y squared?

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.780
Well, that's going to be 9y to the fourth

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.310
minus our b squared.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.480
Well, what's 2y to the fifth squared?

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.860
Well, 2 squared is four,
and y to the fifth squared

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.550
is y to the five times
two, y to the 10th power.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.610
And there's no further
simplification that I could do here.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.470
I can't combine any like terms.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.813
And so, we are done here as well.
