I'll claim Jake that our ancestors who
 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.550
I'll claim Jake that our ancestors who
were not curious aren't never became our

the human human curiosity is how you
 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.060
the human human curiosity is how you
discover things and that's how we

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070
discover things and that's how we
 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.649
