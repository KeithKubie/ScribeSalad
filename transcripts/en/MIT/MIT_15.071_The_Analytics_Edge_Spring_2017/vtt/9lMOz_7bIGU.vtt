00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.970
eHarmony is an
online dating site

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.520
focused on long
term relationships.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.370
It takes a scientific
approach to love and marriage.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.990
About nearly 4% of
US marriages in 2012

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.750
are a result of eHarmony.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.210
The company has
generated over $1 billion

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.280
in cumulative revenue from
2000, the year it was founded.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.410
The overall approach
first predicts

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.090
if users will be compatible
using 29 different dimensions

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.110
of personality and
using linear regression.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.790
Then using optimization,
eHarmony finds

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.530
matches for everyone.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.600
eHarmony has members in
more than 150 countries.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.190
Since launching in 2000, it has
more than 33 million members,

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.590
and it now operates eHarmony
Labs, a relationship research

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.090
facility.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.500
eHarmony collects data
through 436 questions.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.710
Almost 15,000 people take
the questionnaire each day.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.980
What is the edge of eHarmony?

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.730
It relies much more on data
than other dating sites.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.150
It suggests a limited number
of high quality matches.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.810
Users don't have to search
and dig through profiles.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.450
eHarmony has successfully
leveraged the power

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.300
of analytics to create a
successful and thriving

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.190
business.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.580
It represents 14% of the
US online dating market.
