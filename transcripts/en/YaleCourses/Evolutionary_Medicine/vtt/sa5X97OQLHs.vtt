00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.090
The next set of lectures deals with cancer is an evolutionary process.

2
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.810
We're going to be looking both at the micro evolutionary,

3
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.310
a clonal evolution that characterizes every cancer,

4
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.470
and we're also going to see how follow genetic tools help us to understand the

5
00:00:20.471 --> 00:00:24.220
history of cancers is the grow and metastasize.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.750
Let's begin with some cancer basics types of cancers,

7
00:00:28.751 --> 00:00:32.740
hallmarks of cancers,
prevalence of cancer trends and cancer risk,

8
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:34.180
and why we are susceptible.

9
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.700
<v 0>First and definitions.
A tumor is any abnormal swelling of the flesh,</v>

11
00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:44.960
and it's derived from land for swelling,
and it is not synonymous with cancer.

12
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:46.860
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.450
<v 0>Cancer is a group of diseases that are characterized by uncontrolled growth and</v>

14
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:56.451
spread of abnormal cells with the potential for invading and disbursing.

15
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.260
A neoplasm is an abnormal mass of cells that's caused by overproduction and to

16
00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:09.630
benign.
Neoplasm is localized and not cancerous.
For example,
skin moles.

17
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.310
However,
they can also be pre-malignant.

18
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.810
A pre malignant neoplasm doesn't invade and destroy,

19
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.940
but given time they can evolve.

20
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.060
So a classic example is a colon polyp or a dysplasia that is an abnormal cell

21
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:28.734
development.

22
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.520
A malignant cancer is one that is,

23
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:39.521
has metastasized clonality means descent from a single progenitor cells,

24
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.780
so all the cells within a clone have a single genotype.

25
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.140
Cancer is traditionally have been classified a number of ways.

26
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.640
One is by tissue type,

27
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.880
so there are carcinomas which are from FSC glial cells.

28
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.840
They form 90% of all tumors.
They're derived from ectoderm endoderm.

29
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.040
There are sarcomas which are derived from connective tissue.

30
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:11.720
They are about 2% of all tumors and they're derived from Misa derm and then

31
00:02:11.721 --> 00:02:15.320
there are leukemias which are circulatory or lymphatic.

32
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.240
They form about 8% of all tumors and they are derived from mesoderm.

33
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

34
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.490
<v 0>Then there is classification by cell type.</v>

35
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.883
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.680
<v 0>Cancers can come from squamous cells,
which are flat.</v>

37
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.280
They can be myeloid that's coming from blood cells.

38
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.380
They can be lymphoid.

39
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:39.381
That means that they are derived from lymphocytes are macrophages and they can

40
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:44.040
be at nominees,
so that means they are derived from ductal or glandular cells.

41
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:46.500
That would be colon,
thyroid and prostate cancer.

42
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.450
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

43
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.440
<v 0>so cancer is many different diseases and they have many different</v>

44
00:02:53.441 --> 00:02:57.430
characteristics.
What are its hallmarks?

45
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.400
Cancer cells no longer need external signals to stimulate their proliferation.

46
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.720
They become autonomous.

47
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.980
They ignore signals to shut down their proliferation.

48
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.510
They suppress their own program,
cell death,

49
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.030
so they will not undergo apoptosis.

50
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

51
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.750
<v 0>They can divide indefinitely.
They do this by stabilizing their telomeres.</v>

52
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.170
They have increased mutation rates.
They become genetically very heterogeneous.

53
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.440
They can evade the immune system.
They can induce angiogenesis.
That is,

54
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:38.050
they can induce the growth of new blood vessels.

55
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.810
They can metastasize,

56
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:44.260
which means that they can move and colonize new parts of the body.

57
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.020
So those are the hallmarks of cancer.
Now what about the prevalence of cancer?

58
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.370
The lifetime risk being diagnosed with cancer in a country like the United

59
00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.970
States is about one third.

60
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.440
The lifetime risk of breast cancer in women is about 12% about one in eight

61
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.610
autopsies on individuals who died of other causes reveal many covert malignant

62
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:18.210
cancers in premalignant carcinomas and prostate,
breast,
kidney,

63
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.130
thyroid,
and other sites.

64
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.510
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

65
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.050
<v 0>we all have free cancerous mutant clones.
Thousands of them.</v>

66
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.313
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.620
<v 0>If they live long enough,</v>

68
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.120
all men would probably get prostate cancer and all women would probably get

69
00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:34.954
breast cancer.

70
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.900
To give you some idea of the burden of this disease.

71
00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:44.640
Here are the estimated number of cancer deaths in 2006 in the United States for

72
00:04:44.641 --> 00:04:48.480
men and for women.
I'll just mention a couple of the top ones.

73
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.130
In both cases,

74
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.190
lung and bronchial cancer was the most frequent kind of fatal cancer for men.

75
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.020
The second was colon and rectal cancer and for women it was breast cancer.

76
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.330
The third for men was prostate and the third for women was colon and rectal,

77
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.210
so there was a sexually,

78
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.890
a sexual or a system cancer that was in the top three for both men and women.

79
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.730
Breast cancer was a bit more frequent than prostate cancer.

80
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.960
Then the fourth most frequent was pancreatic cancer.

81
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:25.623
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

82
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.990
<v 0>Now,</v>

83
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.990
if we look at risk of death by cancer from 1930 to 2003 what we see is that in

84
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:38.650
some cases a few,
there was considerable improvement.
For example,

85
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.210
the risk of death from stomach cancer in men has been going down.
However,

86
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:47.700
the risk of death from colon and rectal cancer,
prostate cancer,

87
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.070
pancreatic cancer and leukemia has been pretty stable.

88
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.660
The risk of death from lung cancer rose and then started to fall.
And this,
uh,

89
00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.400
tracks cigarette smoking.

90
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.050
The picture in women was a bit different.

91
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.100
The risk of death from uh,

92
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.880
colon rectal cancer has declined a bit in women.

93
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.660
The risk of death from stomach cancer as in men has declined quite a bit.

94
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:18.920
However,
for some of these other cancers such as ovarian cancer,

95
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:22.730
breast cancer and so forth,
that risk is pretty stable.

96
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.580
And women started,
uh,

97
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.530
getting killed by smoking related lung cancer a bit later than men.

98
00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:33.740
And they have not yet benefited quite as much from stopping smoking.

99
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.213
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

100
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.163
<v 0>no,</v>

101
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.380
we have more cancer than do other species and there are at least four reasons

102
00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:47.980
for that.
We now have a post reproductive lifespan.

103
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.540
We've domesticated ourselves and that's less important to natural selection.

104
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.230
So we have a period of our life in which we are surviving,

105
00:06:56.231 --> 00:06:58.990
but natural selection is not improving our maintenance.

106
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.570
We have highly invasive placentas that are produced by stem cells that are pre

107
00:07:04.571 --> 00:07:05.980
adapted to metastases.

108
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.830
We are mismatched to risk factors that are generated by civilization.

109
00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:14.530
So to a certain degree,
cancer is a mismatch disease.

110
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.810
Those factors include tobacco,
alcohol,
a high calorie,
high fat diet,

111
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.900
Aaron Water Pollution,
and contraceptives.

112
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.050
Some of our reproductive cancers may be a proud product of our unique sexuality.

113
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.990
We have continual cycling,
continuous receptivity,

114
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:37.470
and the potential for continuous activity so that there's our mytosis.

115
00:07:38.261 --> 00:07:42.400
There are cell division's going on and reproductive tissue all the time and

116
00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:43.234
humans,

117
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.200
and here are just a few figures to make you remember that.

118
00:07:49.271 --> 00:07:51.490
We're talking about aging,

119
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:57.330
things like smoking and things like contraception as being cancer risks in

120
00:07:58.301 --> 00:08:01.240
humans.
So to summarize,

121
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.720
cancer is a disease that is caused by inappropriate and uncontrolled cell growth

122
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.620
and movement.
It is a collection of diseases,

123
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.150
not a single disease.

124
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:18.820
It is an increasingly important source of mortality in developed countries.

125
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.530
If we live long enough because we had escaped death for other reasons,

126
00:08:23.531 --> 00:08:25.540
we would probably all die of cancer.

127
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.870
Our ability to treat cancer has not improved nearly as much as our ability to

128
00:08:31.871 --> 00:08:33.160
treat other diseases.
