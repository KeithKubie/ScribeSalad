00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:06.326
&gt;&gt;These students are
investigating a murder mystery.

00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:09.046
It's one of several projects
developed by educators

00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:10.836
from Whitfield County
in northwest Georgia,

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:14.176
as they transition their schools
to project based learning.

00:00:15.116 --> 00:00:18.496
The process began two years
before when Whitfield teachers

00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:20.886
and administrators
visited High Tech High.

00:00:21.686 --> 00:00:24.986
The San Diego charter school
specializes in project based learning

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:27.976
and hosts workshops to
showcase its methods.

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:32.306
&gt;&gt;Rob: So projects are key to
our effort to serve a diversity

00:00:32.306 --> 00:00:33.676
of students within each classroom.

00:00:34.626 --> 00:00:35.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Inspired by their visit,

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:39.846
Whitfield educators launched their
own project based learning initiative

00:00:39.846 --> 00:00:43.366
just a few months later, beginning
with the sixth and ninth grades.

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:47.586
&gt;&gt;We were so excited,
because it was like a tool

00:00:47.586 --> 00:00:49.366
that we could give to teachers.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:54.226
It was like the vision that we saw
for our school and for our students.

00:00:54.626 --> 00:00:57.106
&gt;&gt;What we did, we looked at
their core design principles,

00:00:57.246 --> 00:00:59.996
a common intellectual
mission, personalization,

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:04.216
adult world connections, and we
said, "Are those good for our kids?"

00:01:05.036 --> 00:01:05.466
Well, yeah.

00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:06.086
Yeah, they are.

00:01:06.086 --> 00:01:07.026
They are good for our kids.

00:01:07.026 --> 00:01:08.246
That's not a High Tech High thing.

00:01:08.246 --> 00:01:09.796
That's an every kid thing.

00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:10.936
&gt;&gt;We'll look at some of the--

00:01:11.256 --> 00:01:13.546
&gt;&gt;A group of Whitfield
teachers worked together

00:01:13.546 --> 00:01:16.766
to design projects integrating
a variety of subjects,

00:01:17.216 --> 00:01:20.106
including history, math
and forensic science.

00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:25.926
&gt;&gt;What we're studying now in
genetics is DNA and fingerprinting.

00:01:26.356 --> 00:01:28.506
&gt;&gt;Now looking at these, you
should be able to tell me

00:01:28.796 --> 00:01:30.456
about what degree they are.

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:30.686
Remember--

00:01:31.456 --> 00:01:33.946
&gt;&gt;I remember thinking
back when I used to teach

00:01:33.946 --> 00:01:38.416
in a more traditional format, it
seemed to be me versus the kids.

00:01:39.046 --> 00:01:40.066
I gave you work.

00:01:40.226 --> 00:01:41.276
You don't like it.

00:01:41.276 --> 00:01:42.516
You're mad at me.

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:43.556
You know, you give it back.

00:01:43.556 --> 00:01:44.296
I don't like it.

00:01:44.296 --> 00:01:45.136
I'm mad at you.

00:01:45.136 --> 00:01:46.666
It was very adversarial.

00:01:47.176 --> 00:01:48.186
It was amazing.

00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:54.576
Once we started giving kids work
that was different, that allowed them

00:01:54.706 --> 00:01:58.916
to put their passion into it,
to collaborate with others.

00:01:59.356 --> 00:02:01.256
All of a sudden, the conversation

00:02:01.256 --> 00:02:04.376
between teachers and
students changed.

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:09.176
&gt;&gt;There are three major factors
that help these teachers rise

00:02:09.176 --> 00:02:11.846
to the challenge of transitioning
to project based learning.

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:14.686
One is collaborative planning time.

00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:18.186
&gt;&gt;That's just the beauty of it,
because we've got a few minutes

00:02:18.186 --> 00:02:21.836
in the morning to plan, but once a
month, we all get together and plan

00:02:22.216 --> 00:02:23.646
and work together as colleagues.

00:02:23.646 --> 00:02:25.396
And you don't have to design it all.

00:02:25.536 --> 00:02:27.106
Everybody takes their own part

00:02:27.686 --> 00:02:31.066
and contributes what their
strength is toward this big puzzle

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:32.286
of a project.

00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:37.246
&gt;&gt;A second critical factor is freedom
to experiment and even to fail.

00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:40.236
&gt;&gt;I think a lot of teachers have
the feeling that they are allowed

00:02:40.236 --> 00:02:44.686
to fail, and I think that's mainly
because they're really responsible,

00:02:44.936 --> 00:02:46.796
not necessarily to
the administration,

00:02:46.796 --> 00:02:51.756
but more to each other, and I think
that's a really powerful thing.

00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:54.606
&gt;&gt;If I fail to completely organize
a project from the beginning,

00:02:54.606 --> 00:02:56.406
it's gonna be a flop
and I know that now.

00:02:57.006 --> 00:03:00.456
I know that I can't wake up
and wing it from day to day.

00:03:00.456 --> 00:03:01.276
I can't do that.

00:03:02.296 --> 00:03:03.846
&gt;&gt;The third factor is remembering

00:03:03.846 --> 00:03:05.976
that not every lesson
has to be a project.

00:03:07.126 --> 00:03:09.776
&gt;&gt;We at North Whitfield had to stop.

00:03:09.776 --> 00:03:12.066
You know, halfway through the
year, you can get carried away

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:17.506
with how a project works and really,
it's about, are the kids learning?

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:22.496
&gt;&gt;So I think it's supporting them
and saying, "Whatever is best

00:03:22.496 --> 00:03:26.276
for your students, keep searching,
keep seeking, keep designing."

00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:29.266
&gt;&gt;Continued mentoring
and free resources

00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:31.796
from High Tech High also
help keep them on track.

00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:33.756
&gt;&gt; Have your teachers
present as well.

00:03:33.756 --> 00:03:35.936
&gt;&gt;Yes. I think that
would be a good idea.

00:03:36.236 --> 00:03:40.386
&gt;&gt;We could do a focused,
everyone together,

00:03:41.446 --> 00:03:44.356
and then break out into workshop?

00:03:45.096 --> 00:03:46.706
&gt;&gt;It's a little nerve
wracking at first,

00:03:46.756 --> 00:03:48.416
but adult like conversation
we're having

00:03:48.416 --> 00:03:49.926
with kids now, that's worth it all.

00:03:50.376 --> 00:03:50.826
&gt;&gt;Oh wow.

00:03:51.726 --> 00:03:53.966
&gt;&gt;It's very, very different.

00:03:54.056 --> 00:03:58.446
&gt;&gt;It used to just be a lot of tests,
a lot of, "I'm gonna teach you this,"

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:01.366
and then just spit it back out
on a test paper afterwards.

00:04:01.506 --> 00:04:04.726
But now it's more of, "I'm gonna
teacher you this and you have

00:04:04.726 --> 00:04:07.446
to produce something that's
actually meaningful from it."

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:10.386
And it actually, it's more engaging

00:04:10.386 --> 00:04:11.966
and it makes you actually
want to learn.

00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:12.866
&gt;&gt;And what's that for?

00:04:13.156 --> 00:04:14.556
&gt;&gt;This is our way of learning.

00:04:15.036 --> 00:04:19.486
We're learning how to build, putting
math and science and everything

00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:21.676
into our outdoor classroom to learn.

00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:22.446
&gt;&gt;I like it.

00:04:23.046 --> 00:04:25.676
&gt;&gt;With the growing support
of teachers and students,

00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:29.296
Whitfield County plans to continue
implementing project based learning

00:04:29.506 --> 00:04:30.526
across the district.

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:33.146
&gt;&gt;I watch students
up and moving around.

00:04:33.146 --> 00:04:33.896
They're building something.

00:04:33.896 --> 00:04:34.966
They're talking to the students.

00:04:34.996 --> 00:04:36.066
They're presenting their work.

00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:38.956
They have something great they're
fixing to home to show their parents.

00:04:39.126 --> 00:04:42.006
I mean, those are just awesome
things, to watch the kids be engaged.

00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:44.136
It's just a fantastic
thing as a principal.
