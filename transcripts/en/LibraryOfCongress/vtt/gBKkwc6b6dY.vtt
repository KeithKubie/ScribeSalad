00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.770
&gt;&gt;Mary-Jane Deeb: Good afternoon.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.530 position:56%
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.020
and welcome to the
Library of Congress.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.170
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb, Chief of the
African-Middle East Division here

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.480
and I'm delighted to see you
all here, and we are, today,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:46.060
co-sponsoring a wonderful program
with our speaker, Mr. Mehdi Saeedi,

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.050
who is a Persian designer
and visual artist,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.700
and you probably already have
had glimpses of his work,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.170
as he was going through the
images, and we're co-sponsoring,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.160
as we have on a number of other
programs, we're cosponsoring this

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:16.590
with the University of Maryland,
with Roshan Center, and with Dr.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.730
/ Professor Fatemeh Keshavarz,
who has been an inspiration

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.820
and a guiding light
in all our programs,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.380
all our Persian programs
and many others.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:38.160
She has been with us, a partner,
a friend, on our exhibit,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:46.170
on the Persian book, and on
the series that we've had

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.600
since that exhibit, series on the
Persian book, Persian literature,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.060
Persian philosophy, and this
year has been the visual arts,

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.820
the Persian visual arts.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.120
Hence, the presence
of Mr. Mehdi Saeedi.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.150
I always do this for our program.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.430
I have to say a few things about
our division, and our division

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.630
in our reading room here,
our reading room is one

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.060
of the 21 reading rooms of
the Library of Congress.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.240
This one is the one
that serves people,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.550
collections from 78
different countries.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.840
We have three sections,
the African section.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.290
So it's the whole continent
of Africa.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.590
We have a Middle East section,
which is quite expansionous,

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.190
which goes from Morocco to Oman.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:56.520
That includes Iran and Turkey but
also Afghanistan, Central Asia,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.620
and the Caucuses, as well
as communities in China

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.790
and in Russia and elsewhere.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:13.580
The focus of our work is not only
that we recommend and acquire books

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.780 position:56%
from all these regions of the
world, and we have a Arabic section,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.120
as I mentioned, Arabic section.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.820
We collect books from
around the world,

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.870
but the focus is on the vernacular.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.650
That is, on the languages
of these regions.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.490
In other words, for the
Arabic section, for example,

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.740
we collect in Hebrew,
in Yiddish, and Latino.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.670
For the Mideast section, we
collect those materials that are

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.650
in the language of the region.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.520
So Persian, Arabic,
Turkish, Armenian, Georgian,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.670
and so many others, and
we collect them here,

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.340
meaning that these are the
collections that produce

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.100
from those countries about those
countries but by writers who write

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.330 position:56%
in the languages of those countries,
and that's very important,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
because we also have collections
in English and French and German

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.140
and Italian of other countries
of other 78 countries,

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.340
but these are part of
the general collection,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.830
and we treasure these materials
which come from all over the world.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.160
We have a big Preservation
Division that takes care of them.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.240
We have manuscripts that
are taken care of as

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.740
if they were newborn babies.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:37.070
We have materials that are
-- that no one else has,

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.680
and we also have regular
publications, books, serials,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.920
journals, et cetera, and we work
cooperatively across the library.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.680
So with divisions such as the
Geography and Map Division,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.640
it has maps of these countries.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.720
With Prints and Photographs,
it has photographs that go back

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.840
to the beginning of photography
about these countries.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.790
With the Law Library that has
the gazettes and those materials.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.130
So if you were to come here, you
would work across the library,

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.620
but this would be the area
also where the specialists are,

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.380
where the languages
are spoken and written,

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.970
and where we have brilliant people
that are Persian specialists.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:29.590
Hirad Dinavari, who has been really
an incredible force in expanding,

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.170
developing our collections
and our programs.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:38.680
We treasure our partners,
and we have been working

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.520
with the University of Maryland,
with Professor Keshavarz

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.440
for several years now,
and all for the good.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.510
We have numerous projects with
them, and this is a way to reach

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:58.650
out to people, to young people who
want to learn about the regions

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.750
and the art and the culture of
the countries that we represent,

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:14.110
and we invite scholars, artists,
writers, thinkers to our division

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.890
to share with us their
ideas, their viewpoints,

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.090
their perspective,
and their research.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.410
Now when they're addressing you,
they're not only addressing you,

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.110
they're addressing the world,
because we videotape our programs.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.290
We put them on the
Library's website,

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:40.190
and then they are accessible across
the board, and I won't say forever,

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.260
but they're there permanently
on our website.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.120
In other words, years from
now, people will still be able

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.460
to access today's speaker's
presentation.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.400
He will be there because
this is the way.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.700
We also advertise.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.810
We now have blogs, and the program
has already appeared on our blog,

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.650
and I know on the University
of Maryland's blog, as well.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:10.090
So we try to reach out to as
many people to get them involved

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.420
and to see what we
have as our treasures.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.980
So I would like now to
introduce our partner.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:26.970
Dr. Fatemeh Keshavarz, who is a
poet, a writer, a great scholar,

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.950
and as I was just telling
her lately, a dynamo in terms

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:37.630
of activities and at times of the
work she's been doing on Iran,

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.990
but let her talk about
her institution.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.790
So thank you.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:47.680
[ Applause ]

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.980
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Thank you

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.060
so much Mary-Jane and
welcome everybody.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.810
It is an absolute pleasure
to have this collaboration.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.350
We haven't found greater friends
than you guys here, and you know,

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.450
it's just mutual everything
you said.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:06.010 position:56%
I'm not going to take a lot of
time, because I know my dear friend,

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.390
Hirad, is going to
introduce the artist.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:12.970
You're going to hear
from a first-class artist

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:18.330
with an amazing talent to
combine letters of the alphabet

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:23.120
and all kinds of artistic movements

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.390
and creative ways of
thinking about them.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:30.170
So, you know, we will let
him speak about his work.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:35.190
Let me just say that in
our traditions, that is,

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.600
I'm now thinking of Middle East
and Africa, an oral tradition,

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.020
an exchange of person-to-person,
has been always

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.340
at the foundation of
all the writing.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.500
So while the writing
is so important,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.100
there are these huge written
treasures that we have here.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.260
The oral dimension of
something going from one person

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.220
to another has always been
honored as a great way of learning.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.970
So we are absolutely
delighted at Roshan Institute

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:11.650
to have this opportunity here at
the Library of Congress to voice

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:15.570
that aspect of our learning
and looking forward to more.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.870
Welcome again.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.720
This is a hard time
of the day to be here.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.740
So we appreciate all of you coming.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.010
Thank you so much.

[ Applause ]

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.020
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Everyone, thank
you very much for your patience.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.450
I also want to add that
this is a joint effort

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.000
between three organizations.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.040
Us, the Library of Congress,
University of Maryland,

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.220
Roshan Institute for
Persian Studies, as well,

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.530
as the [inaudible] Committee,
who has made this possible,

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.890
working with the wonderful
artist, Mehdi Saeedi, who is here.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.730
Mehdi Saeedi is an internationally
known artist and designer based

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.450
in Philadelphia, who
was born in Tehran.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:58.410
His aesthetics have become a
mainstay of design in many parts

00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.800
of the world, especially regions

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.370
that use the Persian
and Arabic scripts.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:10.710
His special focus and proficiency
is in typography and calligraphy,

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:16.890
which leads him to be an expert in
the shaping of letters and the form

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:21.630
of shapes, zoomographic
and graphic design.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.190
Saeedi has taught in
Iranian universities,

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:30.200
as well as held international
workshops, to bring the beauty

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.010
of arts and graphic design to those

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.920
with different linguistic
backgrounds.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:42.020
He exhibited his work in
more than 250 exhibitions

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:48.200
and by annual events worldwide,
and he has attended numerous local

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.430

of Iranian Graphic
Designers Society.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.880
There are several publications
on his collections,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.610
as well as selections
of his artwork.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:24.240
The most recent one of these is
the 2013 published work titled Form

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.200
Contour to Calligraphy.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:31.120
He is featured among 30 designers
in the second edition publication

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.380

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.550
His name is also listed in
Megg's History of Graphic design.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:50.650
Now I can go on and on and on, but
he has a page this big of awards,

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:55.340
and instead of taking time, I'll
just say that I see awards here

00:11:55.340 --> 00:12:00.300
from Ukraine to Taiwan,
of course Iran,

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.640
a whole slew of different
countries and places

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.330
that he has been and won awards in.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.060
Without taking any further
time, I would like to allow him

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:15.010
to show his art [foreign language
spoken], Medhi, please come on.

Good afternoon.

Thank you for coming today.

I'm very glad to be here, and I want
to thank ot the Library of Congress,

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:43.440
who invited me and Mr.
Hirad, especially Mr. Hirad

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.690
and Dr. Keshavarz and
[inaudible] Committee,

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.590
Charuz [assumed spelling],
Mr. Charuz.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:58.940
Okay, when I was little,
I wanted to be a singer.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.780
Back then, I used to be good at it.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:07.570
I had. I had completely forgotten
about it until one month ago,

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:13.370
I got a video for my birthday and I
was surprised to find little Mehdi

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.780
in that video, holding a
microphone and singing into it.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.840
I want to show you the video.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:27.000
Unfortunately, the
file doesn't work here.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:46.360
So that was my dream back then,
and look what's happened to it.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.700
Of course, I'm holding a microphone
right now, but I'm not singing.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.900
I'm lecturing on graphic design.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.930
People do not always live
out their childhood dream,

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.960
but I'm very happy to
be graphic designer.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:02.810
However, these things turn out
differently for my older brother

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.710
who you see in the video.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:10.830
He used to play with the camera
as a kid, and now he's one

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.430
of the best photojournalists
in Iran.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.800
He works for [inaudible]
for the agency.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.940
He was published in the
New York Times, LeMont,

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.040
and other famous magazines.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.410
I'm going to show some of
his works during my lecture.

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:37.570
So anyway, actually, yeah,
this is it, and this is my mom.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:44.710
We go back to the presentation.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:53.760
Okay, I did not live
out my childhood dream,

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.890
but I found many links
between singing

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:58.190
and using a graphic designer.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:04.380
Maybe that is why I will design
many posters for music festival.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:10.690
In fact, my first professional
poster was designed

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:15.650
for the most important
music festival in Iran.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:20.370
The poster was this poster.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.400
The poster was so ingenious
back then, everyone wanted

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.300
to know who the designer was.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:31.370
Another reason the poster
gained widespread attention was

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:39.050
that there are over 100,000
prints in cities all over Iran.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.780
After designing that
poster, I wondered which part

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.790
of graphic design is
should focus on that.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:51.300
First, to give me work prominence
in graphic design, and second,

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.850
I will make a career out of it.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:16:00.780
It was then, I remember
something my professor said.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:08.070
He told me if you want your work to
last, and if you want to gain money

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:15.590
and fame, you just have to do
your job and do it well with love,

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:20.580 position:56%
as if you are not going to get paid.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.880
I heard what I needed
heard from my professor.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.730
I'm a good listener because
what I wanted required patience

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:34.120
and practice, requires a lot.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:40.530
So my Middle East of
places I wanted to work.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:46.230
For example, the Tehran Museum of
Contemporary Art, Academy of Art,

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.150
international film
and music festivals,

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:53.160
and cultural and arts centers.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:17:02.390
After -- at first I went to the
Museum of Contemporary Art Tehran,

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:06.250
which is one of the most important
museums in Tehran in Iran.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.400
After a series of meetings
and visits,

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:14.570
they offered me a commission,
but it was not an easy job.

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:19.510
The manager said they needed
a poster for an exhibition

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.000
for a traditional Chinese painter.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.090
They didn't have any portrait
of her nor picture of her works.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:35.460
They only had a short,
handwritten Persian text.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.680
Here is the text.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.590
Just this.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:46.740
They gave me no information,
and to make matters worse,

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.970
they wanted to design
an invitation card

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:51.310
for the next day, just next day.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:55.190
One day. And I started
working right away.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:59.090
The first things I did
was draw a vertical frame

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:04.530
that reflected the
atmosphere East Asian art.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.170
Then I use the image
on the Internet.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.990
The image, because the
main element of the poster,

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.940
but I feel like I needed
another element.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.380
So I began to design the title
of the exhibition in Farsi.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.560
I decided to rotate
the Persian letters,

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:26.060
so that they remind people
to Chinese characters.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.580
I worked nonstop to
design the poster.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:36.750
This is a result of what I
design in less than 24 hours.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:46.190
The funny things is that designing
the title for that poster led

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:51.850
to the create of the
new Persian font.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:59.460
This is a start of, I want to, you
know, trying to design a typeface,

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:04.000
Farsi type, based on
the Chinese characters.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:12.610 position:56%
As you may know, the Persian letters
alphabet consists of 32 letters,

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.150
and it is written from
the right to the left.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:18.870
The image of the right shows
the separated Persian letters.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:23.580
In the middle, you can see
all of the connected letters.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.700
The last images shows the
sample of the work AGI,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.640
which is a type with the new font.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.890
The creation of this
form led to the series

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:39.280
of new works that I
want to show you.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:46.350
This poster for Turning Point
for the Century British sculpture

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:51.910
of the Tehran Museum
of Contemporary Art.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:58.390
This poster of exhibition
of selected work

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:02.320
by French artist Armando
Pierre Fernandez

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.180
at the Museum of Contemporary art.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.300
This poster was designed

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:13.850
for honoring the famous
Iranian writer [inaudible].

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.830
I designed the writer's face

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:23.040
by considering the sentence he
wrote just before his death.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.750
"I'm going to see you
on Judgment Day."

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:30.940
And surrealistic atmosphere,
as most of his work.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:33.630
The first meeting

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:39.180
for the introducing the Tehran
Cultural Personality of the Year.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.760
Proverb, the proverb.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.880
When is the romance due?

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:52.190
At this point, clients were
getting attracted to my work,

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:56.230
but I didn't want my
work to be repetitive.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:03.560
So after creating the font, you
just sell, I worked on new fonts.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:10.290
I started to do sketches, and
finally, I create my second font.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:19.240
This is the first thing's actually
I did with this font was used it

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.800
in the photo, you know,
for the poster,

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:30.460
invitation part, and book design.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:38.900
I also used the font
on the wall clock.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:43.730
After that, I tried to
use Persian calligraphy

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:50.530
because I think it is the most
important artistic element in Iran.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:56.580
So I added modern and formalistic
calligraphy, not traditional style,

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:02.370
to my work like this,
one of the sketches

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.940
of the poster Iranian Spring.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:10.210
This poster, part of exhibition
of Iranian art in Paris

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.820
and title Iranian Spring.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.810
These images, these
images are a calendar

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.250
of calligraphy painting
on paperboard.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:28.840
This is a book cover for
Chefs Like Grandmas by one

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.000
of the great [inaudible]
of the [inaudible],

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:47.280
and these are the images
from the inside of the book.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.330
Okay, the late [inaudible] was one

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:54.610
of the most famous
sculptor from Iran.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:59.470
I designed a poster with the
typography that expresses his work

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.690
and also also his physical
appearance.

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.630
As you can see, he's a big guy.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:11.080
The color and texture of the
poster are also associated

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.660
with his sculpture.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:22.380
This is the book cover was done
for Persian [inaudible] Proverb.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.230
I'm in Love.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:33.360
This is the title actually.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:39.390
I designed his work to honor
Turkish poet Yunus Emre.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:42.150
His poetry is romantic and minimal.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:44.460
In this poster, I use
the word [foreign word],

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.790 position:56%
meaning in Persian, love in Persian.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.010
Since his poems were minimalistic,

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.380
I eliminated the word
[foreign word] itself,

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.570
and keep the five dots instead.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:05.390
As you see, this work very close
to formalistic calligraphy,

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:10.410
pure from without any
specific shapes.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:16.490
Later I thought, how can
I convey Iranian symbols,

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:21.730
and at the same time,
attracted not Iranian audiences?

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:25.700
I wanted my work to be
understandable for all

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.870 position:56%
of the people, not just for Iranian.

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:35.040 position:56%
You know, this image is most
important, you know, visual element.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:40.220
Yet you can communicate
with everyone.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:47.570
Even when a child sees a picture,
he or she can easily understand it

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:52.360
or consider people who don't
know how to read and write.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.530
Even those people can read images.

00:24:55.530 --> 00:25:01.530
Therefore, I did some research on
traditional calligraphy and image.

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:10.960
I found my answer to all of my
questions in looking at work

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.490
from 14th century,

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:18.340 position:56%
when calligraphers used the
writing symbol in the pictorial form

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:22.800
and had a static religious
objective.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.280
That was just what
I was looking for.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.010
It was both calligraphy and images.

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:32.200
Something that everyone
could understand,

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.330
but here, the size a challenge.

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:43.080
If I were to do the same things,
it wouldn't be considering new art.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.940
So I explored new metals.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:50.190
The results are I want to show you.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.700
These images are related
to the the sketches

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.900
for the poster nine Iranian
graphic design [inaudible],

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.370
and this is the final works.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:11.950
Yes, this [inaudible], and on
the cover, Ecotimes Magazine,

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:21.380
for honoring 400 years
of publication,

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:30.800
novel Don Quixote and
also billboard.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.000
For international music festivals.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.310
[foreign name] is one of the
most outstanding Iranian musician

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.000
and calligrapher of
the 13th century.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.660
Since he was known as a
creator of the timbre,

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:08.500
an Iranian musical instrument
and a great calligrapher,

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:14.250
I tried to design his -- because
people were playing timbre

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:18.750
by calligraphic writing
with his name.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.210
Shiraz, Persian paradise.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.760
It was designed for the Shiraz Art

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:33.000
and Cultural Exhibition
in the France.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:39.240
This poster involved in an
exhibition of the paintings

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:45.850
of three Iranian women
entitled Three Iranian Looks.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.150
This is sketches of Garden of Iran.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:28:00.380 position:56%
The theme of the poster in Garden of
Iran, patience, wisdom, new vision.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.510
It was designed for an
exhibition with same title

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.660
for the Tehran Museum
of Contemporary Art,

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:15.100
and this is the final work.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.300
[inaudible] is at the well bottom.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:22.660
This work was designed based
on concept of Iranian proverb

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:28.460
that means when a person
creates a problem for others,

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.810
he himself will be troubled later.

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:37.960
The [inaudible] Festival.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.080
This is a poster for the
[inaudible] Festival.

most famous Persian poets

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:47.890
who wrote many [inaudible].

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:53.710
He's also close friend of the Rumi.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:57.870
Eastern, my exhibition in
Missouri of State University.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:05.700
Rumi 800th Birthday Celebration.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.060
The poster was [inaudible].

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:11.250
I want to show you the
process of my work here.

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:21.670
You can see, and this is a final.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:29.000
2012 years, a dragon.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:38.000
Iranian traditional
music in Australia.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.580
The First International Conferences
of Architecture and Globalization,

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:49.430

shopkeepers also participated.

Persian calligraphy,

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:40.510

canvas or through graphic design.

His work is focused on the
balance of images, and thus,

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:32.830
he has introduced a mirror
as the symbol of reality,

00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:35.000
to strengthen the denotation
of symmetry.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.210
The Book of Kings is a mirror of
Iran's ancient myths and legends

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:41.110
with accounts of major
events in its past.

00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:44.530
In this new series,
Medhi tries to emphasize

00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:46.700
that even though the mirror
is the symbol of reality,

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:50.510
it does not always
reflect what is real.

00:51:50.510 --> 00:52:06.040
[ Music ]

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.490
At first glance, when one
looks at the canvas alone,

00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:11.940
the viewer perceives an ambiguous
and somewhat abstract image.

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:15.440
However, after viewing both,
the artwork with its reflection

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:20.650
from the right angle, the
characters become vividly apparent.

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:24.510

Thank you everyone for coming.

I know that we are at 1, but
I would like to allot him

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:41.360
at least five minutes of questions.

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:46.060
Feel free to ask any questions,
and I would direct it to him,

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:49.980
and please speak loudly, since
there's only on microphone here.

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:51.280
Go ahead.

00:52:51.280 --> 00:53:11.930
&gt;&gt; You said that when you saw
that 10th century image made

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:21.300
out of calligraphy, you
had found the answer

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:24.200
to all the questions [inaudible].

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.320
I mean, I know calligraphy
is beautiful and [inaudible],

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:34.490 position:56%
but it kind surprised me, because it
seemed like you're always exploring

00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:38.080 position:56%
and going to new things [inaudible].

00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:44.780
So how did that to suddenly become
like the answer to everything?

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:50.910
&gt;&gt;Mehdi Saeedi: Actually, I
was looking for some way to,

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:56.540
as I told you in the lecture, to
communicate with the audience.

00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:00.460
You know, the image's
biggest and important part.

00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:06.870
So based on that, I'm just trying
to find something different

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:12.450
and somethings new, but I
don't want to, you know,

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:15.200
forget my culture and background.

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:21.310 position:56%
That's because, as I told you, the
Iranian calligraphy, it's, you know,

00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:23.510
it's the biggest things
in our culture.

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:25.550
So based on that, I just thought,

00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:29.170
"How can I use [inaudible] use
the Persian and images together?"

00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:32.970
And after that, I found it, you
know, this way, and after that,

00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:36.710
I tried to, in a graphic
design, because graphic design,

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:40.440
you have to communicate
with your audience.

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:46.960
So based on that, for example, if I
want to work for a music festival,

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.260
I'm just trying to writing.

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:54.530
I made a picture based
on the calligraphy,

00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:55.970
and at the same times can
communicate with the audience,

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:57.270
and also, you know, you
can see and you can feel

00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:58.570
about somethings about the music.
