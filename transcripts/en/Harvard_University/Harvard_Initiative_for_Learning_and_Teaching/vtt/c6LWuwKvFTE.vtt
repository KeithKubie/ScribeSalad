00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.416
Hi, I'm Sarah Grafman,
I'm here from HarvardX.

00:00:08.416 --> 00:00:10.750
I'm Sejal Vashi, I'm here
from the the Harvard TH Sam

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.180
School of Public Health.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.951
And we have some
guests who would

00:00:14.951 --> 00:00:16.740
like to introduce themselves.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.184
We're just-- microphones
for recording.

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:22.090
Yeah, we're just as
loud without them.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.540
Randy King, I'm a
professor of cell biology

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.161
at the medical
school, and do a lot

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:30.580
of teaching in the first
year curriculum over there.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.275
I'm Peter Boy, I
teach Chinese history

00:00:32.275 --> 00:00:34.720
in the department of East
Asian language and civilization

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.031
in the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences.

00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:39.405
Thank you both for agreeing
to participate in this today,

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.870
and thank you all
for coming today.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.965
So as you know, we're here to
talk about failure and success.

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.090
I'm glad we're recording
this for posterity's sake,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.089
though also I'm aware
that talking about failure

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.080
can be an uncomfortable thing.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.109
So please know that what's
talked about in here,

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:58.900
we're not going to go
off into the hallways

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.190
and talk about everybody, "oh
can you believe he did that?"

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.620
It's going to stay in this room.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.620
And so we wanted to start
this by acknowledging,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.905
mostly we talk about failure
in an educational context,

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:13.300
we usually talk about
student failure.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.790
What does failure mean when
you think about the students

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.760
that some of you teach?

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.335
Feel free to just shout
out or raise your hands.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.161
When a student is
failing, what do you do?

00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:28.466
Harvard students don't fail.

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:29.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.490
Okay then.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.180
Average grade is an A minus.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.700
They can't fail.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.590
I did see some hands this
morning when asked people give,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.320
I think it was D's.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.510
Has anyone here encountered
a student that is possibly

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.780
failing, approaching failure?

00:01:49.786 --> 00:01:50.660
Folks, just want to--

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.070
please share.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.560
Well I teach Spanish
language classes,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.990
[INAUDIBLE] the
closest to failure

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.680
is when you see a student
stop attending class,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.990
because we teach all
in section, we're

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.139
acutely aware of our numbers.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.669
There's failure when
they just stop showing up

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.880
and stop even trying,
what about failure--

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.476
That's not necessarily
the same thing.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.570
Tell me more, please.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.872
Sometimes there are
extenuating circumstances,

00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:26.720
personal circumstances
that have nothing

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.870
to do with the
student's motivation.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.870
Any other tales of -- yes?

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.620
We have, at the medical
school, students every year

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.425
who fail in objective
structured clinical exam

00:02:42.425 --> 00:02:44.690
of their clinical skills.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.495
And then, you know, have to
assign some sort of remediation

00:02:49.495 --> 00:02:51.810
if they actually haven't
been able to demonstrate

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.730
that they've learned core
things that every graduating med

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.190
student is supposed to know.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.020
And every year we have
a handful of them.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.200
Certain, sort of,
educational cultures,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.520
there are more opportunities
where you're going to fail.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.340
Others, life circumstances
might take you out of it.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.360
Sometimes failure sort of
means that you're challenged,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.970
you're trying, you're just
not quite getting there.

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:24.070
Do you think that's what you
think about when you think

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.210
about failing successfully?

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.920
When a student is
trying to do something

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.836
they haven't done before,
and they don't quite

00:03:28.836 --> 00:03:31.080
know the steps to do it?

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.301
Does anyone have any
examples of that?

00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:35.800
Whether it's in a current class
or in the past or maybe even

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.280
your own experience
as a student.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.460
Well, [INAUDIBLE] training for
staff and alumni development

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.837
But I also teach in
the extension school

00:03:50.837 --> 00:03:52.696
and in the strategic
management program,

00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:54.910
and we have students
who come from a variety

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.615
of different
backgrounds, many of whom

00:03:57.615 --> 00:04:00.930
haven't been in school in
a long time, many of whom

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.090
have incredibly
successful careers

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.280
but are now coming
back for a degree,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.870
and I have had students who
were very successful in one area

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.765
are now coming to the
management program

00:04:12.765 --> 00:04:16.400
because they've achieved
a degree of success

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.750
in a functional
area or as managers,

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.731
and sometimes they don't have
a finance background, finance

00:04:22.731 --> 00:04:23.230
skills.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.662
And they take this
class [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:25.662 --> 00:04:27.060
strategic management.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.660
And they have sort
of the prerequisites

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.184
that they took many years
ago, but they're really not

00:04:33.184 --> 00:04:34.350
up to speed in those skills.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.016
In those skills.

00:04:35.016 --> 00:04:38.360
And they're very committed and
dedicated and they do struggle.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.148
And it's exactly what you
described, they're motivated

00:04:41.148 --> 00:04:46.760
and they're invested,
but they just don't it's

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.555
something out of
their comfort zone.

00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:54.150
And so they have to put in a
lot of effort as to why to help.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.671
Thank you for that story.

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:57.170
Yes, please.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.480
Well, I'm going to out
myself as a student.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.960
I recently took an extension
school class where I got great

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.230
grades, like an A+
average for the class.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.495
When I tried to apply those
skills outside of the class,

00:05:11.495 --> 00:05:12.900
just nothing.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.880
Could not, like I knew how
to answer all the questions,

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.940
I could not apply
it outside of class.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.404
That was probably
for a lot of reasons.

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.320
It's one other kind of
failure, where you look

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.864
successful but in the end--

00:05:27.864 --> 00:05:29.780
Thank you, that's actually
a great transition,

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.680
because while I think as
folks who work as educators,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.890
you sort of sometimes do
encounter students who

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.269
are struggling and who
are potentially failing,

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:39.810
but actually our
focus today is going

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.170
to be a lot more on
how we take risks

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.140
and the opportunities
for failure and success

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.245
that come with that.

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:47.870
And with that I'm
going to hand it over

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.230
to Sejal who's going to give
everyone a chance to fail.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.945
So in light of
failure, I'm going

00:05:53.945 --> 00:05:55.695
to tell you guys about
my personal failure

00:05:55.695 --> 00:05:56.708
a few years ago.

00:05:56.708 --> 00:05:58.416
My freshman year of
college, my roommates

00:05:58.416 --> 00:06:01.760
decided that A's and
F's go on the fridge.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.510
The first and only F was
mine, and it stayed up there

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.644
for a very long time.

00:06:06.644 --> 00:06:08.060
But again, it was
this environment

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.160
where we got to fail, and they
were excited to support me

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.688
in my failure.

00:06:13.688 --> 00:06:15.896
I still remember it was an
ecology, evolution and bio

00:06:15.896 --> 00:06:17.590
class.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.780
So now I'm hoping that
you guys fail with me.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.940
I'm asking for five
to six volunteers,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.420
it is going to require kneeling.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.180
If you can join us in
the back of the room

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.490
that would be great.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.670
If you've done a helium
stick exercise, please

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.500
do not volunteer.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.770
So question for those of
you who decided to do this,

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.370
why were you willing
to take the risk?

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.040
To help you out to
a certain extent.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.256
It's uncomfortable to
be in front of people

00:06:46.256 --> 00:06:47.630
and be waiting,
waiting, waiting.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.950
And I learned from
my colleague, you

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.075
don't have to tell your
right from your left, which

00:06:51.075 --> 00:06:54.010
I fail at.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.617
Thanks, anyone else
who agreed to do this?

00:06:56.617 --> 00:06:58.700
For those of you who didn't
want to take the risk,

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.241
why didn't you want
to take the risk?

00:07:00.241 --> 00:07:01.635
Kneeling.

00:07:01.635 --> 00:07:03.968
[LAUGHTER] That's why I wanted
to tell you ahead of time

00:07:03.968 --> 00:07:05.460
it does require kneeling.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.780
So, first thing,
willing to take a risk,

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.180
this is an environment
where at least five of you

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.572
felt comfortable
taking the risk.

00:07:13.572 --> 00:07:15.655
For those of you that
didn't, and for those of you

00:07:15.655 --> 00:07:17.446
that were watching,
what do you think would

00:07:17.446 --> 00:07:18.550
have helped them not fail?

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.180
More instruction?

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.150
More instruction.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.320
Going slowly.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.590
Going slowly.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.930
And practice.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.330
Practice.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.830
Communicating
amongst themselves.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.442
Communicating.

00:07:31.442 --> 00:07:32.560
Less constraints.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.060
Sorry?

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.982
Less constraints.

00:07:33.982 --> 00:07:35.791
Less constraints.

00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:36.290
Preparation.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.936
Preparation.

00:07:37.936 --> 00:07:39.435
And I know there
are some people who

00:07:39.435 --> 00:07:41.201
had done this
exercise, because when

00:07:41.201 --> 00:07:42.701
I was like if you've
done it before,

00:07:42.701 --> 00:07:45.370
you can't be a volunteer.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.530
What if they had been able
to tell you some tips on what

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.670
to do and what to expect?

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:55.255
So it's going to be our second
take away for today, is support

00:07:55.255 --> 00:07:57.540
and where to get it.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.330
And then, finally,
those of you that did

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.850
do it, what did you
learn right away?

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.690
Or even if you just saw them.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.230
More instruction helpful.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.210
More instruction helpful,
what did the stick

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.100
do that you weren't expecting?

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.092
You said it.

00:08:16.092 --> 00:08:17.530
It went faster.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.015
It went way faster than
you'd think it would go.

00:08:20.015 --> 00:08:23.380
So now knowing that, do you
think you could pass it?

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.238
If you were given a
couple more tries?

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:29.615
Maybe.

00:08:29.615 --> 00:08:30.710
So, yeah?

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.465
I guess I was
interested, why didn't we

00:08:32.465 --> 00:08:33.530
stop and talk to one another?

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.809
Like it was sort of interesting,
we weren't specifically told

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:38.309
that we couldn't talk to one
another, we were all out there,

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.419
we were given a task it
was clearly a joint task,

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.049
yet we chose to do
it as individuals,

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:47.476
and if we had just
stopped for a minute

00:08:47.476 --> 00:08:49.850
and actually spoken
to one another

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.730
I think we probably could
have done it successfully.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:58.070
So the circumstance
was that the teacher

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.560
was there watching
you and overlooking,

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.240
so that, in some sense,
your relationship was not

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.920
to each other, but was to
the teacher who was present.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.640
And so, if she had walked
away and stood up here,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.190
and turned her back
to you, would you

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.760
have talked to each other?

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.800
There's still a barrier, right?

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.037
Like I have this kind of
automatic relationship with you

00:09:24.037 --> 00:09:26.120
all, because you're telling
me about the exercise,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.520
even if you're not telling
me about the exercise.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.480
But I don't know my colleagues.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.086
And just that small fact can
prevent some simple sharing.

00:09:36.086 --> 00:09:37.960
So in a sense, you're
doing the same activity

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.876
but working in a silo.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.776
I was just curious,
you said helium stick

00:09:43.776 --> 00:09:47.700
and I wanted to say, why is
it called a helium stick,

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.886
now I know why.

00:09:48.886 --> 00:09:51.360
It's lighter than you
would think it would be.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.570
But if you had even just
paused and basically said,

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.130
take one minute
before you start,

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.590
that would have created the
same kind of uncomfortableness

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.860
that would have led
the conversation.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.890
So normally this exercise
is used to teach leadership

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.150
and eventually as
the more you do it,

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.450
someone is going to come
about and be a leader, start

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.160
communicating, but
I actually like

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.140
it better as an
exercise of failure

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.392
and how to learn from that.

00:10:16.392 --> 00:10:18.350
So again, we're going to
go through these three

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:19.790
takeaways towards
the end as well,

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.796
but basically, take the risk.

00:10:21.796 --> 00:10:23.420
What's going to make
you take the risk?

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.675
Get support, and what
are you learning from it.

00:10:25.675 --> 00:10:27.050
So with that,
we're going to have

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.575
you guys turn into your tables.

00:10:30.575 --> 00:10:32.450
So please just introduce
yourself to everyone

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.991
at the table, we're
going to a couple

00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:35.445
of things in our small groups.

00:10:35.445 --> 00:10:36.800
Introduce yourself to
the people at the table

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.304
and just take a
moment to discuss

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.220
a recent failure you
might be willing to share

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:40.845
with the group.

00:10:40.845 --> 00:10:43.610
You shared your A's
and F on the fringe.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.280
Just this morning I
opened the refrigerator

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.230
and found that the bread I'm
making for Rosh Hashana tonight

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:53.460
had overflowed from the bowl
I'd put it in last night.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.434
So I had to do some
quick fixing of that,

00:10:56.434 --> 00:10:58.850
and we'll see what it's like
when I come home later today.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.270
So, just take a moment, turn
and introduce yourselves,

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.190
and just talk about a recent
failure you feel comfortable

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.342
chatting about.

00:11:05.342 --> 00:11:08.110
Just take about five
minutes for this.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:09.870
Thank you all for
sharing your stories,

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.120
I feel like I
heard some pretty--

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.690
from silly to heavy things.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.600
So thank you all
for contributing.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.790
Peter's now going to share with
everyone a story about taking

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.230
risks in his teaching.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.090
So this is a story
that I realized

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.770
only today was supposed
to end with success,

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.820
but I'm going to talk
about abysmal failure.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:39.520
And I'll take around five to ten
minutes to tell you the story.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:45.239
So, I've been teaching
with a colleague a course--

00:11:45.239 --> 00:11:47.280
sort of a general introduction
to Chinese history

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.850
from antiquity from the
Neolithic into the present,

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:56.290
for around well, over
25 years I think.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:02.230
And turned out, I studied
abroad so I had never

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.860
been in a lecture
course, so I had no idea

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.690
what a lecture course was
and so I had to do it myself.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.550
It turned out I was
a very good lecturer.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.170
Surprised me,
surprised everyone.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:19.690
Yeah it really surprised
everyone else in my department.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.900
So we went along, and
at a certain moment

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.630
we thought, back
in the early 90s,

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.270
what you could do
with a website.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:31.270
We thought about ways in
which we could use the web

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:35.530
to give students different
ways, interactive ways,

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.530
of engaging with history and
seeing things for themselves.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.490
To make points that
we wanted to make.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.040
The central point
we wanted to make

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.050
was that China was not
a unit of analysis,

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.560
except at the political level.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.690
That thinking about it as a
single culture was mistaken,

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:54.280
thinking about all peoples being
the same, thinking about them

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.910
all being, as an email from
one of the students in our DCE

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:02.620
course said, worker bees and
ants who have no individuality.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.620
And we tried to break down
assumptions like that.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.820
So, from there, having
worked on the website

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.120
with people who
are just beginning

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:19.572
to do that at Harvard, and then
DCE said you could take an FAS

00:13:19.572 --> 00:13:22.030
course and you could put it
online as well, so that's cool,

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.000
let's do that.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.150
Because we found what
when we had the website,

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.000
we actually had more
students outside of Harvard

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.130
than inside of Harvard,
and they were more

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.860
engaged actually
with the website

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.166
than Harvard students were.

00:13:33.166 --> 00:13:35.040
Because Harvard students
were very motivated,

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.700
said tell me what
the assignment is I

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:41.150
will go and do exactly that,
and no more very often.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:45.250
So we got to the
DCE course and there

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.500
are ways of doing that,
they'd film us then

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.320
we'd have online
sections with the TF,

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.840
but in the course of
that, the TFs were

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.340
sort of interested
in what you could

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.900
do with digital
stuff, kept saying,

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.030
there's so much more we
could do, we should be doing.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:05.170
And, being somewhat lazy, my
colleague and I didn't do it.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.340
But then we heard about
this HarvardX thing

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.660
that was beginning.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.110
And we said, I happen to
be chair of a committee

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.620
where I was sitting
next to a person who

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.140
had a lot of authority
over HarvardX,

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.530
and I said, you know, if you
would let us take our China

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.990
course, our Chinese
history course,

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:30.235
and do it as an online course,
if you devote the resource

00:14:30.235 --> 00:14:32.164
to that, we'll devote the time.

00:14:32.164 --> 00:14:33.830
Because this will be
a chance, actually,

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.070
to realize the
promise of this course

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.520
that we could do so
much more digitally

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.420
online and really do right
by our online students.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.750
That was the idea behind it.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.560
And so we began, and
I actually offered

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.110
a new undergraduate
course in, how

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:53.890
do we turn Chinese
history into a MOOC,

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:57.150
and it was right at the
beginning of HarvardX

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.230
we had no guidance,
no constraints, very

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.960
little support, and
so we just went wild.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.280
The course last
18 months, right?

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:10.230
It has 50 modules, had to be
divided into 10 mini courses,

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:15.140
but we have 500,000
people registering for it.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.585
In fact, as far as I can
tell from the figures I

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.490
got the other day,
we've had more students

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.760
in that course, and more
people completing it,

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.010
than any course except CS-50.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.594
So, that was a real success.

00:15:29.594 --> 00:15:31.010
So we said, well,
what we're going

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.282
to do is we actually want this
to have real value at Harvard,

00:15:34.282 --> 00:15:35.740
and we're going to
take this course

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.420
and we're going to
flip the classroom

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:42.090
and what that means is, we have
our lectures have been done

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.730
and the HarvardX style is what's
called a chunk and test style.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.790
You know, people's attention
wanders after five or six

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.650
minutes you've got
to tell a joke,

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:55.840
and then you put an assessment,
you say, are you awake still?

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.660
You'll push this button or
multiple choice question,

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.070
or write a sentence or two.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.000
And so we said, we'll do
that with our students.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.380
We'll take our lectures,
and we'll put them on--

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.950
they'll just use NX platform,
the HarvardX platform,

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.590
they'll do that and then when
they come to class, rather

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.290
than us lecturing for
three hours a week

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.270
with a fourth hour
of section, we

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.575
will use that class time to
engage with the students.

00:16:19.575 --> 00:16:20.950
The students always
say they want

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:22.450
to engage with the
professors, we're

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.030
going to engage with the
students, really intensively.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:26.560
We'll have
discussion, we'll have

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.710
things to read and
discuss, my colleague

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.616
had some cool HBS
cases to bring in,

00:16:33.616 --> 00:16:35.740
and he wouldn't have to
lecture anymore, because he

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.900
was a boring lecturer.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.250
When he lectured,
50% of the students

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.500
would disappear within a week.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.170
So we went ahead with that.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:51.589
Now, we didn't quite understand
that if-- but of course,

00:16:51.589 --> 00:16:53.380
since we wanted students
to get the lecture

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.940
we required them
to do it, and we

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.640
said you have to do it
before you come to class,

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.310
and sometimes that meant two
or three hours of modules

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.740
before you came to class.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:02.730
And you had to do
the assessments,

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.938
and we knew because if you
didn't do the assessments,

00:17:04.938 --> 00:17:06.670
that was 20% of your grade.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:13.180
And failure to do that on time
put you in a lot of jeopardy.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.790
So we just thought
this was great,

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.873
we were going to spend our
time with our students,

00:17:16.873 --> 00:17:18.940
we said to our TFs, "You
guys still get paid,

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.650
but we're not going
to have sections,

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.280
because we are teaching the
students the section ourselves.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.824
The professors are going to
be doing all the teaching."

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.320
So this is a class that had
student ratings in the Q Guide,

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.980
like 4.4, things
like that, where

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:41.930
I had these fantastic ratings
in the Q guide for my lecturing.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:47.150
I think I got, after
the end of this, 2.6.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:51.860
In the Q Guide world, this is
like really, really dismal,

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.510
going downhill.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:57.190
And the students really
disliked the course.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:02.360
And we saw an immediate
drop in enrollment of 50%.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:07.290
And my friend, my colleague,
who offered some HBS cases

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:08.800
and taught them
in the HBS style,

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.830
he did extremely well with that.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.050
So our relationship reversed.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.290
For 20 years he had to
get scores behind me,

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.070
he's a very competitive guy.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.680
And now all of a sudden he had
to look at me and the staff

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.760
management, "It's all right,
you know, you'll get over this."

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.020
And so that was just--

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.900
why did it happen?

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.190
So that's the first question we
asked, so what happened here?

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:35.520
Because we thought we
were doing a good thing.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.020
Well, we discovered
a couple things.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.380
One is, the graduate
students were unhappy,

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.390
because they were being
deprived of a chance

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:45.560
to interact with students
and be teachers themselves.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.750
The students were unhappy,
because they actually

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.460
appreciate talking
to graduate students

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.200
more than the professors.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.690
That's sort of the culture
they've been brought up

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:57.380
in here at the college.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:01.200
They were unhappy
because we cold called.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.297
We explained the logic
behind cold calling,

00:19:04.297 --> 00:19:05.630
but they were unhappy with that.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.340
And then the other
thing we found

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.640
was that of course they
did the assessments,

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.860
but that meant that they
had to keep going back

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:21.350
over the online lecture to make
sure they got the answer right.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:26.470
And to get the answer right,
they had to spend more time.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:30.420
All of a sudden, their time
on task outside of the class

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.670
doubled.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.746
They were unhappy.

00:19:34.746 --> 00:19:36.370
And they let us know
they were unhappy,

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.490
and students make a
choice, and they walked.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.770
So that was bad for the
study of Chinese history.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.470
If part of your goal
is to get students

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:50.350
to know about Chinese history
and to think analytically

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.290
about it, that was bad.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.290
It was bad for us
because it hurt our egos,

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.800
and you can make all
sorts of justifications,

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.670
the students do need
to do more work,

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.530
but they can choose not to.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.606
It wasn't a required course.

00:20:05.606 --> 00:20:06.980
We know from some
flipped courses

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.589
that are required courses that
they're really successful.

00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:13.130
In terms of learning outcomes,
often the students liked them.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:16.970
But this was an elective,
it wasn't a required course.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:20.100
So that's a story
of abysmal failure.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:25.205
And we made some adjustments,
we put back in sections.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:34.110
But still, I can't say that--

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:38.310
things have not been good.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.426
They would much prefer
to have a lecture,

00:20:40.426 --> 00:20:42.270
and I'm very good
at giving lectures.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:43.560
Right?

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:51.180
So, we're not going to continue
the course and the new Gen Ed

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:55.916
program, it doesn't really fit
the Gen Ed standards anyway.

00:20:55.916 --> 00:20:57.540
It's a terrible way
to end your career,

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.539
to think that a course--

00:20:58.539 --> 00:21:00.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:03.480
That you've just failed.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.470
So you want success out of this.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.920
How do we measure success?

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.550
Well, one way that we didn't
talk about enough this morning

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:16.210
is, surely a measure of success
has to be what students learn.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.450
Not whether they like us.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:20.760
Do students learn more
when they go through this?

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.020
Yes.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.660
Do they have to do more
work to learn more?

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.740
Yes.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.840
So there is an
comment right here

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.340
where you say if I do
more time I'll do better,

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.450
but I don't want
to do more time.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.751
I have my notion of what a core
curriculum course, a Gen Ed

00:21:37.751 --> 00:21:39.750
course should be, how
many hours it should cost,

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.790
and you changed the rules on me.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.650
So those students who
were on the first course

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:47.880
have now all graduated,
and this year,

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.140
all of a sudden, our
enrollments doubled.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.940
And I said, wow, so how
do we account for this?

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.190
Not only did they double,
but the students are active

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.480
and they're enthusiastic
and we have this full room

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.030
and you know just constant
discussion and cold calling,

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:07.410
no one gets upset by
that, it's just wonderful.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.570
And so we said, you
know what it is?

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:16.500
It's the new generation
of students are used to,

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.580
are more accepting of online
stuff, of flipped classrooms,

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.920
of hyper blended learning,
that's what it is.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.350
And the guys who
remember what it

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.510
used to be like in
the old days are gone.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.810
And so students come in and
they're having a good time

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.030
and it's just great.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.512
And so I said that has to be--

00:22:35.512 --> 00:22:37.595
I have no evidence that's
the solution of course--

00:22:37.595 --> 00:22:39.610
but has to be the solution.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:44.530
And then, I was talking
to the staff member

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.950
who runs the
undergraduate program

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.830
and said, no, I'm afraid not.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.330
She said, you know,
they're changing

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:55.302
the requirements for
undergraduates from the old Gen

00:22:55.302 --> 00:22:58.330
Ed to the new Gen Ed, and so the
freshman and sophomores don't

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.140
have to do it, but the
juniors and seniors

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.050
have to fulfill requirements
of the old days.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:07.210
That explains your
doubling in enrollments.

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:09.880
But what I will
say, I guess this

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.760
is my nod in the
direction of success,

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.980
is that the engagement
with the students

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:21.500
in that hour and a half
section has been really quite

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.500
extraordinary this year.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.125
Better than anything
we've seen before.

00:23:24.125 --> 00:23:28.030
But that may just be a
function of having a full room.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.965
So at the moment, I
don't know whether it's

00:23:29.965 --> 00:23:31.100
a success or failure yet.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.070
Thank you so much
for sharing that.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.630
And at the least
from your failure

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:45.920
came a successful sharing
with the room right here.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.920
Yeah, if it matters to you.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.610
Yes.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:50.110
So I'll actually
ask everyone again,

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.930
to go back into
your small groups.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:55.880
And just take a moment
again to reflect,

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.830
and I don't know what you talked
about in your small groups

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.130
before, if you talked about sort
of more personal little things,

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.960
but if you could take a moment
and, thank you again to Peter

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.610
for really sharing,
reflect on a failure

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.020
in your professional life.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.100
Something that didn't go the
way you thought it would,

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.017
and what lessons--

00:24:13.017 --> 00:24:14.600
did you just say,
oh that didn't work,

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.016
I'm never trying
it again, or what

00:24:16.016 --> 00:24:17.970
lessons learned came from that?

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.180
And we'll take just
about five or so minutes

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.334
to reflect on that.

00:24:22.334 --> 00:24:23.750
And also thinking
about maybe some

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.569
risks that you
haven't yet taken.

00:24:25.569 --> 00:24:27.110
Risks that didn't
work well and risks

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.520
that you haven't yet taken.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:33.320
So, thank you, and just
take a moment to gather.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.610
So you guys probably all
had different stories,

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.970
we just wanted to see, what
are some commonalities that

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:40.187
came about from your tables?

00:24:40.187 --> 00:24:42.020
So anyone willing to
share out what you guys

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.730
noticed about your failures?

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.650
Any, kind of, aha moments?

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.710
Any common failures
that you tend to have?

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.370
Common support that you need?

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:51.690
Any of that sort.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.570
This is not really an
answer to your question.

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:58.550
That's cool.

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.490
But we had a question
about, you know,

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:05.970
you said you were a really good
lecturer, what does that mean?

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.335
In terms of students learning
if that's a measure of success,

00:25:09.335 --> 00:25:12.046
the lecture isn't necessarily
the most effective way

00:25:12.046 --> 00:25:14.530
but honestly, I
like a good lecture,

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:18.500
so it seems complicated so
I'm just curious how you--

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.760
So when I'm lecturing, I can
tell whether the students

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.227
are understanding right away.

00:25:25.227 --> 00:25:27.060
I can tell from whether
it's getting across,

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.560
whether my explanation
is working or not.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.730
And so I want it to work.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.470
I want them to
understand, right?

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:34.970
And so if they're
not understanding,

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:38.090
I know I've done a bad job.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.210
The second thing is that,
they should be so caught up

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:43.560
in the problem, or whatever
it is you're talking about,

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.370
that they can start
to anticipate,

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:47.831
and sometimes
spontaneously a question

00:25:47.831 --> 00:25:50.570
is coming out of the audience.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:55.740
And that engagement with that
story is really important.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:01.680
And then-- but I shouldn't
take up this time.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.050
Anybody else?

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:09.000
You guys can ask
questions, I don't mind.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.570
I think we were struck by
the lack of commonality

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.840
in our discussion.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:20.300
Other tables also had a
similar lack of commonalities?

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:29.480
I was just-- if I'm
summarizing correctly--

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:40.470
A professor might try a
novel approach and students,

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:46.740
for whatever reason, maybe
fear failure or just fear

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:52.680
of novelty, don't react
well to the faculty's ideas

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.020
and approach and
novel situation.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:03.042
And is that because the scenario
is challenging or is not

00:27:03.042 --> 00:27:03.750
well thought out?

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.100
Or is it just the students
that are afraid of novelty?

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:12.740
Pose that question to you guys.

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:13.946
Thoughts on--

00:27:13.946 --> 00:27:20.840
I was thinking that one of
the things that's coming out

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.400
is like there are a lot
of different ways to fail.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.822
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:25.822 --> 00:27:28.714
Are there any commonalities
or categories?

00:27:28.714 --> 00:27:33.460
It did seem like one is
mismatches of expectations.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.740
And the whole
question of whether we

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.670
could reduce failure and
have more success by thinking

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:42.910
about expectation setting
in a more sophisticated way,

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:46.570
whether it's giving instructions
for your very first exercise,

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:48.874
or the fact that the
expectations of those students,

00:27:48.874 --> 00:27:51.415
they're thinking it should be
like the old curriculum instead

00:27:51.415 --> 00:27:52.373
of the new or whatever.

00:27:52.373 --> 00:27:54.690
I don't know if
that's a category.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:57.570
That's great.

00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:59.750
I actually have an reflection.

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:01.700
I teach language,
beginners Spanish,

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:05.700
so the failures are
related to the grammar

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.620
and the explanations
and all that.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:11.170
But I always have this idea of--

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:14.530
How we approach the
failure of the students

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:18.640
because we failed to explain
to them properly what they--

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.520
I see that when I grade a quiz,
and say oh no, I did it wrong.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.490
It's my fault.
That's a moment where

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:28.860
you say, how do I do this.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.490
I mean, grammar is easy, I don't
know about all the disciplines,

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:34.120
language is easy to do.

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.258
I know, but-- I don't
know what you think.

00:28:41.202 --> 00:28:42.188
Reflections on that?

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.819
Just, a little bit of
what you're saying--

00:28:50.819 --> 00:28:52.610
piggy backing off of
what Peter was saying,

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.870
our small table
discussion, I think

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:57.650
a commonalty is the success
part of the failure, right?

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.630
And it requires a
vulnerability just

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.960
to take a look at, whether
it's Q scores or attendance,

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.870
and wonder why, and not
just wondering but actively

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:07.900
go after why, and
to keep digging

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.620
until you can get that answer.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.520
You know, whether you are a
faculty member, an instructor,

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.526
or an academic
professional, you know,

00:29:16.526 --> 00:29:17.900
opening yourself
up for feedback,

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:23.670
I think that's tough to do, but
people care enough to do it.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.644
Thanks.

00:29:25.644 --> 00:29:27.925
Final comments?

00:29:27.925 --> 00:29:28.966
All right, I'm going to--

00:29:28.966 --> 00:29:29.740
oh.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:34.560
So I just want to sort of
reiterate the comment--

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:39.310
my assumption is that when I
deal with a student who either

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.960
thinks that she isn't
getting what's going on,

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.780
or seems to me
not to be getting,

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.420
those are two
different categories,

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:52.410
my assumption is that's my
problem, not her problem.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:30:02.520
And I've got to figure out
where the mismatch how it arose.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.420
I don't always know
exactly what it

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.630
means partly that it
actually goes back to your,

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.887
everybody gets A
minuses here, you know,

00:30:10.887 --> 00:30:13.095
back to the measure of the
students at the Law School

00:30:13.095 --> 00:30:14.920
are pretty talented.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:20.040
And so it probably is the case
that if student isn't getting

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.870
something I'm trying to do,
it's on me, not on the student.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:30.050
So anyway, again, figuring out
how to respond to that problem

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:33.130
is the hard part.

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:36.690
So I think the magic word
for today is mismatch.

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:40.000
We're looking at mismatch
between expectations

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.310
amongst faculty and
students, mismatch

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:44.200
between what I
think I'm teaching

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.470
and what I think my
students are comprehending,

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.720
and then, basically,
to top it all off,

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.420
is how comfortable am
I trying to figure out

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:56.780
where that mismatch lies, and
what am I going to do about it?

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.009
So with this I'm now going
pass it over to Randy who--

00:31:00.009 --> 00:31:02.050
I always have to look
because it's a lot of words

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:03.220
and I always mix them up--

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.514
case based
collaborative learning.

00:31:05.514 --> 00:31:07.210
Correct.

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:09.580
So they're doing some novel
stuff at the medical school,

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.010
so I just want him to
kind of talk about what's

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.950
making them take this risk,
what support you've had,

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:16.630
and kind of what
you've learned so far.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.190
So thanks very much.

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:30.330
So I've taught at the medical
school for about 14 years now,

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:32.750
and have been fortunate
to work with a fantastic

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.044
group of first year students.

00:31:34.044 --> 00:31:35.460
So in the courses
that I've taught

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.680
I typically teach very
early in the curriculum,

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.410
so they're just transitioning
to medical school and kind

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:45.480
of getting used to
drinking from a fire hose

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.800
as the analogy goes.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.780
And so I think we
have an opportunity

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:54.500
to really understand
how students

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.670
react to this sort of
change in their learning.

00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:00.110
As undergraduates,
you know, students

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:01.610
have the luxury of time.

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:04.850
In medical school, it
goes at a very fast pace.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:06.740
And so one of the
challenges we face

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:11.167
is really thinking about how do
we keep students engaged sort

00:32:11.167 --> 00:32:14.000
of day in and day out
with a curriculum that

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.850
is a lot of material
and a lot of content.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.010
And I think that's
one of the things that

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:22.150
drove the curriculum reform
at the medical school,

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:25.460
and sort of switched to
this so-called case based

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.830
collaborative learning
which really was, I think,

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:30.400
a nice outgrowth of the
work of many people,

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.810
including Rick Schwartzstein
and others at the school,

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.370
and really thinking
about, how can we

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:36.740
best engage our learners.

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:40.350
So the story I wanted to
tell is sort of my experience

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:42.890
in this process.

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:46.010
And sort of thinking about
how we might do this, how

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:48.440
we might take on this approach.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.522
In the old course that I
taught, it was a mix of lecture,

00:32:52.522 --> 00:32:54.980
so they'd have a couple of
hours of lecture in the morning,

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:59.540
and then a 90 minute small group
discussion in groups of eight.

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.280
And one of the
logistic challenges

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:06.450
that we face with a class of
160 is recruiting 22 discussion

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:07.790
leaders.

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:09.435
These are all faculty,
but faculty kind

00:33:09.435 --> 00:33:12.140
of across the school.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.870
Getting a uniformity of
experience for that process

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:16.880
was a challenge,
and that was one

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.720
of the motivations for thinking
about other types of formats.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:26.100
So I would say our curriculum
has been running about three

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.420
years now, I'd say about
five or six years ago,

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.800
and it's amazing how I'm
hearing echoes of what

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.620
Peter said in terms of failure.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.130
We decided to give this a try.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:37.840
Let's try flipping a session.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.400
So again typically what we were
doing is lecturing for students

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.980
for a couple of hours
then a day or so later

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.220
they'd go and discuss the
material in their small groups.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.470
And we thought, well,
let's flip this around.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:51.470
You know, we're recording
all these lectures,

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.470
half the students aren't
coming to our lectures,

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:55.860
they're watching
the videos anyway,

00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:00.300
surely they'll find this
an interesting exercise.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.460
And so what we told
them was, for two

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:05.990
of the sessions in the course,
instead of having lectures

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:10.170
we are going to have them watch
last year's lecture online,

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:12.360
which we made available to them.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:17.292
And we said, you know, do that
over the weekend, hint hint.

00:34:17.292 --> 00:34:19.620
Do that over the
weekend and then come in

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:22.031
on Monday, and
instead of lecturing,

00:34:22.031 --> 00:34:24.030
we're going to work through
a series of problems

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:27.889
together as a large group.

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:30.710
And so gave this a
try, came out with what

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:33.650
I thought were some really
interesting questions that

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:38.360
would require them to apply
their knowledge in this format.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:44.110
And I would say it was
met with a lot of silence.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.730
Trying to get the students
to participate and answer

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:51.699
questions felt to me
like pulling teeth.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:53.199
So that was the first session.

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:57.290
And then the second session,
I would say about a third

00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:00.490
of the class didn't
even show up.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:02.970
I'm like, what is going on here?

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.690
And so we then--

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:07.400
I don't know if Ed
remembers this at all--

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.050
but we basically had to have
a class meeting after this

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:13.170
and talk about professionalism
and the importance of showing

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:16.436
up to class, and that got
into a big debate about, well,

00:35:16.436 --> 00:35:18.060
you know, I'm a
student I should really

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:21.410
decide what approach for
learning works best for me,

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:22.510
kind of thing.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.305
So it was a disaster.

00:35:24.305 --> 00:35:25.180
I mean it really was.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:26.740
I'm like, what is
this flipped class?

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:27.730
Like, this is a mess.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.610
I mean I just really
didn't know what to make

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:35.190
of it, to be honest with you.

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:37.440
And so I guess the
question is why do we

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.230
keep pursuing this approach?

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:41.520
While other faculty
were experimenting

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.100
with this method
in different ways,

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.190
we ran a pilot
the following year

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:50.820
where we took a group
of about 40 students,

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.500
sitting in a room like this,
working through questions

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.160
in that format.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.100
That worked much better
with a group of 40.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.200
Really what I recognize
in retrospect,

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.100
was really the key
difference was context.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.170
That-- and I think this
is really the message--

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:10.549
that if you're going to take
chances and do experiments,

00:36:10.549 --> 00:36:12.090
and if the experiments
fail, you have

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:14.460
to go back and understand
why the experiment failed.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:16.440
The reason the first
experiment failed

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:19.460
was that these were students
who were used to learning

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.230
in a particular way.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.850
That was actually working
pretty well for them.

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:25.260
And then we said
whoa, we're just

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.134
going to change up a
couple of these sessions

00:36:27.134 --> 00:36:29.320
and see if this
is a better idea.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.020
Think you take something
that ultimately

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:35.570
can work in its own context
but take it out of context,

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:38.082
and try it this way, it
can be a real disaster.

00:36:38.082 --> 00:36:40.290
And so I don't think it was
so much about the content

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:42.500
or the format or the
flipping or so forth,

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.700
but really about
the larger context.

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.620
And, you know, we
now have a curriculum

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:50.479
that's almost exclusively
flipped sessions

00:36:50.479 --> 00:36:51.520
for the medical students.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:55.292
And they do all the prep
work, they work really hard,

00:36:55.292 --> 00:36:57.000
they come to the
sessions, they're really

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.740
very engaged and motivated.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.930
I think the faculty
are enjoying this,

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:02.910
and so I think we're
confident that this kind

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:06.480
of flipped classroom format
can work for medical students,

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.880
but that sure isn't the
conclusion I would have drawn

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.250
from our one pilot experiment.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.020
So I have to say
the lesson that I've

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.660
learned from this is, pilots
are critical and important

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.970
and we learn from them.

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:20.050
But you also have to really
interpret them properly.

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:22.740
And this notion
of context and how

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.540
do you experiment in a
course, is a challenge.

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.580
I mean, should
course pilots really

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:31.770
be pilots within a course
or of a whole course?

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:34.380
Because maybe you can't
draw very broad conclusions

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.657
from doing specific experiments,
because the students have

00:37:37.657 --> 00:37:40.352
a certain set of expectations.

00:37:40.352 --> 00:37:42.810
So, in any case, that was the
story that I wanted to share.

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:47.070
I think experimentation is good,
failure you can learn from,

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:49.820
but I guess, keep plowing ahead.

00:37:55.394 --> 00:37:56.810
So with that, we're
actually going

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:59.480
to ask you guys to
think about a risk

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:04.300
that you haven't taken, but want
to take within the next year.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.930
Ideally we want you
to write it down

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:09.040
if you're even up for it,
verbalize it with a partner.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.130
You know, the whole thing,
if you write it down

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:12.421
you're more willing to do
it, if you tell it to someone

00:38:12.421 --> 00:38:14.250
you're even more
willing to do it.

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.670
So with that, again,
think about a risk

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.300
that you want to take
within the next year.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.630
And figure out a plan
to make that happen.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.490
And we want to help
you make that happen.

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:27.110
So on the little note cards
that you have at your tables,

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:30.320
just write down resources
that you might want

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.880
to help you take this risk.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.460
In these packets as well we've
compiled a bunch of resources

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:37.980
as well.

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:41.130
So there is just some
Harvard specific sites,

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:44.750
the top helped Instructional
Moves just came out,

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:45.930
it's really cool.

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.380
And then school
specific contacts,

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:53.780
which really is this phenomenal
list compiled by HILT of folks

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.970
that you can reach out to
in the specific schools

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:58.220
who can help you
take these risks.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:01.550
Anywhere from
filming your lectures

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:05.030
to see what works, to trying out
an activity for you, for giving

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:08.330
you kind of mock students
to test something on,

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:12.080
so all of that is
available for you guys.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.150
And then if you are more
interested in flipping

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:15.620
classrooms, too,
there's a new book

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.030
that just came out called
Flipped Learning, A Guide

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:21.140
For Higher Education Faculty,
where he talks about how

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.640
he failed with flipping.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.860
So if you like this concept
of failing at flipping,

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:28.610
that book in specific tells
you a lot more about it.

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:31.100
So again, just as the
takeaways from today--

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:33.880
The flipping failure.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.610
Take the risk, get
support, and then learn

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:40.970
from what, most likely,
will be an initial failure.

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:43.850
So, you guys just
want to take some time

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:48.530
to verbalize, write down,
and end on that high note.
