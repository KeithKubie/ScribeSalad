00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:06.673
IN SOVIET RUSSIA, JOKE IS TIRED
OF YOU.

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:11.245
AN IMGUR USER UPLOADED PROFILE
PICS FROM A RUSSIAN DATING SITE

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:13.881
AND THE RESULTS ARE -- SEXY?

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:19.720
I'LL SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF A
RUSSIAN PERSON ON THE MAKE.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.723
SOMEONE WHO IS RUSHING TO
GET IN YOUR PANTS.

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:25.459
AND YOU GIVE ME A LINE FROM
THEIR DATING PROFILE --

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.895
NO POINTS FOR THAT ONE, CHRIS
HARDWICK.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:29.930
LET'S SEE IF THEY CAN GET
POINTS FOR YOU.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:39.506
FIRST ONE, THIS STARVING
SOVIET-- SOMEWHERE GALLAGHER

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:40.874
JUST [BLEEP] HIS PANTS.
(LAUGHTER)

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.609
EMILY.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:49.650
&gt;&gt; SHE DOESN'T NEED A MAN. SHE
NEEDS A KNIFE.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.886
THIS WAS NOT AN ASSVILLE,
LET ME SAY THAT RIGHT NOW.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:55.322
&gt;&gt; LOOKS LIKE IT WAS IN
ASSVILLE.

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:56.690
&gt;&gt; NO, NO.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.725
&gt;&gt; ASSVILLE IS AMERICA, THIS
IS RUSSIA.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:08.435
&gt;&gt; OH, I'M SORRY. THEN SHE'S IN
TAINTSK

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:21.748
&gt;&gt; NEXT ONE THIS MAN --

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:26.220
GET BACK TO THE CELLAR AND
STOP SCARING THE GUESTS.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.760
OH, VERY SORRY -- I WILL GO UP
TO THE BACK AND PUNCH GOPHERS.

00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:34.895
&gt;&gt; YES, MYKE.

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:39.132
&gt;&gt; LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WITH
PASSION FOR TROLL DOLLS.

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:41.001
&gt;&gt; POINTS. POINTS.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.370
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T TELL IF HIS PECS
ARE SUPPOSED TO DISTRACT

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.406
FROM ME FROM FACE OR PANTS
ARE SUPPOSED TO DISTRACT ME

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:50.110
FROM HIS HAIR OR IF-- IF A
WALLPAPER IS SUPPOSED TO

00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:52.813
DISTRACT ME FROM HIM BEING
FOUR FEET TALL?

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:55.182
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE A LOT OF PLACES
FOR THE EYE TO GO.

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:56.283
&gt;&gt; YEAH. POINTS.

00:01:56.383 --> 00:02:05.325
&gt;&gt; I AM CHILD OF SUSAN BOYLE

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:11.765
&gt;&gt; I'D [BLEEP] HIM.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:18.572
&gt;&gt; POINTS. NEXT ONE, LOOK AT
THIS MAGICAL MERMAID.

00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:19.940
MIKE.

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:25.913
&gt;&gt; ENJOYS LONG FLOPS ON THE
BEACH.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:33.453
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE THE FAREWELL NOTE
HER FIANCEE LEFT HER.

00:02:33.554 --> 00:02:38.292
&gt;&gt; I'LL GIVE YOU POINTS, BUT
I WOULD LIKE TO POINT IT OUT --

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:41.361
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S THE SHAPE
OF PAPER AIRPLANE.

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:45.098
IT'S LIKE HERE, I'M DONE.
