00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.800
The world may not agree on just how “real”
professional wrestling, or “sports entertainment”

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.460
may be, but when the masses love or hate one
performers above the rest, mainstream fame

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.980
is usually within reach.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.080
Not every pro wrestler who has pursued a Hollywood
acting career has found success, but that

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.330
might not be as bad as it sounds.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.720
Some of the greatest legends of wrestling
found their way into Hollywood films… and

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.860
still, nobody noticed.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:37.230
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Wrestlers You
Didn’t Know Appeared in Movies.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.230
Hulk Hogan

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.730
Sure, Hulk Hogan made more appearances in
Hollywood films than nearly any other wrestler

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.760
before or since, but one of his strangest
roles unfortunately slipped by plenty of younger

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.760
moviegoers.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.989
The original Gremlins is a classic, but its
sequel is a whole lot… weirder.

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.600
But director Joe Dante was offered the job
with the promise that he could do just about

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.050
anything he wanted with The New Batch.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.300
As a result, audiences were stunned to see
the film burn up, apparently the work of the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.850
film’s maniac monsters.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.180
Luckily, Hulk Hogan was sitting in the same
theater, intimidating the Gremlins until they

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.490
returned to the regular programming.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:20.000
The cameo was strange and unexpected, but
sadly, was replaced in the home video release,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.799
depriving thousands of Hulkamaniacs from seeing
it for themselves.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.229
Terry Funk

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.009
He may not have gained the mainstream fame
of Hulk Hogan or Randy Savage, but there aren’t

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.670
many Hall of Fame wrestlers who can hold a
candle to Terry Funk.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.179
So it’s no surprise he took his signature
hardcore attitude onto the big screen, appearing

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.179
in movies like Road House and Over The Top.

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.000
It’s hard to believe that the towering beast
could ever be beaten in a fight by Patrick

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.931
Swayze or Sam Elliott, but since he’s as
famous for his love of a good time as he is

00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:51.960
for his fighting, we’re willing to bet he
simply let the movie stars win.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.419
Lenny Montana

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:57.279
Beginning his wrestling career as The Zebra
Kid, the Brooklyn-born Lenny Montana found

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:00.609
success due mainly to his 6-foot-6-inch frame.

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:04.369
But when wrestling dried up for Montana in
the late ‘60s, his size was put to another

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.509
use: recruited to work as an enforcer for
New York’s Columbo Crime Family.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.370
After a stint in prison, Montana acted as
a bodyguard for the family, which is what

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.670
brought him onto the set of Francis Ford Coppola’s
Godfather.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.709
The massive but softspoken enforcer was immediately
cast as Vito Corleone’s top hitman, Luca

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:21.709
Brasi.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.480
Even with a small part in the movie, Montana
would enjoy a long acting career as a direct

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.480
result.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.480
Captain Lou Albano

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.579
It’s one thing to turn wrestling success
into a career in Hollywood, but doing it without

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:31.579
most people noticing is something else.

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.519
No wrestling fan of ‘50s and ‘60s will
forget Captain Lou Albano, since he racked

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.099
up wins and legendary status as both a wrestler
and manager – and his long beard, face piercings,

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.459
and Hawaiian shirts didn’t hurt either.

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.159
Despite that fame, Lou Albano’s acting chops
made him almost unrecognizable as the slick

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.540
Sicilian Frank “The Fixer” in Brian De
Palma’s Wise Guys.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.859
And even fewer fans realized the once-crazed
wrestler would entertain kids every week as

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.020
Nintendo’s mascot in The Super Mario Bros.
Super Show!

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.510
Now THAT’s range.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.510
Kevin Nash

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.930
It’s hard to think of a pro wrestler who
has found more success than Kevin Nash.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.450
Winning almost two dozen world championships
and founding the nWo, the man formerly known

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.999
as Diesel found legitimate fame in films and
TV, most recently appearing in the Magic Mike

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:19.269
films as “Tarzan.”

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.380
But Nash’s fans may have caught his big
screen debut earlier than they thought.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.120
When the villain Shredder ingested the mutating
ooze in the second Ninja Turtles movie, it

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.769
was Nash who brought the gigantic “Super
Shredder” to life.

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.430
Let’s be glad that none of his other roles
required the actor to bury himself under a

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.090
dock for no reason whatsoever.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.090
Sable

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.980
The 1990s were a serious turning point for
the WWF, as the Attitude Era saw the company

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.069
target new adult audiences – and their new
Divas more than did the trick.

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.629
No female wrestler was more popular than Rena
Mero, better known as Sable, and one of the

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:50.629
first female performers to show off her athleticism
along with good looks.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.519
When Sable left the WWF in 1999, she turned
to films… but we doubt that beating up former

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.670
SNL cast member Chris Kattan in Corky Romano
was what she had in mind.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.590
As satisfying as it was to watch her fight,
the flop must have opened her eyes.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.639
She returned to wrestling shortly after.

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:10.939
Big John Studd

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.430
It takes a special kind of villain to bring
a stretcher to the ring so his opponent can

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.870
be carried out when the fight is over, but
Big John Studd lived up to his name, going

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.769
toe-to-toe with the massive Andre the Giant.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.750
A monster heel that big would be hard to miss,
but there are some wrestling fans who never

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.560
saw one of his best roles: the bruiser Jack
Daniels in Harley Davidson and the Marlboro

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.560
Man.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.570
The film was a bomb, but that doesn’t mean
it’s any less fun to watch Studd throw Mickey

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.100
Rourke out a window.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.750
Since Rourke would play a pro wrestler twenty
years later, we like to think Studd taught

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.919
him a few tricks of the trade.

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.090
George ‘The Animal’ Steele

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.840
When Jim Myers started wrestling in his free
time, it was only meant to help him pay bills

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.310
when we wasn’t working as a high school
wrestling and football coach.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.949
But when wrestling took off, Myers took the
name of ‘The Animal,’ and wrestled for

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:56.250
the next several decades.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.419
In a strange twist of fate, Steele also landed
a role in Tim Burton’s biopic of the enigmatic

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.460
director Ed Wood.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.120
Steele was recruited to play the part of Wood’s
friend and collaborator Tor Johnson – himself

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.080
a Swedish wrestler turned film actor.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.720
Ox Baker

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.780
Although he began his wrestling career as
a nerdy hero, the legendary Ox Baker soon

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.620
became one of the most well-known villains
of the 1960s.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.311
Famous for his heated interviews and his signature
move – The Heart Punch – it was only a

00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:33.330
matter of time until Ox made it into film.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.449
Escape From New York became a cult classic
thanks to director John Carpenter’s dystopic

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.360
Manhattan prison, and Ox was definitely in
top form when taking on Snake Plissken in

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.790
a fight to the death.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.020
With a catchphrase as simple as “I love
to hurt people,” there’s no doubt that

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.080
he enjoyed the chance to do just that to star
Kurt Russell.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.080
Kimberly Page

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.169
Diamond Dallas Page was one of the biggest
names to ever come out of the WCW, but his

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.350
wife and on-screen manager Kimberly was just
as memorable.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.580
But wrestling fans would be forgiven if they
didn’t catch her surprise cameo in Judd

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.570
Apatow’s 40 Year Old Virgin.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.540
Stepping into the spotlight thanks to a wardrobe
malfunction at a speed dating event may not

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.370
have been the return to fame she was hoping
for, but it definitely makes her brief appearance

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.560
hard to forget.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.310
So what do you think of our list?
