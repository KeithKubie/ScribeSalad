00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.486
REPORTER (over TV):
 Is the climate in this
 country really changing?

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:22.256
REPORTER (over TV):
 Yes, and not only in
 this country, Bill.

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:25.325
There are many lines of
 evidence, which show that
 the climate has slowly been

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:29.997
warming up during the
 20th century over almost
 the entire Earth's surface.

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:33.333
REPORTER (over TV): Man
 may be unwittingly changing
 the world's climate through

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.435
the waste products
 of his civilization.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.505
REPORTER (over TV): Over
 pollution unless checked
 could so warm the Earth in

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:42.409
200 years as to
 create a greenhouse effect
 melting the Arctic ice.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:46.280
REPORTER (over TV): The
 temperature of the lower
 atmosphere will rise perhaps

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.160
to a greater extent than
 at any time since the
 end of the last ice age.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.380
JAMES: This evidence
represents a very strong
case, in my opinion,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.700
that the greenhouse effect
has been detected and it is
changing our climate now.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.129
NARRATOR: The science is in:
 for decades, there's been
 scientific consensus that

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.100
climate change is real, is
 caused by humans and poses
 a threat to civilization.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.900
CARL: Solving these problems
requires a transnational

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.960
and transgenerational
perspective.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.060
NARRATOR: Starting at the
 United Nations Earth Summit
 in Rio de Janeiro in 1992,

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:25.552
the international
 community began working
 together to address the

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:27.880
greatest issue
 in human history.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.000
REPORTER (over TV): 175
 nations did sign a blueprint
 for the world's future.

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:34.194
It's a weaker
 blueprint than many wanted,

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:37.097
but the real test comes
 in the months and years ahead.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.400
NARRATOR: Every year since
 1995, the global community
 has gathered together

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.160
to negotiate a lasting
 agreement to reduce
 carbon emissions.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.560
REPORTER (over TV):
 In Japan today, talks
 on a global climate

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:51.411
treaty went
 way into overtime.

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:54.381
REPORTER (over TV): The
 ink is barely dry on an
 historic agreement to fight

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:57.617
global warming and
 already its future is in doubt.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.386
REPORTER (over TV):
 Big polluters like India

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:01.521
and China haven't signed on.

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:05.625
NARRATOR: Despite the failings
 of international climate
 negotiations and agreements,

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:10.980
advocates from cities,
 towns and states, along with
 businesses and universities,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.420
continued their pressure.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.435
REPORTER (over TV): Hundreds
 of thousands took to the
 streets of New York today.

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.671
NARRATOR: And renewable
 energy continued to grow.

00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:21.274
REPORTER (over TV): You may
 want to consider a job in
 the clean energy industry.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:23.610
It is growing and
 they need more workers.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.547
NARRATOR: And in 2015,
 led by the world's largest
 carbon emitters,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.280
the world came
 together in Paris.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.120
REPORTER (over TV): It
 took two decades, but now a
 historic agreement on climate

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:37.120
change signed by nearly
 every nation in the world.

00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:39.726
(speaking in
foreign language).

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:42.529
REPORTER (over TV): We've
 written a new chapter
 of hope in the lives of

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.364
7 billion
 people on the planet.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.400
REPORTER (over TV):
 The new deal will not
 end global warming,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.269
but signatories
 have agreed to reduce
 their carbon emissions

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.271
and it's being
 seen as a turning point.

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:54.474
PRESIDENT OBAMA: The
Paris Agreement represents
the best chance we've had

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.543
to save the one
planet that we've got.

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:59.279
(applause).

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.740
PRESIDENT TRUMP: In
order to fulfill my solemn
duty to protect America

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.900
and its citizens, the
United States will withdraw

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.680
from the Paris Climate Accord.

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:37.184
I was elected to
represent the citizens of
Pittsburgh, not Paris.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.030
PEDUTO: It's the afternoon.
I'm sitting in this room.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.020
I'm looking over my
phone and I get an alert
and the alert says,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.460
"I was elected to
represent the people of
Pittsburgh, not Paris."

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:03.310
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.045
PEDUTO: Read it twice.

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:07.881
Went into to my chief of
staff's office and just
yelled, "Pittsburgh?!"

00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:09.883
And he's like, what
are you talking about?

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:11.384
And I said,

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:15.455
and I started tweeting back
that Pittsburgh was going

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:18.291
to stay in the
Paris Agreement.

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:21.194
(inaudible).

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:24.498
EVA: In the aftermath of
President Trump pulling out of
the Paris Climate Agreement,

00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:28.902
Pittsburghers came out in
thousands to say that we were
going to take climate action

00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:32.239
into our own hands and
move forward as a city.

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:37.611
PEDUTO: And so we
decided to show how policy
at a local level will help

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:39.780
to change the world.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.349
REPORTER (over TV): Mayor
 Bill Peduto signed an executive
 order today that requires

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.085
the city to follow
 the guidelines of
 the Paris Agreement.

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:47.687
NARRATOR: It wasn't just
 Pittsburgh that reacted
 to this announcement.

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:51.792
A movement was galvanized
 around the country.

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:54.694
REPORTER (over TV): Already
 this morning there is a new
 drive that's gaining steam to

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.180
stick to the U.S.'s
 commitments combating climate
 change despite President Trump.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.780
NARRATOR: In the U.S.,
 hundreds of cities, states,
 universities and businesses

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:07.440
joined the ranks of
 those already committed
 to the goals of Paris.

00:05:08.275 --> 00:05:13.713
BROWN: Mayors and governors,
we're here in the action on
the field taking the kind of

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:18.718
steps that are needed
to get the job done to
preserve our climate.

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:22.822
NARRATOR: A revolution is
 underway to tackle our biggest
 sources of carbon emissions,

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:27.127
creating transformations
 in how people get
 around, build buildings,

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:30.797
grow food and
 generate electricity.

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:35.302
So while coal plants
 continue to close, clean
 energy is creating jobs,

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.305
growing the economy
 and lowering emissions.

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:41.341
PEDUTO: Despite the
President's announcement,

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:44.911
we are still moving
ahead in renewable energy.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:51.400
There are now more jobs in
renewable energy in the state
of Pennsylvania than coal,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.340
natural gas and oil combined.

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:58.458
CURBELO: I think the
president has it wrong.

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:02.162
This isn't a zero-sum
game where we either
save the environment

00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:04.698
or grow the economy.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:07.968
We can do both
at the same time.

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:11.605
BLOOMBERG: The American
government may have pulled
out of the Paris Agreement,

00:06:11.605 --> 00:06:16.977
but the American people are
committed to its goals and
there is nothing Washington

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:19.980
can do to stop us.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.617
NARRATOR: The solutions
 are at hand and it
 couldn't be soon enough.

00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:26.953
The front lines of
 climate change are now
 in everyone's backyard,

00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:29.656
from California to
 Iowa to Florida.

00:06:29.656 --> 00:06:34.894
Climate change is not
 coming, it's already here.

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:47.574
CASTRO: I grew up in the
heart of South Miami and
when I was 10 years old,

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:50.543
I first started to get
involved in surfing.

00:06:54.014 --> 00:06:58.551
I remember coming out
on South Beach early on when I
started to surf and I remember

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:04.658
just seeing vast land of
sand before you hit the beach
and now you know I come back

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:10.730
to Miami and I continue to be
shocked at how close the water
is encroaching on South Beach.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.901
I think we're going
to have to adapt very, very
quickly to the rising tides

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:16.736
and to the rising seas.

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:19.539
CLEETUS: Climate
change isn't just about
some far-off future.

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:21.708
It's actually happening
all around us right now.

00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:25.578
And here in the U.S.
along the east and Gulf coast

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:28.081
of the country in particular,
we have some real hotspots

00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:31.785
where we're seeing
even greater and faster
rates of sea level rise.

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:37.023
MANN: In Florida, there isn't
much elevation and so they
are now dealing with perennial

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:41.540
flooding in Miami Beach,
in Fort Lauderdale, from
what they call king tides.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.798
REPORTER (over TV):
 King tides are here and the
 rising floodwaters are creating

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.966
some trouble for
 drivers and residents.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:49.936
REPORTER (over TV): Salt
 water seeping up through storm
 drains and over the sea wall,

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:52.639
soaking the streets
 of Miami Beach.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:57.777
MANN: These are seasonal high
tides that have been there for
the eons and yet now when they

00:07:57.777 --> 00:08:00.880
arrive in the fall they flood
the streets of Miami Beach,

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.717
and that's because
of sea level rise.

00:08:03.717 --> 00:08:07.754
CASTRO: In fact, there is an
image of an octopus that was
found in a parking garage half

00:08:07.754 --> 00:08:11.958
mile in from the beach
and it's just showing that,
you know, this is real deal.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.180
LEWIS: The big focus in
Miami Beach, I believe,
is on adaptation.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:22.836
They're spending
$500,000,000 on pumps to
keep the tidal water off

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:24.904
the streets
during king tides.

00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:28.808
So, you adapt to climate
change by elevating roads,

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:30.677
putting that green
infrastructure in,

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:33.146
slowing the worse
effects from happening.

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:38.520
So that's getting a lot
of attention because
people see that as,

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.780
keep the water away
from me kind of thing.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.320
What they're not doing quick
enough is addressing things
like salt water intrusion and

00:08:48.328 --> 00:08:53.600
when people talk about sea
level rise being the thing
that gets us out of here

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.772
because we're flooding,
I wonder if it couldn't be
freshwater vulnerability that

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.180
gets us out of here faster.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.779
NARRATOR: The Everglades
 is a critical source of
 fresh drinking water

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:08.915
for nearly eight million
 people in southern Florida.

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:13.853
But as the sea rises,
 it's moving inland, pushing
 sea water into the aquifers

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:17.857
and the Everglades, and
 threatening the freshwater
 supply for the entire region.

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:30.637
CASTRO: A lot of people,
when they think of sea level
rise in the State of Florida,

00:09:30.637 --> 00:09:34.641
they think encroaching
on the coastlines,
but because we're,

00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:36.876
we're built on
this porous limestone,

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:40.113
water can
actually percolate up.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.500
WANLESS: Once the water
level's up, the water
will just come through.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.160
CASTRO: Come through, right.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.920
WANLESS: And there's
essentially nothing we
can do to stop that.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.890
That's a real problem
because as sea level has risen,

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.893
we've been pulling
harder on wells,

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:58.565
sucking harder, so we're
sort of pulling salt water in
from the ocean too, doing that.

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:01.968
CASTRO: It's almost,
we're pulling up brackish
water, essentially.

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:05.738
WANLESS: Yes, we've had
to move the wells farther
and farther inland.

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:09.576
I think probably within
the next 30 years we'll
have lost our fresh water

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:13.012
in South Florida.

00:10:13.513 --> 00:10:15.915
MANN: Look at global
sea level rise.

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:18.852
Here's another area
of the science where,
as we learn more,

00:10:18.852 --> 00:10:21.754
we're discovering that we may
be worse off than we thought,

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:26.059
the models may have under
predicted the amount of sea
level rise that we could see

00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:28.995
by just the
end of this century.

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:31.197
If you look at even
a recent report of the

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:33.766
Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change,

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:36.002
they were looking at
a worst-case scenario
of a little more than

00:10:36.002 --> 00:10:40.260
three feet of sea level
rise by the end of
the century, globally.

00:10:41.207 --> 00:10:45.240
But now there's enough new
science that's come in that
tells us that the ice sheets

00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:49.048
are losing ice faster, that
there are processes that
we didn't have in our models

00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:52.919
and as we put them
into the models, we're now
learning that we could be in

00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:57.123
for more than six feet
of global sea level rise
by the end of the century.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.929
Even if we stop emitting
carbon to the atmosphere now,

00:11:03.296 --> 00:11:05.131
just because of the
inertia of the system,

00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:08.868
we will continue to see
sea level rise for some time.

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:11.905
And if we continue with
business as usual, if we
don't do anything about our

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:16.910
escalating carbon emissions,
there is nothing to prevent
us from melting most of the

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:21.114
West Antarctic ice sheet
and a large part of the
Greenland ice sheet.

00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:27.220
And if we go down that
path then at some point in
the future we could be seeing

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:31.658
20 feet of
global sea level rise.

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:38.798
LUBBER: It's not
happening ten years from
now, it is happening now.

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:42.669
Floods are devastating
communities, are
devastating economies,

00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:46.172
are taking away
people's homes.

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:47.807
Think about Miami Beach.

00:11:47.807 --> 00:11:49.976
We're still seeing
building in those areas.

00:11:49.976 --> 00:11:54.080
People want to live on the
waterfront, but the economic
signals are very clear.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.580
Insurance companies don't want
to insure those places, uh,
they're being redlined out,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.756
meaning they're allowing
people to fend for themselves
or they're raising their

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:07.093
prices so high that you
can't even get insurance.

00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:10.096
NARRATOR: In the U.S.,
 it's estimated that
 in about 25 years,

00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:13.967
more than 300,000 homes
 and businesses valued

00:12:13.967 --> 00:12:18.360
at $135 billion may be
 chronically flooded.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.060
And by the end of the
 century, that number grows
 to two and a half million.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.379
ROS-LEHTINEN: I represent
communities that people
would think they're pretty

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:33.300
conservative and yet now
that they see the impact, the
economic impact that sea level

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:38.980
rise and climate change has
on their pocketbooks and the
revenues that their cities

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.320
bring in, they're
understanding that this
is a conservative issue.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:51.020
But many Republican
public officials do not see
the urgency in this because

00:12:51.404 --> 00:12:55.074
it has been a partisan
issue for a long time.

00:12:55.074 --> 00:12:59.145
INHOFE: When you say that
science is settled and the
overwhelming scientific

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:02.815
analysis comes to that
conclusion, frankly that
is just not correct.

00:13:03.583 --> 00:13:07.086
CRUZ: Climate change is
not science, it's religion.

00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:10.223
CLEETUS: Climate denialism,
the sort of anti-science
attitude about what is

00:13:10.857 --> 00:13:14.761
clearly observable and
which has been supported
by multiple lines of evidence

00:13:15.828 --> 00:13:19.032
didn't happen by accident.

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:23.236
There has been a very
well-funded, long-standing
fossil fuel lobby that has

00:13:23.236 --> 00:13:27.040
been spreading disinformation
and trying to undercut any

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.209
attempt at climate
action in the U.S.

00:13:30.443 --> 00:13:34.881
GERRARD: To this day, Koch
Industries, a privately-owned
fossil fuel company,

00:13:35.682 --> 00:13:38.918
have been funding
climate denial activities,

00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:43.956
have been working
as hard as they can to
fight climate regulation.

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:46.459
REPORTER (over TV): The
 Koch brothers are among
 the nation's best-known

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:48.461
politically active families.

00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:51.297
The billionaires'
 network of political action
 committees and advocacy groups

00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:56.202
will spend $300,000,000
 on campaign 2016.

00:13:56.202 --> 00:14:00.306
TAYLOR: Most Republicans
in the House and the Senate
privately understand full well

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:03.810
climate change is real,
it's not this fiction,
it's not a scam,

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.320
it's not concocted by
liberal activists trying
to destroy capitalism.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.980
Uh, that it's a
dangerous thing, that we're
seeing its impacts now.

00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:15.121
They're afraid of what it's
going to mean for the future.

00:14:15.121 --> 00:14:18.257
They just don't know exactly
what they can do about it
politically that won't cost

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:22.161
them their job
through a primary challenge.

00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:25.098
GERRARD: Climate denial
is not limited to
the federal government.

00:14:25.098 --> 00:14:28.234
Some governors have engaged
in some similar activities.

00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:30.903
Governor Rick Scott
of Florida, for example.

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:33.005
REPORTER (over TV):
 State's Department of
 Environmental Protection

00:14:33.005 --> 00:14:36.175
banned some employees
 from using the term climate
 change or global warming.

00:14:36.476 --> 00:14:38.344
This unwritten policy
 went into effect after

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:41.013
Republican Governor
 Rick Scott took office.

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:44.484
GERRARD: It's almost
as if President Trump
is following Governor Scott

00:14:44.484 --> 00:14:47.987
and adopting the
same kinds of tactics.

00:14:47.987 --> 00:14:52.191
Almost all of his
cabinet members have been
out front in denying that

00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:55.294
climate change
is being caused mostly
by human activities.

00:14:56.095 --> 00:14:58.197
PRUITT: Thank you
Mr. President.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:04.120
Your decision today to exit
the Paris Accord reflects
your unflinching commitment

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.200
to put America first.

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:08.441
GERRARD: They have been
going through various
federal documents

00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:11.377
and x-ing out the
terms "climate change."

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:16.149
They want to slash the
budgets of the scientific
research agencies.

00:15:16.149 --> 00:15:18.384
In every imaginable way,

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:22.121
the administration has been
discouraging the use of science.

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:25.725
ROS-LEHTINEN: It's hard
for us to move any kind of
legislation because if we have

00:15:25.725 --> 00:15:29.162
the administration against us,
it's just really difficult.

00:15:29.896 --> 00:15:35.301
SUH: This administration
clearly has the environment in
its bull's-eye and is clearly,

00:15:35.835 --> 00:15:39.372
and systematically,
going after every single
environmental statute and

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.140
regulation as well as the
federal government's ability
to address climate change.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:54.520
CURBELO: And what I would tell
my friends in public office
is we need your leadership,

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.189
both sides of the aisle.

00:15:56.189 --> 00:15:58.424
Doesn't matter
if you're Republican,
Democrat, Independent,

00:15:58.424 --> 00:16:02.094
you have a role to play
here and those of us who
are from Florida should

00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:08.167
be even more active and
aggressive in pursuing these
policies because you know

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:10.269
what's bad for jobs
and the economy?

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:16.120
Sea level rise and coastal
flooding and saltwater
intrusion into the Everglades

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.560
where our drinking supply
rests in South Florida.

00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:22.281
That will really
devastate our region.

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:26.219
It actually won't allow
us to live there anymore.

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:29.789
WANLESS: I think somewhere
later in this century,

00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:32.124
Miami as we know it
is going to be unlivable.

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:34.460
So in reality,
in South Florida, we're
just going to be leaving.

00:16:36.262 --> 00:16:37.597
We don't have the problem.

00:16:37.597 --> 00:16:39.599
You, up in Orlando.

00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:44.070
You better set aside your
groundwater resources and
you better plan for us.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:46.305
You really better
plan 'cause we are coming.

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:49.108
It's not if we don't do
something, we may be coming.

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:51.477
We will be coming.

00:16:52.445 --> 00:16:55.314
NARRATOR: A recent
 study showed that by
 the end of the century,

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:58.317
as many as two
 and a half million people
 from southern Florida

00:16:58.317 --> 00:17:01.420
may be displaced
 due to climate change.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.590
And many of them could
 be headed to Orlando.

00:17:08.261 --> 00:17:11.497
The city is not
 only preparing for these
 impacts of climate change,

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:14.233
they're also doing
 their part to fight it,

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:16.402
despite federal inaction.

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:21.507
ISAAC: The message around
climate has been so hard for
ordinary people to plug into.

00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:26.479
It's been big and
scary and something
that's happening far away and

00:17:26.479 --> 00:17:29.515
something that I personally
can't do anything about.

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:31.517
And that's not true.

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:33.486
It is big and scary.

00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:36.322
But there are things
we can do and we can impact
policy in our communities

00:17:36.322 --> 00:17:38.391
that can make
a big difference.

00:17:38.658 --> 00:17:40.660
Yeah, if everybody
could take a seat.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.630
So, I want to say welcome
and thank you for being here.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:50.403
When we founded the First
50 Coalition, our goal was
to make our city one of the

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.241
first 50 in the
nation to commit to 100%
renewable energy by 2050.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:01.247
DYER: A lot of greenhouse
gas emissions come from cities

00:18:01.881 --> 00:18:06.185
so after the
current administration
withdrew us from Paris,

00:18:06.485 --> 00:18:09.155
there had been a
number of cities that stepped

00:18:09.155 --> 00:18:12.358
up to the challenge on
renewables and just kind of
galvanized us at the local

00:18:12.358 --> 00:18:16.262
level that we had to pick up
the sword and charge forward.

00:18:17.063 --> 00:18:20.666
SPEAKER: Good afternoon,
I'd like to welcome
you to the August 8th meeting

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:22.401
of the
Orlando City Council.

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:24.704
We're going to...

00:18:24.704 --> 00:18:28.207
ISAAC: So we went to the city
council to get a commitment to
100% renewable energy by 2050;

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:30.343
we were hopeful.

00:18:30.343 --> 00:18:33.212
Every single person in
that room was in support.

00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:36.082
I don't think that's
ever happened at a city
commission meeting before,

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:39.585
where absolutely everybody
is in favor of something.

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:42.555
DYER: All those
in favor of the motion
indicate so by saying aye.

00:18:42.555 --> 00:18:45.691
Those opposed, and so the
motion carries unanimously.

00:18:46.926 --> 00:18:49.228
(applause).

00:18:49.228 --> 00:18:51.063
ISAAC: And they voted yes!

00:18:51.063 --> 00:18:53.165
REPORTER (over TV):
 The City of Orlando has
 committed to running on

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:55.568
clean renewable energy by 2050.

00:18:55.568 --> 00:18:58.637
ISAAC: And that was the
whole reason we started
is we needed a win.

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:00.206
We need a positive momentum.

00:19:00.206 --> 00:19:03.643
We needed to say this is the
kind of community we could be.

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:06.645
NARRATOR: Commitments to
 renewable energy are being
 made around the country.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:10.449
More than 75 cities
 throughout the U.S.
 have already committed

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:14.460
to using 100% renewable
 energy by midcentury.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.320
To help make this happen
 cities are developing
 innovative solutions.

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:23.562
CASTRO: One of the things
that we're doing in Orlando
is testing floating solar,

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:25.731
what we call
floating voltaics.

00:19:25.731 --> 00:19:30.636
There's 9,000 man-made ponds,
that have been created to
capture storm water from the

00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:36.342
streets and we've started
to test out in some of these
ponds how to put floating

00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:38.611
solar on top of them.

00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:42.515
We've also turned
on one of the largest
installations that we have,

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:46.719
it's a 12-megawatt
community solar farm, and
it was literally over decades

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:51.557
a landfill where we
were turning coal ash after
being burned and burying it.

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:54.660
And we realized that
after that was capped,

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:58.464
that that was a prime
spot for us to put solar up.

00:19:58.464 --> 00:20:02.435
We're also transitioning
our downtown bus
rapid transit system to

00:20:02.435 --> 00:20:04.770
100% electric
zero-emission buses.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.400
Another high priority
is the energy-food nexus.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.314
We're shipping
food all around the world,
all around the country,

00:20:15.314 --> 00:20:19.285
15 to 1,800
miles per person,
per plate, per day.

00:20:20.119 --> 00:20:23.355
And in fact, people
have done research that
food systems contribute

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.160
as much as a third of
global climate change.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.528
So we were like, all right,

00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:32.465
one, we need to localize it,
as local as possible.

00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:36.368
Two, we need
to use zero-emission
transportation to build,

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:41.100
maintain and distribute that
produce to the end users,
markets and restaurants.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.580
And that's the epiphany that
we had with Fleet Farming.

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:47.313
PERRY: So starting out,
we're going to go ahead and
have a group that's going

00:20:47.313 --> 00:20:50.316
to harvest and a group
that's going to turn a plot.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:56.555
CASTRO: There's 40 million
acres of lawns across this
country that are absorbing

00:20:56.555 --> 00:21:00.326
a lot of the water resources,
that we're spraying a lot of
fertilizers on and causing

00:21:00.326 --> 00:21:04.597
other problems and that
we could convert into
edible landscapes that

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:07.500
can produce our
food in our neighborhood.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.702
Not just local
but hyper-local.

00:21:09.702 --> 00:21:12.071
PERRY: Ok so I'm going
to go ahead and show
you how to harvest.

00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:14.440
Basically, a homeowner
pays a startup fee.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.876
We farm their front
lawns with the help
of the community during

00:21:16.876 --> 00:21:18.844
our biweekly swarm rides.

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:23.482
We ride bikes out and
we teach the community how
to farm these front lawns.

00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:25.684
CASTRO: It's a win-win
situation across the board.

00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:29.622
The homeowner who provides
the land is actually
getting all of that produce

00:21:29.889 --> 00:21:32.358
free of charge as
much as they want.

00:21:32.358 --> 00:21:35.761
The excess that's grown,
we're harvesting and
we're taking it to market.

00:21:36.595 --> 00:21:39.798
PERRY: We got some heirloom
carrots, watermelon
radishes and beets.

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:42.101
CASTRO: Now we're scaling.

00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:45.437
We're in West Oakland,
California, we're
operating in Jacksonville,

00:21:45.437 --> 00:21:48.274
we have
two branches in Orlando,
so we're pretty excited.

00:21:49.441 --> 00:21:53.546
NARRATOR: The pioneering
 efforts in cities like Orlando
 are essential to achieving

00:21:53.546 --> 00:21:55.748
the goals of the
 Paris Climate Accord.

00:21:56.315 --> 00:22:00.553
Orlando itself is not
 only bracing for an influx of
 people from southern Florida,

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.424
but because of major
 hurricanes, which devastated
 the Caribbean in 2017,

00:22:06.125 --> 00:22:09.295
refugees from U.S. territories
 have already arrived.

00:22:09.762 --> 00:22:12.831
REPORTER (over TV):
 215,000 people have
 arrived in Florida alone.

00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:15.801
Many survivors are flying to
 Orlando International Airport

00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:18.437
where there's
 a resource center.

00:22:18.437 --> 00:22:21.473
CASTRO: Since Irma and Maria,
we've seen now 300,000 people
flee to our city and

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:27.520
that's been a big challenge
in terms of education for the
kids, putting them into schools,

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.480
finding reliable,
affordable housing
for them and then of

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.420
course finding them jobs
to sustain their families.

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:19.420
LUBBER: The hurricane season
of 2017, we saw flooding that
has absolutely devastated

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:24.200
Puerto Rico,
Houston, Texas, hundreds
of billions of dollars'

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.740
worth of damage to
people's lives, their homes.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.743
REPORTER (over TV):
 Hurricane Harvey barreling
 into the Texas coastline as

00:23:30.743 --> 00:23:33.412
a category four storm
 with 130 mile-an-hour winds.

00:23:34.313 --> 00:23:36.382
REPORTER (over TV):
 It's not just a
 little bit of rain.

00:23:36.382 --> 00:23:39.885
Look at this, feet of rain
 is what we're communicating,
 not inches but feet.

00:23:39.885 --> 00:23:43.555
CLEETUS: There are now studies
that show that the extreme
rainfall that accompanied that

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.440
hurricane was made
much more likely because
of climate change.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.896
MANN: Those warm ocean
temperatures meant that
there were record amounts of

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:56.260
moisture within that storm,
moisture that was available
to produce the worst flooding

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.100
event on record in
the United States.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.900
REPORTER (over TV):
 For a third brutal
 day, torrential rain,

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:03.776
people rescued
 from flooded homes.

00:24:03.776 --> 00:24:05.878
WOMAN (over TV):
 There's water everywhere.
 We have nowhere to go.

00:24:05.878 --> 00:24:08.747
I have all my children.
 I lost everything.

00:24:08.747 --> 00:24:10.883
I have nothing but the
 clothes on my back.

00:24:10.883 --> 00:24:15.554
MANN: These storms are
now about 20% more destructive
because of the overall warming

00:24:15.554 --> 00:24:18.924
of the ocean, which thus far
is less than a degree Celsius.

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:22.094
Imagine what two
degrees Celsius gives us.

00:24:22.094 --> 00:24:23.962
REPORTER (over TV):
 The Caribbean has just
 been getting hammered.

00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:26.432
Here's storm number
 four in just weeks.

00:24:26.865 --> 00:24:28.801
REPORTER (over TV): The winds
 are going to be devastating.

00:24:39.745 --> 00:24:42.948
CLEETUS: These types
of extreme weather events
exacerbate already existing

00:24:42.948 --> 00:24:48.754
challenges so in the case of
Puerto Rico the electricity
grid had been under-invested

00:24:48.754 --> 00:24:50.622
in for a very long
period of time.

00:24:50.622 --> 00:24:53.459
And then this hurricane
came along and pretty
much decimated it.

00:24:54.626 --> 00:24:59.131
And that meant not just
that people lost power
but when they lost power,

00:24:59.131 --> 00:25:01.934
people lost lives.

00:25:01.934 --> 00:25:05.604
NARRATOR: Puerto Rican
 officials originally put
 the death toll at 64.

00:25:05.938 --> 00:25:10.976
But nearly a year later,
 raised that estimate to
 almost 3,000 people when

00:25:10.976 --> 00:25:14.813
accounting for the extended
 loss of electricity
 and the lack of food,

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:18.484
water and healthcare
 after the storm.

00:25:19.518 --> 00:25:24.857
Yet in the face of tragedy,
 a remote town of 18,000 in
 the mountains of Puerto Rico,

00:25:25.491 --> 00:25:28.861
showed how renewable energy
 can be a life-saving solution.

00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:56.789
DEYA: Casa Pueblo is a
community-based organization.

00:25:57.356 --> 00:26:01.527
We're actively working
to change our energy
landscape in Adjuntas.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.800
Everything in Casa Pueblo
runs on clean energy.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.420
The radio, the production
of our brand of coffee.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.380
We have cinema theater
run on solar power.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:21.760
So our installation
from being, let's say
10% solar power in 1999

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.680
now is fully solar power.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:33.600
After the hurricane,
the whole energy system
collapsed in Puerto Rico,

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.720
but not in Casa Pueblo.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:41.300
In Casa Pueblo we opened
right away and it was
used as an energy oasis.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:51.780
MARTINEZ-SANCHO:
Everyone saw Casa Pueblo
as the place to look for help

00:26:52.911 --> 00:26:56.014
because power was
not anywhere around.

00:26:57.216 --> 00:27:03.021
I remember coming
to Casa Pueblo and see how
many people will do the line

00:27:03.021 --> 00:27:06.091
for the solar lamps.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:11.940
At least we could give
them an option, a space,
to solve their problems.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:19.780
DEYA: If you look around, most
of the suffering is related
to the energy component:

00:27:21.707 --> 00:27:25.110
food storage, medicine,
medical treatment,

00:27:25.944 --> 00:27:32.718
so we decided to do the solar
urgency system for 10 houses,

00:27:32.718 --> 00:27:36.889
with special needs, to
give a small solar system and

00:27:36.889 --> 00:27:40.759
enough energy to run
special equipment like
the dialysis machine

00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:43.128
or the respiratory machine.

00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:47.000
And that's Maria's house.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.040
DEYA: In Puerto Rico,
we have to move away
from fossil fuel because

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:12.420
it's damaging our island,
our nature and others.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:17.060
So we are pushing for
energy self-sufficiency
for the country,

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:23.560
but in order to do that,
the first level is to reach
that goal, at a local level,

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:30.100
at a community level, to build
from the bottom up and to
teach others in other parts of

00:29:30.102 --> 00:29:36.208
Puerto Rico that we can
free our self by engaging
in these alternative

00:29:36.208 --> 00:29:38.777
that are within our reach.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.920
LOCKE: Renewable energy
is a core strategy for
building resilience right now

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.280
in the Caribbean.

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:49.087
I think it's in every circle
of conversation and dialogue,
whether you be at the highest

00:29:49.087 --> 00:29:52.090
levels of government or at
the local community level.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:56.261
And so several islands
including the Virgin Islands,
Dominica and many others are

00:29:56.261 --> 00:30:02.034
using the recent hurricanes
in the Caribbean as a catalyst
for replacing 20-century

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.280
fossil fuel grids with
21st century renewable grids.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.900
These islands do not want
to be referred to as the
victims of climate change

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.040
and instead are really the
ones bold enough to
provide the solutions.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:20.052
NARRATOR: Although Caribbean
 countries and other small
 island nations collectively

00:30:20.052 --> 00:30:25.891
produce less than 1% of
 global greenhouse gases, some
 are an important testing ground

00:30:25.891 --> 00:30:28.293
and a model for the
 future of clean energy.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.360
Scientists say that we
 must scale up renewables
 to meet the Paris targets.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:39.820
But how fast we must act,
 and what technologies we use,
 are the critical questions.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:45.077
TAYLOR: We have to reduce the
global consumption of fossil
fuels by about 80% by the year

00:30:45.077 --> 00:30:49.247
2050 and completely
remove them from
the global economy only

00:30:49.748 --> 00:30:51.650
a couple of
decades thereafter.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:56.321
And then figure a way
to get greenhouse gases
out of the atmosphere.

00:30:56.755 --> 00:30:58.857
That is a huge challenge.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:02.700
ROBERTS: If you map out
what it's going to take
to hit those targets,

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:07.460
you basically have
two broad choices and which
of those choices you choose

00:31:07.466 --> 00:31:10.335
probably depends on
who's making your model.

00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:12.037
If you're an oil company,

00:31:12.037 --> 00:31:15.006
like Shell for
instance just came out
with a scenario that shows

00:31:15.006 --> 00:31:20.178
in the short term continued
rise in fossil fuels and then

00:31:20.178 --> 00:31:23.281
around mid-century
this plunge in
emissions and then,

00:31:23.281 --> 00:31:26.685
the crucial bit, in the
latter half of the century,

00:31:26.685 --> 00:31:31.022
implementing technologies
which will involve capturing
and burying megatons of

00:31:31.022 --> 00:31:35.360
carbon, what they
call negative emissions.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:41.967
But maybe we shouldn't bet
the future of the human race
on a gigantic mega-project

00:31:41.967 --> 00:31:45.137
that we have not started
and do not know if we can do.

00:31:46.138 --> 00:31:48.974
Maybe that's
not a good gamble.

00:31:48.974 --> 00:31:52.177
But if you look at
the scenarios that show us
hitting our targets without

00:31:52.177 --> 00:31:56.381
negative emissions,
it involves in the short
term a very substantial,

00:31:56.915 --> 00:32:01.219
rapid decline in carbon
emissions, which means
you've got to start

00:32:01.219 --> 00:32:04.089
deploying the technology
you have as fast as possible.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:11.920
MANN: So we need to be putting
our foot on the renewable
energy acceleration pedal

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:16.580
because if we can act at the
municipal level, at the city
level, at the state level,

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:22.540
then we can actually make a
sizeable contribution towards
reducing our carbon emissions.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:27.920
NARRATOR: Renewable energy
 is being embraced as a real
 alternative to fossil fuels.

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:34.540
As their costs plummet,
 the movement continues
 to grow and many in America's

00:32:34.553 --> 00:32:38.390
heartland are
 reaping the benefits.

00:32:42.394 --> 00:32:44.129
(mooing).

00:32:50.202 --> 00:32:52.370
HOGG: Iowa is a
very beautiful state.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:55.073
Contrary to what most
people think, it's not flat.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.960
It's got rolling, beautiful
hills, it's a very
green state in the summer.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.380
We have great communities;

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.382
we have great people,
very friendly.

00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:09.221
JOHANNSEN: Politically,
Iowa's been really interesting.

00:33:09.221 --> 00:33:12.457
It's been a purple state
for a really long time.

00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:15.994
It voted for
Al Gore, George W. Bush,

00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:19.564
voted for Obama
twice and then went for Trump.

00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:24.236
HOGG: People like to be
independent, self-reliant.

00:33:24.236 --> 00:33:27.472
Agriculture is the
backbone of the state.

00:33:27.472 --> 00:33:32.143
It's just an incredibly
important industry,
economically, to our state,

00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:37.148
but it's much more than
economics, it's about culture
and it really is something

00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:39.240
that we take great pride in.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:46.260
YODER: I have probably
a herd of 60 cows, with
50 milking at any time.

00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:50.495
It's a hard way to make
a living and a good
way to raise a family.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.036
I was born in Kalona here.

00:33:58.036 --> 00:34:01.373
My parents and
grandparents were all farmers.

00:34:03.108 --> 00:34:05.176
MCKENNA: Kalona
is a small community.

00:34:05.176 --> 00:34:08.647
You know, when I took
the job I really didn't
know much about the history

00:34:08.647 --> 00:34:10.515
of the background here.

00:34:10.515 --> 00:34:12.484
You know, people
don't move from here.

00:34:12.484 --> 00:34:15.453
They know their cousins
and their cousins' cousins.

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:18.156
So you've got to
watch who you talk to.

00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:20.325
Everybody knows everybody.

00:34:21.493 --> 00:34:23.862
We're a small
rural electric co-op.

00:34:23.862 --> 00:34:28.033
The co-op's owned
by the people and
we have 620 customers.

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:32.400
This is the shop of the
hundred-year-old co-op.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.360
Yeah. These are
just all our customers.

00:34:36.374 --> 00:34:40.445
HOGG: Rural electric co-ops
were a creation of the
New Deal to make sure that

00:34:40.445 --> 00:34:44.883
electricity would be extended
to people in small rural
communities where previously

00:34:44.883 --> 00:34:48.186
they didn't have electricity.

00:34:48.453 --> 00:34:53.224
In Iowa, rural electric
co-ops provide electricity
for about one eighth of

00:34:53.224 --> 00:34:58.330
the state's population
and Warren has taken his
rural electric co-op and

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:03.535
been a solar energy leader
representing a conservative
community in Iowa.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:10.020
MCKENNA: Initially we took
an early vision to cut our
outside energy purchases by 25%.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:14.412
Solar kind of popped
into the picture in 2008.

00:35:14.412 --> 00:35:16.247
We wanted to sell one panel.

00:35:16.247 --> 00:35:20.085
If you wanted one
panel, you could call us
and we'll just try this.

00:35:20.418 --> 00:35:25.357
Well, in the first week
the flyer went in the bill,
we sold twice the number of

00:35:25.357 --> 00:35:29.361
panels that we planned for.

00:35:29.728 --> 00:35:35.266
So with Leighton, some solar
had started to build out
around him and he decided,

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:37.268
hey, this would work.

00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:40.238
So he tried one array
and then next thing you know
they're putting in two or three

00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:43.141
and those
aren't cheap arrays.

00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:45.710
When you're a farmer,
you spend that kind
of money, it has to work

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:48.546
and that's
why they come here.

00:35:48.546 --> 00:35:51.416
YODER: We use a lot of
electricity on a dairy farm.

00:35:51.416 --> 00:35:53.785
You use it to cool
the milk for the cows.

00:35:53.785 --> 00:35:57.589
You use it to run the
milking machines and a lot
of motors that you have.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:03.595
We have it fixed here with
our little cooperative that it
pays you to have solar energy.

00:36:04.963 --> 00:36:10.301
You're always looking to
cut some more costs so you
have some profits left over.

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:14.139
Most people are green,
that kind of green.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:19.444
MCKENNA: You get this
"A-ha" moment when somebody
comes in, that's what you,

00:36:19.444 --> 00:36:23.281
your perspective,
you think they're very, very
conservative politically and

00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:27.685
yet then they buy into this.

00:36:29.621 --> 00:36:32.223
Once our solar started
to grow around here,

00:36:32.223 --> 00:36:35.260
Ryan from the henhouse
had approached us on solar.

00:36:36.428 --> 00:36:39.564
MILLER: Here at Farmers
Hen House we're a
specialty egg company,

00:36:39.564 --> 00:36:43.435
so we produce and distribute
organic and free-range eggs.

00:36:44.169 --> 00:36:48.740
We process anywhere from
900,000 to a million eggs
a day, which is a lot.

00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:54.479
Energy is one of our large
costs of operation, but all
the power all the time it's

00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:57.682
100% from us here
and is completely solar.

00:36:58.483 --> 00:37:02.654
When the solar field
was first built it was the
largest solar field in Iowa.

00:37:03.655 --> 00:37:08.193
MCKENNA: Locally we
generate 20% on average
for the year with solar.

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:12.330
A lot of Sundays
we're 100% solar.

00:37:13.264 --> 00:37:16.734
HOGG: Warren has worked
with that community and
they are leading the way.

00:37:17.469 --> 00:37:22.207
Other rural electric co-ops
have stepped up and have
invested in solar power.

00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:27.879
NARRATOR: Across the country,
 from North Carolina to Texas,
 nearly 200 rural electric

00:37:27.879 --> 00:37:31.716
co-ops have embraced renewable
 energy and it's paying off.

00:37:32.517 --> 00:37:36.821
And solar is not the
 only renewable that's
 being adopted in Iowa.

00:37:36.821 --> 00:37:40.692
Wind energy has become
 a real powerhouse.

00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:46.631
Iowa currently gets
 37% of its electricity
 from renewables.

00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:49.734
If every other state did
 the same, the reduced
 emissions would get the

00:37:49.734 --> 00:37:54.672
U.S. nearly all the way
 to its 2025 Paris goals.

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:57.742
BYERS: Iowa is number one
in the country in terms of
percentage of electricity

00:37:57.742 --> 00:37:59.344
that's generated by wind.

00:37:59.344 --> 00:38:02.514
And we've had major
investments by our
utility companies.

00:38:02.514 --> 00:38:08.419
Just in June of 2018,
MidAmerican Energy announced
an additional $900 million

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:12.657
in wind generation
investment here in Iowa.

00:38:12.657 --> 00:38:15.527
And with that investment, that
raises their total investment

00:38:15.527 --> 00:38:18.863
in wind energy to
almost 13 billion.

00:38:18.863 --> 00:38:23.735
So all these massive
investments in wind energy
have been significant drivers

00:38:23.735 --> 00:38:25.904
in terms of
attracting the tech industry.

00:38:25.904 --> 00:38:30.608
Within the last few years,
Microsoft and Facebook created
data centers in this region

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:34.579
and just most
recently Apple announced a
data center investment

00:38:34.579 --> 00:38:36.548
here in Central Iowa.

00:38:36.548 --> 00:38:40.418
JANOUS: A single data
center is about the size
of four football fields

00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:42.453
and they consume
a lot of energy.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:46.740
One of the things that led
Microsoft to Iowa was the
renewable energy resource

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.720
that's available there.

00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:51.629
JACKSON: Clean power these
days is actually cheaper
in a lot of places.

00:38:51.629 --> 00:38:56.634
So it was really important
for Apple because our goal
is to make sure that this is

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:58.570
sustainable in every way.

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:01.306
And economic sustainability
is one of those ways.

00:39:01.973 --> 00:39:05.443
LUBBER: There are hundreds of
companies saying we are going
to build our goals around

00:39:05.443 --> 00:39:11.580
staying in the Paris Agreement
to address climate change
and go into 100% renewables.

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:15.720
There are also hundreds
of financial leaders and
investors who are putting

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.158
nearly a trillion dollars'
worth of commitments into
clean energy and clean

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.740
transportation, in
innovative technologies.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.966
And those are people
who aren't making economic
commitments because they think

00:39:27.966 --> 00:39:29.667
they're going to lose money.

00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:31.803
They're in it to make money
and that's a good thing.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.720
This is about
building our economy.

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:40.840
BYERS: People in Iowa are very
proud of what's happened with
the wind energy industry and

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:43.915
what it's meant in terms
of our ability to diversify
our economy and we've really

00:39:43.915 --> 00:39:47.819
focused on making this a
place where people want to be
and have great opportunities.

00:39:49.287 --> 00:39:52.590
FAITH: Pretty much all through
high school it's kind of
you're given a little bit

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:55.493
of a negative aspect
on like college cause
you're told you're going

00:39:55.493 --> 00:39:57.862
to have so much debt,
you're going to have
to be getting loans,

00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.964
you're going to have to be
paying for all of this and

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:02.700
you're probably not going
to get a job right as soon
as you're done with college.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.836
But as far
as like wind energy,

00:40:04.836 --> 00:40:06.704
my loans will be covered
because as soon as I'm

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:09.841
out of school I'm
almost guaranteed a job.

00:40:09.841 --> 00:40:12.677
DAN: We have a two-year
program and it results
in an associate in

00:40:12.677 --> 00:40:14.879
applied science degree
in wind technology.

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:18.883
And my daughter, Faith,
is actually interested
in technology fields and

00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:21.986
so she made the
decision that wind was
where she wanted to be.

00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:24.789
She's always been
one of those people
that likes excitement

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:27.892
and likes to do things
that are a little bit different.

00:40:29.227 --> 00:40:32.030
FAITH: I have a few friends
that are girls that are
getting interested

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:34.699
in it because I
hype it up a lot.

00:40:34.699 --> 00:40:36.801
DAN: We're going to
go ahead, and we have the
tower shut down right now,

00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:39.570
we're going to go
ahead and plan to bring
our bags up the tower.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.673
Make sure the equipment's
all safe and stowed.

00:40:41.673 --> 00:40:45.910
JESSIE: I'm passionate about
renewable energy and a
cleaner earth and job growth

00:40:46.344 --> 00:40:49.580
is 100% so
that's job security.

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:56.540
It's just everything about
this field seemed to kind of
fit with me and my lifestyle.

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:07.980
Going up our turbine
the first time was a
little nerve wracking,

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.780
but you just kind
of power through it and
you get so used to it

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:19.700
and then once you
get to the top, it
makes it so worth it.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:26.951
DAN: If the United States had
an energy goal of 20% of our
energy nationwide being drawn

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:32.023
from wind energy, we'll
need about 230,000 people
supporting this industry

00:41:32.023 --> 00:41:34.726
and we just
broke over 100,000.

00:41:34.726 --> 00:41:39.097
This is an opportunity
that hasn't been available in
America for a long, long time.

00:41:39.097 --> 00:41:43.601
Our students are walking
out with a two-year associate
in applied science degree

00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:46.738
and they're making
$50-90,000 right out the door.

00:41:47.004 --> 00:41:51.109
It's very rare that you have
anything on an industrial or
utility scale that doesn't

00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:55.113
really have a downside,
so we create lots of jobs,
we're really good for the

00:41:55.113 --> 00:41:58.916
environment, and we produce
the kind of energy that gets
us to that next best idea

00:41:58.916 --> 00:42:03.621
because we can
do what the coal-fired and
gas-fired plants do without

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:06.591
having all the
nasty side effects.

00:42:07.825 --> 00:42:12.130
GRASSLEY: There's just no way
that I would have predicted
all of these things about

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:17.460
wind energy would turn
out to be so good for
jobs in rural America.

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:23.500
It's projected in
a few years we could have
17,000 jobs connected

00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:26.644
with wind energy in Iowa.

00:42:26.911 --> 00:42:30.882
NARRATOR: In 2017,
 there were approximately
 10.3 million people employed

00:42:30.882 --> 00:42:33.518
in the renewable energy
 industry worldwide.

00:42:34.452 --> 00:42:38.089
Nearly 800,000 of those
 jobs were in the U.S.,

00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:41.859
which is 15 times more
 than coal mining jobs.

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:46.030
This trend is in part
 due to the plummeting
 cost of renewables,

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:48.833
but despite the continuing
 growth in this sector,

00:42:48.833 --> 00:42:53.538
the Trump administration
 aims to prop up
 fossil fuels including coal.

00:42:54.372 --> 00:42:57.708
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Today I'm
taking bold action to follow
through on that promise;

00:42:57.708 --> 00:43:01.679
my administration is putting
an end to the war on coal.

00:43:02.113 --> 00:43:04.882
REPORTER (over TV): Well
 the Trump administration is
 expected to announce a plan

00:43:04.882 --> 00:43:08.986
today to roll back
 rules on coal-fired power
 plants in an effort to

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:11.189
revive the coal industry.

00:43:11.189 --> 00:43:14.559
CLEETUS: The
Trump administration is now
trying, in all sorts of ways,

00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:19.063
to prop up the coal industry,
and by the coal industry,
this is not about coal workers,

00:43:19.697 --> 00:43:23.000
this is about coal
CEOs and their profits.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:29.006
MURRAY: The world needs our
coal and we will do just
fine if we get rid of the

00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:32.844
regulations and get the
government out of picking
winners and losers.

00:43:33.511 --> 00:43:36.747
HOLDEN: Bob Murray, the
Executive of Murray Energy,
one of the biggest coal

00:43:36.747 --> 00:43:41.185
companies in the country, has
sent over multiple documents
to the White House and to

00:43:41.185 --> 00:43:44.922
various agencies basically
laying out what he wants

00:43:44.922 --> 00:43:46.924
to happen in the
regulatory world.

00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:50.761
And one of those memos he
had sixteen recommendations,
including exiting the

00:43:50.761 --> 00:43:55.833
Paris Agreement, and the
administration has either
started or completed nearly

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:58.936
everything on that list.

00:43:58.936 --> 00:44:02.773
CLEETUS: This is deeply
harmful to the interest of
the American public and while

00:44:02.773 --> 00:44:07.912
there is some attention
to it in the media, what I'm
worried about is that so many

00:44:07.912 --> 00:44:11.115
of these things are
happening under the radar.

00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:15.620
NARRATOR: While the Trump
 Administration works to boost
 the fossil fuel industry,

00:44:16.254 --> 00:44:20.758
climate change resulting from
 the burning of those fuels
 is increasingly being felt,

00:44:21.225 --> 00:44:24.629
including in Iowa,
 the breadbasket of the world.

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:30.840
HOGG: We have got to safeguard
our farms from climate-related
disasters in the future.

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:35.239
Iowa is the food
reservoir for the world.

00:44:35.239 --> 00:44:38.976
When there are people who
have crop failures and they're
facing very serious problems,

00:44:38.976 --> 00:44:43.247
we're very proud of
the fact that we have
surplus to export.

00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:47.151
And it's a really
important role that
we play in the world.

00:44:47.552 --> 00:44:53.791
What happens if we can't keep
up with production because of
climate related catastrophes?

00:44:54.058 --> 00:44:56.027
Big drought, big flood.

00:44:56.027 --> 00:45:02.500
If we were to have a
catastrophic multi-year
crop failure in Iowa,

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:07.939
it would be utterly
devastating for the world and
we've seen more than a 40%

00:45:07.939 --> 00:45:12.109
increase in large
precipitation events in Iowa,

00:45:12.743 --> 00:45:15.746
and we had the flood of
2008 here in Cedar Rapids.

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:19.083
REPORTER (over TV):
 20,000 people have been
 evacuated from the area.

00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:22.853
More than 400 city
 blocks are still underwater.

00:45:22.853 --> 00:45:27.758
HOGG: 15 inches of
rain over the entire Cedar
River Basin over two weeks.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:35.200
And we had a flood stage
of 31 feet, more than 10 feet
higher than any previous flood.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.360
It's just unheard of.

00:45:37.368 --> 00:45:41.038
Other communities,
up river, it was worse.

00:45:44.809 --> 00:45:46.210
SWINTON: So, okay.

00:45:48.813 --> 00:45:51.816
This is the marker
I wanted you to see.

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:55.786
This is a marker that we
put up for the flood of 2008.

00:45:55.786 --> 00:45:58.055
This is how
high the water got.

00:45:58.055 --> 00:46:00.124
Now I'm, I'm six feet tall,
so this shows ya.

00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:03.828
This comes up to my,
to my shoulders and
this is how deep it was.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:15.720
VANCE: This was the garage,
the closet, there's a
electrical panel and furnace.

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:23.320
We had six and a half foot
of water on the main level
of the house for over a week.

00:46:23.748 --> 00:46:28.085
Stuff that was in our bedroom
wound up in the garage and
stuff that was in the garage

00:46:28.085 --> 00:46:32.089
wound up in the bedroom
and then lots of it
just floated away

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:36.894
and I imagine that's
in Louisiana now.

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.940
Yeah, it's kind of
spooky being in here.

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:48.039
In 2008, I wasn't going
to rebuild my house and
then everybody said, well,

00:46:48.039 --> 00:46:50.074
that'll never happen again.

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:57.120
It's never happened
in 150 years, so we did, but
then in 2016 it did it again.

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:01.280
REPORTER (over TV): Right
 now thousands of Iowans have
 packed their belongings and

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:05.920
evacuated and can only hope
 that their home is spared
 by the rising floodwater.

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:11.300
VANCE: It's kind of like
playing poker and I lost.

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:19.970
SWINTON: We basically
had two 500-year floods
within eight years.

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:24.975
Now we're thinking, well,
now we need to do something
because these 500-year floods

00:47:24.975 --> 00:47:27.445
aren't happening
every 500 years.

00:47:27.445 --> 00:47:31.282
They're happening
with more frequency.

00:47:31.649 --> 00:47:36.287
The rain is so much
heavier, so rather than get
four or five-inch rains,

00:47:36.287 --> 00:47:38.989
now we'll get a 14-inch rain.

00:47:40.658 --> 00:47:45.429
TAKLE: What's causing most of
our flooding is driven by the
fact that the Gulf of Mexico,

00:47:45.429 --> 00:47:47.998
where we get a lot
of our moisture in the
spring and early summer,

00:47:47.998 --> 00:47:49.900
is getting warmer.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.302
The more we
heat the atmosphere,

00:47:51.302 --> 00:47:54.472
the more we evaporate
water from the oceans.

00:47:54.472 --> 00:47:57.975
When we increase the amount
of water in the atmosphere,

00:47:57.975 --> 00:48:00.111
to the atmosphere,
that's like fuel.

00:48:00.111 --> 00:48:04.315
That's like gasoline almost
and that's what leads to
the intensity of these heavy

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:06.860
rain events that
we're seeing now.

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:15.020
VANCE: I don't think I'm going
to be leaving anytime soon.

00:48:24.702 --> 00:48:30.107
Especially in times
like this you need a
support system and family

00:48:30.374 --> 00:48:33.010
and friends have been that.

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:37.181
You know, they've
stepped up way beyond
my own expectations.

00:48:37.181 --> 00:48:41.051
They didn't need to
take time out of their life
to come and help set rafters

00:48:41.051 --> 00:48:44.054
or stuff but they did.

00:48:44.355 --> 00:48:48.125
HOGG: It is amazing to
this day that nobody died in
the flood and that's actually

00:48:48.125 --> 00:48:50.995
kind of a
testament to Iowans.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.820
People want to be involved.

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:58.469
People want to
take tangible action.

00:48:58.469 --> 00:49:04.980
They want to help,
and I've said since that, we
have to have the same spirit

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:11.040
of the sandbag about
safeguarding our people and our
property from future disasters,

00:49:11.749 --> 00:49:16.153
and that includes
getting our arms around
this climate problem.

00:49:17.087 --> 00:49:23.093
The flood of 2008 raised the
awareness of climate change in
Iowa and I hope we don't have

00:49:23.093 --> 00:49:26.297
to wait for everybody
to feel the disaster before
we decided to take action as

00:49:26.297 --> 00:49:28.299
a country on climate change.

00:49:28.933 --> 00:49:31.368
NARRATOR: The earth's
 average temperature
 has risen approximately

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:34.640
one degree Celsius since
 the Industrial Revolution,

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:38.342
which has created
 the impacts being felt today.

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:41.445
The Paris agreement
 aims to keep global
 average temperature

00:49:41.445 --> 00:49:44.415
well below
 2 degrees Celsius.

00:49:44.415 --> 00:49:48.319
But current international
 pledges won't get us there.

00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:51.789
So without increased
 commitments
 and fulfilling them,

00:49:51.789 --> 00:49:56.360
we could see a projected rise
 of as much as 3.2 degrees
 by the end of the century.

00:49:57.428 --> 00:50:02.299
But if U.S. states,
 cities and businesses cut U.S.
 emissions by 2% a year,

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:08.105
they would achieve more than
 a 75% reduction by 2050.

00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:12.476
This would put the U.S.
 on track to meet its goals
 under the Paris agreement,

00:50:12.476 --> 00:50:17.047
helping avoid a
 world dangerously altered
 by climate change.

00:50:17.047 --> 00:50:19.049
MANN: You know, what does
the world start to look like?

00:50:19.049 --> 00:50:20.517
We don't have to use our
imagination because Hollywood

00:50:20.517 --> 00:50:23.120
has already given
us those depictions.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.490
Some of the dystopian
visions of the future that
Hollywood has provided are

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:30.160
not unlike the actual
scenarios that national
security experts

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.463
are gaming out as
a worst-case scenario.

00:50:33.264 --> 00:50:36.433
GOODMAN: We know that climate
change is a threat multiplier

00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:38.435
for instability
around the world.

00:50:38.435 --> 00:50:42.139
We've seen that it's even
now a catalyst for conflict
in various regions of

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:47.700
the world across the
Middle East, across Africa,
across parts of Asia.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:53.060
We're seeing increased
instability and unrest
fomented by extreme storms,

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:57.040
lack of water, too
much rain, drought.

00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:01.280
All of these
factors are affecting the
stability of the planet

00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:03.494
and people where they live.

00:51:03.494 --> 00:51:07.264
REPORTER (over TV):
 More than 103 million
 Americans are under heat alert.

00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:11.602
MANN: We've seen devastating
heat waves in recent years,
not just around the country

00:51:12.436 --> 00:51:14.738
but around the world.

00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:18.208
REPORTER (over TV): In India,
 more than 2,000 people have
 died from the extreme heat.

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:23.314
MANN: These are things that we
predicted decades ago and now
in every sector of our lives,

00:51:23.714 --> 00:51:27.384
climate change constitutes
an existential threat.

00:51:28.052 --> 00:51:31.522
And people everywhere
are dealing with it
on the front lines.

00:51:50.207 --> 00:51:53.243
HYATT: When I was in
my 20s, I got into the
business as a farrier.

00:51:56.540 --> 00:52:01.360
And so, went to
horseshoeing school and have
been doing it ever since.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.580
Good boy. Good boy.

00:52:06.724 --> 00:52:09.593
I feel like I work
for the animal first
and the owner second,

00:52:09.593 --> 00:52:12.363
so I have an obligation
to take care of them.

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:25.376
I was coming back from LA with
my helper when we first heard
about the fire and driving

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:28.679
into Santa Paula
and I could see it.

00:52:28.679 --> 00:52:31.215
FIREMEN (over radio): We
 have a fire that's established
 behind multiple residences.

00:52:31.215 --> 00:52:34.618
Actually the fire is right
 near the power lines there.

00:52:34.618 --> 00:52:38.222
Engine 31 is fighting
 that fire right now.

00:52:38.222 --> 00:52:41.692
You're going to need other
 resources to head west.

00:52:41.692 --> 00:52:44.294
MAN: Holy (bleep).

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:49.620
Get out of here. Go, go.
Get out. It's time to go.

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:59.710
HYATT: We thought we had all
this time to get in, get the
animals out and we thought we

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:02.613
probably had at least an hour.

00:53:02.613 --> 00:53:04.748
Well, I was wrong.

00:53:05.449 --> 00:53:09.653
I called my daughters
and asked if they could
meet me at the house.

00:53:09.653 --> 00:53:13.223
I needed all the help I
could get to make sure we
got all the animals out.

00:53:14.124 --> 00:53:17.561
I have a three-horse trailer
and I had seven horses there.

00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:23.500
The first load of horses,
I got my girls' ponies out
and my boyfriend's horses out.

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:27.438
Took them to the fairgrounds
where everyone would
evacuate their animals to.

00:53:28.172 --> 00:53:31.442
This fire happened so
fast, hundreds of horses
needed to be evacuated.

00:53:32.009 --> 00:53:35.312
There was just a
mass exodus of animals.

00:53:35.312 --> 00:53:38.482
I'd remember telling
the girls, if we can't
get the horses out,

00:53:38.482 --> 00:53:40.818
just get them across
the bridge and let them go.

00:53:40.818 --> 00:53:43.687
At least they have a chance.

00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:48.459
I kind of just had to not
think about it and think okay,
they're going to be fine.

00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:50.661
They're going to be fine.

00:53:50.661 --> 00:53:55.332
We got back to the mouth
of the canyon and the fire
is going over the road.

00:53:56.867 --> 00:54:01.271
I just had to trust
that everything was
going to be okay.

00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:05.809
A gal who was still out
in the canyon saw my three
horses trotting up the road

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:10.820
in the smoke and she was
able to get my horses
in her horse trailer.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.360
Not a lot survived that fire.

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:29.860
It was, it burned
so hot that everything
just liquified.

00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:34.460
To not be able to save
anything was just really hard.

00:54:35.172 --> 00:54:40.377
Generations of collections
that, you know, that my,
my grandfather started.

00:54:41.745 --> 00:54:44.081
That just broke my heart.

00:54:44.081 --> 00:54:47.684
You know each month that goes
by it gets, it's supposed
to get a little easier.

00:54:48.652 --> 00:54:50.754
But um.

00:54:54.558 --> 00:54:58.428
NARRATOR: As average global
 temperatures have risen
 due to climate change,

00:54:58.428 --> 00:55:01.698
so has the number and
 frequency of large wildfires.

00:55:03.433 --> 00:55:08.672
Since the 70s, the wildfire
 season has grown from five
 months to almost year-round.

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:15.412
Scientists suggest this is
 in part due to the increased
 melting of sea ice in the

00:55:15.412 --> 00:55:19.416
Arctic that is changing the
 Northern Hemisphere Jetstream,
 which has veered north in the

00:55:19.416 --> 00:55:23.887
Western U.S., intensifying
 drought and dry
 conditions in California.

00:55:24.555 --> 00:55:29.560
BROWN: The drought
dries up the soil,
dries up the vegetation,

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:34.598
so now the moisture
that used to prevent forest
fires is now turned into

00:55:34.598 --> 00:55:37.634
an accelerant of forest fires.

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:39.803
REPORTER (over TV):
 The fires are creating
 their own weather.

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:45.380
Firenado spinning at
 150 miles per hour, forcing
 immediate evacuation.

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:50.580
NARRATOR: Such severe
 wildfires leave barren
 landscapes in their wake that

00:55:50.581 --> 00:55:52.983
are less able to
 absorb rainwater,

00:55:52.983 --> 00:55:55.819
creating an elevated risk
 of floods and mudslides.

00:55:56.653 --> 00:55:58.422
MAN: Oh my God!

00:55:59.823 --> 00:56:02.059
NARRATOR: The mudslides,
 combined with almost 9,000
 wildfires that burned through

00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:10.040
California in 2017, took
 65 lives and cost nearly 12
 billion dollars in damages.

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:15.740
Thousands of people were left
 without homes as the fires
 destroyed over a million acres

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:19.843
and 10,000 structures
 throughout the state.

00:56:19.843 --> 00:56:23.580
MANN: California is on the
front lines of dealing with
the devastating impacts of

00:56:24.181 --> 00:56:26.216
climate change.

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:29.686
The interesting thing is
they're also on the frontlines
of solving the problem.

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:34.858
ROBERTS: It's got one of
the most ambitious renewable
mandates, 50% by 2030,

00:56:35.592 --> 00:56:38.829
and one of the most
ambitious emission reduction
goals and you know,

00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:40.631
it's leading on
electric vehicles.

00:56:40.631 --> 00:56:42.699
It's leading on
electricity storage.

00:56:42.699 --> 00:56:47.638
I think California is kind
of giving other states
a model to rally around,

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:53.440
but the state is still
funded by fossil fuels.

00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:59.640
GARCETTI: A lot of people
think of Los Angeles
as Hollywood, Tinseltown.

00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:01.752
They think it's an
entertainment capital,
which it is now,

00:57:01.752 --> 00:57:04.788
but we weren't built because
of the entertainment industry.

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:07.024
We were an oil town.

00:57:07.024 --> 00:57:11.395
The third largest oil
field in America is right
underneath us right now.

00:57:13.563 --> 00:57:16.900
SARMIENTO: California
across the country and
around the world is seen

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:20.070
as a climate leader,
as an environmental leader.

00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:24.908
However, what we're
seeing on the ground
is continued approval

00:57:24.908 --> 00:57:29.413
and permitting of fossil fuel
projects in local communities.

00:57:38.889 --> 00:57:41.925
GUZMAN: I've basically lived
in Wilmington my entire life.

00:57:42.592 --> 00:57:46.596
We have the oil field
located right next to my
house and right across the

00:57:46.596 --> 00:57:49.566
street from
my grandma's house.

00:57:50.534 --> 00:57:52.869
Me and my brothers and
like the neighborhood kids,

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:55.605
we grew up like right
next to this oil field,

00:57:55.605 --> 00:57:59.576
we'd literally climb this
tree when we were little,
we didn't know what it was.

00:57:59.576 --> 00:58:02.012
So we would
just play in there.

00:58:02.779 --> 00:58:06.583
Living next door to
this, we experienced a
lot of sulfuric fumes.

00:58:07.284 --> 00:58:08.952
There's like a
thickness in the air.

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:12.823
And I realized
like, oh, it's the
fumes from the oil rigs.

00:58:12.823 --> 00:58:14.925
Sometimes you get headaches.

00:58:14.925 --> 00:58:17.794
I remember when we were
younger, my brother would
get nosebleeds for no reason.

00:58:18.462 --> 00:58:20.931
And my grandma, she has
like a heart condition.

00:58:20.931 --> 00:58:25.769
I just, I don't want anyone
else or anyone else's children
to have to live near that.

00:58:31.975 --> 00:58:36.646
SARMIENTO: What we see here
are historically
disadvantaged and low-income

00:58:36.646 --> 00:58:39.816
communities of color
impacted by toxic industries.

00:58:41.752 --> 00:58:45.622
We have high rates of
asthma; we have high,
high rates of cancer.

00:58:46.156 --> 00:58:48.392
We have high
rates of leukemia.

00:58:48.392 --> 00:58:54.664
In the neighboring baseball
field, we have seen a leukemia
fundraiser poster go up one

00:58:54.965 --> 00:59:00.504
time after another and
that's nothing any community
should have to go through.

00:59:00.837 --> 00:59:04.741
Everyone has the
right to breathe clean air.

00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:09.679
NARRATOR: A recent study found
 that people who live within
 500 feet of oil and gas wells

00:59:09.679 --> 00:59:13.083
have an 8 times higher
 lifetime risk of cancer.

00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:17.754
Another study found
 that more than 17 and a half
 million people throughout the

00:59:17.754 --> 00:59:21.625
U.S. live within a mile of
 oil and gas infrastructure.

00:59:22.626 --> 00:59:25.162
ROBERTS: California is
trying to juggle these things.

00:59:25.162 --> 00:59:28.799
They want the revenue from
the fossil fuel sales, because
if they keep it in the ground

00:59:29.366 --> 00:59:32.869
as the activist keeps
saying, that's a huge chunk
out of the state budget,

00:59:32.869 --> 00:59:35.605
which would harm
renewable energy efforts.

00:59:35.605 --> 00:59:37.841
Right? So there's
a real dilemma.

00:59:37.841 --> 00:59:40.811
BROWN: Most of the
oil resources must be
left in the ground.

00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:44.014
Now the question
is how do we get there
and how do we do that?

00:59:44.481 --> 00:59:49.586
And I think we can but we can
only do it by accelerating
the alternatives and

00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:53.824
changing the lifestyles
and the way our economies
are currently constituted.

00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:58.728
GARCETTI: You see
increasingly here in LA, kind
of a vision of the future,

00:59:58.728 --> 01:00:00.864
but also the
challenge of the future.

01:00:00.864 --> 01:00:04.460
And, and for us that
means our response has to
be comprehensive as well.

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:10.974
Probably what we're
best known for is our
soul-crushing traffic.

01:00:10.974 --> 01:00:14.711
We're the car capital of
America, if not the world.

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:17.414
GERRARD: Because of
the history of smog
in Los Angeles,

01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:22.652
California has been allowed
to have stronger fuel economy
standards for motor vehicles.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.924
But the Trump administration
is moving to weaken the
nationwide standards for

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:34.080
motor vehicle emissions
and is also moving
to take away California's

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.867
ability to set
its own standards.

01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:39.236
REPORTER (over TV):
 The Trump administration
 is moving towards cutting

01:00:39.236 --> 01:00:43.240
tougher fuel standards,
 and challenging California
 which sets the toughest fuel

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.640
standards in the country that
 12 states currently follow.

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:51.080
BROWN: The emissions from
transportation, cars and
trucks is going up and the

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:57.440
federal government at
the same time is now attacking
our standards and is attempting

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.920
to weaken them,
and in effect,

01:01:00.924 --> 01:01:03.760
add more climate
pollutants to the atmosphere.

01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:06.997
So that's a very bad idea and
we're going to fight that,

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:10.734
and I think we'll be very
successful in stopping that.

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:14.004
FABER-O'CONNOR: Transportation
is about a third of our total
greenhouse gas emissions in

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:19.809
Los Angeles, and we know that
in order to meet our climate
goals and really uphold the

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:23.580
Paris Climate Agreement,
we have to decarbonize
our transportation sector.

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:27.817
GARCETTI: We now are
looking to rebuild the most
ambitious public transit

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:29.486
system in the country.

01:01:29.486 --> 01:01:31.955
So voters passed a
permanent tax on
themselves that will build

01:01:31.955 --> 01:01:34.224
a new fifteen rapid
transit lines.

01:01:34.224 --> 01:01:39.162
And I think most people
don't know how important
Los Angeles and Long Beach

01:01:39.663 --> 01:01:42.065
are to this nation's economy.

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:46.836
They account for
about 40% of all the seaborne
goods that come into America.

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:51.775
Those huge ships that
feed our stores come in
right here to Los Angeles,

01:01:51.775 --> 01:01:54.010
and each one of
them is the equivalent
of tens of thousands

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:55.845
of greenhouse gas emissions.

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:57.981
But we're taking
aggressive actions.

01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:00.283
We want to go to
zero emission ports.

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:04.754
We see the technology in
trucks coming, we see the new
locomotives that are looking

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:09.125
at pure electric power,
and we're building out the
infrastructure for these large

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:12.460
ships to be able to plug in
and go off of electric power.

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.160
And then the third thing is,

01:02:15.165 --> 01:02:18.702
we're trying to
make sure everybody is a
part of the solar economy.

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:21.271
FABER-O'CONNOR: We have
taken the bull by the horns.

01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:25.041
We're the number one
solar city in America.

01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:28.111
Just in the city alone,
basically on rooftops,

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:31.848
we have enough solar
to power over 82,000 homes.

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:37.554
And equally important, we're
making sure that we have
programs that aren't just for

01:02:37.554 --> 01:02:40.991
the wealthiest of our
residents, but everybody.

01:02:41.558 --> 01:02:44.227
So there's solar equity
throughout Los Angeles.

01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:57.140
ANDRADE: Growing up, my
role models were out there
on the street, you know,

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:02.879
especially in east LA,
it's one of the largest
gang-populated areas.

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:05.315
So of course I'll be
running around the streets
at night, little teenager,

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:07.384
little kid,
not knowing any better.

01:03:07.384 --> 01:03:11.821
I had everything: guns,
drugs, just getting
in trouble, using.

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:16.259
If I wasn't selling drugs,
it's me robbing people
or stealing from homes,

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:18.895
breaking into them.

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:21.264
And that's how it all started.

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:25.720
May 10th, 2004, I went
to prison for 10 years.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.375
I was 18 years old.

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:35.278
Two strikes, I
didn't expect to get home.

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:38.915
So when that day finally
happened, where, hey,
you're getting released,

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:41.051
to me it was surreal.

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:45.288
This is finally happening,
like I made it, you know,
like God, after all this time.

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:50.260
You know, I had nieces
born, nephews born
that I never even seen

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.995
or met and you
know what I mean?

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:56.366
So that's just, yeah.

01:03:58.935 --> 01:04:01.838
Finally got to meet
them when I got out.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:09.045
I literally thought
I'd probably be back in
prison or dead already.

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:11.147
But then I got
the opportunity with
Homeboy Industries,

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:14.884
which is the largest
gang intervention
program in the U.S. Solar

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:17.320
happened to
be one of the programs
that was offered to me.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.956
And I said, yeah,
sure, like, let's do this.

01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:22.225
And I was like,
what's a solar panel?

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:23.927
That's how it got started.

01:04:23.927 --> 01:04:25.662
I just fell in love with it.

01:04:25.662 --> 01:04:28.131
Now I'm the Volunteer
Training Coordinator
for Grid Alternatives,

01:04:28.131 --> 01:04:29.966
Greater Los Angeles.

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:31.968
Salvador,
what's goin' on, man?

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:35.004
KADISH: Our mission
is to bring the benefits of
renewable energy technology

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:36.673
to underserved communities.

01:04:36.673 --> 01:04:39.342
We're able to have
people from the very
communities we serve,

01:04:39.342 --> 01:04:42.846
come out and get job
training on the
installations themselves.

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:47.984
I've worked with people
who have come from prison
and within, you know,

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:51.140
a year or two, are in
a management position at a
residential solar company.

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:54.860
You know, they're going
from incarceration into
being entrepreneurs.

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:57.193
-There's going to be
a lot to learn today.

01:04:57.193 --> 01:04:59.996
We are going to be on sort
of a steep pitched roof.

01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:02.132
So we definitely want
to go at a safe pace.

01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:04.300
When in doubt, ask.

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:08.171
ANDRADE: Last year we
placed 87 individuals
in solar careers.

01:05:08.171 --> 01:05:11.274
And honestly, they're
dedicated because like
myself, once I got released,

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:13.143
I want to stay
out of trouble.

01:05:13.143 --> 01:05:14.444
I just want to work.

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:16.379
I've been out of
prison five years.

01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:19.215
And now everything
I do is for my son.

01:05:20.717 --> 01:05:23.453
I want him
to have everything I
didn't have in life.

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:25.889
I want him to have it.

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:30.160
FABER-O'CONNOR: In
LA alone we have created
29,000 green jobs.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.997
Over 80,000 solar
jobs in the state.

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:36.366
There's such a
big opportunity.

01:05:36.366 --> 01:05:38.968
We're not afraid of
this being a job killer.

01:05:38.968 --> 01:05:43.039
This is a job creator
and people are coming to
Los Angeles, to California,

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:45.308
to be part of that revolution.

01:05:46.676 --> 01:05:50.747
BROWN: With Trump saying he's
going to pull out of Paris,
the next best thing is for

01:05:50.747 --> 01:05:55.418
states to take their
own action because the
climate is changing,

01:05:56.085 --> 01:06:01.391
there's real impacts in
real time and this is an
existential threat to the

01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:04.494
wellbeing of everyone
everywhere in the world.

01:06:05.061 --> 01:06:07.430
NARRATOR: Since
 the announcement to
 withdraw from Paris,

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:11.301
states and governors around
 the country have passed
 legislation to join the

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:15.071
U.S. climate alliance and
 uphold the commitments of
 the Paris Climate Accord.

01:06:16.606 --> 01:06:20.109
New Jersey recently introduced
 a bill to join the alliance,

01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:24.247
which would bring
 its membership to 16
 states plus Puerto Rico.

01:06:24.247 --> 01:06:28.084
MUKHERJI: Mr. Speaker,
this bill if passed
and signed into law will

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:30.353
help protect
generations to come.

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:33.122
MR. SPEAKER: Madam clerk
open the machine for a vote.

01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:39.562
Senate bill 598 having
received 49 votes
in the affirmative,

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:43.132
23 votes in the negative
and zero abstentions, I
declare the bill passed.

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:46.536
Let the bill take the
usual course of passed bills.

01:06:46.536 --> 01:06:49.572
NARRATOR: New Jersey's
 decision to join the
 U.S. Climate Alliance

01:06:49.572 --> 01:06:53.343
was successful
 due to a change in
 New Jersey's leadership.

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:56.646
POTOSNAK: Right up there
with California and New York,
New Jersey's probably on target

01:06:56.646 --> 01:06:58.514
to be the greenest
state in America.

01:06:58.514 --> 01:07:00.316
And that happened
in just one election.

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:02.118
MURPHY: So help me God.

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:04.487
POTOSNAK: The difference
between our new
governor, Phil Murphy,

01:07:04.487 --> 01:07:07.156
and Governor Chris Christie
couldn't be more clear.

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:10.093
It's like night and day.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:15.331
Following Hurricane Sandy,
what we saw from Governor
Christie was just ignoring the

01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:19.302
causes of climate
change and ignoring
things that we can do

01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:21.504
to be more resilient
with natural systems.

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:23.172
CHRISTIE: It's not a crisis.

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:26.075
The climate's been
changing forever and
it will always change.

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:28.511
POTOSNAK: It was
disappointing, but
it was also wrong,

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:31.848
but I can tell
you for a fact the people
here in New Jersey,

01:07:31.848 --> 01:07:35.184
they understand
the connection.

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:38.288
We were very, very
focused on making sure
the next governor,

01:07:38.288 --> 01:07:40.323
whoever was
going to be elected,

01:07:40.323 --> 01:07:45.161
was going to really
have strong plans to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.

01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:49.132
MURPHY: A stronger and fairer
New Jersey accepts the sad
reality of climate change

01:07:49.465 --> 01:07:54.270
and invests aggressively
in renewable energy
and it upholds the goals

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.873
of the
Paris Climate Accord.

01:07:56.873 --> 01:07:59.208
POTOSNAK: Since Governor
Murphy has come into office,

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:02.512
we saw a whirlwind
of action in a very
short period of time.

01:08:02.979 --> 01:08:06.182
And I think we can take
it a step further, because
setting the bar with Paris

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:11.554
is an important step, but
I don't think anyone who sees
a bar just wants to get there.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:15.491
We want to go and
reach even higher.

01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:19.562
NARRATOR: The movement that's
 working across the country
 continues to gain momentum.

01:08:19.896 --> 01:08:23.533
Since the days after the
 Trump announcement to leave
 the Paris Climate Accord,

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.738
the number of cities, states,
 businesses and organizations
 pledging to uphold the

01:08:28.738 --> 01:08:31.207
agreement has
 more than doubled.

01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:35.144
And with initiatives that
 are tracking the commitments
 for real change in

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:38.581
our energy future,
 the stakes and challenges
 couldn't be clearer.

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:44.153
But even in places
 grappling with the long
 legacy of fossil fuels,

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:47.590
commitments to a clean energy
 future are moving forward.

01:08:48.091 --> 01:08:50.426
Regardless of
 federal inaction.

01:08:51.728 --> 01:08:56.599
PEDUTO: I couldn't disagree
with the president any
stronger and I say that as

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:00.600
somebody who lived
through the Pittsburgh of old.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:05.380
Pittsburgh was the
center of heavy industry.

01:09:06.275 --> 01:09:09.679
Coal and steel became
a part of its legacy.

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:14.550
It was a two-shirt town,
meaning that if you
worked in corporate

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:16.753
Pittsburgh in the 1940s,

01:09:16.753 --> 01:09:20.957
you wore one shirt up
until lunchtime and then
you changed it because

01:09:20.957 --> 01:09:25.461
of the amount of soot
that would get on it.

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:32.280
During the 50s and the 60s,
we were one of the wealthiest
cities in the United States.

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:37.140
And then by 1979,
it all collapsed.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:45.420
Took 30 years between
1979 and 2009 to see
this city come back.

01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:51.660
ERVIN: The city
had to reimagine itself as
a knowledge economy where

01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:57.293
healthcare and education and
robotics really developed
and now we're starting

01:09:57.293 --> 01:09:59.328
to see the fruits
of those labors.

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:02.532
PEDUTO: There was
a whole different part of
Pittsburgh that was thinking

01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:06.669
maybe our future doesn't
necessarily have to
be based upon the past.

01:10:08.671 --> 01:10:12.508
And these were
the people that were looking
at technology and engineering

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:16.846
and understanding
it wasn't steel, it was
innovation that would be the

01:10:16.846 --> 01:10:22.000
cornerstone from which we
would build a new Pittsburgh.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:27.480
ERVIN: And now we're
in the position to reap some
of the benefits of those seeds

01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:30.593
that were sown and
create the clean economy.

01:10:30.593 --> 01:10:34.297
It's about changing
building codes, how we
plan our neighborhoods,

01:10:34.297 --> 01:10:36.732
how we design our streets.

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:42.220
So whether you are developing
new energy-efficient housing
or you know, creating new,

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:47.200
clean energy generation
systems, this is
economic development.

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:50.240
This is innovation.

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:54.817
PEDUTO: And today we are
fully committed to making
that transition to be at

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:59.622
100% renewable energy at the
city level, a 50% reduction
in the amount of energy

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:04.560
we're using and a zero-landfill
waste policy by 2030.

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:09.560
It's an ambitious
goal, but it's also a
very practical goal.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.738
This city is a
city of bridges.

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:20.443
We have more bridges
than most cities on earth.

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:25.515
As mayor, my job is to take
all the great things that I
remember from my childhood

01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:31.554
about Pittsburgh and what it
was and make sure it gets to
the other side of the bridge

01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:36.626
and then to be able to hand
it off to somebody, because I
believe that it's not just the

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:42.265
Pittsburghs but it's
the other cities, it's the
institutions and the youth

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:44.433
that will help
to lead the world.

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:46.435
PROTESTORS: Take it the polls!

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:47.770
MAN: Take it the street!

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:49.605
PROTESTORS: Take it the polls!

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:52.375
IRIS: This isn't just the
beginning of one march.

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:59.760
This is the start of us
taking control of our future.

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:02.652
(applause).

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:06.622
I started speaking out
because I felt like the youth
voice needed to be in the

01:12:06.622 --> 01:12:10.540
discussion about these
issues that are directly
going to impact us.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:17.560
And we are calling for
climate action because
this is zero hour.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.280
(cheering).

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:25.575
This is zero hour to act
on climate change because
the clock is ticking.

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:30.379
But when you bring together
a group of diverse young
people from all different

01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:36.519
backgrounds, we can really
come together as a movement
and take action because our

01:12:36.819 --> 01:12:39.789
lives are at stake here.

01:12:39.789 --> 01:12:42.692
EVA: I think people
in my generation and
the generation below

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:45.161
me see this as our future.

01:12:45.161 --> 01:12:49.832
We see a viable path where
people are working and people
are installing solar panels

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:53.836
and wind turbines and we just
see that as where we're going.

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:55.838
It's not even a question.

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:57.640
CASTRO: You look at the facts.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.911
The transformation
towards a renewable energy
future is the greatest

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:05.848
economic opportunity
of the 21st century.

01:13:06.249 --> 01:13:09.919
SUH: This is
not a left state,
right state, blue state,

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:12.755
red state issue.

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:17.860
This is a fantastic
opportunity for communities
to revitalize themselves and

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.963
combat climate change
at the exact same time.

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:23.599
KADISH: If climate
change is going to be
addressed successfully,

01:13:23.599 --> 01:13:27.803
everyone is going to need to
participate in the solutions
and that means not just

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:31.641
installing solar
on homes but moving people
into electric vehicles

01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:34.310
that are powered
by that solar.

01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:38.881
It means finding a way
for renters to benefit from
solar so that the gains

01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:42.018
from this new
economy flow to everybody.

01:13:42.018 --> 01:13:44.787
TAYLOR: We have to move
away from fossil fuels.

01:13:44.787 --> 01:13:49.492
One way to do that in
a fast and ambitious
fashion is to put a

01:13:49.492 --> 01:13:51.560
price on
greenhouse gas emissions.

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:55.598
LUBBER: And it's going to take
grappling with the reality
that we need to act now.

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:58.501
If we put it off, the
challenge gets bigger,
it gets greater.

01:13:58.501 --> 01:14:02.872
We still need scale and
having policy at a federal
level is going to be

01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:06.542
an imperative
to quicken the pace.

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:11.547
PEDUTO: And if we look at it
as an American Marshall Plan,
and we start to build out the

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:17.400
renewable energy industry,
we can exceed the goals
of the Paris Agreement.

01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:20.880
POTOSNAK: The minimal
thing you should be doing is
getting out there and asking

01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:24.527
candidates for office
and elected officials how
they're agreeing to tackle

01:14:24.527 --> 01:14:26.762
a big problem
like climate change.

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:28.764
FABER-O'CONNOR: We're all
a resident of somewhere,

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:32.601
so residents of cities
have a huge role to play.

01:14:32.601 --> 01:14:36.439
That's where we can pull
the levers on things like
transportation decisions,

01:14:36.939 --> 01:14:40.643
land use decisions, people
understanding where they
live, where they work,

01:14:40.943 --> 01:14:42.678
how they get around.

01:14:42.678 --> 01:14:45.681
This is their everyday
life that actually can
make a real difference.

01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:49.085
GARCETTI: I believe that
we will be able to bring
the best of technology,

01:14:49.085 --> 01:14:53.022
personal action, and
just the heart that
says, "this matters."

01:14:53.022 --> 01:14:56.625
Long after we're going to be
gone, that our children and
our children's children will

01:14:56.625 --> 01:15:01.597
have an earth and a quality
of life that we can feel
proud that we left behind.

01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:04.967
CLEETUS: What I'm hopeful
about is that there are so
many people around the world

01:15:04.967 --> 01:15:09.605
who are out there saying
that they want this vision
of a clean energy economy

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:12.041
and a future
that benefits all.

01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:15.878
So what we need to do is
galvanize this movement, put
pressure on our political

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:20.683
leaders to do what we want
them to do, to live up to
their responsibility to us,

01:15:21.317 --> 01:15:23.719
to our children and
our grandchildren.

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:26.922
