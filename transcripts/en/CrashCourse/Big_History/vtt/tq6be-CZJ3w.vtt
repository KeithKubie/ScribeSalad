Hi. I'm John Green and this is Crash Course
Big History, in which we'll be looking at

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.700
the history of, like, everything. I'm talking about
13.8 billion years, from the big bang to now.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.419
I mean, in this series, we are literally
going to attempt to tell you the story of

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.939
what Douglas Adams famously called
"life, the universe, and everything."

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.990
Mr Green! Mr Green! That's not history. That's
science, and science is for nerds!

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.400
Oh, me from the past! Things would be so much
easier for you if you would just accept that

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.540
you are, in fact, a nerd! And that's okay!
I mean, look at this picture, dude!

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.920
Anyway, academics often describe history as
like, all the stuff that's happened since

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.640
we started writing things down, but they only start there
because that's where we have the best information.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.640
And yeah, I think that the advent of writing
was a huge deal, obviously, but as a start

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.180
date for history, it's totally arbitrary! It's just a line we
drew in the sand and said "okay, history begins now!"

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.300
In Big History, we're gonna start history
when it really starts - at least, we think

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.370
- at the creation of the universe, and we're
gonna end that story where it ends - please

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.280
let that be after I die! Well, I guess it will definitely
be after I die, just - I want it to be a while after I die!

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.690
So we're even gonna terrify traditional historians
by using physics to make some predictions

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.720
about the future, and we're gonna end many
trillions and trillions of years from now,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.420
when the universe itself, spoiler alert: dies.
At least, in a manner of speaking.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:35.200
[Theme Music]

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.760
Hey! I'm not John. If you're thinking we look
a little bit the same, that's because we're brothers.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.400
I'm Hank. Anyway, if you wanna learn the 13.8 billion
year history of the universe in the same amount

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.920
of time that we usually cover the 238 years of American
history, you're not gonna get the same resolution.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.440
Of course, knowing the names and dates of American history is important, but we just can't do that in Big History.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.060
There are much broader historical questions
in the story of the universe that can only

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.800
be explored by zooming out to the ultimate
scale. As you zoom out, you see a lot more

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.730
of the picture. The details get a little fuzzy,
but we quickly realize that history is everything.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.090
Cosmology, geology, biology, social sciences,
literature, physics... Everything!

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.200
You might think that such a scale would be
filled with way too much detail, but the amount

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.560
of detail an answer requires, depends on the
nature of the question. Some questions can

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.610
only be explored by zooming out. That is what
Big History does.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.420
Speaking of zoomed out, this is Earthrise,
one of the most famous photographs of all

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.580
time. William Anders, an Apollo astronaut,
took it in 1968. From the surface of another

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.700
world, we see our planet as a little ball
in space. No borders, no people, no buildings.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.540
Just oceans and clouds and continents being
shined upon by the sun.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.200
That sheer expansion of scale gives me perspective.
It lets me imagine all the complexity of life

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.160
on Earth, from the gasoline engine that powered
my trip to the studio, to political instability

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.930
in Nepal as part of a thriving, living, teeming
mass of life floating in the emptiness of space.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.069
So what that photograph does for physical
space, Big History aims to do for everything.

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:16.160
I mean, we wanna contextualize all of existence.
We wanna outline the most powerful and important breakthroughs,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.920
the tremendous scale of existence, and how we 
know what we know, and why we're sure we know it.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.220
All right, let's go to the Thought Bubble. So
the universe is big. Like, really big. And it's also old.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.480
Like, 13.8 billion years old, which is enough
years that there is no way to actually comprehend it.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.180
So let's just compress that age to 13 years,
small enough that our puny brains can handle it.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.069
On that timescale, the universe would have
begun 13 years ago, in 2001. George W Bush

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.260
had just been sworn in as president, most Americans on
the internet were connecting to it with dial-up modems.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.580
Right, so the first stars and galaxies would
have formed 12 years ago, but seven and a

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.200
half more years would pass until the Earth
formed, about 4.5 years ago. Move a little

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.290
bit up to four years ago - that's when the
first single celled life formed on Earth.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.990
Then leap forward nearly three and a half
more years before the first multi-cellular

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.130
organisms in the Cambrian explosion...

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.270
What I'm trying to explain is that all complex
life on Earth is a fairly recent development.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.650
Like, on this scale, the dinosaurs went
extinct about three weeks ago --

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.950
roughly the last time I changed my Facebook status.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.390
Humans and chimpanzees split from their last
shared ancestor about three days ago!

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.280
The first homo sapiens emerged fifty minutes ago,
roughly the last time I checked my email.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.060
We left Africa 26 minutes ago. The American-Indians
reached the Americas 6 minutes ago --

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.960
roughly the last time I checked my Twitter.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.300
We invented agriculture 5 minutes ago. Ancient
Egypt? 3 minutes ago! The Black Death? 24

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.210
seconds ago. The Industrial Revolution - 6
seconds. World War One, 2 seconds. The Cold

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.020
War, th e first man on the moon, your birth, the internet,
the Big Mac? All within the last second.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.640
But in many other ways, complex life and humanity
are exceptional. Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.280
Also exceptional, by the way, the Mongols!
[Mongoltage]

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.360
Okay, let's begin at the beginning! The big
bang!

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.220
Hank, wait a second! Woah, woah, woah, woah,
woah. I- I don't understand how we know that

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.280
the big bang is really the beginning. Like,
what happened before the big bang?

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.000
Well. Okay. Uh... Theoretical physicists say
that space and time are not two different

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:26.020
things. They are two expressions of one thing
- space-time. And space-time was created by

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.540
the big bang, thus time didn't exist before
the big bang, so it doesn't make much sense

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.040
to ask what happened before it. There was
no "then", then!

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.060
Of course, this, like many ideas in cosmology,
doesn't really make any sense to our puny

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.500
human brains. It's largely beyond our comprehension,
rather like explaining color to a blind person.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.350
We know that it's true because the math works
and it explains our observations so elegantly,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.400
but it's so far outside of how we directly
perceive the world, that I don't think it's

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.070
something even the most genius physicists
are able to imagine.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.140
But yeah, if you're gonna do a chronological
study of the universe, the creation of time

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.360
is probably a pretty good place to start the
story.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.199
So the big bang wasn't something that happened
inside the universe, nor did it expand into

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:15.320
some kind of void. It was literally the moment
when both time and space were created. The

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.510
thing that was banging was the universe itself.
It was expanding from an unimaginably tiny

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.340
point to an unimaginably large universe, unimaginably
quickly.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.020
Unimaginable is basically the subtitle to
the story of the big bang, but then again,

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.210
it's also kind of the subtitle to everything
else in big history.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.240
I mean, I can only do this occasionally, but
sometimes you look outside and you're like,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.280
"Oh, my goodness! This is nuts! How did we get trees?"
Needless to say, we will be talking about that.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.120
Anyway, the universe is a hard worker, and
it got most of the heavy lifting done in those

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.180
first few seconds. For comparison, it takes
me about twenty minutes after I wake up for

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.449
me to even get myself into a standing position.
But the universe is somewhat more efficient.

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:00.210
In the barest fraction of the first second,
the universe inflated from something many,

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:05.009
many, many times smaller than an atom to about
the size of a grapefruit. Like, think of it

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:08.660
this way: in much less than a blink of an
eye, if it'd originally been the size of a

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.860
tennis ball, it would have inflated to over
ninety billion light-years across.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.800
This inflation theory has been well backed-up
by mathematics for a long time now, but it

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.009
has recently received some staggering new
support from the BICEP project at the South

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:23.600
Pole, which sadly has nothing to do with my
guns.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.610
Ten seconds after the big bang, the universe
had expanded enough that the normal rules

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.759
of the universe, with atomic forces and gravity
and electromagnetism that we know and love

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:37.250
today, were already in charge. All of the
anti-matter created in the big bang had combined

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:42.770
with matter and annihilated itself, leaving
behind only one billionth of the matter created

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:48.100
in the big bang, and that billionth is everything!
And I mean everything. Every grain of sand,

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.640
every blueberry you will ever eat, every star
that you will ever see - everything!

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:58.140
We've already tried to understand how big a billion is,
but just pause to think about that - everything!

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:04.160
Everything! Is one billionth of the matter
created in the big bang. [Explosion sound]

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:09.060
The first law of thermodynamics is that matter
and energy cannot be created or destroyed.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:14.640
Everything we have now, we had then. The matter
that makes up your body right now has been

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:20.170
around since those moments 13.8 billion years
ago. It's simply changed form.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:24.400
After just three minutes, the universe was
cool enough that the nuclei of atoms started

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.650
forming - just hydrogen and helium back then,
the two simplest elements - keep those two

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.389
in mind, however, because it turns out, if
you take a bunch of hydrogen and you wait

00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:35.679
like, several billion years, you might just
grow yourself some humans!

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:39.709
Let's remember: at this time, the universe
was still very, very hot. I don't wanna use

00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:43.300
the word unimaginable too often, but it was
unimaginably hot!

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:48.139
The universe remained like an uber-hot sea
dominated by radiation, but then luckily,

00:08:48.139 --> 00:08:52.850
it simmered down to a balmy 5,000 degrees
Fahrenheit about 380 thousand years after

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.100
the big bang, allowing matter and radiation
to separate.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.350
And remember, matter is just a more congealed
form of energy. I mean, you are a somewhat

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.350
firm bag of energy. In my case, not that firm.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:09.110
So anyway, at 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit, radiation
was finally able to move freely through the

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:13.980
universe, and we see that radiation today
as the end of the Dark Ages that followed

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:19.540
the big bang, and the beginning of a brilliant
flash that we call Cosmic Background Radiation,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.740
which is a great name for a band.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.619
Physicists call it the fingerprint of the
universe and it's one of the most important

00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:30.660
pieces of historical evidence we have for
the big bang, because CBR is everywhere.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.290
Tune your radio to a frequency that doesn't
have a station - a portion of the static you

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:40.600
hear is actually that cosmic background radiation
being picked up by your radio. So you can

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.360
literally hear the universe in its infancy!

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.360
Sometimes it can be tricky to know what's
true, especially when we're talking about

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.689
stuff that happened so far in the distant
past. That is why we created science, that

00:09:52.689 --> 00:09:56.110
elegant system for sorting out the facts from
the fertilizer.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.800
So just using your limited human senses, you
might come to the same conclusion as 19th

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:06.649
century scientists, that the universe is static,
eternal and infinite... But then, using our

00:10:06.649 --> 00:10:10.920
minds, if the universe is infinite and contains
infinite stars and it has always existed,

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.369
then the night sky, and the day-time sky for
that matter, would literally be filled with

00:10:15.369 --> 00:10:20.319
stars - so much that day and night would be
indistinguishable! This is clearly not the

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:22.339
case, so something must be amiss.

00:10:22.339 --> 00:10:27.019
The universe must either be not static, not
infinite or not eternal. So which is it? You

00:10:27.019 --> 00:10:30.249
know how when an ambulance drives towards
you, the sound-waves are compressed and the

00:10:30.249 --> 00:10:33.929
siren sounds higher pitched, and as it speeds
away, the waves are stretched out and the

00:10:33.929 --> 00:10:35.679
pitch is lower? It's the Doppler effect.

00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:40.790
Well, here's another name you've heard. Edwin
Hubble. He realized that light does the same

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:45.249
thing. Galaxies and stars moving away from
us have their light stretched out, making

00:10:45.249 --> 00:10:49.920
it more red, and stars moving toward us have
their light compressed, making it more blue.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.589
Combined with the work of Henrietta Leavitt,
which allowed us to accurately estimate how

00:10:53.589 --> 00:10:59.839
far away stars are, Hubble was able to determine that
stars, on the whole, are flying away from each other.

00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:03.939
He discovered that the most remote objects
in the sky were all red-shifted and were actually

00:11:03.939 --> 00:11:08.009
other galaxies beyond the milky way, moving
away from us. From here, he built upon the

00:11:08.009 --> 00:11:13.399
work of Belgian Catholic priest Georges Lemaitre,
who hypothesized that the universe began at

00:11:13.399 --> 00:11:18.189
a single point. Big bang cosmologists wanted
proof though. They knew that the amount of

00:11:18.189 --> 00:11:22.720
radiation released by the big bang would be
massive, and they wanted to see it.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.269
It wasn't until the 1960s that it was found
accidentally, by two guys working on an antenna

00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:32.449
at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey. They were
trying to eliminate all the background noise

00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:37.819
from an extremely sensitive radio antenna, but they
found this faint hum coming from every direction.

00:11:37.819 --> 00:11:41.649
They tried everything they could to get rid
of it, including murdering the pigeons that

00:11:41.649 --> 00:11:46.529
kept pooping on the antenna - kinda sad, but
those pigeons - they gave their lives for

00:11:46.529 --> 00:11:50.639
one of the most profound discoveries in modern
science. A conversation with a local radio

00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:54.339
astronomer lead them to show their findings
to an astronomer at Princeton, who confirmed

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:57.499
the existence of what had been predicted for
years.

00:11:57.499 --> 00:12:02.420
The final piece of that big bang puzzle is
that we can see it. Light has a speed. When

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.569
we look at the sun, we're seeing the light
that left it eight minutes ago, but if we

00:12:06.569 --> 00:12:10.889
look at something that's 13.8 billion light-years
away, we're seeing the stuff that happened

00:12:10.889 --> 00:12:16.909
13.8 billion years ago! That radiation has been
traveling since the very beginning of the universe.

00:12:16.909 --> 00:12:21.579
Not only can we tell very clearly that there
was just nothing there before that, we can

00:12:21.579 --> 00:12:25.989
now study that radiation to learn the sequence
of events of the big bang. We can also see

00:12:25.989 --> 00:12:29.889
that the chemical composition of the early
universe is what we'd expect to see - a lot

00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:34.860
of hydrogen, a lot of helium and a tiny pinch
of lithium. The rest of the periodic table

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.200
had to wait for the fiery furnaces and the
bellies of stars to be created.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.900
But more on that, next episode!

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:44.790
As far as we've come in the past century in
crafting a history of the universe, there

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:49.709
are still many things cosmologists have yet
to discover. For instance, the universe behaves

00:12:49.709 --> 00:12:54.449
as if there's a bunch of matter in it that
we can't see or detect. Galaxies' gravitation

00:12:54.449 --> 00:12:58.929
is affected by this matter, but it's otherwise
completely invisible to us. Physicists call

00:12:58.929 --> 00:13:03.749
it dark matter, but we have no idea what it
is! But as in any historical endeavor, new

00:13:03.749 --> 00:13:08.730
discoveries will alter the story in future
years, so expect the big histories of ten

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.529
or twenty years from now to look very different
from today's.

00:13:11.529 --> 00:13:15.189
But this isn't discouraging, because like,
knowing everything would be boring!

00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:20.079
There's a lot left to discover, and at the current
pace of scientific inquiry, many of those

00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:24.439
amazing discoveries will await us in our lifetime!
Or at least in your lifetime.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:29.100
Whether it be World War Two or the life of
Abe Lincoln, all histories ultimately start

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.569
with the big bang. Yeah, it would be silly
to start your typical World War Two textbook

00:13:33.569 --> 00:13:37.709
with the big bang, but it would be about a
hundred trillion, trillion times more ridiculous

00:13:37.709 --> 00:13:42.279
to say the big bang - the mother of all historical
events - was not history.

00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:47.279
And that's why big history reaches into the
lives of every person on this tiny speck of

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:53.819
dust we call home, regardless of nation, class
or creed, and forms our common story.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.260
See you next time!
