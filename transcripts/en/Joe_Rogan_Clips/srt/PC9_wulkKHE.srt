1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,900
The Joe Rogan experience.
You got spidey sense, man.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,241
Got It.

3
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:10,200
So one of the most humbling things
about getting older is the vision going.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,210
Oh yeah.
Okay.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,960
I've known like from when I was like 42
I started to notice it and by the time I

6
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:17,540
was 46 I was like,
God damn.

7
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:22,080
And I think I need glasses because I
would just try to like read the computer

8
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:23,490
and I'd be doing this with my eyes,

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,110
like bulging my eyes and squinting and
trying to look at it sideways and try and

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,510
see what the fuck I was ready. It's
a weird thing. It's like, oh boy.

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,490
My ability to see the world
is fading. It happens. Yeah.

12
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:38,310
It was to the best of this, but it's
a warning sign like, hey man, this is,

13
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:41,370
you know, this is a finite
existence. Yeah. Oh,

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,870
get some shit done right now.
Right now.

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,000
Don't wait. It's going to be waiting
time. It sets a precious commodity.

16
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,680
Billionaires,

17
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,600
you can not buy one second
nine oh one second of life.

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,880
Yeah. Can't do it. Nope. It's whole price.

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,600
Anything that you're thinking about
doing and you've been putting off?

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,940
My advice is big.
Get step and get to next year.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,800
Right now we get after it. Don't
put it off any longer. Get it done.

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,820
So do you feel like you're like
CT Fletcher 2.0 definitely.

23
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,340
I'm a new dude. I knew dude
with a new attitude. Yeah.

24
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,850
Yeah. Big Time. Oh boy. You
won't be arguing at Taylor.

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,820
The guys I used to argue with
online, Hey, I love you man.

26
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,770
You can hate me all you want to. I love
to see I ain't got time for hate. Yeah.

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,710
Racism or a big, I got time for none
of that. It's all foolish and I said,

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,700
it's so much bullshit and just a waste
of time and ain't even fighting. Yeah.

29
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,390
I'm like,
look,

30
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,390
if the in the transplant
experience enhanced my view,

31
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,880
I've always said,
we were all saying I need a bar.

32
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,670
My mom taught me love
everybody, but look, they took,

33
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,700
I have no idea the nationality
or race up the donor,

34
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,620
it don't matter. I hope you're right.
If you're right, it's an Asian woman.

35
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:12,050
I think that would be fantastic.
Then you could feel that,

36
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,990
that you would know that
and you could feel it. Man,

37
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:19,380
we that be something to be amazing. I
got to find out. How can you find out? I,

38
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,310
I don't, I have no idea. I want that.

39
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:24,740
Hopefully they're listening
to the Joe Rogan podcast.

40
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:25,850
Okay.
