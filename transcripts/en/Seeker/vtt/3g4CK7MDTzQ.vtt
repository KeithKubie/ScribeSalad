00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.160
Hey guys, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.380
San Francisco is notoriously hilly

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.040
and when you're going up and down those hills,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.420
you get potential energy and kinetic energy

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.200
and it gets wasted if you don't harvest it back from your environment

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.010
which brings us to something called regenerative braking.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.420
Before we get to the science of harvesting energy from your brakes,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.000
we're on Potrero Hill, one of 43 different hills in San Francisco.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.500
Some are so steep, they feel like rollercoasters.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.500
Some of the steepest and most beautiful are Pacific Heights, Knob Hill, and Potrero Hill.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.880
The reason we're on this hill is energy.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.100
When a car drives to the top of the hill, it gains potential energy.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.400
As it accelerates down the hill, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.400
Usually the kinetic energy just dissipates unless we can capture it.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.380
In a regular car, friction is applied using hydraulics and brake pads

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.160
in order to slow the vehicle, with heat being the byproduct.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.300
Hybrids take that a step further

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.100
by intelligently making use of a relationship

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.320
between magnetism and electricity.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.920
With regenerative braking, that electric motor that propels the car forward

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.960
can actually be turned by the kinetic momentum of the car

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.080
during deceleration and braking.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.080
By turning the electric motor,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.080
it acts as a generator,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.620
so instead of heat, electricity is the byproduct.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.820
This electricity is then fed back into the battery, helping to recharge it.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.860
This means when you're hitting the brake in a Toyota Prius Prime, like this one Toyota let us use,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.020
the car doesn't let all that potential energy go to waste, from the top of the hill to the bottom.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.060
Instead, the hill itself plus gravity and the trade-off of potential and kinetic energy

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.100
are all contributing to recharging the car's batteries.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.780
It's not just helpful on these straight hills, but on curvy ones as well.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.320
Lombard Street is considered the crookedest street in San Francisco

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.580
but that's not, strictly speaking, true.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.060
It's actually Vermont Street here in Potrero Hill.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.960
Regenerative brakes aren't super new.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.360
In fact, in 1903, Louis Antoine Krieger built one of the first electric cars

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.560
by putting an electric motor on a Parisian horse carriage

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.460
and it had regenerative braking.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.180
The idea was incorporated into trolley cars, early electric vehicles

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.380
and even today, you can even find it in my e-bike, the Stromer ST1X.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.600
This bike has regenerative braking too.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.760
This bad boy has an electric motor to help me get up these hills,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.900
but when I'm heading down, it will recharge the battery.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.480
When I'm coasting down a hill, I can generate up to 15 amps of current,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.700
more than enough to power even the fanciest vacuum or electric lawnmower.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.160
You don't have to be on a hill to harvest electricity from your environment.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.960
Even just driving down the highway can do it.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.820
If you're traveling 50 miles (80.46 kilometers) per hour and let off the gas,

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.340
you've still got a lot of potential energy flowing through your vehicle.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.340
Braking, even on flat ground, will still gather electricity through the coiled wires around the axles.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.820
Who'd have thought technology from around the turn of the last century,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.640
would finally hit everywhere in THIS century?

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.360
Hopefully, with more hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles hitting the road in the coming years,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.280
we will keep thinking about how to grab all of those stray energy sources.
