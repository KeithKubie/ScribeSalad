what's next I mean if on the one end you

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820
what's next I mean if on the one end you
 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.639
what's next I mean if on the one end you
have vegans and on the other hand you

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649
have vegans and on the other hand you
 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.040

problem with the way most Americans eat

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330
problem with the way most Americans eat
 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.070
problem with the way most Americans eat
right now is that we are about as far

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080
right now is that we are about as far
 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.669
right now is that we are about as far
from veganism as we could be so a vegan

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679
from veganism as we could be so a vegan
 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.040
from veganism as we could be so a vegan
would get one hundred percent of his or

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050
would get one hundred percent of his or
 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.429
would get one hundred percent of his or
her calories from plants most Americans

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
her calories from plants most Americans
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.890
her calories from plants most Americans
get ninety percent of their calories

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900
get ninety percent of their calories
 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.889
get ninety percent of their calories
from processed food junk food and animal

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899
from processed food junk food and animal
 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.530
from processed food junk food and animal
products so the the goal i think is to

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540
products so the the goal i think is to
 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.110
products so the the goal i think is to
move in the direction of eating more

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120
move in the direction of eating more
 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.819
move in the direction of eating more
unprocessed plant food than we do now

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829
unprocessed plant food than we do now
 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.590
unprocessed plant food than we do now
and everybody's got a different starting

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600
and everybody's got a different starting
 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.259
and everybody's got a different starting
place if you eat 20 cheeseburgers a week

place if you eat 20 cheeseburgers a week
 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.420
place if you eat 20 cheeseburgers a week
or the equivalent you might look at

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430
or the equivalent you might look at
 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.400
or the equivalent you might look at
eating 15 cheeseburgers a week or the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410
eating 15 cheeseburgers a week or the
 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.650
eating 15 cheeseburgers a week or the
equivalent if you're eating 15 you might

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660
equivalent if you're eating 15 you might
 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.080
equivalent if you're eating 15 you might
look at eating 10 and so on and I think

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090
look at eating 10 and so on and I think
 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.870
look at eating 10 and so on and I think
if people think about what's best for

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880
if people think about what's best for
 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.340
if people think about what's best for
their body what's best for the planet

the answer is eating unprocessed plant

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630
the answer is eating unprocessed plant
 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.229
the answer is eating unprocessed plant
food and then think about how can I eat

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239
food and then think about how can I eat
 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.180
food and then think about how can I eat
more of that stuff at the expense of

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190
more of that stuff at the expense of
 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.920
more of that stuff at the expense of
meat which was you know which was the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930
meat which was you know which was the
 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.390
meat which was you know which was the
question but also at the expense of

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400
question but also at the expense of
 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.050
