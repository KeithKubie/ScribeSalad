1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.100
The Joe Rogan experience.
Zero alcohol.
Let's get crazy.

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.780
Let's pace ourselves.
She takes cheers,
sir.
I'm gonna Chug this.
Whoa.

3
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:13.950
Don't deny any of that.
Sweet,
dangerous.
Zero alcohol.
How many calories though?

4
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.100
We scared cow horse,
Bro.
Tell you stay alive.

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.760
That's going to get your energy back there.
Plenty of calories already.

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.740
I have to ask you.
Did you drive it in the Hemi?
No,
I didn't.

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.770
I got dropped off in a Chevy.
Oh my God.
This is outrageous.

8
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.680
I had one for a little while.
Just a little while.

9
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.180
Figured like you would have to have one for quite a long time.
It was fun.
Well,

10
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.280
okay,
I'm going to backtrack a little day.
So first commercial,
right,
that,

11
00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:42.570
thank God I hear me right.

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.430
I did six of these things and around commercial three,
I,

13
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:49.890
uh,
I was talking to my agent and I said,
man,
you know,

14
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.390
if they asked you to do another one,
oh shit.
Here we go.
Yeah.

15
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.320
My God,
that's the worst I've ever looked at my life.

16
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.290
I really felt like I was sitting in the desert like no one's ever going to see

17
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:03.960
these commercials.
That wasn't going to know what a Hammy is incorrect.

18
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.600
I could not have been more wrong.
Yeah,
yeah.
There it is.

19
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.840
Look at that bad ass.
Did they give you one or did you just go out and buy one?

20
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.500
Well,
I said,
listen,
if they,
if they want me to do another commercial,

21
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:20.250
see if you can get a vehicle out of them.
Right in.
My agent was like,
you know,

22
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:23.220
make it their problem.
He calls him up.
He goes,
hey,
I don't know if you know this,

23
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.660
but your [inaudible] guy,

24
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.550
your spokesman is driving around Los Angeles right now on a Suzuki sidekick.
Oh.

25
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.050
And they're like,
hey,
miss.
I found out the fucking,

26
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:38.670
the CMOS,
so at the same thing,
it's the lightest.

27
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.180
It's a box.
Skype.
If you could put a string to it and float in the air.

28
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.220
That shitty looking jeep thing.
Yes.
Oh Wow.
You have one of those?
I did,
yeah.
Red.

29
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.340
Wow.
I don't know why.
For some reason I liked that thing.

30
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:53.720
I got it in college and as the way I like it.
Yeah.
This college,

31
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.390
it was cool for a tailgating and shit.
There it is.
Yeah,
I did that.

32
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.720
That's the ll cool j versus how did they have that one?
Let's say I include J.

33
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.590
Dot.
No,
I think I saw that a video one though.

34
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:08.730
Cause it's a cause that's the one I had,
right.
You've got the hard top.
Damn.
Yeah.

35
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.630
I had total that thing in North Dakota one time hit black eyes.

36
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.190
[inaudible] Augusta wind just knocked me off the road and I was in a ditch,

37
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.130
but it was uh,
you know how people in motorcycles,

38
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.960
they'll see another motorcycle and they'll wave.

39
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.440
It's like a little club that you're in and jeeps do it too.

40
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.850
And I started doing that to other Suzuki sidekicks and out of port for a reason,

41
00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:33.300
I'd wave to him nine times out of 10.
It's like a overweight black lady.

42
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.020
And then I just went with that and I'm like,
what is he doing with it?
I was like,

43
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:39.960
what the club man.
So,
but yeah,
uh,

44
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.310
people like got hit me ice cars.
Yeah.
But to do that with shitty cars too.
Yeah.

45
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.720
That's what he does next level.
That's more fun.
Yeah.
Like I see you,

46
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.100
did they give you when they give you him?
Uh,
it was a,
uh,
uh,

47
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.010
1500 dodge ram quad cab.
The lack,
a lot of chrome feel comfortable in it.

48
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.500
I loved it.
I lived when I first got it.
You know,
it's like,
it's like the,

49
00:03:00.501 --> 00:03:03.040
in the middle of,
you know,
I did six of those commercials.

50
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.210
So as rod around La with the windows down just blasting,
you know,

51
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.950
Leonard Skinner did shit.
Yeah.
That's perfect.
The comedy store and like park it,

52
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.620
I made,
they hated parking that thing in that,
in that light,

53
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:17.920
because it's gigantic.
Yeah.
That's a wide,
and they're like really mad.

54
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.870
Can you just have somebody drop you off?
Yeah.

55
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:23.650
Brendan Chavs but showing up in his,
uh,
he got a raptor.
Oh yeah.

56
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.550
We realized how wide those things are until you're standing in front of him.

57
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.140
Like,
like huge Fox does that fucking giant vehicle.

58
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.580
And then trying to valet that thing anywhere in Los Angeles,
you know,

59
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.620
that's a lot of tiny little Mexican dudes are like,
really,
man.
