00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.360
As you’re watching this video, thousands
of kilometers beneath your feet, edging on

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.849
the brink of alien and terrestrial, lies two
vast structures with unknown origins, and

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:11.259
scientists call them...

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:12.259
Earth blobs?

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:13.259
Uhh wait what?

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.259
Did I read that correctly?

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.740
Yes, yes I did read that correctly.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.390
These ‘blobs’ have been a big geologic
mystery that researchers believe are having

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.180
an untold effect on our planet and it’s
baffled scientists for over 40 years.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.060
So what do we know about them?

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.070
Well, Earth blobs have picked up this rather
un-sciency name because they look sort of

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.890
blobby with round, soft edges.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.969
No, not that type of blob.

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.079
Scientists call them Large Low Shear Velocity
Provinces, because waves of energy slow down

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.550
through these zones, but boy, that’s a mouthful
so let’s just stick to Earth blobs for now.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.679
They’re hidden underneath Earth’s crust,
like really, really deep - about 2,000 kilometers

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:47.679
deep.

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.719
These blobs are so massive that if we moved
them to Earth’s surface, the International

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.749
Space Station would need to navigate around
them.

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:57.820
So to better understand these gigantic structures,
we need to journey into the center of the

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.820
earth.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.760
They begin where Earth’s mantle meets the
outer molten core.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.740
In the 1970’s, scientists discovered that
one of the blobs sits under the Pacific ocean,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.280
while the other one sits under Africa and
part of the Atlantic ocean.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.700
So we know their general location and we know
that these regions are different from the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.750
surrounding mantle material because seismic
waves move through these massive regions slower

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.240
than their surroundings.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.789
But there are still many unanswered questions.

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.780
No one knows for sure where they came from,
how long they’ve been around, or even what

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.490
their role is on the planet.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.909
But yah know, scientists love a good mystery
hidden deep within the Earth's crust.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.560
So it's been an ongoing debate ever since
they were discovered 40 years ago with a whole

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.350
range of ideas trying to explain them.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.079
One hypothesis has described them as plumes
of hot upwelling rock that connect to surface

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.719
volcanoes to form island chains like Hawaii
and Iceland.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.460
Another has speculated that the blobs are
disrupting Earth’s magnetic field.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.320
And others have suggested that the blobs are
connected to super volcanoes that at one time

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.079
caused extinction events.

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:59.100
So yeah... the ideas run from the generally
benign to the apocalyptic.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.720
But these are just hypotheses.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.049
Because it’s impossible to reach these depths
in one piece—temperature and pressure would

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.530
kill you —scientists have to rely on a multitude
of techniques to tell us what the interior

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.270
looks like, and maybe even explain how these
mysterious regions affect our planet.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.989
One way is with seismic tomography, a technique
that helps us look below the crust by tracking

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.900
and calculating seismic waves.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.700
This was how scientists actually discovered
the blobs in the first place.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.050
But while the method revealed where the blobs
are and how large they are, it can’t really

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.870
tell us much about their density.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.370
So one researcher turned to a new technique
called tidal tomography to peer under Earth’s

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.370
crust.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.190
It uses sensitive GPS measurements to track
Earth’s body tides and can give us a better

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.200
gauge of the blobs’ density.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.549
Preliminary results showed that the blobs
were pretty dense and could be composed of

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.540
iron and have similarities to primordial material.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.500
While geochemists are analyzing the chemical
composition of lava samples to help determine

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.790
what role blobs could play on volcanoes.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.790
One study, looking at underwater lava flows
along Costa Rica, suggested that at least

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.790
one of the blobs may have been a source for
an extinction level event millions of years

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.790
ago.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.360
So evidently more research is needed to demystify
the blobs before we make any conclusions.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.280
What’s important to keep in mind is that
each of the earlier ideas may present a different

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.290
picture of Earth’s inner workings and the
role the blobs could play on our planet, which

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.670
is why these regions are so scientifically
interesting.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.980
They could tell us very different things about
the planet, from its earliest beginnings to

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.450
the magnetic field to even super volcanoes.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.340
But until Brendan Fraser figures out a way
to journey back to the center of the Earth,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.220
we’ll use the techniques at our disposal
to reveal the mysterious blobs wrapped around

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.660
the heart of our planet.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.680
Come on Brendan, we’re counting on you.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.640
