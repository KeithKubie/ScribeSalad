00:00:00.634 --> 00:00:02.514
- [Voiceover] Farmer Jan
is a vegetable farmer

00:00:02.514 --> 00:00:04.998
who divides his field
between broccoli crops

00:00:04.998 --> 00:00:06.531
and spinach crops.

00:00:06.531 --> 00:00:10.083
Last year, he grew six
tons of broccoli per acre,

00:00:10.083 --> 00:00:12.869
so six tons of broccoli per acre,

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.748
and nine tons of spinach,

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:17.931
nine tons of spinach per acre,

00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:21.414
for a total of 93 tons of vegetables.

00:00:21.414 --> 00:00:24.966
This year, he grew two
tons of broccoli per acre,

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:29.169
so this year, he grew two
tons of broccoli per acre,

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.559
and three tons of spinach per acre,

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.229
and three tons of spinach per acre,

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:38.458
for a total of 31 tons of vegetables.

00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:41.800
How many acres of broccoli
crops and how many acres

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.028
of spinach crops does Farmer Jan have?

00:00:45.028 --> 00:00:46.467
So let's think about this.

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:51.042
So let's say that the number
of acres of broccoli crops,

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:54.385
let's call that B,

00:00:54.385 --> 00:00:57.589
and let's say the acres of spinach crops,

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.537
acres of spinach crops, let's call that S.

00:01:01.537 --> 00:01:04.811
So how much broccoli is he going to grow

00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:07.388
in, I guess you could say, last year?

00:01:07.388 --> 00:01:09.385
Last year, how much broccoli did he grow?

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:11.576
And let me just write this
down. This is last year.

00:01:11.576 --> 00:01:15.019
Last year.

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:19.241
And they tell us, last
year he grew six tons

00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:21.453
of broccoli per acre.

00:01:21.453 --> 00:01:23.914
So if he grew six tons
of broccoli per acre,

00:01:23.914 --> 00:01:25.935
and he has B acres,

00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:29.860
well, that means he grew six tons per acre

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.903
times B acres.

00:01:31.903 --> 00:01:36.499
So he grew 6B tons of broccoli last year.

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:40.262
And by the same logic,
he grew how much spinach?

00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:45.022
Well, nine tons of spinach
per acre times S acres.

00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:49.311
So 9S tons of spinach,

00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:51.957
and then the total is 93 tons,

00:01:51.957 --> 00:01:55.534
so for a total of 93 tons of vegetables.

00:01:55.534 --> 00:01:59.132
So this is going to be equal to 93.

00:01:59.132 --> 00:02:01.315
So now let's think about this year.

00:02:01.315 --> 00:02:03.892
And in general, when you
tackle these, just think about,

00:02:03.892 --> 00:02:05.889
well, set the variables in general

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:07.405
to what they're asking for, and then,

00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:10.181
how can you use the information
that they're giving us?

00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:13.477
So this year, how much
broccoli would he have grown?

00:02:13.477 --> 00:02:16.542
Well, he grew two tons
of broccoli per acre,

00:02:16.542 --> 00:02:19.701
so he grew two tons per acre.

00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:22.673
He has the same number of
acres. We can assume that.

00:02:22.673 --> 00:02:24.785
So two tons per acre times B acres

00:02:24.785 --> 00:02:28.106
is gonna be 2B tons of broccoli.

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.242
And by that same logic, it's going to be,

00:02:30.242 --> 00:02:32.610
he grew three tons of spinach per acre.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.283
Well, he has S acres.

00:02:34.283 --> 00:02:36.651
Each of those acres,
he's growing three tons

00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:41.017
of spinach per acre, so it's
going to be 3S tons of spinach.

00:02:41.017 --> 00:02:42.827
And they tell us what that total is.

00:02:42.827 --> 00:02:47.395
That total is, for a total
of 31 tons of vegetables.

00:02:47.395 --> 00:02:50.112
So this is going to be equal to 31.

00:02:50.112 --> 00:02:52.456
And so now we have a
system of two equations

00:02:52.456 --> 00:02:56.962
with two unknowns, that we
can use to solve for B and S.

00:02:56.962 --> 00:03:00.026
So let's see. What do we
wanna solve for first?

00:03:00.026 --> 00:03:03.787
Well, what we could do, let
me rewrite the top equation.

00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:07.028
So we have 6B plus,

00:03:07.868 --> 00:03:12.261
plus 9S is equal to 93,

00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:15.321
is equal to 93.

00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:16.299
And the second equation,

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.084
we'll let's try to eliminate the Bs.

00:03:20.084 --> 00:03:24.326
So let's multiply the second
equation by negative three.

00:03:24.326 --> 00:03:27.791
I'm gonna multiply the left
hand side by negative three,

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.253
and I'm gonna multiply the right hand side

00:03:30.253 --> 00:03:31.623
by negative three.

00:03:31.623 --> 00:03:34.014
What am I going to get?

00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:37.335
Negative three times 2B is negative 6B.

00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:38.914
That was the whole point by multiplying it

00:03:38.914 --> 00:03:40.585
by negative three.

00:03:40.585 --> 00:03:44.685
Negative three times 3S is negative 9S,

00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:46.242
negative 9S.

00:03:46.242 --> 00:03:51.140
And then, negative three times 31 is going

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.159
to be negative 93.

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.688
So what do we get if we
now add the two sides

00:03:57.688 --> 00:03:59.477
of these equations?

00:03:59.477 --> 00:04:02.612
So on the left hand side,
6B minus 6B, that's zero.

00:04:02.612 --> 00:04:06.117
9S minus 9S, that's zero.
We're gonna get just zero.

00:04:06.117 --> 00:04:10.296
On the right hand side we get 93 minus 93.

00:04:10.296 --> 00:04:13.454
Well, that's still just going to be zero.

00:04:13.454 --> 00:04:16.356
So we have this situation
where we get zero equals zero,

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:19.421
which is going to be true
no matter what X and Y are,

00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:22.092
and so this is a system
with an infinite number

00:04:22.092 --> 00:04:23.253
of solutions.

00:04:23.253 --> 00:04:26.482
So this has infinite,

00:04:27.592 --> 00:04:31.655
infinite number of solutions.

00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:33.491
So one way we could think about it is,

00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:34.861
these two constraints,

00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:37.460
they're not giving us enough information.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.317
There's an infinite number
of B and S combinations

00:04:40.317 --> 00:04:42.987
that would satisfy these equations,

00:04:42.987 --> 00:04:45.565
so they're not giving
us enough information

00:04:45.565 --> 00:04:50.325
to say exactly what B and S are.

00:04:50.325 --> 00:04:53.617
So there is not enough,

00:04:53.617 --> 00:04:56.495
not enough info!

00:04:56.495 --> 00:04:58.492
Put an exclamation mark there.
