has two peaks and the peak for which we
 

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:09.490
has two peaks and the peak for which we
think is the active conformation is

know when I get back to our efforts to

00:53:03.779 --> 00:53:03.789
know when I get back to our efforts to
 

00:53:03.789 --> 00:53:10.019
know when I get back to our efforts to
obtain an active structure and the first

00:53:10.019 --> 00:53:10.029
obtain an active structure and the first
 

00:53:10.029 --> 00:53:11.490
obtain an active structure and the first
question that we had is what do a

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:11.500

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.319

Guinness do can we actually trap this
 

00:53:13.329 --> 00:53:15.630
Guinness do can we actually trap this

we worked on for quite a while with
 

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:22.920
we worked on for quite a while with
little success we were not able to

little success we were not able to
 

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:26.609

obtain any crystals of a receptor bound

agonist for the beta 2 receptor and in
 

00:53:41.859 --> 00:53:43.710
agonist for the beta 2 receptor and in
this crystal structure it was obtained

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:43.720
this crystal structure it was obtained
 

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:46.829
this crystal structure it was obtained
but it was in an inactive state so this

00:53:46.829 --> 00:53:46.839
but it was in an inactive state so this
 

00:53:46.839 --> 00:53:48.630
but it was in an inactive state so this
gets back to what we were learning from

00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640
gets back to what we were learning from
 

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.150
gets back to what we were learning from

and that is agonists alone don't fully

and that is agonists alone don't fully

stabilized in active state so this is a

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:56.890

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:01.510
transmembrane to illustrate it but what
 

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:02.849
transmembrane to illustrate it but what
I show here is that the receptor is

00:54:02.849 --> 00:54:02.859
I show here is that the receptor is
 

00:54:02.859 --> 00:54:05.130
I show here is that the receptor is
flexible to begin with and when you bind

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:05.140

an agonist it appears that the

00:54:08.049 --> 00:54:08.059
an agonist it appears that the

an agonist it appears that the
dynamic character actually increases

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920

00:54:12.339 --> 00:54:12.349
rather than stabilizing a uniform
 

00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:14.920
rather than stabilizing a uniform
conformation and so to stabilize you

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:14.930
conformation and so to stabilize you
 

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:16.989
conformation and so to stabilize you
uniform conformation you need a

00:54:16.989 --> 00:54:16.999
uniform conformation you need a
 

00:54:16.999 --> 00:54:19.390
uniform conformation you need a

00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:19.400
stabilizing protein interaction if if
 

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.009
stabilizing protein interaction if if
this isn't a g-protein then you need to

00:54:21.009 --> 00:54:21.019
this isn't a g-protein then you need to
 

00:54:21.019 --> 00:54:25.479
this isn't a g-protein then you need to

00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:57.939
 
this turned out to be a lot of work and

this turned out to be a lot of work and
 

00:55:57.949 --> 00:56:02.140
this turned out to be a lot of work and
very challenging and and I really don't

00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:02.150
very challenging and and I really don't
 

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:04.299
very challenging and and I really don't
have time to go into the this in detail

00:56:04.299 --> 00:56:04.309
have time to go into the this in detail
 

00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:07.089
have time to go into the this in detail
but I think it's useful to illustrate or

but I think it's useful to illustrate or
 

00:56:07.099 --> 00:56:10.329
but I think it's useful to illustrate or
to at least discuss some of the some of

the important contributions to

so the first involved being able to

00:56:16.449 --> 00:56:16.459
so the first involved being able to

so the first involved being able to
identify a very high affinity agonist

00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:19.310
identify a very high affinity agonist
 

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:22.870
identify a very high affinity agonist
and most of the agonists have even the

structural change is a very large
 

01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:16.069
structural change is a very large
movement of the alpha helical domain and

released the other very large change is

01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:22.800
released the other very large change is
 

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.760
released the other very large change is
the c-terminal alpha helix which

projects into the core of the receptor
 

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.650
projects into the core of the receptor
and stabilize it in these active state

01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:30.660
and stabilize it in these active state
 

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:33.950
and stabilize it in these active state
so this is the guanine nucleotide free

01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960
so this is the guanine nucleotide free
 

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:37.579
so this is the guanine nucleotide free
