00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:17.791
One of the reasons that I'm fascinated by the ocean

00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:20.905
is that it's really an alien world on our own planet.

00:00:20.905 --> 00:00:21.973
From our perspective,

00:00:21.973 --> 00:00:24.137
sitting on the shoreline or even out on a boat,

00:00:24.137 --> 00:00:25.796
we're given only the tiniest glimpses

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:27.586
at the real action that's happening

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:30.218
beneath the surface of the waves.

00:00:30.218 --> 00:00:32.152
And even if you were able to go down there,

00:00:32.152 --> 00:00:33.454
you wouldn't see very much

00:00:33.454 --> 00:00:36.057
because light doesn't travel very far in the ocean.

00:00:36.057 --> 00:00:37.966
So, to answer questions about how the ocean works,

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.131
in my research, we use sound.

00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:42.123
We use sonars that send out pulses of sound

00:00:42.123 --> 00:00:45.233
made up of a number of different frequencies, or pitches,

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:47.524
that are shown with different colors.

00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:49.668
That sound bounces off things in the habitat

00:00:49.668 --> 00:00:51.295
and comes back to us.

00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:53.031
If it were to bounce off this dolphin,

00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:54.263
the signal we got back

00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:56.321
would look very much like the one we sent out

00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:59.027
where all the colors are represented pretty evenly.

00:00:59.027 --> 00:01:00.366
However, if we were to bounce

00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.062
that same sound off of a squid,

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:05.034
which in this case is about the same size as that dolphin,

00:01:05.034 --> 00:01:08.402
we'd instead only get the lowest frequencies back strongly,

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:10.249
shown here in the red.

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:12.416
And if we were to look at the prey of that squid,

00:01:12.416 --> 00:01:14.360
the tiny little krill that they're eating,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.412
we would instead only get the highest frequencies back.

00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:18.591
And so by looking at this,

00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:21.156
we can tell what kinds of animals are in the ocean,

00:01:21.156 --> 00:01:22.751
we can look at how dense they are,

00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:23.952
where they are distributed,

00:01:23.952 --> 00:01:24.925
look at their interactions

00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:26.185
and even their behavior

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:29.523
to start to study the ecology of the ocean.

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:30.954
When we do that, we come up with

00:01:30.954 --> 00:01:32.737
something sort of surprising:

00:01:32.737 --> 00:01:35.328
on average, there isn't very much food in the ocean.

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:38.048
So even in places which we think of as rich, the coasts,

00:01:38.048 --> 00:01:42.605
we're talking about two parts of every million contain food.

00:01:42.605 --> 00:01:44.062
So what does that mean?

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:46.224
Well, that means that in the volume of this theater,

00:01:46.224 --> 00:01:48.951
there would be one tub of movie theater popcorn

00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:50.830
available to be eaten.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.110
But of course, it wouldn't be collected

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.624
for you neatly in this bucket.

00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:55.064
Instead, you'd actually have to be swimming

00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:57.882
through this entire volume Willy Wonka style,

00:01:57.882 --> 00:02:00.179
picking off individual kernels of popcorn,

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:01.678
or perhaps if you were lucky,

00:02:01.678 --> 00:02:04.524
getting a hold of a few small clumps.

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:06.019
But, of course, if you were in the ocean,

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:07.576
this popcorn wouldn't be sitting here

00:02:07.576 --> 00:02:09.153
waiting for you to eat it.

00:02:09.153 --> 00:02:12.713
It would, instead, be trying to avoid becoming your dinner.

00:02:12.713 --> 00:02:16.097
So I want to know how do animals solve this challenge?

00:02:16.097 --> 00:02:19.011
We're going to talk about animals in the Bering Sea.

00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:21.296
This is where you may have see "Deadliest Catch" framed,

00:02:21.296 --> 00:02:23.646
in the northernmost part of the Pacific Ocean.

00:02:23.646 --> 00:02:25.580
We've been looking specifically at krill,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.122
one of the most important food items in this habitat.

00:02:28.122 --> 00:02:30.379
These half-inch long shrimp-like critters

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.890
are about the caloric equivalent

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.422
of a heavily buttered kernel of popcorn.

00:02:34.422 --> 00:02:35.505
And they're eaten by everything

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:38.259
from birds and fur seals that pick them up one at a time

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.295
to large whales that engulf them in huge mouthfuls.

00:02:41.295 --> 00:02:42.644
So I'm going to focus in the area

00:02:42.644 --> 00:02:45.692
around three breeding colonies for birds and fur seals

00:02:45.692 --> 00:02:48.171
in the southeastern Bering Sea.

00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:49.796
And this is a map of that habitat

00:02:49.796 --> 00:02:51.902
that we made making maps of food

00:02:51.902 --> 00:02:53.902
the way we've always made maps of food.

00:02:53.902 --> 00:02:57.072
This is how many krill are in this area of the ocean.

00:02:57.072 --> 00:02:58.741
Red areas represent lots of krill

00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:00.544
and purple basically none.

00:03:00.544 --> 00:03:03.135
And you can see that around the northern two most islands,

00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:04.567
which are highlighted with white circles

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:06.237
because they are so tiny,

00:03:06.237 --> 00:03:08.869
it looks like there's a lot of food to be eaten.

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.918
And yet, the fur seals and birds on these islands

00:03:11.918 --> 00:03:12.894
are crashing.

00:03:12.894 --> 00:03:14.008
Their populations are declining

00:03:14.008 --> 00:03:16.063
despite decades of protection.

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:17.379
And while on that southern island

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:18.847
at the very bottom of the screen

00:03:18.847 --> 00:03:20.784
it doesn't look like there's anything to eat,

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:23.185
those populations are doing incredibly well.

00:03:23.185 --> 00:03:25.065
So this left us with a dilemma.

00:03:25.065 --> 00:03:27.222
Our observations of food don't make any sense

00:03:27.222 --> 00:03:30.291
in the context of our observations of these animals.

00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:32.827
So we started to think about how we could do this differently.

00:03:32.827 --> 00:03:35.898
And this map shows not how many krill there are,

00:03:35.898 --> 00:03:38.232
but how many clumps of krill there are,

00:03:38.232 --> 00:03:39.692
how aggregated are they.

00:03:39.692 --> 00:03:42.813
And what you get is a very different picture of the landscape.

00:03:42.813 --> 00:03:43.883
Now that southern island looks

00:03:43.883 --> 00:03:45.245
like a pretty good place to be,

00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:46.301
and when we combine this

00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:47.841
with other information about prey,

00:03:47.841 --> 00:03:50.946
it starts to explain the population observations.

00:03:50.946 --> 00:03:53.071
But we can also ask that question differently.

00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:55.593
We can have the animals tell us what's important.

00:03:55.593 --> 00:03:57.480
By tagging and tracking these animals

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.901
and looking at how they use this habitat,

00:03:59.901 --> 00:04:02.248
we are able to say, "What matters to you?"

00:04:02.248 --> 00:04:03.547
about the prey.

00:04:03.547 --> 00:04:04.305
And what they've told us

00:04:04.305 --> 00:04:07.214
is that how many krill there are really isn't important.

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:09.238
It is how closely spaced those krill are

00:04:09.238 --> 00:04:12.406
because that's how they are able to make a living.

00:04:12.406 --> 00:04:14.070
We see the same pattern

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.685
when we look in very different ocean,

00:04:15.685 --> 00:04:17.352
further south in the Pacific,

00:04:17.352 --> 00:04:19.955
in the warm waters around the Hawaiian islands.

00:04:19.955 --> 00:04:21.404
So a very different habitat,

00:04:21.404 --> 00:04:23.259
and yet the same story.

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:24.524
Under some conditions,

00:04:24.524 --> 00:04:27.264
the physics and the nutrients, the fertilizer,

00:04:27.264 --> 00:04:30.983
set up aggregations in the plants, the phytoplankton.

00:04:30.983 --> 00:04:32.469
And when that happens,

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:34.651
these very dense aggregations of phytoplankton

00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:36.043
attract their predators,

00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:38.875
which themselves form very dense layers.

00:04:38.875 --> 00:04:40.843
That changes the behavior and distribution

00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:42.350
of their predators as well,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.434
starting to set up how this entire ecosystem functions.

00:04:46.434 --> 00:04:48.383
Finally, the predators that eat

00:04:48.383 --> 00:04:50.454
these small fish, shrimp, and squid,

00:04:50.454 --> 00:04:53.150
we're talking about two- to three-inch long prey here,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.057
changes how they use their habitat

00:04:55.057 --> 00:04:56.627
and how they forage.

00:04:56.627 --> 00:04:58.495
And so we see changes in the spinner dolphins

00:04:58.495 --> 00:04:59.985
that are related to the changes

00:04:59.985 --> 00:05:01.668
we're seeing in the plant life.

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:03.474
And just by measuring the plants,

00:05:03.474 --> 00:05:05.063
we can actually predict very well

00:05:05.063 --> 00:05:06.702
what's going to happen in the top predator

00:05:06.702 --> 00:05:09.442
three steps away in the food web.

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:10.598
But what's interesting is

00:05:10.598 --> 00:05:12.998
that even the densest aggregations of their prey

00:05:12.998 --> 00:05:15.241
aren't enough for spinner dolphins to make it.

00:05:15.241 --> 00:05:16.989
It's a pretty tough life there in the ocean.

00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:19.288
So these animals actually work together

00:05:19.288 --> 00:05:22.785
to herd their prey into even denser aggregations,

00:05:22.785 --> 00:05:25.234
starting with patches that they find in the first place.

00:05:25.234 --> 00:05:28.057
And that's what you're going to see in this visualization.

00:05:28.057 --> 00:05:29.576
We have a group of 20 dolphins,

00:05:29.576 --> 00:05:31.359
you notice they're all set up in pairs,

00:05:31.359 --> 00:05:32.799
that are working together

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:34.270
to basically bulldoze prey

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.319
to accumulate it on top of itself.

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:37.431
And once they do that,

00:05:37.431 --> 00:05:39.154
they form a circle around that prey

00:05:39.154 --> 00:05:41.171
to maintain that really dense patch

00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:43.229
that is a couple thousand times higher density

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.909
than the background that they started with

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:47.637
before individual pairs of dolphins

00:05:47.637 --> 00:05:49.301
start to take turns feeding

00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:53.207
inside this circle of prey that they've created.

00:05:53.207 --> 00:05:55.375
And so, this work is showing us

00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:57.558
that animals can first give us the answers

00:05:57.558 --> 00:06:01.644
that aggregation is critical to how they make their living.

00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:03.964
And by looking more deeply at the ocean,

00:06:03.964 --> 00:06:06.599
we're starting to understand our interactions with it

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.002
and finding more effective ways of conserving it.

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:11.071
Thank you.
