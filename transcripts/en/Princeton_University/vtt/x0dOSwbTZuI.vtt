00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.800
&gt;&gt; Thank you for
being here on time.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.140
Welcome to everybody here.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.560
And the reason we're
in this larger venue,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.380
is for the videotaping of
Robert's talk, because I saw

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.150
in YouTube, he goes to Cornell
and Cornell does this elaborate,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.990
one-on-one interview
with Robert,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.920
talking about the work he does.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.440
And it's like, "Oh, come on."

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.920
You know, "He went
to our school.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.980
Why aren't we doing something?"

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.180
So -- and so though,
that's why [inaudible].

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.260
So, this room is built for
videotaping talks very easily.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.850
And so, it's our pleasure
to meet Robert and I try not

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.890
to think about how far I go back
with Robert because we were --

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.160
I was working at Bell Labs.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.950
In fact, I remember, I was
just minding my own business

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.690
at Bell Labs.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.900
I was laying low that summer.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.370
And this guy is knocking
at my door,

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.890
and he introduces himself
as Robert Hampshire.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.050
And he was there as
a summer student.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.950
And he, you know, he at that
time, he was an undergraduate

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.500
at the University of Cincinnati
in electrical engineering.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.220
But you know, electrical
engineers in the 1990s,

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.960
felt a little adrift because
the internet had been built.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.260
You know, "What do we do now?"

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.390
And so, and then, Frank Kelly
[phonetic] was visiting us

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.570
and he was talking
about internet --

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.640
you know, network economy.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.440
And network economy,
economics, you have to look

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.380
at how many customers there are,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.170
and how many customers can be
described by a queuing model.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.910
So, the beginnings of
queuing and economics,

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.200
were starting right there.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.900
And so, I said nothing, and
he told me he wanted to apply

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.070
for you know, Princeton's
Operations Research

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.950
and Financial Engineering
Department.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.720
Okay? And then, little
did I realize

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.900
as someone who'd worked there,
you know, 2001 at Bell Labs,

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.550
when the summer was over,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.450
we would both leave
and go to Princeton.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.670
Okay? And so, he
got his PhD here

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.210
at Princeton University
Operations Research Financial

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.470
Engineering Department, and
then he went on to become,

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:44.670
first the assistant professor
at Carnegie Mellon which was

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.140
in Pittsburgh for a few years.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.170
And then he went to the
University of Michigan.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:01.410
And now he's a tenured professor
of the Gerald R. Ford School

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.550
of Public Policy, at the
University of Michigan.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.980
And he doesn't work on
telecommunication problems.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.040
He's taking queuing
theory over to look

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.010
at resource sharing issues in
the world of transportation,

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.090
and become an expert in
the area of smart cities.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.730
So.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.040
&gt;&gt; Okay, [inaudible].

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.510
Thanks, Bill.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.530
[ Applause ]

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.790
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius Hampshire:
Alright, well thanks Bill,

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.920
for that great introduction.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.500
And thanks for changing the
location of the seminar.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.580
This is -- so, thanks
for coming over.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.430
So, let me just jump
right into it.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.260
So, I'm going to talk
about a collection of work

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.580
that we've been doing over
the last ten years or so,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.220
related to reducing
congestion, pollution in cities.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.900
And trying to make
them more livable.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.730
And so, this is under a
broad rubric here I call Data

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.840
and Decision Sciences
for Parking Management.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.240
This is one set of activities

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.710
that my research group
had been working on.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.030
And so, for those of you
who are going to fall asleep

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.550
and like not pay attention,

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.430
I'll just give you the
punchlines right now.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.230
So, what we're going to do is
a field experiment of pricing.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.250
It's a spatial pricing
problem, related to parking.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.590
And so, we actually
implement this in the field.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:37.030
And basically, it's a test of
marginal pricing for parking.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.100
Oh, okay. Let me
just pull that up.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.020
So, the bottom line I
want to say is that, okay,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.260
for any economists in the
room, so pricing works

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.960
to help align supply and demand.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.890
It does work.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.320
Even despite some significant
market imperfections

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.010
that I'll tell you about.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.930
And it actually turns out that
if you can just get a few people

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.870
to change behavior in
a constrained system,

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.190
that you can actually
see a big out --

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.370
change in some output variables.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.990
Okay? And here that was going
to be cruising and congestion,

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.040
is one thing we really
care about.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.060
So, just small changes

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.730
in pricing can actually
make a big difference

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.080
in road congestion.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.480
So, I'll show that.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.080
And also, because of some --

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.920
there's quite a bit
of non-smooth behavior

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.360
in some of these prices.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.940
So, I'll show you that
a reasonable supply

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.540
and demand curve for
a city over space,

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.360
actually has pretty big jumps

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.590
in what the equilibrium
prices look like.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.250
So, you can be on one block, and
the best price is $5 an hour,

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.330
but an adjacent block, literally
will be 25 cents an hour.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.010
That's the right
equilibrium price.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.840
And so, you get these sort of
very non-smooth set of prices.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.760
I'll talk about that.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.100
And then finally, here
for cities, this --

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.220
think about on-street parking.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.310
Really cities oftentimes
think about occupancy.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.270
How many cars are parked?

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.290
But that's really not the
right thing to look at.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.210
I'll show you that what
you want to look at,

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.480
is from the perspective
of the driver.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.560
What's the chance that
when you show up to park,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.960
there's a space available?

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.970
Alright? And a lot of cities
actually look at the occupancy

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.330
of spaces, but that's -- I'll
show you that's not the --

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.280
necessarily the right
thing to do.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.960
Okay? So, these are
some punchlines

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.590
that I'll return
to, hopefully soon.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.300
So, and like I said
here, the idea is that,

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.150
a little goes a long way.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.630
So, what we're going
to do is modify prices

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.620
in some very elaborate
way, and it actually turns

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.700
out that the occupancy
changes only 1 or 2%.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:56.510
But that corresponds to roughly
a 50% decrease in the amount

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.600
of time it takes people
to look for parking.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.290
So, this is the idea of this
sort of congested system.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:06.330
You can really make a big impact
by small changes on the inputs.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:13.020
So, of course, idea of pricing
for roadways is not new.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.750
Actually, even pricing
for parking is not new.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.570
So, Vickrey back in the 50's,
actually has a whole paper

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.350
about parking and using
congestion pricing related

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.500
to on-street parking.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.840
So, like I said, this
is part of a larger set

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.370
of activities we've been up to.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.140
I'm not going to
spend much time.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:32.790
We're doing some stuff AV's.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:38.860
We're looking at travel behavior
impacts of on-demand mobility.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.400
A lot of stuff now on
socioeconomic impacts

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.840
of automated driving systems
and driverless vehicles.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.560
And a lot of stuff

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.630
about financing a
smart infrastructure,

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.670
plus like real options,
and so forth.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:52.420
[Inaudible] and stuff.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.210
So, I'm not going
to talk about that.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:58.530
We also have lots of stuff
going on in bike share,

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.690
scooter sharing,
alternative modes

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.820
of vehicle ownership,
and so forth.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:04.870
But I'm going to focus just

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.730
in the top-left corner,
the smart parking.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.020
Alright so, let me just
jump into the motivation.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.800
So, alright -- so,
of course, here,

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.490
road congestion is
certainly a big --

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:25.360
some people think a waste
of time, and annoying.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.890
There's also a signal
of economic activity.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:34.540
But it turns out that of
course, you guys know lots

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.920
of causes attributed to people
sitting traffic throughout

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.510
the day.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:45.480
You know, one, 9% of all
driving time's actually spent

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.340
in congestion.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:52.700
You know, so-called 42 hours a
year spent sitting in traffic.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.970
And this comes at a huge --

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.380
well, 300 billion dollars
cost of congestion.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.360
That's lost wages
and time, mostly.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.150
But guess what?

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.640
Even though sitting in
congestion is really annoying

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.150
and costly, we all still do it.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.930
Right? Because we
want to go to work.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.820
We want to see our
friends, and so forth.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:22.320
So, with that setting, it
turns out that you know,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.680
we still do it because we
don't pay the full cost

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.280
of the externalities that
we're imposing on other people.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.590
So, it's sort of the
hurting behavior --

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.960
you know, tragedy
of commons idea.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.500
Alright? So, we don't really
pay our full [inaudible].

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.760
Some estimates, they're roughly

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.400
about 8 cents per mile is
actually a cost that you impose

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.690
on other people, due to the
congestion that you cause.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.410
There's certainly
a lot of noise.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:59.530
There's a safety risk per mile
that you impose on other people,

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:00.600
that you can kind of estimate.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.760
This is from the literature.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.230
And certainly, pollution risk.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.520
This one's a little more
wonky because, well,

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.830
how do you price pollution as
an issue, but you might think

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:11.940
about that's a cost,

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.550
externality, that
you're imposing.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.610
That you're not quite
internalizing.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:21.330
So, also it turns out,
there's even more costs

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.320
that you're not paying
for, because guess what?

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.190
Most of the time, you park
at the mall, park places --

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.760
you park for free,
but guess what?

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.610
Those parking spaces
aren't free.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.840
Certainly, there's a
cost that's attributed

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.390
for every trip you
make in the city,

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.130
there's a parking space waiting
for you on the other end.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.410
There's some cost
associated with that.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.870
And also, the cost to build.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:50.670
If anyone's looked -- priced
out prices of garages, I mean,

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.770
there's a lot of municipal
finance in cities that take

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:58.990
out big bond issues to pay for
parking garages, to build space.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:02.190
So, it's certainly not free.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.530
So, you don't really
pay the full cost.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.380
Either your trip when you're
driving, or when you park,

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:13.040
those are all subsidized by
other actors in the system.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.350
So, as you guys know,
New York's --

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.200
this is researched
in New York, right,

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.970
but congestion pricing is
one-way theoretically to think

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:26.700
about ways to get
drivers to pay for some

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.960
of the externalities they're
imposing on other people.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.050
Of course, Singapore and
other places have done this

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:37.650
for a long time, and they
probably have the most pure form

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.770
of this congestion pricing,

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:43.430
because they can do it
at the roadway level.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.390
And the idea is you
know, try to --

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.920
have drivers pay for
this marginal cost.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.330
But of course, there's
another version of this --

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.330
political backlash
to this, I guess.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.930
I haven't kept track today
or the last couple of days

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.590
in New York, what's happening,
if they're going to move forward

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:01.510
or not, but certainly ten
years ago, when this came

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.230
up the first time, there
were certainly major backlash

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.900
about congestion pricing.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.810
And cities like London
have a version,

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.460
and this is what New
York City's considering,

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.670
more like cordon pricing.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.300
This is, when you enter a
region, a congestion region,

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.160
you pay, as opposed to the
pure, sort of Vickrey prices

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.720
where you're charging --

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.200
you're being charged for
the actual road segment

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.450
that you're going to travel on.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.070
That's sort of the
first best kind of idea

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.990
that you want to
charge per link.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.910
But there's other
approaches that do this sort

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:38.130
of cordon pricing and so forth.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:41.420
So, let me get to parking.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:45.160
Okay. So, one way you can
think about parking pricing,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.890
is actually an alternative
to road pricing, okay?

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.690
So, one way to think about
it is that okay, every trip,

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.470
ends with your car
parked somewhere.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:01.580
Alright? So, you may think about
parking pricing as some kind

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:06.910
of so-called second-best
approach to try to capture some

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.960
of the externalities
related to driving.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.400
Okay? So, there's a body
of economic literature

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.030
that conceives about the
price of parking in this way.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.060
You know, if parking's a million
dollars an hour, guess what?

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.830
You're not going to go park
-- drive and park there.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.490
So, you're controlling
traffic -- congestion.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.380
Okay? So, imagine there's
some price between zero

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.270
and a million dollars
that might make sense.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.200
Okay? So, that's how we're
kind of framing this.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.780
So, but the idea, "What
is that right price?"

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.260
And so, in some ways,
you might think

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.620
of the price equaling
the marginal social costs

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.070
for occupying this space.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.430
Right? And so, this
includes the cost --

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.460
the searching cost that
you impose on other people.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.210
While you're looking -- while
you're driving around looking

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.760
for a parking space,
you're really --

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.450
you're inconveniencing
lots of other people.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.440
Maybe you should
somehow internalize that.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.540
Certainly, the safety
risk, the pollution risk,

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.000
and other costs might --

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.980
you might want to try
to capture that as well.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:12.500
And so, for example,
I think this was in --

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.670
this was in London, that roughly
estimated about every hour

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:21.350
that you were parked, you caused
about three to four other people

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:25.400
to look for a parking
space, okay?

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.220
And there's some time
costs associated with that.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.650
So, this is some
of the sort of --

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.860
the empirical foundations we're
thinking about parking price

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.670
and a way to frame it as a
-- this congestion charge.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:45.350
So, but I want to say,
a lot of the ideas

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:49.540
about congestion pricing, like
be it parking or road pricing,

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:55.740
assumes a lot about people's
knowledge and information flow.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.730
For example, you know,
you're assuming that --

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.810
okay, one, drivers are making
rational decisions, okay?

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.810
So, we know parking's
sometimes irrational.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.690
Some people they -- they
can always beat the system.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.730
Most of your [inaudible] for
example, think they're better

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.390
than the average driver.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.680
You know, they're -- and some
people think they're better

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.860
than the average person
at finding a parking spot.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.060
So, they'll have these risk
behaviors that you know --

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.800
so, there's a question
here, "Okay,

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.420
do people actually
make rational choices

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.970
about looking for a space?"

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.560
Alan, I'm sure you're
good at finding a space,

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.320
better than anyone else.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.210
I can imagine.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:42.740
One, a driver's -- people
actually pay for parking.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.000
Okay? Pricing only works

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.690
if people actually
pay for it, you know?

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:54.510
And also, in a lot of places,
you have a lot of visitors

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:58.610
who don't know how
much parking costs.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.270
So, they're not making
their decision about whether

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:04.310
to make the trip, you know,
based on full information,

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:08.380
or where in a given city
to park, at what price,

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.930
as a mechanism of -- .

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:14.600
Like, for example, does anyone
here know, how much does it cost

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.660
to park on street in Princeton?

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.840
Say on Nassau Street, per hour?

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.830
&gt;&gt; Two-twenty-five.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:21.490
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Oh, very good.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:22.430
Okay.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.010
&gt;&gt; No, I mean, they
just changed that.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:29.160
It's like $8.00 or something.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.080
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: It's $8.00 now?

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.440
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.580
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius Hampshire:
So, that's what I'm saying.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.660
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] based
on time [inaudible].

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:36.470
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Yes,

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.350
so a lot of this
foundation depends

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.800
on do people actually even know
the prices to react to them?

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.990
And that's the same
for road [inaudible].

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.030
And you assume people
can -- it's enforced.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.190
And so -- so, okay.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.750
&gt;&gt; It's perfect in Princeton.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:55.710
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Oh,

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.230
enforcement is perfect
[inaudible].

00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:59.480
That's true.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.910
Okay so, here's where --
let me get to the meat.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:05.390
So, here -- what we
did is, this was part

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:10.690
of a 20-million-dollar
federal pilot program.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.130
I think that was matched
by the state of California.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.880
So, like a 40-million-dollar
pilot program in San Francisco,

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:22.610
to actually implement a dynamic
-- a pricing scheme for parking,

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:24.580
that takes into --
with the goal is

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.310
to minimize the road
congestion associated

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.060
with people looking for parking.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:34.320
And also, with the goal of
improving the vehicle speed

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.350
and flow on the roads.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:43.190
Yes, so, ultimate goal of
reducing greenhouse gasses.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:48.130
Like localize pollution that's
related to people looking

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.960
for parking and congestion, and
improving the traffic speeds.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.730
So, the way this program,
worked, there's one part of it

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:59.000
that was -- we call it so-called
Demand Responsive Pricing.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.860
The other as you see here,

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.410
it looks like they did
this now on [inaudible].

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.750
&gt;&gt; We have smart meters.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:04.260
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Smart meters.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.130
So, you rip out the old
meters and then you put

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:08.600
in so-called smart meters,
or you allow people to pay

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.750
by their cell phone,
or something.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.570
So, we did that.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.390
Here, longer time limits.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:16.820
So, a pure market-based approach

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.810
for parking would actually
have no time limits.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:24.760
You would just use price
as a mechanism to --

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.530
so, it's like a supply
and demand.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.500
If you want to park longer,
that's fine, but you're going

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.410
to pay for it, you know?

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.910
And the other part was the
information environment.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:37.410
So, this is their real-time
information environment.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.590
And the way we -- this was
actually implemented, it was --

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:41.760
this was implemented
in certain sections

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.930
of the city, that's the orange.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.620
And then, other parts
of the city, it wasn't.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.740
So, it's like a quasi-control.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.430
So, this is kind of -- try
to control for economic --

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.770
macro-economic kinds
of activity.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.700
So, you know, when the economy's
bad, people aren't going

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.730
to work, so the congestion's
down, right?

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.460
So, what we wanted to
do was have some areas

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.890
where we didn't control the
price, so that we can try to net

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.220
out the effect of the pricing.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:10.450
&gt;&gt; What's the difference
between the orange and the blue?

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:10.700
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: So,

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.060
the blue are the areas we
didn't change the price.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.070
Orange is where the
intervention was.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.300
And I can tell you
more about that.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.150
This is -- let me just
say that this is joint

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:21.110
with some collaborators.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.900
We were actually on the
technical advisor committee

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:29.770
to the city to set
up this program.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.980
And so -- and with someone
else named Donald Shoup.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.420
Okay--

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.990
&gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.390
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Yes?

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:39.780
&gt;&gt; If I drive around and
around and pretend I'm looking

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.760
for the pricing, can
I erase [inaudible]?

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.580
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius Hampshire:
Yes, so I'll tell you.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.130
So, here, I'll tell
you the pricing is not,

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:50.620
what I call, like
dynamic pricing.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.620
It's not a real time
changing price.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.480
We're only going to change the
price once every six weeks.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.870
So, it's not like you pull into
a parking spot and then a --

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:04.160
then you know the price.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.790
So, because there has to
be some price discovery

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.260
that it affects people's
behavior.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.610
So, they need to kind of
know some predictability

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.230
about how much it cost.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:13.090
So, that's [inaudible].

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:14.540
So, no. Your answer's no.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.500
You can't-- .

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.760
&gt;&gt; So [inaudible] not important.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.120
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: No.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.900
Not at all.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.520
Okay so, and I'll say
this later because we had

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.000
to get this past city council.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.110
So, the pricing mechanism
had to be

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:31.450
such that it was
understandable and -- okay.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:34.900
So, here, what I want to say is,

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.830
"Did this program actually
increase parking availability

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.590
and reduce search times?"

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.810
That's sort of the key question.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.070
So, in some ways, it's
like a program evaluation.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.860
We created some algorithms,
implemented them in the field,

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.160
they were in the field
for about four years,

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.650
and they [inaudible] did it,
had they achieved their goal.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:03.070
Alright, and so again, the
two main pieces of this time

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.320
of day pricing, and this
real time environment.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.680
So, actually had students

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.720
who built the first
version of this app.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.690
It has real-time
information about parking.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.680
And then the city
turned out to use

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.010
that in the full implementation.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:22.230
Again, like I said
here, it turned out --

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.750
it's easier to control
in pilot areas.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.400
There are roughly
about 6,000 spaces.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:32.450
These are on-street spaces
that we actually change --

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:39.110
we had control of changing
the price of parking.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:45.080
So here, what we did is we
want to adjust the time of --

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.280
pricing by time of day.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.560
So, the way this is set up
is, there's a morning price,

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.260
afternoon price, and
an evening price.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.130
Okay? So, those are the three --

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.110
so, it's not like a
continuously changing price.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:05.290
It's just one -- and the idea --
so, I put this paper down here

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.350
because this is actually the
paper from my dissertation.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:09.880
So, this is how I got into this.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.230
This is how do you set --

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.510
this was actually in a
telecommunication network.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.730
How do you set the price
such when someone shows

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:21.670
up to use the resources, there's
some guaranteed probability

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.790
that there's a resource
available, to use it?

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.780
That was the chapter
of my dissertation.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.060
So, this work, years
and years later,

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.400
turns out to not use
that, by the way.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.800
I mean, this is really
theoretical and not so practical

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.070
for implementation, but
this informed what was

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.840
actually implemented.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.550
Okay so, we boiled down
the objectives to this.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.830
The idea is that for each block,
we want to keep the occupancy

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.970
between some ban,
60 to 80% full.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:58.080
Alright? And because that way,
you're utilizing the block.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.930
Mainly people are traveling

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:04.880
for some value-added
activity or some utility.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.070
They're shopping.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.780
They're seeing their friends.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.810
So, you want to make sure
there's space available.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.970
But you want to make sure
there's not too many spaces

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:12.240
available, right?

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.240
And so, I -- so, we
actually shoot for this ban

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.970
about 60 to 80% full, okay?

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:22.230
And the way the pricing
algorithm works, is this.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:28.020
So, in the previous six weeks,
we observe all the occupancies

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.250
on all the blocks in the city.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.050
And for each block,
for each block,

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.720
we look over that
previous six weeks,

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.650
was the occupancy over 80% full?

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:42.170
If it was over 80% full, then
we just increase the price

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.730
by a quarter, for
the next period.

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.040
So, increase the price.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.990
Maybe use -- you know,
discourage people

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.560
from parking there,
because we want to pull it

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.010
down between the
60 and 80% range.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:57.310
Alright? But if, in the previous
six weeks, the occupancy's lower

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.630
than 60%, then we
lower the price, okay?

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:04.850
Now, here's the part where
it sort of theoretical model

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.130
of how you should change
your price, and [inaudible].

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.230
But you know, the
people implementing this

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.160
in the city were
like, "Okay, look.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.900
Give us something that we
could actually make sense

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:15.670
of and communicate."

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:17.070
You know, so this was it.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:23.340
We could only increase the
price by 25 cents per hour,

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.860
but we could decrease the price

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.720
by you know, 25 cents
or 50 cents.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.660
They were fine with us
decreasing the price.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.870
There's the increasing,
that's the problem.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.950
Okay? So, the idea with
this, you're not supposed

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:36.960
to really try to read that.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.560
It's just to show that
there's a flow of algorithm.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.320
And so, this, like I said,
we do this over the time --

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.250
these three, time
bands: morning,

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.740
evening -- lunch, and evening.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.870
So, let me get to punchline.

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.880
So, we had this pricing scheme.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.250
And so, like I mentioned, one
of the key assumptions a lot

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:02.520
of time in revenue management
or pricing, is that the users

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.140
or people actually
know the prices.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.570
And so, the city did a
major marketing campaign.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:11.300
So, this is from the
San Francisco Chronicle.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:16.300
And there were billboards all
over the city, at bus shelters,

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.290
a very large campaign,
to let people know

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.510
that this program's happening,

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:26.150
and that there's
an app available.

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:29.240
On that app, you
could see the prices

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.660
in real time, and so forth.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:36.740
So, there was a big effort to
communicate this -- the prices.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.960
So, the way this
worked is, for example,

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.550
and here's the Filmore area.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:45.770
So, here, the brown
area for example,

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:48.240
is where there's low occupancy.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:53.250
Okay? So, and red means
the occupancy's high.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.480
Alright, so here's a
sort of before picture,

00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:01.490
and if a block is between
you know, less than 60% full,

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.980
then we decrease the price
for the next time period.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.920
So, here are the
corresponding price changes.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.790
So, green in this picture
means we decrease the price

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.340
on those blocks.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.820
Red means we increase.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.980
Okay? So, this is --

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.470
so, we looked at the
previous time period.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.220
Look at the average occupancy.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.020
Then we change the price,

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.940
and then we see how those
prices affected occupancies

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.660
in the next time period.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.530
Okay? So, here, the idea is
we want to move more and more

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.780
of these blocks into
the blue area.

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.820
So, this is how the
program worked.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:41.690
&gt;&gt; Why you [inaudible]
green sometimes [inaudible]

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:42.090
red [inaudible]?

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:42.160
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: So,

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.950
the red should only
get increases.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:50.290
Hopefully, the red
should only get increases.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:53.740
If in this time period,
you were red,

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:57.880
then you should get
over here, increases.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.810
So, over here, for increase.

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:00.890
&gt;&gt; Okay, [inaudible].

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:01.660
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Yes.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:06.970
And the idea is to push
everything into the blue areas.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:10.570
Okay so, here is sort
of a net change --

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:15.690
net changes over the
different neighborhoods.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.700
So, this is over
12 price changes.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.380
So, you can see [inaudible]
net -- red means on net,

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.640
that the price increased.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.440
Green, on net, the
price decreased.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.740
So, we did this -- this
is after 12 prices changes

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.790
with 6 weeks in between.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.550
So, you see here, it's not
really like a price gouge.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.570
[Inaudible] you know, there was
a big backlash to this program.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:41.390
Like, "Oh, the city's just
gouging us for more money.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.010
Revenue." Alright?

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.420
And so, you see, it's a
mixture of green and red.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:49.640
So, some areas, the prices
decreased pretty significantly.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.010
And some areas, it increased.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:51.670
Yes, there?

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.280
&gt;&gt; How transparent
is the pricing?

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.360
Do people have to stop
and look at the meter

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.780
and read the fine point or--

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:58.230
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Yes.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:59.200
&gt;&gt; -[inaudible] print
or is there --

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.950
are there big signs that say,
"This block is this much"?

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:02.080
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Yes.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.860
&gt;&gt; "And this block
is this much"?

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:04.550
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius Hampshire:
That's a great question.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:08.480
So, it's in the app.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.730
So, if you, before you
leave home, look at the app,

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.500
you can know what the
price of parking is.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.960
If you travel to that area
often, you can do some

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.390
of your own price exploration.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.450
And so, maybe after six
weeks, then you understand.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:23.910
You've done enough discovery.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:25.650
That's kind of the premise

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:29.320
of why we exogenously changed
the price every six weeks.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.120
We just say we do that.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.290
We don't necessarily
optimally time

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:35.490
when we should change
the prices, for example.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:38.290
But that's a great question.

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:38.450
Yes?

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:44.210
&gt;&gt; How much did it take
people to react to this?

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:44.430
Like, [inaudible]?

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:44.740
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Yes,

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:45.670
so this is a great question.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:46.490
I'll get to that.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.220
Just -- the question
about stabilizing.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.410
Well, do these prices stabilize?

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:51.210
So, let me just say this.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.580
So, actually, it
turns out, so --

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:59.780
that the prices were quite
insensitive to price --

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:03.740
I mean, the parking levels were
quite insensitive to price.

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.470
I'll say more about
that in a second.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:09.890
But here's -- actually, it turns
out one-third of the blocks,

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:16.120
monotonically increased -- the
price increased over the --

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.790
this is over a 12
time change period.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:19.700
So, they went up.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.570
One-third went up monotonically.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:25.340
The other -- another third
monotonically decreased.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.300
So, the area just got cheaper
and cheaper and cheaper.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:30.600
Some areas got more
expensive, more expensive.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.520
But then everything
else in between,

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.150
actually bounced around.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:36.080
Sometimes they go up,
then they go down.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:40.540
So, you get some odd behavior
there in the equilibrium.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.390
And also, what I say, there's
non-smooth spatial prices.

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:48.280
So, you'll get literally roads,
streets, blocks right next

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.070
to each other, that have
very different prices

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:52.900
after many changes.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:53.910
After many price changes.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:56.500
And that has to do with
maybe like amenities.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:01.750
You know, where restaurants
are, versus where they're not,

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:05.510
but you imagine people's
walking utility should be smooth

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:06.260
over a space.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.520
It should be a nice,
spatial thing.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.620
So, that's still
actually a current mystery

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:15.690
that we're trying to look
at for spatial pricing.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:21.600
And it turns out the average
revenue per meter went up.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.260
Okay.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:25.610
&gt;&gt; Go [inaudible]?

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:26.270
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Yes.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:30.480
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] So, I guess
our 1, 2 related that--

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.300
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Yes.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.170
&gt;&gt; -you -- this looks
like an area

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:35.160
where I should decrease
the price.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.830
I increased it, but
nothing really happened,

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:38.760
so let me do it again.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.720
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Exactly, yes.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.430
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:40.630
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Yes,

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:41.470
I'm not going to go into it.

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:44.720
We went -- we have a whole
set of methodologies,

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.190
how to estimate this
-- price elasticities.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:49.990
It turned out, it's
not easy to do

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:51.780
because there's some
reversion --

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.160
some issue with reversion
to the [inaudible].

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.760
If you guys want to know
more about that, we can --

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.730
I can say more about that later.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:05.450
Okay so -- so here,
the idea was --

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:08.110
we observed that the occupancy

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:10.980
and the cruising levels
actually had changed,

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:16.430
but it was actually due to
our program, or was it due

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:19.650
to some other thing
that was happening?

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:23.270
And so, to do this -- to
do the actual analysis,

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:26.320
here's what we did.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.510
This program had an API
-- or we had access --

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:31.660
since we were running,
we had access to data

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.900
over roughly a two-year period

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.990
about the average
occupancy on all the blocks.

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.400
Like I said, there's about
400 blocks in the program,

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:45.660
250 were in the pilot, 55 were
controls, and just to kind

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.210
of give you guys a sense
of how much parking is,

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:50.590
so the baseline before
we started the program,

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:52.920
was $2.00 an hour.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.480
Two dollars an hour to park.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.910
Okay? And so, for
all the blocks,

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:05.030
we have the occupancy
levels and the prices.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:08.370
And that's from the
parking spaces perspective.

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:12.870
Alright so, this is
what the urban planners

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:14.540
and the transportation
planners were thinking.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.640
They were like, "Oh,
the idea is to kind

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:21.080
of keep the average
occupancy between 60 and 80%."

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.600
Well, in this case, 85%.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.020
It was sort in the literature.

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.720
We wanted to have occupancy
on average around 85%.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.210
And they thought that that --

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:34.840
and they use that
as rule of thumb.

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:39.970
But it turns out just because
a space is occupied 85%

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:43.750
of the time, that's not the same
thing as saying, as a driver,

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:44.780
when I show up to park,

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.370
that there's a space
available 85% of the time.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:49.270
Okay? This is sort
of the difference

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:52.400
between the spatial average
and the time average.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:57.130
So, this is -- so what is the
experience of the drivers?

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:59.760
And so, this is --
okay, some good --

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.730
some queuing theory comes in.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.160
This is a standard
problem in queuing theory,

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.230
that it was C here would
be the number of spaces.

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:10.610
We have some folks who
are arriving to park.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:15.160
If the spaces are all
full, then here you drive

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.190
around until you can park.

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:21.140
Very simple model of parking.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.420
Alright? And so, it turns
out that that's a standard --

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.340
if you assume things
are exponentially --

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.070
you know, [inaudible] on
arrivals, exponential amount

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.230
of time you wait here.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:34.820
Was a very standard model.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:36.560
Multi-server queue model.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.390
And it actually turns out that
from the driver's perspective,

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:42.430
that probably that --
when you show up to park,

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:44.130
that there's a space available,

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:45.840
is this so-called
Erlang C formula.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.680
So, you can write that down.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:51.240
And from the parking
spaces perspective,

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.140
this is the fraction
that are going

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.870
to be occupied in the long run.

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:57.710
So, this kind of gives
you that dichotomy.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:01.170
So, here's what we
ended up doing.

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:02.740
The data that we originally had,

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.920
I told you is the
hourly averages.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.950
But what we did is we took
finer grained observations

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:12.200
of how much -- how many
spaces were available.

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.850
Okay? So, every five
minutes, we're collecting data

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:19.950
for every block, how many
people are parked there.

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:23.360
Okay? And I'll show
you why we do that.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.880
So, here it turns out
the -- so we want to --

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.320
what's the hourly --
what's the relationship

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.580
with an hourly occupancy and the
probability of finding a space?

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.560
Like, I said, that's the
Erlang Blocking Formula.

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.260
But we have lots of data,

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:40.210
so can we actually
empirically verify or fit that?

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:43.760
So, what -- so actually,
what I end up doing is taking

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:50.870
that Erlang Blocking Formula,
and taking the log of it.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:54.060
Okay? So, if you take the log of
this, Erlang Blocking Formula,

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:58.060
you get -- actually, you
can get a linear regression.

00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.290
So, basically, what
I'm going to do is make

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:02.110
like a linear model, alright?

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:04.300
So, and I'll show
you why I'm doing it.

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:08.090
So, on the right-hand side,
are data that's related

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:11.330
to the -- what the spaces see.

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:13.440
These are like the
spatial averages.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.000
But on the left-hand side,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.940
is actually the driver
averages, okay?

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.780
So, I'm basically linearizing
the Erlang Blocking Formula,

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:25.830
and then running a
regression, to get a model.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:27.020
So, it turns out that --

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:32.040
like I said, we had about
130 observations about --

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.900
for every block --
130,000 observations.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:41.980
And so, you can actually fit
empirical model from the data,

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:47.800
about how if a block is 80%
full on average over an hour,

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.300
what's the corresponding,
over there,

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.430
probability that a
driver finds a space?

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:56.240
Okay? And of course, that's
[inaudible] the number

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.460
of spaces on that block.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:02.710
So, if you have a really big
block, and it's, you know --

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:07.050
it takes a lot of -- a
really high occupancy that --

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.630
for the users to
experience full.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.460
Right? If you have
a really big block.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.880
So, that's going to
come in handy later.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.080
So, let me move on.

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:24.400
So, next, the idea is that how
does this hourly occupancy data

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.580
that the city uses, how
does that map onto cruising?

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:28.830
They're searching for a space.

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:32.000
So, the idea is that you're
looking for a space to park.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.370
If it's not available, then
you go searching around.

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:40.570
Okay? And so, what we do
is a very simple model.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:41.790
Because we don't have --

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:46.060
we don't have sensors that track
all the cars in this study.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.420
What we do only have the --

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:51.630
we can only see what's
happening at the space.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.550
Is it full or not?

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:55.870
And we can see the dynamics
of how the block changes.

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:56.560
And so, we're going to use

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:01.160
that to infer how long it
took you to find a space.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:01.490
Yes?

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:03.820
&gt;&gt; Don't you have an app?

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.990
[Inaudible] turn the app
on, and then you turn

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.310
on the GPS receiver and
[inaudible] you know everything

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.830
about the [inaudible] because
I went around or [inaudible]?

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:11.690
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: No, we don't.

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:11.760
[Inaudible]

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.600
&gt;&gt; Oh, you didn't go
there [inaudible]?

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.820
&gt;&gt; No, we didn't.

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:14.200
We should have.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.650
We didn't do that.

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.600
We do have how many people
are actually using the app,

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.850
but we don't track the user.

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:22.640
We should [inaudible].

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.380
&gt;&gt; Can I ask why you didn't?

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:24.600
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Oh, no.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.510
Yes.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:26.730
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] moral
[inaudible]?

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:27.970
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius Hampshire:
There's privacy reasons.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:28.850
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] never mind.

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:30.630
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius Hampshire:
Now, we have other work

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:34.600
where we actually, in the same
period, purchased a large set

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:39.530
of GPS data, for about a
million trips of people moving

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:41.150
around in San Francisco,

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.630
and we estimate how many
people are looking --

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:44.990
excessively looking for parking.

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:46.430
&gt;&gt; Where'd you get
that [inaudible]?

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.610
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: So,

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:48.210
someone else collected the data.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:51.270
So, you can buy these data
sets as you [inaudible].

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.640
So, in this -- for this work,

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.420
what we did is a
very simple thing.

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.710
Actually, it's just
absorbing mark off chain.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:58.160
I'll show you.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.770
So, the idea is that you know,
[inaudible] each driver wants

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:02.610
to park in a given block.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:06.240
They start there with some
probability there's a space.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.150
If they can't find a space, then
they move to the adjacent block

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:13.280
with some probability and
try to find up a space again.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.820
So, it's almost like a
geometric kind of trials.

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:21.490
And so, let me show
you -- where's my --

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:22.130
okay, I'll show you this.

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:23.120
You guys know [inaudible].

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.410
So, we have a transition matrix.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:29.820
So, the idea is that the first
row is where you want to park,

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.910
where you actually are driver
and you end up parking.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:38.680
But let's say you start at Block
Number 3, where probably 0.8,

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.180
80% [inaudible] there's
a space available.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.340
If there's a space available,
you go to Row 1 and you park.

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.500
You absorb.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.050
So, it's a simple
absorbing chain.

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:52.550
And so, we know they're
just simple, linear system

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:54.760
that can solve for
the expected amount

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:56.600
of time it takes you to park.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.880
So, it's the -- this
is a very simple model.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.850
Alright? Now, the first
row about the probability

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:10.370
of a space is available, comes
from the data that we collected.

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:11.910
So, we have that raw data.

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:13.840
We know the probability
for every block.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:18.010
So, we compute this
absorbing chain,

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.550
and we get results like this.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:24.100
So, this is real results
for Fisherman's Wharf.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:32.020
And let's look at
the dark blue here.

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:37.250
This is the average number of
blocks that you had to cruise,

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:42.070
before you could
find a parking spot.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:46.320
The orange here is the
probability that when you arrive

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:49.610
at that block, that
there's no space available.

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:54.790
Okay? So, for every --
so, this is aggregated

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:55.770
up to the neighborhood level.

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:58.030
But for every block, we
can say, [inaudible],

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:00.180
"What's the probability
that when you show up there

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.770
as a user, that there's a space?

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:03.830
And what's the probability
that when you-- ."

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:06.670
We also say, "What's
the average amount of --

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.700
average number of
blocks that you have

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:11.090
to search before you can
find an available space?"

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:17.660
So, that's -- and that's sort of
all driven by the empirical data

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:19.730
in this simply queuing model.

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:26.150
Okay. And we can do that
for various neighborhoods.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:33.530
As so, this is the
so-called Marina neighborhood.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:35.820
And it turns out
here at 6 o'clock is

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.210
when the meters turn
off in San Francisco.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:42.920
Alright. Like actually, it turns

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:46.650
out they probably shouldn't
turn off, because there seems

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:53.330
to be a lot of demand,
potentially in the evening.

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:55.680
So, let me move on.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.450
So, okay. So, the
first part of --

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:00.630
this first part was really

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.910
about how do you compute
the relevant quantities

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.180
that we want to use
in evaluation?

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.950
So, like I mentioned,
so, this program SFpark,

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:12.280
we changed the prices on lots
of blocks, and then we wanted

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.290
to evaluate whether
or not it reduced --

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:18.580
reduced the amount
of time in cruising.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.430
The amount of time you took
to find a parking spot.

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:26.020
And we want to know, did it
also reduce the occupancy?

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:30.800
You know, did the blocks move
into this 60 to 80% range.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.560
Okay? But before we could
evaluate that properly,

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.990
we had to create some
tools from Queuing Theory

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.120
that was the quantities
that we're going

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.500
to use in the evaluation.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.750
Make sense?

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:44.690
Okay. When is this over, Bill?

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:48.330
[Inaudible] because we
started at 4:30, right?

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:49.170
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, yes.

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:49.320
[Inaudible]

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:49.700
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Okay, [inaudible].

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:50.410
Okay, good.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:50.600
&gt;&gt; Like [inaudible].

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:59.460
Yes, I'd say about
10 [inaudible].

00:41:59.460 --> 00:41:59.990
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: About 10 [inaudible].

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.790
Okay, alright.

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:05.600
Okay. So, the next
part is really --

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.490
so, econometrics or
statistical evaluation, okay?

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:12.890
So, let me just --
this is a big picture.

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:13.420
Okay? Let me [inaudible].

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:19.360
So, these row -- I mean,
the columns represent here,

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.800
ten different price changes.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.160
So, we had to -- this
evaluation time period.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:28.130
So, roughly about six weeks
between each price change,

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:30.810
so this is ten price
changes, and then --

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:32.310
but we took baseline data,

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:35.960
before we did any
changes in price.

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.780
Okay? Now, what I want to show
you is that -- look at the --

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:44.510
in the top row, at
the top, the green.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:47.870
So, we wanted to push
the occupancy of blocks

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:50.540
into this 60 to 80%
range, right?

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:55.330
So, the top is the control area,
and so, the percentage means

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:59.140
like here, roughly 40%
of all the blocks were

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.950
in the range that we desired.

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:03.050
That's how you read this.

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:06.070
Now, at the bottom, these
are all from the pilot area.

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:09.060
This is where we actually
did the interventions.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:14.570
Okay? And so, the idea was that
we want to push more and more

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:17.620
of -- into this range.

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:28.020
So, it started at
about 34%, 32, okay?

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:29.910
But it ended like 36.

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:32.450
So, you say, "Oh,
did it do anything?"

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:34.990
You know? Yes, maybe
it didn't --

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:36.640
maybe people were too
inelastic, you know?

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.670
Did it work or not?

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:43.540
Alright. But then you also
look at the control area.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:47.110
So, what we wanted to do was try
to make a rigorous comparison

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:52.030
between you know --
did the program --

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:56.140
can you attribute to the
program, an increased number

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.520
of blocks in this range?

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:04.680
Okay so, what we did -- end
up doing this is that we kind

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.730
of built -- we wanted to
look at a couple things.

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:10.850
One, the percent -- so,
the first model is really

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.590
about how many --
the percentage points

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:16.840
by which a block
deviates from the range.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.030
So, 60 to 80% is the
range that we care about.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:23.020
If the occupancy of
a block was say, 85%,

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.660
then that would deviate
by 5 points.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.660
Okay? That's this first --

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.930
the first dependent
variable we care about.

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:33.510
And the other thing is the
number of blocks cruised.

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:36.370
Okay? So, what we
want to make sure is

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:40.680
that we're pushing more
blocks into this --

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.860
we want to decrease this
deviation from the range,

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.510
over time, when --
and want to see

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:47.980
if it decreases the cruising.

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:51.490
Now, the key thing that we
care about is the programs.

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:56.530
So, how many times did the
rates change for a given block?

00:44:57.550 --> 00:45:02.690
Okay? Now, there's lots of
other factors that contribute

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:04.420
to occupancy and parking demand.

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:07.040
So, the so-called like
"neighborhood effects."

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.810
So, there could be
things occurring say

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:13.230
in the Fisherman's Wharf area
that could have happened,

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:14.640
that we don't maybe --

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.430
for example, we may not observe
things that could happen.

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:19.870
A parade came through
or they shut

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:21.950
down some streets in
that neighborhood.

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:23.870
Unobserved characteristics.

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:26.310
And also, those kind
of things that happen

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:28.730
at the block level, right?

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:32.670
So, maybe some of the
meters were disabled,

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:33.770
but we didn't observe it.

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:36.870
So, we want to be able to sort
of control for a lot of --

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:39.220
some of these unobserved
factors, okay?

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:47.050
So, what we end up -- so,
what we do -- oh, well.

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:47.880
Maybe [inaudible].

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:52.050
I won't -- let me go here first.

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:58.500
So, what we ended up doing
is Number 1, 2, and 3,

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.370
relate to the occupancy.

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:04.150
Okay? And what you
want to look at --

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:06.590
what we really care about
is these number of changes.

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:10.140
So, every time the price
changes, what happens to the --

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.910
how much close -- do you
get closer to that range.

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:15.820
So, a negative means that
every time the price change,

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:19.580
you get a -- our blocks are
getting closer to that 60,

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:23.440
80% -- 60 to 80%
occupancy range.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.950
Okay? And this so-called
panel regression.

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:32.610
So, we look at one block
over many time periods, okay?

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:35.460
So, we have a lot of
observations from one block.

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.290
And so, you have to
take in account --

00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:39.870
so, we take into account, time
of day, day of week, lots of --

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:43.140
we have lots of data so
we can sort of control

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:45.380
for a lot of these factors.

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:46.880
So, basically about mine.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.280
These first three
models basically show

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:53.160
that when you change price,
well except these first two,

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:57.550
that when you change the price,
you are actually moving closer

00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:00.900
to that range, but it's
really -- it's really small.

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:05.500
And over here, 4, 5, and 6,
are really looking at cruising.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.060
So, every time you
change the price,

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:11.320
are you decreasing the amount
of distance that people have

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.760
to search to find the space.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.790
Okay? And I'm going -- I will
claim here that the answer's yes

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:19.690
and it's going to
be significant.

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:22.270
Let me just -- but let me
show you something though.

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:27.090
So, and this relates
to your question that,

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:30.280
here are all the
ten price changes.

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:34.420
And the Y-axis is sort
of the percentage change

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:36.790
that you're moving closer
and closer to the target.

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:38.630
So, it turns out that early --

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:40.500
and the blur there is sort

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.390
of the confidence
intervals, alright?

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:45.520
And so, you can see early in
the program, that it's sort

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.720
of indistinguishable from zero.

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:51.520
That maybe there's
no big effect.

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.900
But as you can continue
to change the prices,

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.540
you actually get -- that's
when you get the impact.

00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:01.350
So, we continue this
out for 20 time periods.

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:03.830
So, we actually -- this
program is still in effect now.

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:06.010
It was a pilot, but
now it's been scaled

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:07.870
up city-wide and so forth.

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:11.600
But the point is that it
take quite a while for --

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.130
we can interpret this.

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:17.600
It took a while for
people to actually respond.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:21.980
That we can say people
responded to this program.

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:26.900
Okay? It wasn't until maybe much
later that we can feel confident

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:30.200
to say that this program
changed people's behavior.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.400
But by a very small percent.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:35.610
Maybe 2 percentage
points on occupancy.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:42.220
Okay? But, and the same
thing here for cruising.

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.280
You don't start to get an impact

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:50.910
until much later
on in the program.

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:55.800
So, it turns out that even
though the average occupancy

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.420
only changed about
1 to 2 percent,

00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:04.320
the corresponding change in
this cruising was around 50%.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.130
So, it really decreased
the amount of time.

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:08.530
Even though there wasn't a lot
of cruising at the beginning,

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:11.940
we can attribute about 50%
of the decrease in the amount

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.400
of time you were looking
for parking to this program.

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:21.840
And to provide more
color, so this is --

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.080
yes, the map of San Francisco.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:27.240
Actually, it turns out that
of the roughly 500 blocks,

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.280
only about 43 of them accounted

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.930
for about half of
all the cruising.

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:33.760
So, we kind of know this.

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.290
There's like popular
areas in the city,

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:39.560
that basically generate
most of the searching.

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.600
So, it's very localized.

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:42.270
And it's, yes.

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:43.710
So, this is very surprising.

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:45.770
Well, in some ways.

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:48.390
That -- it turns out
that this program,

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:53.370
we were changing the price
on roughly about 500 spaces.

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:56.090
But we could get
close to the same --

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:59.840
well, I don't want to say.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.110
Actually, it only
turns out that about 43

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:05.090
of the blocks are
generating most of --

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:06.040
half of all the congestion.

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.000
And I think this
phenomena kind of holds.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.640
And it kind of makes
sense to us.

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.000
Like Nassau Street, okay?

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.990
If you get Nassau Street right,
then you're really going to --

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:24.520
you know, get a big
bang for your buck.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:28.110
Yes, and so there is a lot of
just evidence that you know,

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:31.690
when you turn the
meters off at 6 o'clock,

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:33.200
you really get this big spike.

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.590
So, people are just
waiting, you know, to park.

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:38.760
Once the meters turn off, then
you get a lot of this demand.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:42.170
So, the prices are
doing something to sort

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:44.500
of control demand,
because you know,

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:47.130
why else would there
be this sort

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:49.920
of really big discontinuity
at 6 o'clock?

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.570
So, there's something
happening there.

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:51.640
[ Inaudible audience question ]

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:55.270
Oh, good question.

00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:58.920
So, like Fisherman's Wharf is
not residential, but here, yes.

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:01.150
Here's like residential
parking potentially.

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.470
That's good.

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:05.020
So, let me just kind of
move a little bit faster.

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:10.600
So, like I said, let me just
summarize here that this is a --

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.490
[inaudible] field
experiment to try

00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:14.520
to understand how this
spatial pricing works.

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.470
And I think the takeaway is,

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:21.220
I call it like a little
change goes a long way,

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:24.510
meaning that the occupancy
didn't change a lot,

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:27.790
but the cruising, we
can attribute to say

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:30.920
that did change pretty
dramatically,

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.030
in some nonlinear way.

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:42.160
We got the very -- variety
of responses spatially.

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.430
Yes, maybe the program hasn't
run long enough to get smooth,

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:48.050
kind of spatial prices or
not in the equilibrium.

00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:51.320
But that's not quite
what we're seeing.

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:56.700
And then, we would
kind of really argue

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.170
that this average occupancy
is something that was

00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:00.240
in the literature and something

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.110
that city planners
really just --

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:03.370
that's what the main
focus [inaudible].

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:05.420
On average, how full is it?

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:07.580
But we tried to make an argument
that really, you want to try

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:10.120
to look at it from the
person's driving perspective.

00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:14.560
Was there a chance
that you'd get a space?

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:20.580
Yes, so that's more about that.

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:23.980
Let me just stop here.

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:27.760
Okay, so from the implementation
side -- so this program,

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:31.310
it turns out that
it was sponsored

00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:33.290
by the Federal Highways
Administration.

00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:40.580
And the program actually led to
replication in a lot of cities.

00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:44.720
Not just in the U.S., but around
the world had implemented,

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.700
based on lessons
learned here and other --

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:49.070
the things they implemented
versions

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:51.060
of this, time of day pricing.

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.490
They tried to use some
of these principles.

00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:57.090
So, yes. And so, then we
did a big road show in a lot

00:52:57.090 --> 00:53:01.630
of different cities in the
U.S. to try to you know,

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:03.350
replicate this to
a lesser degree.

00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:06.690
Here we put -- they put sensors
in every, single parking space.

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:08.310
There were 6,000 spaces.

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:10.280
They put an individual
sensor in each space.

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:13.090
It's very expensive.

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:18.210
So, there's a very lightweight,
light hardware versions of this

00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:21.170
that don't use as many sensors,
or don't use sensors at all.

00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:22.410
Maybe use cameras.

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:26.990
Maybe use parking meter receipts
to try to infer availability,

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:29.780
but there's certainly
asset-light versions of this,

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:31.170
because this program
is very expensive.

00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:32.560
It was a 20-million-dollar
program.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.660
It was matched, 20 million
dollars from the state.

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:38.830
So, a 40-million-dollar
program, that a lot of cities

00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:40.080
and states don't
have that money.

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:42.050
So, a lot of the work has been

00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:45.000
about how do you translate
this to other places?

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:52.090
And so, of course, this -- and
this now may have more residence

00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:57.020
if you look towards -- this
is my editorializing now.

00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:02.810
Towards AV's, autonomous
vehicles, or self-driving

00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:06.340
or driverless vehicles.

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:07.660
Those terms are all the same,

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:11.550
but people want to
ask me about them.

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:16.020
So certainly, that has
implicate -- parking, you know,

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:21.410
there's arguments that
actually these vehicles won't

00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:22.890
park themselves.

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:25.420
In fact, if they -- if
they're privately owned,

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:28.650
which could be a disaster,
they would just drive

00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:31.240
around in circles, on the road.

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:36.450
They have the incentive because
they may run on electric motors,

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:40.430
that are quite efficient at
low -- relatively low speeds.

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:43.970
So, the idea you might actually
have vehicles that may bob --

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:46.350
you have an AV, it dropped
you off, and guess what?

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:47.700
It doesn't park.

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:49.960
It may just drive
around in circles.

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:55.020
Worse yet, it may collude with
other AV's to create congestion.

00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:55.550
So, they can move [inaudible].

00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:56.360
&gt;&gt; No collusion.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.390
No collusion.

00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:58.140
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: No collusion.

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.540
To conclude, to actually
drive slow.

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.230
Alright? Or it may drive
back to your house and park

00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:04.810
in your garage, or
something like that.

00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:08.100
So, this parking that
we'll continue to do,

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.490
actually moving forward,
we have current work

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:12.410
that really looks
the implications

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:13.910
for AV, autonomous vehicles.

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:18.500
And so, let me just
kind of wrap up here.

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:21.660
Thanks to the people at --
in the city of San Francisco

00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:24.010
who we worked very closely with.

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:30.900
This is based on a set of papers
that we've published on this.

00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:31.790
And I'll stop there.

00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:33.510
So, thank you.

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:37.730
[ Applause ]

00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:39.690
&gt;&gt; Okay, and [inaudible]
couple questions.

00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:40.510
Yes?

00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:47.050
[ Inaudible student question ]

00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:49.510
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Say that again?

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:59.670
[ Inaudible student question ]

00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:01.440
Yes, so the -- you're saying --

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:04.380
usually, they want to have
one available parking space

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:05.730
per block.

00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:08.450
And that's -- yes, so if you --

00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:10.520
that's close to the kind of
objective we're looking at.

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:14.890
If an average block has 12 to
15 spaces, if one of them --

00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:17.570
if 14 -- you know, 14
are full, then you get

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:20.120
around you know, 80, 85% full.

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.720
So, that's kind of like
this similar criteria.

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.400
But you need much better
sensing to make sure

00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:26.810
that there's only
one space available.

00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:27.460
Yes.

00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:28.630
&gt;&gt; The technology question.

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:32.700
If there are sensors that that's

00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.770
where there are parking spots
available, is there an app

00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:39.960
that will tell you
where to go to park?

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:42.980
The closest parking
or cheapest parking?

00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:45.590
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius Hampshire:
Yes, so the app, from the city

00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:47.420
and now there's a
host of other apps

00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:49.960
that have availability
information.

00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:52.010
So, if you either have the app,

00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:53.800
you shouldn't look
at it while driving.

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:55.200
That's a problem.

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:58.820
But if it's integrated into your
car, some navigation system,

00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:01.160
they could drop, you
know, directly to the --

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:04.840
direct you to the
available parking space.

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:08.480
Yes. So, the app we made
was voice activated, too.

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.840
So. There?

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:15.100
&gt;&gt; So, I'm thinking about --
and I'm not advocating this,

00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:18.250
but I'm thinking about
[inaudible] resources

00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:21.770
and some people argue
that, you know,

00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:24.320
what would a private company
do if they [inaudible].

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:27.070
And I, for the first
time in a long time,

00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:31.410
I flew Southwest Airlines last
week, and they have this model.

00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:34.620
And I think of their business
model as being very similar

00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:36.930
to this, which is you --

00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:43.290
you have tiered pricing with
the goal being that you --

00:57:43.290 --> 00:57:46.430
you want to sell all seats
but if you're the last seat--

00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:47.240
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: That's right.

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:49.200
&gt;&gt; -it's going to be more
expensive than the first.

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:49.510
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Yes.

00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:52.450
&gt;&gt; Right? Did you guys
look at any of the data,

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:55.660
because I know airlines
spend millions of dollars

00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:57.190
on this type of research?

00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.390
What's [inaudible]--

00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:57.720
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Yes.

00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:00.070
&gt;&gt; -[inaudible] they do for,
and did you look at that?

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:00.810
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Yes, you know,

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:02.180
part of what Bob mentioned,

00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:05.260
we wanted the prices
to be transparent.

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:08.830
And so, if you do this sort
of inventory-based, prices --

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:12.300
it's a much -- you know,
as opposed to airlines,

00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:13.500
you go to buy a ticket,

00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.620
you don't know how much
it's going to cost.

00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:18.500
That's one thing, but if you go
to park in the city and you --

00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.160
once you park, you get
out and look at the meter

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:22.690
and it's you know, $100 an hour.

00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:26.420
That's not a satisfactory
political outcome.

00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:28.610
So, a lot of political
constraints.

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:31.540
So, yes, we didn't --
that's why we didn't go

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:32.490
that direction [inaudible].

00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:37.550
&gt;&gt; Well, now that you've
finished with San Francisco,

00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:40.150
I'm just wondering if you'll
apply this to La La Land?

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:41.440
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: What is that?

00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:43.230
&gt;&gt; Princeton.

00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:44.350
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Oh, La La -- okay.

00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:47.140
Now, I would say here at San
Francisco, part of the --

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:49.100
any additional revenues
that will be generated

00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:53.350
from this program, go
to improve transit,

00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:55.910
and go to improve the BART.

00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:57.540
That's the subway.

00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:03.920
And MUNI. Because otherwise,
if there's no alternative mode,

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:08.710
then the pricing now takes on
another different character.

00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:10.210
You know, it's the certainly --

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:14.600
and you have to think about
equity impacts of this kind

00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:15.860
of -- for public good.

00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:19.250
So, the way that San Francisco
got around this is any revenue,

00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:20.610
you know, goes to
improve transit.

00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:21.790
And transit's for everyone.

00:59:21.790 --> 00:59:24.820
And there's subsidized
transit passes and so forth.

00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:26.990
So, you just don't end
up with like BMW's parked

00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:28.220
on the street, which-- .

00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:30.320
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] people
sitting on the street.

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.260
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Exactly.

00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:33.290
Yes, so that's a big deal of --

00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:35.410
when you're implementing
in other cities,

00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:40.060
are there viable other modes,
or are you just really gouging.

00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:41.820
And I'll -- let me just
say one other [inaudible].

00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:48.330
These programs make it easier
and more convenient to park.

00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:52.560
And for some cities,
that's not the objective.

00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.890
That makes it easier for
you to drive your car.

00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:58.100
And actually, in some ways,
that works counter to a lot

00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:01.030
of cities sustainability goals.

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:03.180
Okay? So, I -- we're sort of
torn with just like, where --

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.820
doing this program, and it
makes it easier for you to drive

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:07.450
and more [inaudible],
but guess what?

01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:11.410
They may not be the right
objective to actually go after.

01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:13.000
So, we're working on that also.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:20.500
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] when you
took the logarithm--

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:20.790
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Oh, yes.

01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:22.740
&gt;&gt; -of the probability.

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:25.410
Was that more just for
computational convenience

01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:27.080
or because log will probably --

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.240
sometimes it interprets
[inaudible] information.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.620
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius Hampshire:
Yes, no, it was mainly

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:34.660
for computational
convenience to get sort

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:36.540
of a nice, linear regression.

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.810
&gt;&gt; But I just wondered just --

01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:39.440
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: That's a good point.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:45.040
&gt;&gt; -the absence of information
theoretical [inaudible].

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:45.430
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Maybe not.

01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:47.740
Yes, so logs with
probability, yes.

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:50.620
Maybe get the -- you
maybe get the [inaudible],

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.330
the negative with that.

01:00:54.330 --> 01:00:55.030
Okay.

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:57.990
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] Oh, before we
take off, [inaudible] reception

01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:59.410
that [inaudible] on
the second floor.

01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:00.240
&gt;&gt; Oh, excellent.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.010
&gt;&gt; Robert Cornelius
Hampshire: Okay, thank you.

01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:04.510
[ Applause ]

01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:08.910
[ Silence ]
