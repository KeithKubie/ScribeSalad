01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:27.430
to create a whole system to kind of deal
with the conflict within the

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440
with the conflict within the
 

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.340
with the conflict within the
organization another way to do it is to

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:30.350
organization another way to do it is to
 

01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:33.880
organization another way to do it is to
do training so you can do both together

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:33.890
do training so you can do both together
 

01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:35.770
do training so you can do both together
but for example since I travel a lot and

01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:35.780
but for example since I travel a lot and
 

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:38.290
but for example since I travel a lot and
I go lots of different laces I tend to

01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:38.300
I go lots of different laces I tend to
 

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:40.060
I go lots of different laces I tend to
just focus on training so I'm really

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:40.070
just focus on training so I'm really
 

01:06:40.070 --> 01:06:41.590
just focus on training so I'm really
focusing on individuals in the

01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:41.600
focusing on individuals in the
 

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.570
focusing on individuals in the
organization and trying to help them

01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:43.580
organization and trying to help them
 

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:46.570
organization and trying to help them
deal more effectively with conflict so

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:46.580
deal more effectively with conflict so
 

01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:48.130
deal more effectively with conflict so
if somebody's asking me to do a more

01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:48.140
if somebody's asking me to do a more
 

01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:50.440
if somebody's asking me to do a more
in-depth project then I'm turning it

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:50.450
in-depth project then I'm turning it
 

01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:51.820
in-depth project then I'm turning it
over to somebody like Beth or somebody

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:51.830
over to somebody like Beth or somebody
 

01:06:51.830 --> 01:06:54.280
over to somebody like Beth or somebody
who does a more kind of they're really

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:54.290
who does a more kind of they're really
 

01:06:54.290 --> 01:06:56.050
who does a more kind of they're really
looking at the organization itself and

01:06:56.050 --> 01:06:56.060
looking at the organization itself and
 

01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:58.780
looking at the organization itself and
how they're going to create a system to

01:06:58.780 --> 01:06:58.790
how they're going to create a system to
 

01:06:58.790 --> 01:07:01.359
how they're going to create a system to
help that organization manage conflict

01:07:01.359 --> 01:07:01.369
help that organization manage conflict
 

01:07:01.369 --> 01:07:04.420
help that organization manage conflict
more effectively so if you want to say

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:04.430
more effectively so if you want to say
 

01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:06.490
more effectively so if you want to say
if you have an area of expertise so

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:06.500
if you have an area of expertise so
 

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:07.540
if you have an area of expertise so
let's say it's like financial

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:07.550
let's say it's like financial
 

01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:10.060
let's say it's like financial
institutions right so you work with

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:10.070
institutions right so you work with
 

01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:12.040
institutions right so you work with
financial institutions you then know

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:12.050
financial institutions you then know
 

01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:13.540
financial institutions you then know
what goes on in the financial

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:13.550
what goes on in the financial
 

01:07:13.550 --> 01:07:14.890
what goes on in the financial
institution so you're speaking from

01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:14.900
institution so you're speaking from
 

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:16.480
institution so you're speaking from
somebody from the inside who knows the

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:16.490
somebody from the inside who knows the
 

01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:18.280
somebody from the inside who knows the
industry and then you can go to somebody

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:18.290
industry and then you can go to somebody
 

01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:20.050
industry and then you can go to somebody
else in a financial institution and say

01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:20.060
else in a financial institution and say
 

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.090
else in a financial institution and say
I know for my you doing an informational

01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:22.100
I know for my you doing an informational
 

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:23.410
I know for my you doing an informational
interview and you're building and

01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:23.420
interview and you're building and
 

01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:24.760
interview and you're building and
getting the situation there and saying I

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:24.770
getting the situation there and saying I
 

01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:25.840
getting the situation there and saying I
know from my own experience these are

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:25.850
know from my own experience these are
 

01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:27.550
know from my own experience these are
some of the issues that we're facing

01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:27.560
some of the issues that we're facing
 

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.170
some of the issues that we're facing
yet people facing these and these are

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:29.180
yet people facing these and these are
 

01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:30.880
yet people facing these and these are
the things I think that could really

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:30.890
the things I think that could really
 

01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:32.770
the things I think that could really
help do that so you want to match the

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:32.780
help do that so you want to match the
 

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.810
help do that so you want to match the
conflict resolution skills to a

01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:34.820
conflict resolution skills to a
 

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.130
conflict resolution skills to a
particular industry that you have

01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:36.140
particular industry that you have
 

01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:38.140
particular industry that you have
knowledge and expertise available then

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:38.150
knowledge and expertise available then
 

01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:39.460
knowledge and expertise available then
it makes sense because people usually

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:39.470
it makes sense because people usually
 

01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:41.230
it makes sense because people usually
say what do you know about my industry

01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:41.240
say what do you know about my industry
 

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:41.980
say what do you know about my industry
and what do you know about my

01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:41.990
and what do you know about my
 

01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:43.720
and what do you know about my
organization you're right I may not know

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:43.730
organization you're right I may not know
 

01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:45.460
organization you're right I may not know
all things about your organization but

01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:45.470
all things about your organization but
 

01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:46.960
all things about your organization but
I've worked in other organizations or

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:46.970
I've worked in other organizations or
 

01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:47.560
I've worked in other organizations or
another one

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:47.570
another one
 

01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:49.870
another one
in your industry and I know about that

01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:49.880
in your industry and I know about that
 

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.490
in your industry and I know about that
and I'm just wondering if you have the

01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:51.500
and I'm just wondering if you have the
 

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.080
and I'm just wondering if you have the
same kind of issues I wouldn't go in

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:53.090
same kind of issues I wouldn't go in
 

01:07:53.090 --> 01:07:54.700
same kind of issues I wouldn't go in
there and saying I know about I know

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:54.710
there and saying I know about I know
 

01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:56.230
there and saying I know about I know
you've got problems I wouldn't go in

01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240
you've got problems I wouldn't go in
 

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.730
you've got problems I wouldn't go in
there saying that but saying based on my

01:07:57.730 --> 01:07:57.740
there saying that but saying based on my
 

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.800
there saying that but saying based on my
other experience I imagine this could be

01:07:59.800 --> 01:07:59.810
other experience I imagine this could be
 

01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:05.290
other experience I imagine this could be
a need that you may have international

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:05.300
a need that you may have international
 

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.480
a need that you may have international
development organizations one one of the

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:07.490
development organizations one one of the
 

01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:09.820
development organizations one one of the
things that they need desperately is

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:09.830
things that they need desperately is
 

01:08:09.830 --> 01:08:11.260
things that they need desperately is
this work especially when they're on the

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:11.270
this work especially when they're on the
 

01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:12.910
this work especially when they're on the
ground and they need to interface or

01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:12.920
ground and they need to interface or
 

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.020
ground and they need to interface or
they don't but they should interface

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:14.030
they don't but they should interface
 

01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:16.300
they don't but they should interface
with other development organizations so

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:16.310
with other development organizations so
 

01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:17.650
with other development organizations so
partly if it's people coming together

01:08:17.650 --> 01:08:17.660
partly if it's people coming together
 

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.030
partly if it's people coming together
from different countries now you have

01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040
from different countries now you have
 

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.130
from different countries now you have
the whole multicultural intercultural

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:21.140
the whole multicultural intercultural
 

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:23.260
the whole multicultural intercultural
aspect of it if there are people flying

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:23.270
aspect of it if there are people flying
 

01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:25.360
aspect of it if there are people flying
in to a place that they're not familiar

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:25.370
in to a place that they're not familiar
 

01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:27.039
in to a place that they're not familiar
with oh that is really difficult

01:08:27.039 --> 01:08:27.049
with oh that is really difficult
 

01:08:27.049 --> 01:08:30.039
with oh that is really difficult
conditions the stress of that can add to

01:08:30.039 --> 01:08:30.049
conditions the stress of that can add to
 

01:08:30.049 --> 01:08:32.349
conditions the stress of that can add to
its you bring that into being able to

01:08:32.349 --> 01:08:32.359
its you bring that into being able to
 

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:35.380
its you bring that into being able to
have your resources there when you need

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:35.390
have your resources there when you need
 

01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:36.970
have your resources there when you need
them and they don't always arrive that

01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:36.980
them and they don't always arrive that
 

01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:38.470
them and they don't always arrive that
can be stressful how do you build that

01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480
can be stressful how do you build that
 

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:40.570
can be stressful how do you build that
in and managing stress so you want to

01:08:40.570 --> 01:08:40.580
in and managing stress so you want to
 

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:43.420
in and managing stress so you want to
find out what it is that the buzzword of

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:43.430
find out what it is that the buzzword of
 

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:45.280
find out what it is that the buzzword of
the hook that they're dealing with and

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:45.290
the hook that they're dealing with and
 

01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:47.710
the hook that they're dealing with and
you can address because the reality is a

01:08:47.710 --> 01:08:47.720
you can address because the reality is a
 

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.420
you can address because the reality is a
lot of the skills we do can really be

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:49.430
lot of the skills we do can really be
 

01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:51.250
lot of the skills we do can really be
applied to so many situations but what's

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:51.260
applied to so many situations but what's
 

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.110
applied to so many situations but what's
the the word that's going to hook them

01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120
the the word that's going to hook them
 

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.300
the the word that's going to hook them
if they have team issues and teams the

01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:55.310
if they have team issues and teams the
 

01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:58.000
if they have team issues and teams the
word or stress or trauma then you want

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:58.010
word or stress or trauma then you want
 

01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:59.200
word or stress or trauma then you want
to hook into that but you don't know

01:08:59.200 --> 01:08:59.210
to hook into that but you don't know
 

01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:01.059
to hook into that but you don't know
that until you get that information but

01:09:01.059 --> 01:09:01.069
that until you get that information but
 

01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:02.320
that until you get that information but
you can ask about that if you're

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:02.330
you can ask about that if you're
 

01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:04.450
you can ask about that if you're
familiar with the industry and familiar

01:09:04.450 --> 01:09:04.460
familiar with the industry and familiar
 

01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:06.280
familiar with the industry and familiar
with other organizations I also think a

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:06.290
with other organizations I also think a
 

01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:09.130
with other organizations I also think a
good tool in any area that you're

01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:09.140
good tool in any area that you're
 

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:10.660
good tool in any area that you're
looking for when you're starting to

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:10.670
looking for when you're starting to
 

01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:13.539
looking for when you're starting to
explore opportunities and you want to

01:09:13.539 --> 01:09:13.549
explore opportunities and you want to
 

01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:17.980
explore opportunities and you want to
figure out how to get in up I say it's a

01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:17.990
figure out how to get in up I say it's a
 

01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:20.950
figure out how to get in up I say it's a
good opportunity to find a friend who

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960
good opportunity to find a friend who
 

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:25.599
good opportunity to find a friend who
you respect and practice the information

01:09:25.599 --> 01:09:25.609
you respect and practice the information
 

01:09:25.609 --> 01:09:29.079
you respect and practice the information
gathering because that's critical people

01:09:29.079 --> 01:09:29.089
gathering because that's critical people
 

01:09:29.089 --> 01:09:31.150
gathering because that's critical people
I think they're happy to do

01:09:31.150 --> 01:09:31.160
I think they're happy to do
 

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:35.380
