00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.290
So let's see if we can figure out what kind

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.060
of atomic instruction do we need. So we want to

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.080
implement locks easily. And for that, we need what type

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.400
of instruction? We need a load that reads memory, or we

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.060
need a store that writes memory, or we need an

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.630
instruction that both reads and writes memory, or we need an

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.638
instruction that doesn't access memory at all. So what do

00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:25.664
we need in order to implement locks relatively easily without resorting

00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:27.330
to complicated algorithms?
