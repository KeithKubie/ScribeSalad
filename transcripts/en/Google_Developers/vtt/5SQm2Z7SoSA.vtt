JONATHAN: Hi, everybody.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.210
Welcome to this week's Google+
platform office hours.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.590
I'm joined by Richard Dunn,
who is the tech lead for

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.700
Google+ Hangouts, as well as
Jason Salas, and the one only

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.250
Allen Firstenberg.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.970
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG:
Hey, everybody.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.850
JONATHAN: Oh, and Jenny Murphy
is coming on stage right now.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.780
There she is.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.760
So first and foremost, I want
to thank Richard for joining

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.370
us this week.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.830
It's an honor to have one of
the members of the Hangouts

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.630
API team join this
office hours.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.845
He's busy, as we're trying
to get more releases out

00:00:43.845 --> 00:00:47.050
as often as we can.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.620
We have a few questions for
him to answer later in the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.142
show, as well as questions from
the folks who joined us.

00:00:54.142 --> 00:00:57.400
I think for this Office Hours,
we'll be a little bit more

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.450
free form, and as questions
come in we'll

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.240
start to address those.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.880
Not as a particular topic
to start with.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.190
So how about I just start with
Richard, saying, what's going

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.630
on with Hangouts API?

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.060
What's the current
scene of things?

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.245
And what would you like to
tell the audience first?

00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:21.370
RICHARD DUNN: Yeah.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.690
So hi, guys.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.060
I'm Richard, tech lead
for Hangouts API.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.830
I assume that most people are
aware that we launched

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.190
publicly just about
a month ago.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.500
So we're really excited to have
stuff out there and see

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.860
people building apps,
releasing apps.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.170
We're interested to see
what can happen.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.960
We spent a lot of time of
getting that public release

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.180
going, so we're now being able
to have some time to go back

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.510
and beef up the API some more.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.120
So we're also interested in
hearing from people, you know,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.910
what do you need for us
to build for you?

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.390
Trying to make it easier
to write apps,

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.539
that kind of thing.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.680
So easier to write apps, easier
to distribute apps,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.410
easier to find and use
apps in the Hangout.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.905
All that kind of stuff is things
we're thinking about

00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:19.075
and working on.

00:02:19.075 --> 00:02:22.625
JASON SALAS: Very cool.

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:26.663
JONATHAN: So for Jason, I
think-- is this your first

00:02:26.663 --> 00:02:29.514
time in Office Hours?

00:02:29.514 --> 00:02:30.147
JASON SALAS: Yeah.

00:02:30.147 --> 00:02:34.000
I actually-- normally, because
of the time difference between

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.500
you fine folks and me, I usually
catch it on demand.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.730
But I was really interested in
participating today just

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.605
because the focus was going
to be specifically on the

00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:45.470
Hangouts API, which, like Allen,
I have taken a great

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.190
interest in and done a fair
amount of tinkering in.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.400
And I actually, I'm trying
to get several Hangouts

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.477
API-centric projects
off the ground, and

00:02:55.477 --> 00:02:55.560
everything like that.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.400
So I'm really excited to be
speaking with you and Jenny

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.990
and Richard.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.140
All of you have been extremely
gracious and really, really

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.660
quick to respond in the
past and everything.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.606
Every time we have questions and
everything, so it's a real

00:03:08.606 --> 00:03:11.780
treat to be interacting with
you guys live this time.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.000
And it's 4:30 in the
morning on Thursday

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.320
where I am right now.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.610
Even though for you
guys it's like 11.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.490
JONATHAN: You're not in the
States-- you're not stateside.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.210
Where are you again?

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.840
JASON SALAS: I'm in Guam.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.340
So I am about 3 and 1/2 hours
south of Japan and 8 and 1/2

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.800
hours north of Hawaii.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.210
That's 15 hours ahead
of you guys.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.784
So you're literally talking to
somebody from the future.

00:03:33.784 --> 00:03:35.840
JONATHAN: Oh, how is
it in the future?

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.616
Is [INAUDIBLE]?

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:38.730
JASON SALAS: It's hot.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.390
It's hot here.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.430
It's very, very hot.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.612
It's 4:30 in the morning and
it's about 89 degrees already.

00:03:44.612 --> 00:03:47.260
RICHARD DUNN: So can you talk a
little bit about some of the

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.210
projects you're thinking
about doing?

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.290
I feel like I've seen you around
on Twitter, but it'd be

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.376
great to hear about them.

00:03:56.376 --> 00:03:57.580
JASON SALAS: Oh, yeah.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.390
Twitter, it's lots of sports
one-liners and everything, but

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.060
hopefully something
with a little bit

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.030
more substance here.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.780
So basically, I kind of had--
and this obviously is not a

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.370
completely new idea, but I was
talking with some friends in a

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.079
Hangout, you know, on my stream,
and I just kind of

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.260
thought, I was like, why isn't
there a Hangout app right now

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.360
that lets paid Netflix
subscribers be able to

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.390
actually basically host
movie parties?

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:31.090
And I kind of came up with the
notion that movie watching and

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.950
the act of enjoying movies
can be a social

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.890
experience if you so desire.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.590
For some people, they're very
private relaxation activities,

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.205
and for other people they're
more of a party atmosphere.

00:04:42.205 --> 00:04:44.266
And so I started thinking about
it, and I was like, you

00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:47.070
know, if you're a paid Netflix
subscriber, you should be able

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.640
to share those kind of
experiences with other Netflix

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.310
subscribers.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.530
And I know obviously there's a
whole bunch of intellectual

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.195
property concerns.

00:04:53.195 --> 00:04:58.890
And there's huge issues about,
is that going to be piracy?

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.395
And can you lock it down so that
movies don't get stolen

00:05:01.395 --> 00:05:02.100
and everything like that?

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.815
But I actually started thinking,
and I started look

00:05:04.815 --> 00:05:07.530
at other platforms. And of
course, on the Xbox 360 they

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.090
had previously had a party
mode where if you were a

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.740
legitimate Netflix subscriber,
you and other members could

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.200
sign in and then you
could basically

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.660
watch a movie together.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.360
And up until the December,
2011 firmware update, I

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.020
believe, that existed.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.510
But it's since been taken out.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.890
So I was thinking, can this
kind of thing actually be

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.830
built legally and safely
and securely with

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.730
the Hangouts platform?

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.730
And I would think that
it could be.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:40.930
So I guess long story short, now
that I've rambled on, as a

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.700
developer, what kind of control
do I have to say, if I

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.740
build an app and everything,
to ensure that it will not

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.240
work in a Hangout
On Air scenario.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.570
Regardless of this
implementation or in something

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.920
else, if I write something, is
there a guarantee, or do I

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.730
have programmatic control to
say this will not run in a

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.276
Hangout On Air in a
live broadcast?

00:06:05.276 --> 00:06:07.060
RICHARD DUNN: We don't
have that right now.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.660
And I think as part of preparing
for a broader

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.410
release of the On Air stuff,
there's actually a bunch of

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.890
things we need to do
to just make sure

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.800
everything works great.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.775
And I guess one of the obvious
things will be, should this

00:06:23.775 --> 00:06:25.166
app be able to run
in an On Air?

00:06:25.166 --> 00:06:26.630
I don't think that's something
we thought about.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.170
We thought about more--

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.190
As an example, I have the
volume control app up.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.150
And there's six participants,
not five, because there's the

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.510
magic On Air participant.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.660
So we should probably
be fixing that.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.120
Yeah, I mean, that's
a good point.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.660
I don't know if you'd want
to do it like, don't

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.710
ever let this run.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.450
So don't even show this
in a Hangout On Air.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.600
Or whether you'd just want to
let the application know, hey,

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.020
this is an On Air Hangout, and
then the application can

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.100
decide to show something where
it's like, this is not

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.830
available in an On Air.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.310
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: I think there
are also some things--

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.560
JASON SALAS: Because right now
I know, and Alan and I are

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.875
contributors to Google
Plus week.

00:07:10.875 --> 00:07:12.690
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:13.180
I'm sorry, Allen.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.430
I was going to say because you
and I are both contributors to

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.590
Google+ Week, and Dan McDermott,
the show host on

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:24.750
That Show has at times said,
if I bring up a Google doc,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.470
because I wanted to interact
with a guest, that's not going

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.500
to show up I guess
just by default.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.750
Because it won't come out
on the recording.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.480
Like you were saying, Richard,
hopefully in the future,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.900
either by design of the actual
core program, or maybe from a

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.760
developer's standpoint, this
will just be something that we

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.210
can maybe just easily apply,
just turn on or off.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.740
And just say, exclude this
from a live broadcast

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.285
scenario, either because it's
just going to be goofy, or

00:07:52.285 --> 00:07:55.250
just because there are privacy
concerns or whatever.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.160
RICHARD DUNN: And again, it's
not as big of a problem now

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.814
just because the apps aren't
available, they're not going

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:02.430
to show up on the recording.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:07.220
But I think that's obviously a
place that we want to get to.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.480
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: I think one
of the things that we need to

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.490
start evolving towards when
we're talking about the

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.600
integration of apps and On Air
is a way for some of the apps

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.700
to be able to control, for the
person who owns the On Air

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.680
account to be able to control
the recording in User.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.630
RICHARD DUNN: Right.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.430
So-- go ahead.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.920
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: So for now
for example, I know that if

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.590
that person clicks on one of the
thumbnails on the bottom,

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.244
that will be the primary stream
that's recorded, that's

00:08:36.244 --> 00:08:37.780
send out On Air.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.640
That kind of control in an
API fashion would also be

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.200
beneficial.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.050
And I'm sure there are others.

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:45.585
It's that sort of thing.

00:08:45.585 --> 00:08:46.750
RICHARD DUNN: Right.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.600
So as I said, we definitely have
sort of an open project

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.760
to do the On Air stuff.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.540
And there is definitely a plan
to expose the sort of

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.340
privileges that the
broadcaster has--

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.560
like I think [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
and that kind of thing--

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.770
as an API so that people
can write--

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:11.010
I mean, ideally, we will want
people to be able to write an

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.140
extension or whatever that's
a better version of the

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.710
broadcast controls.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.640
And that extension would be
aware that, hey, this person

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.930
is the broadcaster and I
can actually do this.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.820
And if they're not the
broadcaster and they try to do

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.390
is, it'll just fail on them.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.080
But we definitely want to expose
that, and we would just

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.250
expose that in the way of,
there'll obviously be a call

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.290
that's like, is this person
the broadcaster?

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.170
And if they are, you have
all these other calls

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.876
available to you.

00:09:40.876 --> 00:09:43.870
JONATHAN: And I would say that
as you guys are thinking about

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.045
how that would work, as
developers and designers and

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:49.040
that, the feedback
to us directly.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.280
You do already.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.900
And anybody who's watching this
live or the according,

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.240
send it our way, both to Jenny
and I and the rest of the

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.640
team, and we can double
that up and help out

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.095
with the API side.

00:10:03.095 --> 00:10:06.041
JENNIE MURPHY: Definitely.

00:10:06.041 --> 00:10:07.050
JASON SALAS: OK.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.370
Well, I have another question,
if I may, for Richard.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:14.480
And actually, for all of
you, including Allen.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.900
One of my favorite examples is
the very excellent demo that

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.550
Jonathan has actually showed
many times live in his

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.130
presentations.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.530
The one where you have the
little avatars of each

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.940
participant, and the
he goes around.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.450
Like the initial version of
that, I think Wolff may have

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.930
written it specifically.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.830
But takes a drink or dances
around, you know,

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:33.570
unwraps a candy bar.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.850
And the most recent one was
flies and gets out of there to

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.700
actually get down to
South by Southwest.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.140
And Jonathan, you actually
mentioned that there was,

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.690
because it's built in flash,
that there was a

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.240
communications bridge that
was very easy to do.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.930
Again, because what I'm looking
at doing right now is

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:53.890
hopefully trying to integrate
Netflix, which I believe for

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.550
most people is based
on Silverlight.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.600
So do you know?

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.140
Because I'm just ignorant
of that thing.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.260
Do you know if there is a
Flashlight bridge that we use

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.112
to communicate with Silverlight
applications?

00:11:04.112 --> 00:11:04.930
JONATHAN: Yeah.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:10.130
So in Flash there's a series
of methods that's called

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:10.740
External Interface.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.220
So it allows you to call
JavaScript externally, and

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:18.450
there's a way to do the reverse
from Flash to pass

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.770
that back up.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.440
Silverlight has a similar API.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.510
I don't know it--

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:24.460
I've never programmed
Silverlight.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.170
But I know if you Google
external interface

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.250
Silverlight, you'll find
the right path.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.270
Probably through Stack Overflow,
if I were to guess.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:35.110
And I could also send you
that after the show.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.110
JASON SALAS: All right.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.610
Excellent.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:37.840
Thank you.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.235
JONATHAN: No problem.

00:11:42.081 --> 00:11:42.810
JENNIE MURPHY: Cool.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.260
So are there any more, any other
questions for people

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.910
currently present?

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.710
Otherwise, I'll start going to
the comments feeds and we'll

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:53.060
answer some more app questions
from the passive audience who

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.750
are watching us on YouTube
or on Google+.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.220
JASON SALAS: Well, if I--

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.030
JONATHAN: Yeah, go ahead.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.590
JASON SALAS: I'm sorry.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.870
I'm just going to say, if I
could just be a motor mouth

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.040
for just 10 more seconds.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.190
One other concern I had, and
it's kind of a minor one, was,

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.920
because I've done some HTML 5
work as far as video game

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.390
development.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.100
And developers have in
that space is kind

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.530
of a concern for--

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.310
because now we can actually
list our applications and

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.380
extensions in the Chrome
web store.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.460
And for those people that
actually want to maybe

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.830
commercialize this, is there a
way as developers where we

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.820
could actually maybe obfuscate
the code that we ultimately

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.810
write so that it won't be so
easy to just go in and look

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.360
through and see what
we're doing.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.620
Or in some way actually lock
down the logic just so it's

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.565
not so easy to reverse engineer
what we're doing.

00:12:39.565 --> 00:12:41.230
RICHARD DUNN: Right.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.200
I mean, there's a variety of
ways to compile and in some

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.990
sense JavaScript.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.130
Obviously, Google's Closure
stuff has ways

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:51.830
to compile it down.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.960
Like if you look at the actual
Hangouts code, if you were

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.475
really into it, you could
probably figure out what it

00:12:58.475 --> 00:13:00.475
was doing, but it
just makes it--

00:13:00.475 --> 00:13:04.580
it increases that bar
so much further.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.530
In general, we haven't been
facing that situation because

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:11.080
the apps that we've been writing
are sort of like we'd

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.340
like you to see them and
how we do things.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.430
But there are definitely
solutions

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.840
that compile it down.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.440
JONATHAN: I'd add to that.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.560
Closure Compile is great.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.840
We use it across Google.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.280
There's a recent addition to
Chrome which makes using that

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.990
not only better for
a developer, but

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.080
also still the same.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.260
It's called Source Maps.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.510
And what that does is it
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] your

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.340
JavaScript code--

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.180
it obfuscates it and tries to
reduce the complexity of it--

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.710
and then it also spits out this
file called Source Map.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.110
It's sort of like your
Rosetta Stone for

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.470
your obfuscated code.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.480
So all you have to do is plug
that into Chrome, and then

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.370
your code gets cleaned
up and legible again.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:53.915
RICHARD DUNN: Yeah.

00:13:53.915 --> 00:13:54.660
Un-obfuscated.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.660
So if you have access to the
Source Map, actually it looks

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.314
clean to you.

00:14:00.314 --> 00:14:03.647
JONATHAN: So that's a super
powerful tool-- really want to

00:14:03.647 --> 00:14:05.830
try to develop it.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:06.970
JASON SALAS: Excellent.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.990
And I was actually thinking more
from the standpoint of

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.720
people who might use apps that
write, not necessarily because

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.780
I want to mangle my own code
just so people won't be able

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.100
to reverse engineer it.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.080
I'm just thinking, you know,
how easy would it be for

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.223
somebody to go in there
and actually pick

00:14:20.223 --> 00:14:21.120
up on what I'm doing.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.810
Because yeah, like you guys,
right now, it's a great

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:25.996
learning tool.

00:14:25.996 --> 00:14:28.730
JONATHAN: So the two things
I will say about game

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:33.560
development, it's a little bit
tricky because if you're

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.710
building a web app that people
want to use as a utility,

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.135
they're not going
to hack around.

00:14:38.135 --> 00:14:42.130
But in games, there's Murphy's
law that says they will hack

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.180
the game to try to get
a better score.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:50.160
There's a very long and detailed
science of how to

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.880
prevent that, with Sphinx
and using servers,

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.610
and things like that.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:59.000
So it's not just obfuscating
your code, but also trying to

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.480
ensure truthfulness in the state
of your applications.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.270
So that's where using a
server-side back end to store

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:11.930
that and keep that truthy, as
well as obfuscated the data

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.120
over the wire and things
like that.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.101
So just an extra tip.

00:15:17.101 --> 00:15:18.445
JASON SALAS: Thank you.

00:15:18.445 --> 00:15:19.695
JONATHAN: No problem.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.815
JENNIE MURPHY: Okey doke.

00:15:23.815 --> 00:15:27.110
I'm going to pull a question
from the common stream now.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.740
So Tim actually asks
a few questions.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.700
I'll read them one at
a time, we'll field

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.710
them one at a time.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:38.990
So first she asks, "I have
Hangouts On Air, plus I have

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.280
streaming to YouTube capability
and I would like to

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.920
ask questions live.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.420
Here's my question--

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.980
when will the chat stream be
incorporated into Hangout so

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.560
that it can be monitored
within the Hangout?"

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.930
I'm assuming she's asking about
the YouTube chat stream.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.940
"Also, is there a plan to
incorporate the chat--" oh,

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:58.460
there it is--

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.970
"is there a plan to incorporate
the chat from

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:03.295
YouTube too so it can be managed
from the Hangout On

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:04.380
Air."

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.930
So I guess what she's asking is,
right now there's a whole

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.320
bunch of different conversation
channels

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.000
potentially for a Hangout On
Air, like the Hangout On Air

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.120
you might be watching
right now.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.250
Are there any plans to kind
of coalesce those

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.500
communication channels?

00:16:20.425 --> 00:16:23.060
RICHARD DUNN: So, sorry.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.110
You were talking about
the YouTube chat?

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.323
JONATHAN: So I think her
question is, you know, I start

00:16:28.323 --> 00:16:31.130
an On Air and there's a post
and people comment on that

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.590
post. I'd like to see those
comments inside of the chat.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.820
Also, I have a YouTube live and
there's comments there.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.660
People will read those folks,
there's comments there.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:41.880
It's hard [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.480
in these multiple interface.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.100
RICHARD DUNN: Got it, OK.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:52.855
Yeah, I mean, in terms of the
post thing, putting it into

00:16:52.855 --> 00:16:56.690
the chat in a Hangout is sort
of a delicate topic.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.760
We have talked in the past about
doing a write interface

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.750
to the chat.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:07.550
Because things like maintaining
the event history

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.470
of an app or whatever, like,
so-and-so changed the YouTube

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.849
video to something.

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:16.829
Getting read access to the chat
is super sensitive in

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.160
terms of privacy issues.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.720
The other thing that people I
think are worried about this

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:27.089
is sort filling up that chat
with useless stuff.

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:30.410
But we would definitely like
to find a way to let apps

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:31.400
write into it.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.680
And I think if you can let
apps write into the chat

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.300
stream, then whatever the
app can access in

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.120
terms the Google Post--

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.200
the Comment Tracker would be
an example here, right?

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.200
Where it knows the post, it can
access those comments, and

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.340
it could put them
into the chat.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.540
And then I assume there's a
YouTube API for grabbing the

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.870
comments around a particular
video.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.930
And then it's really just
an implementation issue.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:00.190
So I think the takeaway from
that was is API-wise, we

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:04.326
really do need to find a way
to integrate that into the

00:18:04.326 --> 00:18:07.850
chat stream or have a separate
stream that's like app events

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:10.920
and that kind of thing that
people can follow.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.900
JONATHAN: And so for anybody
who's not familiar with

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.860
Comment Tracker, that was a
Hangout extension that was

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.530
built by Gerwin Sturm.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:21.025
It allows you to grab any posts
on Google Plus, paste

00:18:21.025 --> 00:18:25.560
the URL for that post into the
sidebar extension, and it will

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.740
actually pull in all
the comments.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.080
So in this particular Hangout,
if you wanted to track the

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.540
post, you could follow along and
pull in those questions.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.680
And it's one of the many Hangout
apps that we have

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.016
built by third parties.

00:18:39.016 --> 00:18:44.860
JENNIE MURPHY: We have some
other questions that are not

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.860
directly related to
the Hangouts API.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.520
They're more Hangouts in
general questions.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.205
Reload.

00:18:52.205 --> 00:18:55.395
For example, there's
one question.

00:18:55.395 --> 00:18:59.670
"When will Hangouts On Air
come to Android?" Which I

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:03.240
guess is a question about
running a Hangout On Air from

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.490
a mobile device.

00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:11.710
RICHARD DUNN: That is an
interesting question.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:16.860
I don't actually know how tough
that would be to do.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.640
JONATHAN: Yeah.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.870
I think part of the answer is
that won't happen until

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.680
Hangouts On Air gets
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.350
And if at that point, if
it's feasible, that's

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.950
something to look at.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:33.790
But there's no plans
as far as we know.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.910
And that's a great
idea, right?

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:37.170
JENNIE MURPHY: That's
a cool idea.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.260
RICHARD DUNN: I think in general
we'd like to make the

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.350
mobile experience as
rich as possible.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:47.320
And so being able to support
all that is definitely

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.782
something we'd like
to work on.

00:19:49.782 --> 00:19:51.460
JENNIE MURPHY: Cool.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.710
So next up--

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:53.462
JASON SALAS: Maybe.

00:19:53.462 --> 00:19:54.938
JENNIE MURPHY: Sorry?

00:19:54.938 --> 00:19:57.568
JASON SALAS: You mean
as a participant?

00:19:57.568 --> 00:19:59.100
RICHARD DUNN: Sorry, you
broke up a little

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.060
in the middle there.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.925
What did you say?

00:20:01.925 --> 00:20:02.700
JASON SALAS: Oh, did I?

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.010
I'm sorry about that.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.380
Maybe the person is asking
as a participant.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.470
Because I'm fortunate enough
to have Hangouts On Air

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:12.055
access, but when my friends
invite me with other Hangouts,

00:20:12.055 --> 00:20:15.540
other users invite me to
Hangouts, if they're going on

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.960
the air, then if I check it on
one of my mobile devices, it

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.800
says, this is not supported,
obviously, by mobile devices.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.510
So maybe that person's even
thinking, can I at least jump

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:29.480
in, if not as a recorder, then
just as a contributor.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.440
RICHARD DUNN: Yeah, I mean,
that's something definitely

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.196
for me to check with
the On Air team.

00:20:34.196 --> 00:20:35.810
It's a separate team
than I am.

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.700
But I'm actually a little
surprised that you can't joint

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.140
as just as a--

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.580
but that seems like it would
be a much easier task to

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.830
accomplish.

00:20:49.156 --> 00:20:50.120
JENNIE MURPHY: Okey-doke.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.940
So I have a question
from Robert Pitt.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.170
"When will the OAuth
token be easily

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.860
accessible within the API?

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:03.010
Right now, users authorize the
applications but there is no

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.646
method to get the access
token within the code."

00:21:06.646 --> 00:21:10.560
RICHARD DUNN: So Jonathan, I
thought Wolff published a

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.220
sample out that was
showing you how to

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:14.910
get the OAuth token.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:15.560
JONATHAN: Yeah.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.020
So with the current
implementation, they authorize

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.030
it and then you can use the
JavaScript client library to

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.470
access that token.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:31.335
It is part of our Hangout
experiments, which is a

00:21:31.335 --> 00:21:32.325
co-depository.

00:21:32.325 --> 00:21:35.090
I don't know if we've linked
to it from the developer's

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:38.750
site just yet, but it's easily
available, and I think I've

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:44.140
even demoed that three
Office Hours ago.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.100
If not, we can post that link
to the article on describing

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:47.900
how to use it.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.330
It works well.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:54.170
We have I think, for example,
Ace's Poker is

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.430
using it in their app.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:00.430
And that lets you use the Google
APIs and the Google+

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:05.601
and every other authenticate
API under the Google stack.

00:22:05.601 --> 00:22:06.155
RICHARD DUNN: Yeah.

00:22:06.155 --> 00:22:10.850
I mean, I think we should
definitely hook that up to the

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.456
developer's side if possible.

00:22:13.456 --> 00:22:14.360
JONATHAN: Yeah.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.070
And we are looking at ways to
streamline that even further

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.691
and make it a better developer
experience.

00:22:20.691 --> 00:22:23.560
JENNIE MURPHY: But in the
meantime, we'll grab that

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:27.410
article from Wolff, and I will
have to the show notes near

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:28.822
this question.

00:22:28.822 --> 00:22:30.920
So we have another way for
people to find it.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.630
Great.

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:38.120
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: I've got a
follow up question on one of

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.870
the mobile questions
from earlier.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.630
What kind of plans are in
progress for having Hangout

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:49.350
apps available through
the mobile clients?

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.640
RICHARD DUNN: So we've
definitely thought about it,

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.300
and it actually turns out to
be something of a hard

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.370
problem, just because there's
not a lot of support for

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:03.750
JavaScript in the sort of
mobile native apps.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:10.640
And it's really hard to get
that communication going.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.270
So there are some plans to look
at it from a different

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.140
way, but nothing that
I think is going to

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.228
come out anytime soon.

00:23:19.228 --> 00:23:20.495
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: That's
interesting, because there's a

00:23:20.495 --> 00:23:23.530
lot of stuff on mobile
that's being done

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.580
with a WebKit window.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.290
RICHARD DUNN: Right.

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:31.060
So from my understanding,
it's the communication.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.900
It's the communication that
seems to be the problem.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:38.820
So displaying that is fine, but
the communication across

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:43.490
that WebKit window to the
actual native app is--

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:48.110
and we have a fairly rich API
that relies on a lot of that

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:50.430
communication.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:55.270
We might be able to do a
scaled-down version of it, but

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.370
that was my understanding
of sort of the technical

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.750
difficulty there.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.000
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: OK, thanks.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:11.450
JONATHAN: And I will add that
the WebKit child iframe across

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.045
different operating systems, as
well as different versions

00:24:14.045 --> 00:24:16.870
of operating systems,
is not consistent.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.636
Very inconsistent.

00:24:19.636 --> 00:24:23.540
RICHARD DUNN: As I said, as a
general rule, we're trying to

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.640
make the mobile experience as
rich as responsible, and we

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:31.990
certainly have that on our to-do
list. It's just given

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:34.980
the technical constraints and
then resource constraints,

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.340
it's probably going
to be a while.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.650
JENNIE MURPHY: Great.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.800
So I'm not seeing any other
Hangouts API-related

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.250
questions, but I am seeing a
couple questions about the

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:50.630
show and the REST API.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:54.270
So I'll field these really
quickly while we wait for

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:56.690
those of you out there to ask
us some more questions about

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.360
the Hangouts API.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:03.090
So Fabio asks, "is it possible
to search for two or more

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:07.620
hashtags using the
activities.search method?"

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:11.700
And actually, I just did some
experimentation with it, and I

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.220
got the same results you did.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.260
Went searching for multiple
hashtags, the results just did

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.850
full text search using
the hashtags.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:21.020
So right now it appears it'll
only except one hashtag as

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:26.120
well as any number of full
text search parameters.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.160
I'm a little surprised by that,
so I'll be following up,

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.000
I'll be filing that as a bug.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.150
And well, I'll follow up
with you later on that.

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:38.810
So I would expect
that to work.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:40.060
Thanks for bringing that
to our attention.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:53.284
And also, Nicolo asks, "Will we
be treated to PHP for list

00:25:53.284 --> 00:25:54.580
activities?"

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:58.110
I'm assuming you're referring
to the JavaScript demo I did

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:02.280
last session showing you how to
use the JavaScript APIs and

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.820
the JavaScript client library
to access your activities.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.510
Not going to be doing
that in PHP today.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:12.240
We're focusing on Hangout APIs,
but in a future week

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.530
we'll be talking about that.

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.160
So thanks for your patience.

00:26:18.824 --> 00:26:20.430
JASON SALAS: May I ask
another question?

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.052
JONATHAN: Yeah, please.

00:26:23.052 --> 00:26:26.530
JASON SALAS: I was wondering--
and this may or may not be

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:31.220
anything, and I think
maybe goes more to

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.740
the Core Rest API.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.460
And I don't believe it exists
right now, but would we be

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:45.090
able to actually set what level
of invitee would be able

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.270
to get either the Hangout app or
like the invite to actually

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.090
use that app.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.290
This is a weird way
of framing it.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:52.550
I guess I've got to rephrase.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:57.150
Would I be able to only invite
non-public circles or

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:58.940
non-extended circles
to use an app?

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:04.740
Like, say, if you just wanted
to do it for a super private

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.880
implementation, or only invite
specific non-public circles or

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.060
individual users.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.170
RICHARD DUNN: So I'd--

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.320
JASON SALAS: Could probably
just do it manually.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.380
RICHARD DUNN: I guess I'm
confused as to why.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.680
I mean, are there concerns above
and beyond creating a

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.560
Hangout with this app and
then only inviting

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.132
those select few people?

00:27:27.132 --> 00:27:29.890
JASON SALAS: Yeah.

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:32.840
Because, again, going back to
what I was trying to do with

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.270
Netflix initially, I was saying
it's like, OK, well, I

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.470
only want to invite certain
people and I don't want to

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:42.500
open it up to the greater
internet in general.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.790
So can I exclude this from
ever being a service that

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:47.850
people would invite
to the public?

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:49.600
And then I just kind
of came around.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.620
I was like, you know
what, I shouldn't

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.330
even bother with that.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.260
Just make sure that everybody
using it is a subscriber of

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.410
that service, and that takes
care of that problem.

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:58.850
But just going back,
would it ever be

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:00.255
possible just to restrict?

00:28:00.255 --> 00:28:01.700
JONATHAN: There's also
another solution.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:05.340
If you don't publish this app,
if you keep it private and add

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.190
individuals as team members of
the application, they'll still

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.830
be able [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.770
application it will be
publicly available.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.950
So that might be another
solution, especially if this

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:18.160
is a small app for your team
or your school or something

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.430
you're in development.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:20.950
That's the right route.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:21.710
JASON SALAS: OK.

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:22.544
Thank you.

00:28:22.544 --> 00:28:24.980
JENNIE MURPHY: Yeah.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.180
If any of you did Hangout app
development before the

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.520
release, that's actually the
original solution for

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.314
collaborating on the
[INAUDIBLE].

00:28:31.314 --> 00:28:33.690
RICHARD DUNN: And I might add
something, which is that we're

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:36.400
trying to--

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.270
we're going to try to remove
this distinction between sort

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:42.880
of public Hangouts and then be
the developer sandbox and

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.920
actually try to roll that
into the main thing.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.630
So that you can join a Hangout
in developer mode if you are

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:51.090
developer and look at your
developed apps and private

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:54.060
apps and things like that, but
that it's not necessarily a

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:58.405
separate Hangout, and so you
could invite other people to

00:28:58.405 --> 00:28:58.920
the hang out.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.780
They wouldn't necessarily be
able to see your private apps.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.520
But just try to integrate that
experience and not have this

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.660
sort of separate, sand-boxed
environment.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.870
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:11.750
RICHARD DUNN: Oh, go ahead.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.060
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: No, I was
going to say, Jason, that way

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.990
I deal with that right now
is for all of my apps I

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.290
essentially have two projects.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.310
One is the release project
and one is

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.950
the development project.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:26.140
And I either don't invite or on
a very limited basis invite

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:30.140
people into the Hangout while
I'm doing development.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.270
So if you catch me at the right
time, you'll see my

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:35.950
caption, test-- app running.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:38.990
And for the most you won't.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:43.400
JONATHAN: You can also do user
authentication on top of your

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.380
application.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:48.540
So if you have an app engine
or an app running, you can

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:51.410
look at the login user and just
show a white screen, or

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:54.040
you don't have access to it
if they're not authorized.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:54.780
RICHARD DUNN: Right.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:59.120
Because you can use essentially
their Google Plus

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.698
ID to uniquely identify them.

00:30:02.698 --> 00:30:03.948
JONATHAN: Yep.

00:30:09.055 --> 00:30:10.040
JENNIE MURPHY: Cool.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.590
So I have a more general
Hangouts

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.070
question, for you, Jonathan.

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.675
JONATHAN: All really?

00:30:13.675 --> 00:30:16.880
JENNIE MURPHY: Matthew Books
asks, "how do you host a

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.160
Hangout with a simulcast
on YouTube?"

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.910
JONATHAN: So what we're in right
now is a Hangouts On

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.890
Air, and that is a product
that has been in limited

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:28.640
availability as we're building
out the infrastructure and the

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.570
technology.

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:32.910
And what that allows you to do
is take a regular Hangout,

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:35.730
flip a bit, and we automatically
publish that to

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:38.420
Google+ as a YouTube livestream,
and it lives on

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.600
youtube.com.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.480
That feature is not yet
generally available, but we're

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.250
planning on rolling out soon.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:50.350
If you have more specific
questions, there's an FAQ on

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:53.720
the help site that talks a
little bit more about that.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.330
And just follow along
when that becomes

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:59.016
more readily available.

00:30:59.016 --> 00:31:01.244
JENNIE MURPHY: Great.

00:31:01.244 --> 00:31:05.430
It looks like that's all we have
on the feed for today.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.940
So does anyone who's joined us
have anything else you'd like

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:09.520
to discuss?

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.320
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Yeah.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.880
I actually had a general
question.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.080
In some ways it's
kind of basic.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.470
From reading the API, if I
remember correctly, getting

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:22.190
the list of users in the
Hangout, although you do get a

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.670
list of people, anyone
who's not running

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:27.405
your app doesn't get--

00:31:27.405 --> 00:31:30.530
anyone who's not running your
app just shows up as there,

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.640
but with no information
at all about them.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.890
RICHARD DUNN: Right.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.680
So that was actually originally
a policy decision,

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.120
sort of from a privacy
perspective.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.570
And I think this is something
that came out

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.080
of the public lunch.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.470
There are definitely use cases
for having that stuff.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:51.180
So I think the volume
app is a good

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.170
indication of that, right?

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:55.140
It's like, you shouldn't have to
have everyone run this app,

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:58.140
but I should be able to find
out this information.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.850
I think as of today
we're actually

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:02.200
revisiting that decision.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.310
And so you should expect
to see that opened up.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:06.190
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: OK.

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:10.700
And it seems to me there's some
pieces of information

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.010
that might be useful.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:16.850
So even if I don't have, for
example, their ID number, it

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.418
might still be useful to at
least have their name so I

00:32:19.418 --> 00:32:20.745
know who we are.

00:32:20.745 --> 00:32:24.120
RICHARD DUNN: So I think we're
definitely comfortable with

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:28.280
doing the name and the image,
because they're part of that.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.360
And I think the reality is that
that will probably mean

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.280
the ID will be public.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.900
Because if you have a name and
an image, you're going to be

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.930
able to find their ID.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:38.330
Right?

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:42.673
I mean, we're definitely
going to make the name

00:32:42.673 --> 00:32:44.590
and the image public.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:47.550
And that should be
coming very soon.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.335
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Let me
also ask a question.

00:32:49.335 --> 00:32:51.190
This may be for--

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:55.280
I'm not sure if this is great
for you or for the team.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:59.280
What are current best
practices on storing

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.170
configuration information
long term?

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:03.760
It's something I've been
thinking about a lot for the

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.425
past week or so.

00:33:04.425 --> 00:33:07.910
And I've got assorted ideas,
and all of them have their

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:08.555
pluses and minuses.

00:33:08.555 --> 00:33:11.000
So I'm curious what current
suggestions for best

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:11.970
practice would be.

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:15.190
JONATHAN: So maybe you can
elaborate on the type of

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:16.050
configuration.

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:17.780
Give an example of what kind
of data you're storing, and

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.250
then we could [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.190
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Pretty much
what I'm thinking of at this

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:27.330
point is just storing
a JSON object.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.530
Nothing large, extremely tiny,
probably something that could

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:35.460
fit into a cookie or into a
local storage, but for various

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.290
reasons I don't want
to put it in there.

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:40.985
So we're talking something
that's probably 1k or less.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.685
Some of it may or may not be
somewhat sensitive, so I want

00:33:47.685 --> 00:33:50.070
to at least be able to assure
the person who's doing the

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:55.580
configuration that I as the
app developer won't have

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.290
access to it.

00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:00.520
JONATHAN: So can you give me
an example of two bits of

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.900
data, one sensitive, one not
sensitive, and then I can

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.020
maybe think a little
bit more about it.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:06.955
I have some options there.

00:34:06.955 --> 00:34:07.550
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Yeah.

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:08.820
Using, for example,
a caption app.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.639
You know, my caption app.

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:15.719
A non-sensitive one would just
be, predefine a bunch of

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:19.889
caption configurations and be
able to quickly switch between

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:23.460
them without having to change
the settings every time.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:27.760
Or giving my preferential colors
so those show up at the

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.590
top of the list. Those
would be examples of

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:32.409
non-sensitive stuff.

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:34.560
More sensitive stuff is, in
some cases the captions

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.620
themselves could be.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.850
Or if I'm using Hangouts
to share pictures--

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:43.480
what the references to those
pictures might be.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.320
The sensitive one is probably
not so much--

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.290
it's not as fully formed, but
I can see apps where in the

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:52.420
future, I would be storing more
sensitive information in

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:57.440
there that, even if it's not
critically private, I don't

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.540
want the person thinking,
hey, wait a minute--

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.560
what other information does
this person have about me?

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.650
JONATHAN: So you mentioned
a few good ones.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:07.960
Obviously, cookie
storage is one.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.370
Local storage is another.

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:11.860
There's also session storage,
which gets deleted after the

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.440
session is over, which is very
similar to local storage in

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.170
that sense.

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:20.230
There is of course server side
storage, and you can persist

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:24.950
that in your database and,
with your privacy policy,

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:28.100
promise the user that you're
going to encrypt that or

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.100
delete it every 24 hours
or something like that.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:34.730
In terms of encryption, both
in the local storage or

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:36.990
browser-based storage, as well
as server side storage,

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:40.180
there's a couple of interesting
techniques.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.240
Hashing data is one.

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.420
That's simple enough, especially
if you hash the

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.750
values of the JSON.

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:53.530
There's also JSON web tokens, or
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], which is

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:57.570
basically encrypted JSON
with a standard.

00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:00.320
We use that in a few places like
in-an-app payments and

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.780
things like that.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:07.710
If you really want the data
stored client side and to

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:11.240
persisted across sessions,
really the only viable

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:15.120
solution I think is encrypted
local storage.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.640
Maybe JOT is one solution
for you for that.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.930
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: OK.

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:25.640
Let me raise the possibility
that this be a possible API

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.290
extension in the future, being
able to provide a small chunk

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:30.575
of configuration space.

00:36:30.575 --> 00:36:31.200
RICHARD DUNN: Yeah.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.290
So we have definitely thought
about providing some sort of

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:37.540
persistent storage.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:45.810
I think in general we're trying,
when it comes to data,

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.420
we're trying to provide sort of
a basic API that will work

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.310
for most small applications.

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:53.010
And then anyone that wants to
write something big rolls

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.460
their own, and obviously
persistence is one of those

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.200
things that is an issue.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.010
I think mostly we haven't
addressed it yet because it's

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:02.905
unclear, like, should this
be charged to the user?

00:37:02.905 --> 00:37:04.410
Should this be charged
to the app?

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:07.150
That kind of thing.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:10.880
How do we resolve that
piece of it?

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.200
But it's definitely on
the sort of medium

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.850
to long term goals.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:18.540
In the meantime, obviously,
there's all these solutions

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.410
that Jonathan has
talked about.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:27.950
JONATHAN: And just to touch on
the server side piece, if it's

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:31.940
something that the user needs
to change often, obviously,

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:35.310
App Engine and Think Query and
the different types of ways to

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:36.920
persist data is one solution.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.430
If it's a configuration that
doesn't change often--

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:43.700
let's say a start up or their
profile information--

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.636
that could be something that's
even stored on Google Cloud

00:37:45.636 --> 00:37:49.900
Storage as a simple JSON file.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:53.270
All that stuff can be encrypted
over the wire as

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.810
well as where you store it.

00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:57.060
So that's another thing
to look at.

00:38:00.941 --> 00:38:03.940
JASON SALAS: And I just had
a quick two-part question.

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:07.570
And maybe this is more
promotional than anything.

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:11.720
So real fast double-edged sword
here, one, have you

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.850
heard about any app developers
building anything that

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:16.470
facilitate in-app payment?

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:19.200
Not necessarily to use the app,
but actually running the

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.420
app where you could facilitate
payment transactions?

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.410
And then two, even though we've
only been out for a few

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:28.580
weeks as far as the Hangout API
being officially in a 1.0

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.550
release, have you heard anybody
writing any books

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:33.505
about the topic?

00:38:33.505 --> 00:38:36.590
JONATHAN: So in terms of
charging, before we had

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:40.040
Hangout apps, there was
ChefHangouts, I believe.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:44.080
It's a service that allows
people to pay to

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:44.650
learn how to cook.

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:46.610
And they're doing some very
interesting things.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:47.860
I know they're looking
at Hangout apps.

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:55.860
I believe some of the initial
apps that came out with the

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:58.895
launch either have payments
already or

00:38:58.895 --> 00:39:00.540
are looking to payments.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:04.420
Obviously, Google has
in-app payments.

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.640
We don't have a sample working
with it, but it should be

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.520
feasible to work.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.020
And it's probably a good
solution, especially with the

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:12.630
price point.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:17.415
RICHARD DUNN: So actually, our
PM's previous project was

00:39:17.415 --> 00:39:18.085
in-app payments.

00:39:18.085 --> 00:39:22.645
So we should probably get
him on that task.

00:39:22.645 --> 00:39:24.650
JONATHAN: But yeah,
it should work.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:28.250
And obviously, because
it's so new,

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:29.390
nobody's written any books.

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:31.340
And I don't know of anybody
who's writing a book

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:34.862
specifically about payments
in Hangouts.

00:39:34.862 --> 00:39:38.400
JASON SALAS: Or just books about
Hangout apps in general.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.140
I would assume that there's a
ton of people just lining up

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:45.201
to say, hey, I can do a really
good title on that.

00:39:45.201 --> 00:39:48.785
I mean, it's a fascinating
topic to write a book on.

00:39:48.785 --> 00:39:51.460
JONATHAN: And it is a
fascinating target, so it's

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:55.810
probably of the reasons why it
hasn't been offered yet.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:56.710
But it definitely--

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.800
Google+ in general and
on the platform.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.700
There's a lot of different
things and new approaches to

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.670
social web and social platforms.
So I think it would

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:05.430
make a [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:07.030
RICHARD DUNN: Maybe I'll cut out
early and go write a book.

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:13.170
JONATHAN: Or you can
do it in Google

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:15.372
Docs and do it a Hangout.

00:40:15.372 --> 00:40:16.760
JASON SALAS: There you go.

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.625
And then you can use in-app
payment and actually charge

00:40:18.625 --> 00:40:19.816
people inside the [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:19.816 --> 00:40:23.040
JONATHAN: Well, with the launch
of Google Drive, just

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:23.620
to sign up.

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:26.840
We partnered with Lulu, so you
can do publishing straight

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.830
from Google Docs.

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:29.823
JASON SALAS: There you go.

00:40:29.823 --> 00:40:31.925
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:40:31.925 --> 00:40:33.350
RICHARD DUNN: I see Allen
made a comment

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:35.076
about GDrive, as well.

00:40:35.076 --> 00:40:36.326
JONATHAN: Great.

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.904
RICHARD DUNN: I would love to
see a Hangout app, actually,

00:40:42.904 --> 00:40:46.140
that did use the GDrive API.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.270
So that would be great.

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:50.975
Let's do it.

00:40:50.975 --> 00:40:54.080
JONATHAN: I actually did see
some questions before Google

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.830
Drive came out about
the DocList API.

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:00.760
And just to make a quick
comment, DocList API is not

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:06.290
part of the Google API stack,
so it cannot work with our

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:08.090
Google client APIs.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:12.650
But it is using the old GData
implementation, which has

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:15.240
plenty of sample
code and APIs.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.810
And I believe there's
even a JavaScript

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.650
client library for GData.

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:25.640
So you could use it straight
in the Hangout Apps.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.890
JASON SALAS: Excellent.

00:41:30.856 --> 00:41:32.650
JENNIE MURPHY: Well, was there
any other questions?

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:34.040
I don't see anything
else in the feed?

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.805
We're getting close to then end,
our scheduled end time.

00:41:38.805 --> 00:41:41.930
So if you have any questions,
speak now or wait until the

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:44.488
next session.

00:41:44.488 --> 00:41:45.640
Okey-doke.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.670
So I think we're going to
call it a day, then.

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:51.530
So thanks everyone who joined
us, and everyone who commented

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:54.860
on the thread and participated
in other ways.

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.950
And that's it.

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:59.080
So we're going to
be taking off.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:41:59.380
See you later.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:41:59.838
JASON SALAS: All right.

00:41:59.838 --> 00:42:00.075
Thank you, guys.

00:42:00.075 --> 00:42:00.870
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Thanks.

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:02.120
RICHARD DUNN: Bye bye.
