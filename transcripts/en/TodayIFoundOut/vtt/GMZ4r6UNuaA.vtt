00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:18.869
Wahlberg, born the youngest of nine children
all living in a three bedroom apartment, dropped

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.430
out of school around the age of fourteen and
joined a gang.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.800
During this time, he was reportedly in trouble
with the law around 20-25 times, for dealing

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.550
drugs and various other offenses.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.480
He also claims he became addicted to cocaine
during this period.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.260
Things came to a head when he was 16 years
old and he attacked two Vietnamese men without

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.260
provocation.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.010
He attacked the first with a stick and he
punched the second, permanently blinding him

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.010
in the process.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.880
The official record of the event as recorded
by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Superior

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.180
Court is as follows:

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.180
Count I:

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.750
At approximately 9:00 p.m. on April 8, 1988,
Thanh Lam, a Vietnamese adult male who resides

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.570
in Dorchester, traveled by car to 998 Dorchester
Avenue, Dorchester, Massachusetts.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.780
At 998 Dorchester Avenue, Thanh Lam left his
car carrying two cases of beer.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.860
As he crossed the sidewalk, Mark Wahlberg
attacked Thanh Lam.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.690
Wahlberg was carrying a large wooden stick,
approximately five feet long and two to three

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.150
inches in diameter.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.330
Wahlberg approached Thanh Lam calling him
a “Vietnam fucking shit”, then hit him

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.600
over the head with the stick.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.120
Thanh Lam was knocked to the ground unconscious.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.660
The stick broke in two and was later recovered
from the scene.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.610
Thanh Lam was treated overnight at Boston
City Hospital.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.580
After police arrested Wahlberg later on the
night of April 8, 1988, Wahlberg was informed

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.460
of his rights and returned to the scene of
988 Dorchester Avenue.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.920
In the presence of two police officers, he
stated: “You don’t have to let him identify

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.830
me, I’ll tell you now that’s the mother-fucker
whose head I split open”, or words to that

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.830
effect.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.830
Count II:

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.930
As a police officer arrived at the scene of
988 Dorchester Avenue, Wahlberg and two other

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.670
youths who were with him fled up Dorchester
Avenue toward Pearl Street.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.760
Shortly after 9:00pm on April 8, 1988, Hoa
Trinh, an adult Vietnamese male who resides

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.659
in Dorchester, was standing several blocks
away from 998 Dorchester Avenue, near the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.840
corner of Dorchester Avenue and Pearl Street.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.579
Hoa Trinh was not aware of the altercation
outside of 998 Dorchester Avenue.

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:14.849
Wahlberg ran up to Hoa Trinh, put his arm
around Hoa Trinh’s shoulder and said: “Police

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.719
coming, police coming, let me hide.”

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.109
After a police cruiser passed, Wahlberg punched
Trinh in the eye, causing him to fall to the

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:21.159
ground.

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.340
Police arrived and Hoa Trinh identified Wahlberg
as the person who punched him.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.510
Wahlberg was placed under arrest and read
his rights.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.170
Thereafter, he made numerous unsolicited racial
statements about “gooks” and “slant-eyed

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.170
gooks”.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.079
After being returned to 998 Dorchester Avenue,
Wahlberg identified Thanh Lam as the person

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.310
he hit over the head with a stick.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.349
For these attacks, Wahlberg was arrested and
initially charged with attempted murder, but

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.279
it was later reduced to criminal contempt,
which carried a maximum sentence of ten years.

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:50.489
After pleading guilty, he was given a two
year sentence at the Deer Island House of

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.010
Correction in Boston.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.870
In the end, he only had to serve 45 days in
the correctional facility.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.610
Unlike most that go through such facilities,
the time he spent locked up inspired him to

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.969
try and turn his life around.

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.709
“As soon as I began that life of crime,
there was always a voice in my head telling

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.750
me I was going to end up in jail.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.290
Three of my brothers had done time.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.989
My sister went to prison so many times I lost
count.

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.109
Finally I was there, locked up with the kind
of guys I’d always wanted to be like.

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.980
Now I’d earned my stripes and I was just
like them and I realized it wasn’t what

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.050
I wanted at all.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.919
I’d ended up in the worst place I could
possibly imagine and I never wanted to go

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:24.919
back.”

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.840
He started his turn-around by reaching out
to his parish priest for guidance and support,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.310
as well as leaving the gang he was a member
of.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.519
Mark Wahlberg’s big break came thanks to
his older brother, Donnie.

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.779
Donnie Wahlberg was already famous at this
point with his success as a member of The

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:42.370
New Kids on the Block, a band Mark had initially
been a member of at the age of 13, but quit

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.079
before the group became famous.

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.819
Mark had been working as a bricklayer after
serving time when Donnie helped him form Marky

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.609
Mark and the Funky Bunch, including helping
him get a record contract and producing the

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.109
first record the group made.

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.329
The debut album Music for the People, released
in 1991 when Mark Wahlberg was 19 years old,

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.339
ended up going Platinum thanks largely to
the hit single Good Vibrations and the follow

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:01.540
up single Wildside.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.629
After his music career started to hit the
tank a couple years later, Wahlberg dropped

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.870
his Marky Mark persona and decided to take
up acting.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.790
Despite early skepticism by critics, he made
the switch successfully, with his first critical

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.829
success coming from appearing in The Basketball
Diaries, though he had a few roles before

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.120
this, most notably opposite Danny DeVito in
Renaissance Man.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.409
Since then, he has become one of the bigger
stars in Hollywood, reportedly commanding

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.800
around $12-$15 million per movie today.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.590
During his “Marky Mark” fame period, Wahlberg
famously worked for Calvin Klein as an underwear

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.590
model.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.540
Somewhat more humorously, he also put out
a workout video: Form…

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.540
Focus…

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.220
Fitness
Mark Wahlberg’s siblings are: Arthur, James,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.230
Debbie, Michelle, Paul, Tracey, Robert, and
Donnie.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.620
He also has half siblings Scott, Buddy, and
Donna who are children of his dad by another

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.620
woman.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.680
Though all in all Wahlberg has turned his
life around quite nicely, especially in recent

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.539
years where he’s been involved in numerous
charitable endeavors, particularly benefiting

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.389
underprivileged youth, he still had several
instances of violence in his post-prison,

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.509
younger years (around the “Marky Mark”
period).

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.550
For instance, when he was 21 years old, he
“viciously and repeatedly kicked the plaintiff,

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.650
Robert D. Crehan, in the face and jaw” while
a friend of his, Derk McCall, held Crehan

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.790
down on the ground.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.080
This resulted in Crehan’s jaw being broken,
as well as a claimed decrease in learning

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.080
ability.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.490
Wahlberg also famous had a fight with certain
members of Madonna’s entourage (which he

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.470
states Madonna still owes him an apology over).

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.260
He also attacked a security guard, which resulted
in him having to appear in several anti-bias

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.650
advertisements.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.139
Wahlberg states about his early life: “I’ve
made a lot of mistakes in my life and I’ve

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.139
done bad things.

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.210
But I never blamed my upbringing for that.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.470
I never behaved like a victim so that I would
have a convenient reason for victimizing others.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.450
Everything I did wrong was my own fault.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.229
I was taught the difference between right
and wrong at an early age.

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.710
I take full responsibility.”

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.300
Wahlberg was originally cast in both Ocean’s
Eleven and Brokeback Mountain, but turned

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.569
both roles down.

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:52.710
In Ocean’s Eleven, he was cast as Linus
Caldwell, but withdrew and Matt Damon was

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:53.759
cast instead.

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:59.360
In Brokeback Mountain he states he withdrew
due to being uncomfortable with the sex scenes.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.629
Wahlberg and several friends originally had
tickets to fly on United 93, one of the planes

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:07.030
hijacked by terrorists on September 11, 2001.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.120
However, they ended up deciding to instead
charter a plane to go attend a film festival

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.520
in Canada before returning to Los Angeles.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.960
Wahlberg has since stated that “If I was
on that plane with my kids, it wouldn’t

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.430
have went down like it did.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.199
There would have been a lot of blood in that
first-class cabin and then me saying, ‘OK,

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.650
we’re going to land somewhere safely, don’t
worry.'”

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.000
Obviously this didn’t go over very well
with people who lost loved ones on that plane,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.060
nor with the general public.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.219
Given Wahlberg’s apparent propensity towards
violence, even when unprovoked, the first

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:37.740
part of his claim isn’t really that far-fetched.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.520
However, the passengers of United 93 did revolt
once they realized the bomb threat the terrorists

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.129
were using to control them wasn’t likely
true.

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:48.360
They learned this after several passengers
heard of the planes that hit the twin towers

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.660
from talking to loved ones on their cell phones.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.210
Unfortunately for the passengers, though,
the terrorists at this point were obviously

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.699
the ones flying the plane.

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.330
Once the passengers had nearly broken into
the cockpit, the hijackers made the decision

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.740
to simply crash the plane, with one recorded
as saying “Is that it?

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.300
I mean, shall we put it down?” and another
responding, “Yes, pull it down.”

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.439
The pilot then rolled the plane over and began
chanting “Allāhu Akbar”, while the passengers

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:11.710
continued to fight.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.350
The official report states that at the time
of impact, the passengers were just seconds

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.009
from taking complete control.

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:20.810
So obviously Wahlberg with his temper and
fighting ability being there or not would

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.330
have made no difference as the hijackers would
have put the plane down all the same the second

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:30.530
it was apparent a passenger or group of passengers
were about to retake the aircraft.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.280
Wahlberg never returned to High School after
dropping out at the age of 14, but did eventually

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.300
get his GED.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.080
Since New Kids on the Block, Donnie Wahlberg
also took up acting, appearing in such works

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.069
as Band of Brothers, the Saw films, and The
Sixth Sense.

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:50.150
For the latter role in The Sixth Sense as
“Vincent Grey”, he had to lose 43 pounds.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.099
New Kids on the Block was formed by Maurice
Starr who held auditions in Boston with over

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:55.569
500 boys turning out.

00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:58.819
The first member selected was Donnie Wahlberg,
who subsequently convinced Starr to also add

00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:02.349
Mark to the group, along with some friends
of his.

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:05.860
New Kids on the Block actually almost never
were, as far as becoming famous.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.819
Their debut album was a flop and their second
album initially didn’t do any better.

00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:13.360
After their first album, the group could only
get gigs at school dances and the like.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.620
When their second album was released, it also
initially flopped with little interest in

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.800
their first single Please Don’t Go Girl.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.319
Finally, the label had decided to drop the
group, but at this same time a single radio

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:25.990
station in Florida had been playing the song
steadily, with it becoming one of the most

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.020
requested songs at that station.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.400
When Columbia Records learned of this, they
decided to promote the song more and things

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.790
took off from there.

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.720
Interestingly, due to their later success,
their debut album ultimately ended up selling

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.010
four million copies, despite the initial flop.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:44.920
All total, New Kids on the Block sold over
70 million albums.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.920
The original name of New Kids on the Block
was “NYNUK”, but upon signing the group,

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.440
the label, Columbia Records, told them they
needed to come up with a different name.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.580
Donnie Wahlberg also has had his share of
trouble with the law, such as being charged

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.580
with first degree arson for setting fire to
a hotel hallway in Kentucky (The Seelbach

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.580
Hotel).

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.960
The charges were later lowered and he simply
had to make a series of public service ads

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:14.690
about fire safety, as well as anti-drug and
anti-drunk driving ads.
