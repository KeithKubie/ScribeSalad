a flash bag it would have given it would

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740
a flash bag it would have given it would
 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.140
a flash bag it would have given it would
have made so much more sense I would

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150
have made so much more sense I would
 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.029
have made so much more sense I would
have been with her more yeah because it

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039
have been with her more yeah because it
 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.320
have been with her more yeah because it
would have been like okay this is what

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330
would have been like okay this is what
 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.240
would have been like okay this is what
drove her to this point and I normally

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250
drove her to this point and I normally
 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.950
drove her to this point and I normally
I'm not a huge like oh it has to be done

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960
I'm not a huge like oh it has to be done
 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.390
I'm not a huge like oh it has to be done
like a Christopher Nolan film where it's

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400
like a Christopher Nolan film where it's
 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.610
like a Christopher Nolan film where it's
backwards and out of order and a lot of

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620
backwards and out of order and a lot of
 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.590
backwards and out of order and a lot of
times if it helps yeah a lot of times

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600
times if it helps yeah a lot of times
 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.360
times if it helps yeah a lot of times
it's a cheap gimmick but in this case I

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370
it's a cheap gimmick but in this case I
 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.920
it's a cheap gimmick but in this case I
think it really would have saved this

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930
think it really would have saved this
 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.180
think it really would have saved this
season a lot because you would have been

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190
season a lot because you would have been
 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.800
season a lot because you would have been
like okay how did we get to this point

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810
like okay how did we get to this point
 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.710
like okay how did we get to this point
and then you can see the crazy decisions

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720
and then you can see the crazy decisions
 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.900
and then you can see the crazy decisions
she made and you're just like okay so

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910
she made and you're just like okay so
 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.310
she made and you're just like okay so
that's how she ended up on a beach in

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320
that's how she ended up on a beach in
 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.170
that's how she ended up on a beach in
the middle of an island and the but that

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180
the middle of an island and the but that
 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.600
the middle of an island and the but that
I mean how do we like blame the show for

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610
I mean how do we like blame the show for
 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.890
I mean how do we like blame the show for
that that's just more hate one it than

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900
that that's just more hate one it than
 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.260
that that's just more hate one it than
cool you know if they did that I think

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270
cool you know if they did that I think
 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.610
cool you know if they did that I think
it would have been a lot better because

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620
it would have been a lot better because
 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.430
it would have been a lot better because
I the linear storytelling this time

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440
I the linear storytelling this time
 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.150
I the linear storytelling this time
around because we went through season

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160
around because we went through season
 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.529
around because we went through season
one in season two I mean this has been

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539
one in season two I mean this has been
 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:59.120
one in season two I mean this has been
the biggest gripe we've had it's kind of

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130
the biggest gripe we've had it's kind of
 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.830
the biggest gripe we've had it's kind of
like I don't feel like we've progressed

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840
like I don't feel like we've progressed
 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.930
like I don't feel like we've progressed
anywhere well we might actually be I'm

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940
anywhere well we might actually be I'm
 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.760
anywhere well we might actually be I'm
like okay well now you can start from

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770
like okay well now you can start from
 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.920
like okay well now you can start from
ground again I mean I think with even

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930
ground again I mean I think with even
 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.220
ground again I mean I think with even
the fill er up fill er episodes in

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230
the fill er up fill er episodes in
 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.360
the fill er up fill er episodes in
and even Cory season one you kind of

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370
and even Cory season one you kind of
 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.820
and even Cory season one you kind of
accepted because again you know what the

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830
accepted because again you know what the
 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.680
accepted because again you know what the
big focus is you know what the big

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690
big focus is you know what the big
 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.570
big focus is you know what the big
driving force is and sometimes you know

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580
driving force is and sometimes you know
 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.490
driving force is and sometimes you know
you need a break in your filler episode

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500
you need a break in your filler episode
 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.620
you need a break in your filler episode
and here again me because the focus is

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630
and here again me because the focus is
 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.110
and here again me because the focus is
not as or at least what they're fighting

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120
not as or at least what they're fighting
 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.180
not as or at least what they're fighting
for is not as strong or not as focused

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190
for is not as strong or not as focused
 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.030
for is not as strong or not as focused
uh the filler episodes are becoming a

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040
uh the filler episodes are becoming a
 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.680
uh the filler episodes are becoming a
little bit more noticeable but I will

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690
