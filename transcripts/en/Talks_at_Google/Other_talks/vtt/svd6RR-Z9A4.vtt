[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.940
AMANDA PALMER: I loved being
the center of attention

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.330
when I was a kid,
and I still do.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.827
And sometimes it makes
wonderful things happen.

00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:17.660
Like when I convinced
the neighborhood girls

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.560
to enact an a cappella
production of "Fiddler

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.420
on the Roof" on my back porch.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.310
I played Tevya, obviously.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.530
And sometimes it made
terrible things happen,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.550
like when I wore a bra
to school Madonna-style

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.966
on the outside of my dress and
got sent to the principal's

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.850
office, and the principal
delivered a lecture

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.240
that I would absolutely kill
to have a recording of, just

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.650
to be able to use the line,
"You think you're so special,

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.920
Amanda.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.930
But you're not
actually special,"

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.055
in my techno remix of
"Creep," by Radiohead.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.400
As I moved through my life as
a street performing statue,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.020
and later, as a
musician, I started

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.060
to understand something.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.140
There's a difference between
wanting to be looked at

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.920
and wanting to be seen.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.600
When you're looked at, your
eyes can stay blissfully closed.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.440
You suck energy.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.780
You steal the spotlight.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.090
But when you're seen,
your eyes must be open

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.180
as you are seeing and
recognizing your witness.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.050
You accept energy, but
you generate energy.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.420
You create light.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.700
One is exhibitionism.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.300
The other is connection.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.960
Not everybody wants
to be looked at,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.075
but everybody wants to be seen.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.040
Following the success of my
TED Talk, Microsoft called.

00:01:49.728 --> 00:01:53.090
I don't know why I was
expecting a reaction, but-- just

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.830
crickets.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.980
OK.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.510
OK.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.050
No, it's cool, it's
cool, it's cool.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.550
Good.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.690
Fine.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.056
Microsoft called.

00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:00.818
Oooh.

00:02:00.818 --> 00:02:01.484
AUDIENCE: Ooooh.

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:05.540
AMANDA PALMER:
They were offering

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.169
to fly me to Seattle to
speak to a group of women

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.729
who worked there.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.520
Apparently a whopping 16% of
the employees at Microsoft

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.430
were female.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.976
I asked the speaker coordinator
what I would be speaking about.

00:02:19.976 --> 00:02:23.130
"Whatever you want," she said.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.060
And I started to panic.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.280
I had no idea what
to talk about.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.240
Crowd-sourcing?

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.860
Music?

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.870
Surely I could wax poetic for
a half an hour about something.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.300
But these women
were actually smart,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.800
and the Fraud Police
were paying me a call.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.630
Fraud Police is my own
personal version of, you know,

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.720
what y'all might call
impostor syndrome.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.540
So for two months,
I avoided coming up

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.911
with an idea worth Microsofting.

00:02:51.911 --> 00:02:53.410
And the night before
the talk, I was

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.120
pacing frantically around Jason
Webley's Seattle houseboat,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.280
where I was staying,
still having written

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.250
nothing, when it occurred
to me-- my mother.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.350
She'd been retired for
a decade, but she'd

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.620
worked as a freelancer
for almost 40 years,

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.010
applying her math whiz
brain to the emerging

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.030
field of computer programming.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.510
And growing up, I'd had no
idea of what she actually

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.690
did all day after she
threw her heels in a bag

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.130
and drove her car into
the rush hour traffic.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.760
And whenever she started
trying to explain to me what

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.870
her job entailed, the words
blurred into a wall of noise.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.960
I hadn't called my
mother in a while,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.890
but now I had
something to ask her.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.290
And I needed her.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.320
She talked for
two hours straight

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.320
while I furiously
scribbled notes

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.630
about what it was like for
her to be one of the only

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.080
female computer programmers
at various companies

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.840
around Boston in
the '60s and '70s.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.500
I poured myself a glass of wine.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.700
On the other end of the
phone, on the opposite side

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.380
of the country, so did my mom.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.980
And for the first
time, in earnest,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.000
it was like we were
drinking together.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.170
I listened to her stories about
the sexism and the judgment

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.620
and the weird harassment.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.860
She told me the story about
the guy she programmed

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.000
with who got fired for looking
at too much porn on his office

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.150
computer.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.959
"In 1970?"

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:25.250
"No, no, no, no, no, no, honey.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.070
This was way later, when
we were working on Y2K.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.869
There was internet
porn by then."

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:32.410
I couldn't believe
my mother had just

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.550
said the words "internet porn,"
and I asked for more stories.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.310
"Well, you had to work
harder than the men

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.250
just to keep the job,"
she said matter-of-factly.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.670
"And, you know, you
had to be perfect."

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.660
The way she said it hit a nerve.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.240
"What kind of perfect?"

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.770
"Well, if a guy
messed up a project,

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.410
there was always another
job waiting for him.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.465
But a woman, forget it.

00:04:55.465 --> 00:04:57.330
You'd never get a job
in that town again.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.240
And Boston was a small town.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.110
There were only a few of us,
and the men all stuck together."

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.180
And she told me the story
of the accountant, Jerry,

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.350
who paid all the male
freelancers on time

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.060
but kept withholding
her paycheck,

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.280
claiming offhandedly that
because she "had a husband,"

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.690
she probably didn't need the
money as badly as the men did.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.830
She asked nicely for
months, persistently,

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.120
and a check she was owed
still didn't arrive.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.590
So one day, she called him up.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.840
"At 6:02," she said, "when I
knew the switchboard operator

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.000
had gone home for the day and
I would get him directly."

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.869
And she said, "Hi,
Jerry, it's Kathy.

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:38.410
Just wondering when
we're going to be

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.560
able to process that check.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.310
It's eight weeks late."

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.852
And when Jerry made
some grumblings

00:05:43.852 --> 00:05:46.060
about how they would send
it out as soon as possible,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.070
my mother said,
"What are you having

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.920
for dinner tonight, Jerry?"

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.030
I love my mom so much.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.070
And Jerry said, "Excuse me?"

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.820
And my mother said,
"I need that money

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.410
to buy groceries
to feed my family,

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.826
and if you don't
cut my check, I'm

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:02.360
coming to your house
for dinner tonight.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.440
And I don't like salmon,
and I don't like peas."

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.220
the check was on her
desk the next day.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.840
I'd never known
any of this stuff.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.700
But then again, I'd never asked.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.510
And as we were wrapping up our
two-hour conversation, and well

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.920
into our second or possibly
third glasses of wine,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:26.180
she said, "You know, Amanda,
one thing always bothered me.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.960
Something you said when
you were a teenager."

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.340
Whatever this was going
to be, it was not good.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.090
I was a terrible teenager.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.220
An explosion of
hormones and nihilism.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.560
"What, Mom?"

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.900
She can do this imitation
of me as a teenager that

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.440
makes me want to crawl under
a table, and she did it now.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.620
"You said, "Mom, I'm a real
artist, and you're not.'" Oh,

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.390
god.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.700
And then she added, more
kindly, "You know, Amanda,

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.970
you were just being
a typical teenager."

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.270
I winced, and I felt my neck
tighten and my teeth grit down

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.680
into mother
fight-or-flight mode.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.040
And she continued, "But you
know, Amanda, you would say,

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.100
'I'm an artist.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.520
Fuck you, Mom.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.250
What do you know?

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.490
You're just a
computer programmer.'"

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.677
I had to admit I could totally
imagine myself saying that

00:07:25.677 --> 00:07:26.260
as a teenager.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.280
Maybe not the "Fuck you,
Mom" part, but still.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.180
And then my mother
said something

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.454
that absolutely demolished
my defensiveness.

00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:36.870
And I don't think
in all the years

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.522
I've known her,
that I've ever heard

00:07:38.522 --> 00:07:39.605
her sound more vulnerable.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.210
"You know, Amanda, it
always bothered me.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:51.660
Because you can't see my art,
but I'm one of the best artists

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.260
I know.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.600
And it's just that no one
can see the beautiful things

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.220
I made, because you couldn't
hang them in a gallery."

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:07.340
And then there was a pause,
and I took a deep breath.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.770
"God, Mom, I'm sorry."

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.837
And she laughed, and her
voice turns cheerful again.

00:08:12.837 --> 00:08:13.920
"Oh, don't worry, sweetie.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.810
You were 13."

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.640
As I related this
story the next morning

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.060
to a small theater filled
with 200 women of Microsoft,

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.590
I added a confession, which
was that in all my years

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.280
of rock-and-roll, touring
around and supporting people,

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.840
and advocating for women, and
giving all these strangers

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.142
and fans permission to embrace
their inner fucking artists

00:08:34.142 --> 00:08:35.850
and to express themselves
fully, and look

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.750
at their own work and lives
as beautiful, unique, creative

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.309
acts, I'd somehow
excluded my own mother.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:46.350
And maybe, by extension, a
whole lot of other people.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.640
And I looked out at
the women of Microsoft,

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.470
seeing present-day versions
of my 1970s programmer mom.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.440
Maybe they all felt
thoroughly misunderstood

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.070
by their own bitchy teenage
wannabe-poet daughters.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.406
Who knew?

00:09:01.406 --> 00:09:03.280
So I thought about all
the things she told me

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.100
over the phone, I
said to the room.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.780
And I thought about her work
that I couldn't possibly

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.760
comprehend, about the actual
creative work she had done.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.690
All of that delicate,
handmade programming she

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.270
did into the dead of night,
to switch one platform

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.950
to another on some
critical company deadline.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.880
How "outside the box"
she said that she

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.410
would think and venture to fix a
problem, and how insanely proud

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.350
she felt it worked.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.890
And the true beauty
of those things.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:40.170
And the sadness, too, because
nobody ever, you know,

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.720
clapped for her at
the end of the night.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.620
And as I looked out
into the audience,

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.180
I saw that three or four
of the women of Microsoft

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.650
were sniffling and
dabbing their eyes.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.410
And my own throat tightened up.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.980
"And she couldn't hang
her work on a wall.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.220
I can.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.580
I do my art in public, and
people applaud all the time.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.720
And my mom never
really got that.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.090
And she's retired now."

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.060
After the talk, I
hugged a handful

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.430
of the women of Microsoft,
got back in my rental car,

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:22.110
turned the radio up to 11, and
peeled out of the office park.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.940
Take that, Fraud Police.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.990
[APPLAUSE]
