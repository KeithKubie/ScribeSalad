started with the JavaScript API now is a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
started with the JavaScript API now is a
 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.920
started with the JavaScript API now is a
really good time to watch them so let's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
really good time to watch them so let's
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.700
really good time to watch them so let's
get started with the code if you've

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710
get started with the code if you've
 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.859
get started with the code if you've
created a map before you'll recognize

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
created a map before you'll recognize
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.770
created a map before you'll recognize
this as the basic JavaScript used to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
this as the basic JavaScript used to
 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.910
this as the basic JavaScript used to
create a map place autocomplete is part

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
create a map place autocomplete is part
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.130
create a map place autocomplete is part
of the Google Places library so our

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140
of the Google Places library so our
 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.109
of the Google Places library so our
first step is to add the Google Places

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
first step is to add the Google Places
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.840
first step is to add the Google Places
library to the JavaScript API there are

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
library to the JavaScript API there are
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.399
library to the JavaScript API there are
a number of libraries that provides

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409
a number of libraries that provides
 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.899
a number of libraries that provides
additional functionality for the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909
additional functionality for the
 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.999
additional functionality for the
JavaScript API and one of them is the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
JavaScript API and one of them is the
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.190
JavaScript API and one of them is the
Google Places library so to add a

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
Google Places library so to add a
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.160
Google Places library so to add a
library include a library's parameter in

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170
library include a library's parameter in
 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.859
library include a library's parameter in
the JavaScript API loader here I've

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869
the JavaScript API loader here I've
 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.050
the JavaScript API loader here I've
specified libraries equals places

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060
specified libraries equals places
 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.910
specified libraries equals places
autocomplete adds a text input element

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920
autocomplete adds a text input element
 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.219
autocomplete adds a text input element
to your page and responds with

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229
to your page and responds with
 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.020
to your page and responds with
predictions when the user types into the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030
predictions when the user types into the
 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.170
predictions when the user types into the
textbox so we need to define an HTML

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180
textbox so we need to define an HTML
 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.099
textbox so we need to define an HTML
input element of type text and next we

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109
input element of type text and next we
 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:20.539
input element of type text and next we
can set some options for the

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549
can set some options for the
 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.240
can set some options for the
autocomplete widget so I decided to use

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250
autocomplete widget so I decided to use
 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.430
autocomplete widget so I decided to use
a default area for the search conducted

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440
a default area for the search conducted
 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.430
a default area for the search conducted
by autocomplete to define define the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440
by autocomplete to define define the
 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.640
by autocomplete to define define the
area I've created a letter long bounds

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650
area I've created a letter long bounds
 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.099
area I've created a letter long bounds
object it defines a rectangle on the

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109
object it defines a rectangle on the
 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.170
object it defines a rectangle on the
earth by setting the latitude and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180
earth by setting the latitude and
 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.270
earth by setting the latitude and
longitude for the southwest corner and

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280
longitude for the southwest corner and
 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.009
longitude for the southwest corner and
for the northeast corner of the

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019
for the northeast corner of the
 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.830
for the northeast corner of the
rectangle the autocomplete will bias its

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840
rectangle the autocomplete will bias its
 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.380
rectangle the autocomplete will bias its
search to this area but not restrict the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390
search to this area but not restrict the
 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.840
search to this area but not restrict the
results to that area I've decided to

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850
results to that area I've decided to
 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.030
results to that area I've decided to
bias my search results to an area in

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040
bias my search results to an area in
 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.729
bias my search results to an area in
Sydney Australia I've also created a

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739
Sydney Australia I've also created a
 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.340
Sydney Australia I've also created a
variable which I've called options that

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350
variable which I've called options that
 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.830
variable which I've called options that
contains the bounds objects

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840
contains the bounds objects
 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.039
contains the bounds objects
now we hook up the HTML input element as

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049
now we hook up the HTML input element as
 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.500
now we hook up the HTML input element as
a variable and add some magic to push

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510
a variable and add some magic to push
 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.330
a variable and add some magic to push
the autocomplete widget onto the map

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340
the autocomplete widget onto the map
 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.910
the autocomplete widget onto the map
canvas and finally create the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920
canvas and finally create the
 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.179
canvas and finally create the
autocomplete object passing it the input

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189
autocomplete object passing it the input
 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.020
autocomplete object passing it the input
element and the options object let's

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030
element and the options object let's
 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.630
element and the options object let's
take a look at the autocomplete of a

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640
take a look at the autocomplete of a
 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:30.890
take a look at the autocomplete of a
widget in action again

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900
 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.449
so one thing to note is that by default

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459
so one thing to note is that by default
 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.920
so one thing to note is that by default
autocomplete will automatically

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930
autocomplete will automatically
 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.050
autocomplete will automatically
determine the user's location by looking

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060
determine the user's location by looking
 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.390
determine the user's location by looking
at their IP address and will bias the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400
at their IP address and will bias the
 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.059
at their IP address and will bias the
search results to that location you can

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069
search results to that location you can
 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.640
search results to that location you can
turn off this location awareness by

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650
turn off this location awareness by
 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.619
turn off this location awareness by
setting the bounds to encompass the

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629
setting the bounds to encompass the
 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.619
setting the bounds to encompass the
whole world use bounds of minus 90 minus

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629
whole world use bounds of minus 90 minus
 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.330
whole world use bounds of minus 90 minus
180 + 90 180 you can also set the bounds

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340
180 + 90 180 you can also set the bounds
 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.670
180 + 90 180 you can also set the bounds

you can use the geocoding API define the

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069
you can use the geocoding API define the
 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.369
you can use the geocoding API define the
latitude and longitude coordinates of

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379
latitude and longitude coordinates of

so here's a link to the geocoding API
documentation okay let's think outside

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049
documentation okay let's think outside
 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.909
documentation okay let's think outside
the map how about using autocomplete to

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919
the map how about using autocomplete to
 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.580
the map how about using autocomplete to
autofill and the dress form there's a

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590
autofill and the dress form there's a
 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.529
autofill and the dress form there's a
really nice example in the documentation

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539
really nice example in the documentation
 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.300
really nice example in the documentation
which I'm just going to show you quickly
