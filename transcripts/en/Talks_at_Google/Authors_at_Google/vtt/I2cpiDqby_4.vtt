and "The New Republic."

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.000
He was a reporter for
Bleacher Report, where

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.640
he covered the Golden
State Warriors,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.310
and he is also a frequent

journalism in the US.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.680
He's here today to discuss
his new book, "Betaball--

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.230
How Silicon Valley Built One
of the Greatest Basketball

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.700
Teams in History."

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.120
Please join me in welcoming
to Google Mr. Erik Malinowski.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.781
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:02.364
ERIK MALINOWSKI:
Thanks for having me.

00:01:02.364 --> 00:01:04.260
DAVID BARRY: Yeah,
thank you for coming.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.450
So I think I'd like
to start with maybe

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.100
a quick reading from the book.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.600
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Sure.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.673
DAVID BARRY: I think you
mentioned Google once or twice

00:01:10.673 --> 00:01:10.900
in there.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.816
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Yeah.

00:01:11.816 --> 00:01:13.530
There's a couple of
Google references

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.070
sprinkled throughout the book,
so we'll do a blind read here.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.740
We'll see-- and then we'll
do a quiz at the end.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.620
DAVID BARRY: OK.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.703
ERIK MALINOWSKI: So see
if you can think about who

00:01:22.703 --> 00:01:25.000
would be saying this quote.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.730
So a little back
story here-- so this

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.170
is the setup to
Kevin Durant, when

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.570
he signed with the Warriors
on July 4th of last year.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.200
So this is a reference to the
backlash that was building up

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.880
in the wake of that.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.240
Quote, "Nobody complains when
somebody leaves Apple and goes

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.680
to Google.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.090
Aren't they in competition
with each other?

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.870
Nobody talk junk about the
CEO, who leaves Apple and goes

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.010
to Google.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.310
As a basketball player, you
are the CEO of a business.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.840
You are a business.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.970
Kevin Durant is a big business.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.490
He is the CEO of that business.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.820
So him going to play basketball
for a different team, the CEO

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.332
decided to leave where he
was at and go somewhere else.

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:06.790
But there's so many guys in
this league that are so stupid,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.380
they don't think like that.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.150
They don't think business-wise.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.230
It happens everyday
in the world.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.020
But in basketball,
it's a problem.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.170
Aren't you competitive in your
day job if you work for Apple?

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.600
Don't you want to outdo Google?

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.520
What's the difference
on the basketball court?

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.780
It's your day job.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.100
You want to do what's
better for you."

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.460
OK, so do we think that
Joe Lacob, the owner

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.950
of the Warriors, said that,
who is a Silicon Valley venture

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.382
capitalist for 25 years?

00:02:32.382 --> 00:02:34.340
Do we think that Rick
Welts, the team president

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.620
might have said that,
or Steve Kerr, the head

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.820
coach of the Warriors?

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.195
Or do we think,
perhaps, that was

00:02:39.195 --> 00:02:42.380
Draymond Green who said that?

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.880
Obviously, just the fact that
we're asking this question,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.282
it was Draymond
Green who said that.

00:02:47.282 --> 00:02:49.490
But I like that quote, and
that's a quote, obviously,

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.660
that pops up at the
end of the book,

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.250
because the book is written
sort of chronologically,

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.333
and that's a recent event.

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:55.100
But I like that,
because it serves

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.080
as a nice bookend to
kind of what you've

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.810
read throughout the book
to that point, which

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.090
is that the Warriors are--

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.310
they are a different
kind of organization.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.130
And the players and the
executives in the front office

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.970
here, they think and they talk
in a different kind of way,

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.322
and they approach not just
the game in another way,

00:03:13.322 --> 00:03:15.530
but sort of the fundamentals
of the sport and the way

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.480
that they approach free
agency and their image

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.600
and all those other sort
of extracurriculars.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.767
They look at the whole
package, and they approach it

00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:24.308
in a different way
that I don't think

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:26.870
you get to see in a lot
of other organizations.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.510
And that's a
representative of what

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.240
they've spent years trying
to build up the culture here

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.229
with the Warriors.

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.770
DAVID BARRY: And I think as you
mentioned throughout the book

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.250
sort of parallels with sort
of the Silicon Valley ethos

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.670
and the culture of the team.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.432
And I think there's a lot of
parallels with Google as well.

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:45.390
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Right.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.890
Yeah.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.180
It's about empowering
your employees.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.410
It's about-- it's really one of
the major themes of the book is

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.780
this idea that you
never really know

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.170
where the next good idea
is going to come from.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.210
You might have a lot
of different people

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.330
in the room,
different paygrades.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.130
Maybe some people's
office has a window.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.650
Maybe some don't.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.620
But you know, you don't
necessarily feel intimidated.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.070
You understand that
you're all there invested

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.440
in a common problem,
and the bottom line

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.089
is you're all there to solve it.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.680
And so someone might
have a good idea.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.704
They might feel empowered
power to bring that up.

00:04:25.704 --> 00:04:27.620
And the fact of the
matter is that there's not

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.040
a lot of organizations
in the NBA

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.290
that embrace that
sort of philosophy.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.080
And that was something that,
when the new ownership came

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.870
in in the summer of
2010, they realized

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.610
that we don't have a whole
lot to lose basketball-wise.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.280
And so they had a lot to lose
financially, because they

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.370
had paid a record sum of money.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.539
They had paid $450
million, which was--

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.330
even though we just
had the Houston Rockets

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.610
sell for $2.2 billion, 450--

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.250
that was a record
sum, even though it

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.291
was only seven years ago.

00:04:58.291 --> 00:05:00.869
So they came in, and they
realized, maybe financially we

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:02.660
have a lot to lose,
but basketball-wise, we

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.260
have an opportunity to basically
strip this organization down

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.564
to its bare bones.

00:05:07.564 --> 00:05:09.230
And we're going to
rebuild it, and we're

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.631
going to operate it sort of as
if you would a Silicon Valley

00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:13.130
startup.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.220
And we're going to imbue it with
some of those same philosophies

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.340
and principles, basically
that Joe Lacob helped

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.805
do in his quarter century
working in the Valley.

00:05:21.805 --> 00:05:23.930
DAVID BARRY: OK well, that's
a perfect segue, then.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.850
So let's talk about where the
idea of betaball originated,

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.620
and could you explain,
maybe for people,

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.094
for the audience who
don't know, the title?

00:05:33.094 --> 00:05:34.010
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Sure.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.490
DAVID BARRY: And
sort of the product.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.440
ERIK MALINOWSKI: So you
know, obviously, it's

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.830
a direct reference to that stage
of software development called

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.420
beta, where your final product
is not fully baked yet.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.570
And so you are in a position,
where you can still innovate.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.850
You can still change
some things up.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.500
You can still-- you're
basically not afraid to fail.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.880
You shouldn't be
afraid to take risks.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.040
There could be a big
payoff in the end for you.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.410
And so this was--

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.100
when I started writing
the proposal about a year

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.822
and a half ago,
maybe 20 months ago,

00:06:05.822 --> 00:06:07.280
this was a case,
where I was trying

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.470
to take sort of a
very macro overview

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.695
and look at not just what the
Warriors had accomplished.

00:06:12.695 --> 00:06:15.070
I mean, that was something I
wanted to get into the book,

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.570
but I wanted to get
into this larger

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.440
question of how they were able
to accomplish this thing that--

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.260
not just that not a lot
of other organizations

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.390
can reach this level of
success, but the fact

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.160
that we were seeing
unprecedented levels

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.850
of success.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.450
You know, we've seen
historically great teams,

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.530
but the Warriors have
literally been doing things

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.570
that we've never seen before
in not just the modern NBA,

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.040
but in the entire NBA's history.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.550
And then the real
brainstorm came--

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.667
Peter Guber was giving a
lecture down at Stanford.

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:45.500
They have their Sports
Innovation Conference

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.306
every March.

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:47.930
And he said something
to the effect of,

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.230
we are operating in a
constant state of beta.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.590
And I sort of had all of these
ideas kicking around my brain

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.586
at that point, and
I realized that

00:06:56.586 --> 00:06:58.460
that really was sort of
the connective tissue

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.370
here was that they've
been in a position

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.680
where they have-- they've tried
to stay nimble over the years.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.270
They've made decisions that
have been controversial.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.040
They've made a lot
of mistakes, but they

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.170
were in a position, where
they were going to learn

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.690
from them pretty quickly.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.210
But at the same time, they
saw that this was also,

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.040
in a sense, a kind of
market inefficiency

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.150
that they could exploit, that
no other NBA teams were really

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.990
being run like this.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.130
They were teams that had sort of
embraced technology and science

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.020
to a point.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.330
But they were going
to go all out,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.140
and they were going to basically
rebuild the entire organization

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.730
with these sort of
principles in mind.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.040
It was sort of a case study.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.430
And if they failed,
in some ways,

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.760
they were going to
fail spectacularly.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.050
But this was something
that they set out to do,

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.200
and they were determined
to see it through its end.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.670
They thought they
would be successful.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.400
I don't think anybody
reasonably thought

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.790
that they would not just
turn it around in five years,

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.520
but create a
championship-winning team,

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.640
create something that was going
to compete for championships

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.827
year in and year out.

00:08:02.827 --> 00:08:04.660
But obviously, they've
had some good fortune

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.920
and some serendipity
over the years.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.059
But at the same
time, they've also

00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:10.600
done a good job of
putting themselves

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.900
in a position to embrace
that and to take that

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.730
to its fullest potential.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.635
And that is a direct
result of the principles

00:08:19.635 --> 00:08:22.010
and the decisions that they've
instituted over the years.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.640
So that's a lot of what I
get into the book, not just

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.440
the basketball
sense, but seeing how

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.390
a lot of the off-court stuff has
affected the basketball side.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.150
DAVID BARRY: And it
sounds like, in the book,

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:39.070
for as nimble as they are,
Joe Lacob, in the beginning,

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.890
said he didn't want to come
in and make any changes that

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:42.739
were too drastic.

00:08:42.739 --> 00:08:43.169
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Right.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:43.360
Right.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.110
DAVID BARRY: So it
sounds like in addition

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.430
to sort of being in this
continuous beta stage,

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:52.810
he also kind brings a
sort of wiser business,

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:57.812
you know, I guess
experience to the team.

00:08:57.812 --> 00:08:59.020
Do you have anything to say--

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.019
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Yeah, I
mean this was something

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:03.520
that with sports fans,
you have to understand

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.510
that the Warriors were a
historically dreadful team.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:08.950
I mean really, really bad.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.710
They had-- when the
new ownership came in,

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:16.240
they had not made the
playoffs in 16 out of 17 years

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.500
preceding that.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.244
And it's really hard to not
make the playoffs in the NBA.

00:09:20.244 --> 00:09:22.660
Like literally, a majority of
the teams in each conference

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.868
make the playoffs every year.

00:09:23.868 --> 00:09:26.850
So it almost requires a
certain perverse kind of effort

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.500
to be that bad in some
ways, or it's just

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.740
an extraordinarily amount
of bad luck or incompetence.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.410
And I think it was all of
those things for the Warriors.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.280
But when the new
ownership came in,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.420
they decided that, yeah, they
were going to do it their way.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.400
But they made a lot of mistakes
those first couple of years.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:53.037
They had a lot to dig
out from, but there

00:09:53.037 --> 00:09:55.120
was a little bit of a fan
revolt there at a couple

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.078
of times along the way.

00:09:56.078 --> 00:10:00.610
So they were not
stubborn, but they

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:04.030
were determined to see it
through to a certain point.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.207
But yeah, they decided
that we're just

00:10:06.207 --> 00:10:08.290
going to try to put ourselves
in the best position

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:09.382
to try to succeed.

00:10:09.382 --> 00:10:10.840
And there were
times along the way,

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.995
where they didn't know
which direction it

00:10:11.995 --> 00:10:12.786
was going to go in.

00:10:12.786 --> 00:10:15.444
And it wasn't a foregone
conclusion at any point

00:10:15.444 --> 00:10:17.360
that they were going to
succeed to this level.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.367
But they kept at it, and
they had some good fortune

00:10:20.367 --> 00:10:20.950
along the way.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.324
But they also had
the opportunity

00:10:22.324 --> 00:10:24.254
to embrace all of that.

00:10:24.254 --> 00:10:26.170
DAVID BARRY: I want to
dive in a little deeper

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.270
to what you mean
when you say that it

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.089
was Silicon Valley and
science that built this team.

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:32.380
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Yeah, it was--

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.630
so I mean, as a way
of going into that,

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.850
I'll say my reporting on
the Warriors goes back--

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.970
I've gotten to cover this team
pretty closely the last three

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:43.540
years or so.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.430
But my reporting
really starts with them

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:48.421
back in the spring of 2011,
when the new owners had just

00:10:48.421 --> 00:10:48.920
come in.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.919
They had just been approved
in November of 2010,

00:10:50.919 --> 00:10:54.600
so they were about three or four
months basically on the job.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.780
And I did a story
for "Wired" about how

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.490
they were one of
the first few teams

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.930
in the league to adopt these--

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.640
to install these
motion tracking cameras

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.550
that we know in the
NBA today as Sport View

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.000
and has pretty much changed
the way that we write

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.350
about basketball, that
we understand the game,

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.470
all sorts of things
that we never thought

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:18.160
would be quantifiable before.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.150
But back then, it was this
very nascent technology.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.990
It was very new, and so I think
the analytically driven teams,

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.880
such as such as the
Houston Rockets,

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.710
who are led by Darrell
Morey, an MIT grad,

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.750
the co-founder of the
Sloan Sports Conference,

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.480
San Antonio Spurs have always
been analytically driven,

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.644
Oklahoma City Thunder, and
the Dallas Mavericks with Mark

00:11:37.644 --> 00:11:40.060
Cuban and everything-- those
are teams that were the first

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.160
signatories on that,
and they always--

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.050
so those were the
teams you would expect.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.258
The Warriors were the fifth
team to adopt Sport View,

00:11:46.258 --> 00:11:47.470
and when I read about that--

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.015
I read about it
in the newspaper--

00:11:49.015 --> 00:11:51.842
I was really surprised, because
that was just not something

00:11:51.842 --> 00:11:53.300
that you associated
with this team.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.660
But it was a very clear idea.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.890
It was a very clear indication
that they were embracing

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:03.400
the geography, that they were
embracing the fact that Silicon

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.550
Valley was in their
backyard, that it

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.050
was very obvious you could see
then that Joe Lacob was going

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.870
to use his roots as
a venture capitalist

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:15.160
and try to learn from what
he learned from 25 years

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.750
being around these
sorts of companies.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.940
And the people
working on Sport View

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.480
were-- it was all right here.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.700
It was very local.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.090
So I wrote that story,
and the basic premise

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.340
was that maybe they're
going to turn this around.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.310
Maybe it's going to give
them a chance to maybe become

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.660
a mediocre team.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.920
Maybe they can get out
of the bottom of the NBA.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.830
And that was part of it,
but it was also this idea

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.660
that we're going to
hire the right people.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.910
We're going to
bring in people that

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.430
have sort of a different
kind of experience

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.170
and a different background.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.000
I look at someone
like, for example,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.340
hiring Bob Myers as
assistant general manager.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.410
This was also literally
the day that I

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.510
visited Oracle Arena
to see the cameras

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.450
and was walking on the catwalks
80 feet above the court.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.010
It was later that
day that news had

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.040
leaked that they were
hiring a player agent named

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.140
Bob Myers to work in
their front office

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.120
and basically to groom this guy
to be the next general manager.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.360
And there were a lot of
people around the NBA

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.596
that scoffed at this idea,
and they thought, well,

00:13:12.596 --> 00:13:14.470
he doesn't have the
right kind of experience.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.300
He's never worked
in a front office,

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.717
and the Warriors looked at
that, and their thinking

00:13:18.717 --> 00:13:20.800
was a little more lateral,
and they thought, well,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.890
15 years of experience at
the negotiating table--

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.320
that's 15 years of experience
at the negotiating table.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.360
Sure, maybe he's on the
other side of the table,

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.900
but in some sense, it's
all of the same thing.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.180
And maybe this is something
that other people are not

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.202
appreciating, or
they're overlooking.

00:13:36.202 --> 00:13:37.660
This is a guy who
knows the agents,

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:38.868
having worked alongside them.

00:13:38.868 --> 00:13:42.130
He knows the players, having
literally represented them.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.820
This is a guy that-- this is
a new kind of NBA executive.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.460
So it's that sort of [INAUDIBLE]
thinking and thinking,

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.320
this is a guy who has
maybe a different set

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.410
of core strengths, and we need
to bring this guy on our team.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.710
And so bringing him
in, he was the guy

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.670
who signed Andre Iguodala.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.640
It was literally through
his sheer efforts.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.349
And I would say not
by having to convince

00:14:02.349 --> 00:14:04.181
Andrea Iguodala to come
to the Warriors-- he

00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:05.020
wanted to come here.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.150
But Bob Myers had
to dump $24 million

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.514
in contracts, and
so in some ways,

00:14:09.514 --> 00:14:11.680
who better to do that than
a former player agent who

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.050
understands the collective
bargaining agreement, who

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.960
understands the
intricacies of contracts,

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.460
and who knows the teams out
there who would be willing--

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.205
who have the
executives in place who

00:14:21.205 --> 00:14:23.380
would be willing to
take on those contracts?

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.090
And then even just
to the present day,

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.937
look at signing Kevin Durant.

00:14:26.937 --> 00:14:29.020
It was through Bob, it was
through his connections

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.230
and through just his sheer
energy and force of will

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:34.040
that allowed that to happen.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.070
So there's not a
lot of organizations

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.927
that would've brought
in a guy like Bob Myers.

00:14:38.927 --> 00:14:40.510
Yeah, a lot would
have wanted to bring

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.340
in a guy like Jerry West,
who the Warriors did,

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.215
and things like that.

00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:46.090
But I sort of look specifically
at a hire like Bob Myers,

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.370
and I think, that
is a thing that

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.990
is indicative of a
specific kind of mindset.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.350
And so this idea that
you're going to-- you've

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.937
got weaknesses on your
team and strengths,

00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:58.270
and you're not going to bring
in just basically the most

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.645
talented or the
most experienced.

00:14:59.645 --> 00:15:01.478
But you're going to
bring in people who have

00:15:01.478 --> 00:15:03.080
a specific kind of experience.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.270
And you're going to
use their strengths

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.964
to make up for the
weaknesses, perhaps,

00:15:07.964 --> 00:15:09.130
of other people on the team.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.650
And I think that is sort of
a very sort of Silicon Valley

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.200
mindset, where you want to
bring in people who have

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.940
all these varied experiences.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.300
And you want this to be the
sort of perfect little brew,

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.730
where everyone is sort
of working in concert,

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.100
and people are lifting each
other up and all that sort

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.360
of thing.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.570
And this is a thing that has
sort of been anathema to NBA

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:29.780
front offices over the years.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.780
But the Warriors figured
that this was something

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.550
that we can apply to
running a basketball team.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.370
DAVID BARRY: The idea
of bringing together

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:40.420
an eclectic board, who can
bring value in different ways.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.160
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Yeah.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.750
DAVID BARRY: And
also, I think it's

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:47.830
kind of a Silicon Valley idea--

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:52.225
you said that they were the
fifth team to use data science.

00:15:52.225 --> 00:15:54.850
But you say throughout the book
how they weren't really looking

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.140
for a short-term payoff
with it, that they

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.140
knew it wasn't going to
pay off for a long time,

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.900
yet they continued to
make the investment.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.816
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Yeah.

00:16:01.816 --> 00:16:05.600
They were-- what they
were doing was so new

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.600
and so nascent at that
point, and the technology

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.450
itself was so
immature in some ways,

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.790
that they had the
presence of mind

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.180
that they were going to spend
a not insignificant amount

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.540
of money installing these
cameras, and then in time,

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.270
hiring people to interpret this
data in such a way that would

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.390
befit the basketball team.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.500
But all of that
took a long time,

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.240
and at the very
beginning, they did not

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.770
have a head coach in place.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.082
Keith Smart, who was very
receptive to all of that--

00:16:33.082 --> 00:16:35.290
in fairness, not even the
next head coach they hired,

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.600
Mark Jackson, was all
that receptive to it.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.450
But by that time, they were
in a position, where they

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.500
were hiring these analysts.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.190
They were bringing people
into their front office

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.560
that could interpret
the data in such a way.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.810
And I should say, also,
that this was really

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.515
only six years ago we're
basically talking about.

00:16:52.515 --> 00:16:53.890
They're actually--
I mean they're

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.265
just weren't even
a lot of people

00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:58.210
in the industry that were
well-versed in this sort

00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.170
of thing.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:03.430
They had to look at, who
were the people that they

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.560
were going to be up and
coming in this industry?

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.579
Who were the people
that might be

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:08.050
a general manager in 10 years?

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.950
But they're taking sort of
a different career path.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.319
You It's very much something
like in "Moneyball,"

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.210
with Michael Lewis, you
know, he talks about,

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.310
obviously, "Moneyball"
is all about Billy Beane,

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:22.304
but one of the secondary stars
of that book is Paul DePodesta.

00:17:22.304 --> 00:17:24.220
And so basically, what
the Warriors were doing

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.750
is, who is our Paul DePodesta?

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.020
Who are the people that are
younger but are coming up

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.710
and are native in
this sort of language

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.730
and these sorts of skills?

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.110
And so it was about--

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.200
they were in a position, where
Joe Lacob's son, Kirk Lacob,

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.220
was a Stanford graduate.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.950
And he was actually friends
with a lot of these guys

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.800
that are working on these
tech initiatives that

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.800
could be applied to
basketball in a certain way.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.834
And so in some ways, they
were fortunate to have

00:17:49.834 --> 00:17:51.250
Kirk Lacob in a
position, where he

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.200
can bring in some of these guys
and introduce them to the team.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.220
But it's also about hiring a
guy like Sammy Gelfand, who

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.390
came up--

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.891
he was a DC guy and came
up through the D-league

00:18:00.891 --> 00:18:02.140
and was working as an analyst.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.920
And this was a guy, as you're
reading the book, Kirk Lacob

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.470
and Sammy Gelfand,
they basically

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.470
formed this bond,
this friendship,

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:10.900
and Sammy is one of these
guys now that comes up.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.480
And now to this day,
he's the number two

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.150
guy at the Warriors in
the analytics department,

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:19.190
but this is a guy who was
hired, in a lot of ways,

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.120
not just to crunch numbers
but to be that liaison,

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.930
to be that guy who can
act as a go-between

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:30.670
between the analytics department
and the coaching staff,

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:34.330
and then, in turn, the players,
because the Warriors realized

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.264
early on, even if they were
aggregating all this data, even

00:18:37.264 --> 00:18:39.430
if they didn't necessarily
know when they were going

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.040
to be able to use it in
a basketball kind of way,

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.720
that when it came
time to do that,

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.260
that you could have the
best analytics in the world.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.200
But if you don't have people
in place, who are going to--

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.660
that can convey that
information in a way that

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.320
makes sense, that can apply
that in a basketball sense

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.480
and go to these coaches, go to
these players, and say, look,

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.360
I know that you're used to
doing things in a certain way.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.170
But this-- go work
with us on this.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.842
This is going to help you
play basketball in a way

00:19:06.842 --> 00:19:08.550
that maybe you've
never played it before.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:10.591
This is going to help you
find a level of success

00:19:10.591 --> 00:19:12.690
that you've never found before.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.610
Then, the best analytics
don't mean anything,

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.580
if you don't have the people
that can explain those concepts

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.194
and actually will work to
convince people of their value.

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:23.610
Then, it's almost
all for nothing.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.430
So this is really just about all
these pieces coming together.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.569
And like you said, the
investment in time,

00:19:28.569 --> 00:19:30.360
not just in money, but
in time, and to know

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.160
that there would come
a day, and maybe it

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.330
was in two years or three
years or four years,

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.401
but that all of this stuff was,
in a sense, going to pay off,

00:19:37.401 --> 00:19:39.900
and maybe was going to pay off
big time, maybe a little bit,

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.880
but to stay with
that investment,

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.700
and to understand that this is
working toward something bigger

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.140
and better in time.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.765
DAVID BARRY: And it sounds like
Steve Kerr is a perfect example

00:19:48.765 --> 00:19:51.296
of that in terms of
understanding the analytics,

00:19:51.296 --> 00:19:52.920
but also knowing how
to get stuff done.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.615
But let's postpone
that for a second.

00:19:54.615 --> 00:19:55.500
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Sure, OK.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.541
DAVID BARRY: So take us
back through the history,

00:19:57.541 --> 00:20:00.120
for anyone in the audience
who may not be a Warriors fan,

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.070
didn't experience it as a fan.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.900
What was the story
of the Warriors

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.750
before it got sold to
the current ownership?

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.360
ERIK MALINOWSKI: I
mean, it's been--

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.420
it is a varied and
eclectic history.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.580
And they are not just one of
the oldest teams in the NBA.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.125
I mean the Warriors
actually predate the NBA.

00:20:17.125 --> 00:20:18.500
They were one of
the teams-- they

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.630
were one of the franchises
that merged with another league

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:25.770
and essentially created
the NBA in 1949, I believe.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.160
But they found a lot
of success early on.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.470
They've had historically
great players

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.570
like Wilt Chamberlain
and Nate Thurman

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:34.830
and Rick Barry over the years.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:39.200
And they were really good in
the mid-'70s, also the time that

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.200
the Oakland As were winning the
World Series across the walkway

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:43.736
from them.

00:20:43.736 --> 00:20:46.110
The Warriors were winning
championships in Oakland Arena,

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.840
but this was a
team that when they

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.440
head into the '80s
and early '90s,

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.820
success was few and far between.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:58.440
This was a team that, in
time, became historically bad

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.760
on a level that we've
almost never seen before.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.990
A lot of that had to do with
the new owner, Chris Cohan,

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.842
coming in 1995.

00:21:05.842 --> 00:21:07.800
He had been a minority
owner with the Warriors.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.000
He had come into the Warriors in
some little bit of shady means,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.840
and then in even
shadier means, managed

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.410
to become the full 100% owner
of the Warriors in 1995.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:21.710
But this was a guy that was
so incredibly incompetent,

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.580
and he was a cable TV magnate.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.710
He had founded and run
Sonic Communications.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.440
But he was not a basketball guy.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.840
He brought in guys
to run the team that

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.310
were not basketball guys.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.250
They were just guys that he
had known through his college

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.530
connections down
in San Luis Obispo.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.820
And so it's no surprise
that just year after year,

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.267
they would pass on--

00:21:43.267 --> 00:21:44.850
I spell this out in
the book, but they

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.790
passed on just one Hall
of Famer after another.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:49.410
Obviously, hindsight's
20/20, but you

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:52.590
would think at some point, you
would hit on one of these guys.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.800
But obviously, I think
the big one is drafting

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.990
Todd Fuller, instead
of Kobe Bryant,

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.140
I think is sort of the
one that most Warriors

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.100
fans bemoan the most.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.430
But they would have these blips
of success over the years.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.490
They had, for example, the
We Believe season in 2006

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:11.550
and '07, but just as fast
as that success came around,

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.370
it would sort of go away,
and it was so fleeting.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:18.009
So by the time the Cohan
decided to sell the team,

00:22:18.009 --> 00:22:19.800
I mean at that point,
it almost didn't even

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.457
matter who they were sold to.

00:22:21.457 --> 00:22:22.290
They were going to--

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:23.873
Warriors fans were
going to be elated.

00:22:23.873 --> 00:22:25.950
But you talked
earlier about sort

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.911
of waiting a little while
to turn the team around.

00:22:28.911 --> 00:22:30.660
That was one of the
reasons why the fans--

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.950
the honeymoon period with
this new ownership group

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.250
was so quick, because
they do expect, especially

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:39.130
when you've had 15 years of
failure, almost concurrently,

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.182
but this idea that you're
going to clean house.

00:22:41.182 --> 00:22:43.390
You're going to-- it doesn't
matter who you bring in,

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.264
but you're going to get
rid of all these guys

00:22:45.264 --> 00:22:47.180
that had all this failure.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.180
And they didn't do that.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.260
They waited six months.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.840
They brought a startup
kind of mindset,

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.104
where it's like, we're
going to evaluate everyone's

00:22:54.104 --> 00:22:55.020
place in this company.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.790
And maybe there are
some hidden gems here.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:57.581
We don't know that.

00:22:57.581 --> 00:23:00.270
If we just come in here
and clean house and act

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:02.012
sort of irrationally,
you could say,

00:23:02.012 --> 00:23:03.720
we might be throwing
out some people that

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.080
could be some valued members.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.932
It doesn't mean everyone's bad.

00:23:06.932 --> 00:23:08.640
It just means that a
lot of them are bad,

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.140
but we need to take
the time, and we

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.620
to invest in the sort
of evaluation process.

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.720
And there were guys,
there were holdovers.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.196
There was a-- the
Atlanta Hawks just hired

00:23:18.196 --> 00:23:19.320
a guy named Travis Schlenk.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.903
He was actually the
guy that I went up

00:23:20.903 --> 00:23:23.730
in the catwalks over Oracle
Arena with back in 2011.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.350
But he had been
with the Warriors.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:26.933
He was a coach, and
then an executive,

00:23:26.933 --> 00:23:28.860
but he had been in
the Chris Cohan era

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.482
for six, seven, eight years.

00:23:30.482 --> 00:23:32.190
And he was the guy
that they kept around,

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.565
because they looked
at his place,

00:23:33.565 --> 00:23:35.584
and they saw he had a
specific set of skills.

00:23:35.584 --> 00:23:37.500
He was a guy that was
well-versed in the draft

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.546
and player evaluation,
and it wasn't his fault

00:23:40.546 --> 00:23:43.170
that they weren't drafting Kobe
Bryant and Vince Carter and all

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:43.878
these other guys.

00:23:43.878 --> 00:23:46.140
But this was a guy that
we needed to stick around,

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.740
and so they did that.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.760
It was pretty methodical,
but they took their time.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.760
And in addition to trying
to change the culture,

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.390
it was about identifying, who do
they already have around here?

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.660
And so that gave them a
little bit of a head start,

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.260
but obviously, they still
had all of this work

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.121
to do going forward.

00:24:03.121 --> 00:24:04.620
DAVID BARRY: It
sounded a little bit

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.161
like the movie,
"Office Space," where

00:24:06.161 --> 00:24:09.210
they bring in the consulting
firm to give everyone

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:10.590
the chance to show their worth.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:13.006
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Yes, I think
it was a little bit of that.

00:24:13.006 --> 00:24:14.310
It was a little more high--

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:16.650
I mean, in addition to
all that, they also spent

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:20.832
almost $2 million renovating the
actual offices of the Warriors.

00:24:20.832 --> 00:24:23.040
They walked in there, and
they realized that not only

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.597
is this culture of failure--

00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:27.180
it's not just on the
basketball court.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.540
It's in the workplace.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.600
And so they realized
that people did not

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.850
enjoy coming to work every day.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:34.310
They didn't have
pride in the team.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.185
That's one of the things
I say in the book is

00:24:36.185 --> 00:24:39.240
that if they're going to sell
the Warriors as this free agent

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.727
destination to sell it to
other players in the NBA,

00:24:41.727 --> 00:24:44.310
they basically had to sell the
Warriors to their own employees

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.930
first.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:48.300
That pride in the work
that they were doing

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.380
was just, basically,
nonexistent.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:53.100
So they knocked
down cubicle walls,

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.350
and they built
these new workspaces

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:59.130
to try to increase
cross-collaboration and trust

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.770
with each other, and not just
bring in the right people,

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:04.380
but to just change the culture
and change the workspace

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.520
and things like that.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.834
And that's what I've seen
really take root over the years

00:25:08.834 --> 00:25:11.250
is that, especially with the
players that they brought in,

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:12.874
but also talking to
front office execs,

00:25:12.874 --> 00:25:14.490
but especially with
the players, it's

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.830
this idea that they use
language that I've never

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:19.020
heard other professional
athletes use before.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.880
They say things like,
I like coming to work,

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.070
coming into work today.

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:24.790
You I like-- this is my job.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.390
I like my job.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.220
And this is not something
that we, I think,

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.900
associate with
professional athletes,

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.110
but just to sort of hear
the way that they like--

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.640
and I think,
obviously, some of this

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.900
is all the success they have.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.340
And obviously, the
more success you have,

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.250
the more you want
to come into work,

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.110
whether that's
sports or a business

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.720
or something like that.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.430
But that's a peek
into the mindset

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:49.967
of how the Warriors operate is
that that's how they view it.

00:25:49.967 --> 00:25:52.050
They don't view it as
coming into play basketball.

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.420
They view it as
coming in to do a job.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.920
Everyone has a job to do, and
the court is your workplace,

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.850
and the practice court
is your workplace.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:03.030
And at the day is
done, you go home.

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.264
You do non-basketball
things and other things,

00:26:05.264 --> 00:26:06.930
and you come, and you
do the basketball,

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.430
and everything is valued.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.190
And that's just not something
that you see across the NBA,

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:12.840
but it's something
that the Warriors--

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.502
they hold that in high esteem.

00:26:15.502 --> 00:26:17.960
DAVID BARRY: Yeah, and on the
opposite end of the spectrum,

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.700
I think you mentioned the
Latrell Sprewell incident.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.690
ERIK MALINOWSKI: That
was sort of a low point.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:22.498
DAVID BARRY: Yeah.

00:26:22.498 --> 00:26:23.710
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Yeah.

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:24.668
DAVID BARRY: OK, great.

00:26:24.668 --> 00:26:26.850
So there's a lot of
talk right now about how

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:28.530
the Warriors are
fundamentally changing

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:29.782
the way the game is played.

00:26:29.782 --> 00:26:31.740
What do you make of that,
and how revolutionary

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.796
has it really been?

00:26:32.796 --> 00:26:34.170
ERIK MALINOWSKI:
I mean, it's not

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:37.920
like the Warriors are the ones
that came up with the idea

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.200
that, oh, we should shoot
a bunch of three-pointers,

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.590
and this is how we're going
to score our way to success.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.939
There have been-- you look
at like Doug Moes, the Denver

00:26:46.939 --> 00:26:48.480
Nuggets team of the
early '80s, where

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.140
they would score 120 points a
game or something like that.

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.660
Or you look at Mike D'Antoni,
Suns, the "07 Seconds or Less"

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.590
Suns, Jack McCallum's
famous book.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:02.540
But especially, this is a lot
of stuff that has taken root--

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.082
Mark Jackson, I think, laid the
foundation for a lot of this,

00:27:05.082 --> 00:27:07.289
and that's something I get
into the book is that he's

00:27:07.289 --> 00:27:09.770
a guy that came in and gave
them a lot of confidence

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.450
and proved that you could have
a winning formula by shooting

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.620
the three ball, and that this
was a way that you could find--

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.990
you could basically take the
team from these low depths

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.500
and excel into something
bigger than that.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:25.800
But when Steve Kerr came in, it
was this idea that not only can

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.910
we score in bunches.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:28.410
We can embrace the
three-point shot,

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.990
even in ways that take it,
what the Mark Jackson was doing

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:32.520
and kick it up a
couple of notches.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.950
But we can also play
defense at the same time.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.530
And this was-- you look at the
metrics over the last three

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.590
years, so when Steve Kerr
has become head coach.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:43.350
We've never seen a team in
NBA history that has played,

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.690
that has had such an
efficient offense,

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.244
but has not sacrificed
defense in such a way.

00:27:48.244 --> 00:27:50.160
And what Steve Kerr came
in and was able to do

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.409
was that he showed
the guys that now you

00:27:53.409 --> 00:27:54.450
can keep shooting threes.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:57.030
You can keep scoring in
bunches, but if we also

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.700
commit on the defensive
end, your offense

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.980
is going to be more efficient
than it has ever been,

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.590
because you get stops.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:05.550
You get rebounds.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.170
The other team is
out of position.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:10.460
You run the fast break, or
you pop back out for a three.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.030
You catch guys out of position.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.000
There's all sorts of ways
that you can use defense

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.320
to make your offense better.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.250
And you just look
at the numbers,

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.190
and we've never
seen a team excel

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:21.660
on both ends of
the court the way

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.868
we've seen with the Warriors.

00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:26.700
And so they're showing,
in a way, that you can--

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.440
it's not just live
and die by the three,

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.081
but it's thrive by the three.

00:28:30.081 --> 00:28:31.830
And at the same time,
if you are committed

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:35.817
to defense in such a way,
you can be better off for it

00:28:35.817 --> 00:28:36.900
on both ends of the court.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.717
So they value both
of those things.

00:28:39.717 --> 00:28:41.550
For as long as Steve
Kerr is the head coach,

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:43.290
if they are ever
lower than top five

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:46.290
in defense, that's a year that
he's probably going to consider

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:47.670
a failure, because he just--

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.350
he values both
parts of that game.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:51.840
But we talk about the
Warriors doing things

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.240
that no team has ever done
and shaking the very core

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.560
of the foundations of the NBA.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.810
This is one of those
examples, because we've just

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:00.280
never seen it on
both ends the way

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.020
we've seen it with this team.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.840
DAVID BARRY: Yeah, I think
the quintessential example is

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:09.550
rather than taking a layup, like
Steph Curry will forego a layup

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:12.490
to take a three, and
it's actually-- so

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:14.530
what's informed that strategy?

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:16.960
Was that a data analysis or?

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.460
ERIK MALINOWSKI: I
just think it's--

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:22.290
I think it's showing the
players that on some level,

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:24.130
it's pretty elementary.

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:27.550
It's convincing them that
three is worth more than two,

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.230
so we've got that part down.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:32.590
We've got that technical math
part of the equation settled.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:35.230
But it's the idea
that you're completely

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.060
capable of shooting
a three-point shot

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.340
and making it in
any given scenario.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.410
And traditionally
in the NBA, it's

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:44.650
almost seems hubris
in some ways to--

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.900
you've got the easy
layup, or maybe you've

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.096
got one on one match-up.

00:29:49.096 --> 00:29:50.470
You challenge the
guy at the rim,

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.840
and you go, you take it
up, and you take it strong.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.750
You don't kick it out to the
trailer for a three pointer

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.720
when there's no one
within 12 feet of him,

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.219
and literally, everyone else
is trailing on the play,

00:30:01.219 --> 00:30:02.260
but this guy's wide open.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.600
But when that guy
is Steph Curry,

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.840
or that guy is Klay Thompson,
and you practice that play,

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.200
and they can do that in
rhythm, then the whole play

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.750
just feels natural to them.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.190
And so you just make that
a part of your offense.

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:18.455
You make that a part of the
culture of how you play,

00:30:18.455 --> 00:30:20.080
and then it just
becomes second nature.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.390
Then it doesn't become
this hubristic display

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:23.530
of basketball.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.860
Then it just becomes another
part of your game plan,

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.997
and boy, when you're an
opposing team, and now,

00:30:28.997 --> 00:30:31.330
all of a sudden, that is
something that you need to game

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.210
plan for, now you
have the advantage.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:36.972
Now, you have the
leg up on them,

00:30:36.972 --> 00:30:38.680
because now you have
to keep them honest.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.270
Now it's just not a
forgone conclusion

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.550
that you're going to be going
up strong for the layup.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:43.690
Now you've got to
watch the trailer.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.130
You're going to kick
it out to the guy,

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:46.870
and you have to be ready
for all sorts of scenarios.

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.630
DAVID BARRY: Right, so much more
frustrating for the defense.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.320
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Well, not
for Warriors fans, but yes,

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.070
it's frustrating for
the opposing defense.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.740
Exactly.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.290
DAVID BARRY: OK, can you
talk about Steve Kerr?

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.350
What has he meant to the
team, and what could all of us

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.390
learn from his leadership style?

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:02.984
ERIK MALINOWSKI:
I mean it's hard--

00:31:02.984 --> 00:31:05.400
it's sort of hard for me to
be objective about Steve Kerr.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.822
He really is sort of one of my--

00:31:06.822 --> 00:31:09.280
in all the years that I've been
covering sports and writing

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.779
about it, I mean he's pretty
much one of my favorite people.

00:31:11.779 --> 00:31:14.620
He's so-- I mean he's
just a genuine guy.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.960
What you see is what
you get, but he's

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:22.330
had such incredible and
varied life experiences.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:26.734
Coming up through Arizona,
very public-- his father

00:31:26.734 --> 00:31:28.150
was a diplomat in
the Middle East.

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:30.654
His father was
assassinated in 1984, back

00:31:30.654 --> 00:31:32.320
when he was still a
freshman at Arizona.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:37.457
And he just became this national
name that everybody knew about,

00:31:37.457 --> 00:31:39.040
and it was almost
about that same time

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.530
that he just really
started to find himself

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:43.885
as a basketball
player, as a person,

00:31:43.885 --> 00:31:45.010
and just worked his way up.

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:47.590
This is a guy that
really had no right--

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:50.345
6'3", 171, know what I mean?

00:31:50.345 --> 00:31:51.220
He had a little bit--

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.678
he just didn't
have-- he's not what

00:31:52.678 --> 00:31:55.540
you sort of thought of as this
star college basketball player.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.840
But just through this force
of sheer will, confidence,

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.740
cockiness, whatever you want to
call it, just this exuberance,

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.440
he was able to-- he
became this national star

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.010
and worked his way, basically,
into a 15-year NBA career that

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:12.220
was almost one of the most
inexplicable careers just

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.880
in terms of his physicality and
what he brought to the game.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.670
But he came up through
the NBA in college.

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.540
It was literally while he was
in college that the NCAA adopted

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.660
the three-point shot.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.930
And so when he got to the
NBA a couple years later,

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:27.700
this was a time when
the three-point shot

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.520
was coming into vogue.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.728
It had been in the NBA for
a few years at that point,

00:32:30.728 --> 00:32:33.730
but finally, the NBA
was embracing the idea

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:35.180
of a three-point specialist.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:39.550
And so I think he started, or he
played something like 900 games

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:40.700
across his NBA career.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.520
But I think when he
only started like 10.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.360
He was this super sixth man
sub, but that was his role,

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.320
and he understood that.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.510
He was a team player, but
also at the same time,

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:53.270
he won five championships
as a player.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:56.420
On a Chicago Bulls team
that had Michael Jordan,

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.500
he hit a game-winning shot
to win a championship.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.500
Michael Jordan passed to Steve
Kerr to win a championship,

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.600
and I think that,
in some ways, that's

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.480
something that sort of
people forget about.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.430
But at the same
time, this is a guy

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.820
that's always understood that
basketball has its place.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.310
I think it's probably because
all the personal stuff that's

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:16.018
gone on with him.

00:33:16.018 --> 00:33:18.760
He understands that
basketball-- there's this

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.770
saying "basketball is life."

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.600
Well, to him, basketball
is very much not life.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.570
There is so much
more to basketball,

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.950
and all of those things
need to be balanced.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:30.880
It's about happiness.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.630
It's about doing
what's right for you.

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:34.921
It's about understanding that
basketball has its place,

00:33:34.921 --> 00:33:37.192
but there's so much more
to experience in life--

00:33:37.192 --> 00:33:39.400
not to jump ahead, but I
think that's why you've seen

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.795
him be such a vocal critic.

00:33:41.795 --> 00:33:44.170
He's been involved in this
current administration, things

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:44.740
like that.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.110
A lot of that you see is
manifested in this idea

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:50.650
that there is so much more
to life than just basketball,

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:54.690
but when they hired him
in the summer of 2014,

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.140
this was a case, where
the timing was right.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.920
He was in a position, where
he had been a general manager

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.480
before the NBA.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.810
It had gone pretty
wrong with Phoenix.

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:08.860
They had some success,
but that team--

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.710
it ended pretty badly.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.710
But he had been a broadcaster
a couple of times,

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:15.471
but he was in a position
where his kids were older.

00:34:15.471 --> 00:34:16.929
He was looking for
a new challenge.

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:18.928
I think he'd always wanted
to get into coaching,

00:34:18.928 --> 00:34:20.814
but this was a guy--

00:34:20.814 --> 00:34:22.230
he had had a heck
of a head start.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:25.409
The Warriors had won 51
games under Mark Jackson,

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:27.935
and it was a lot of pressure.

00:34:27.935 --> 00:34:29.310
Whoever was going
to replace him,

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:32.320
there were a lot of very good
reasons why Mark Jackson--

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.409
why his tenure came to
an end as Warriors coach.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:36.300
But this was a guy
with the weight

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.165
of the world on his
shoulders, and I

00:34:38.165 --> 00:34:39.540
think there were
a lot of coaches

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.460
that might've come
into that situation

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:44.670
and realized that it might
have gone really badly.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.719
They had all this talent.

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:46.870
There was all
these expectations.

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:49.560
They thought maybe it was the
germ of sort of a championship

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:54.480
level team here, but he came
in and it was a position where

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.320
he had some very
certain ideas and things

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:02.430
that he wanted to institute, and
so he just set about doing it.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:05.010
And it was a very-- he
fit in really perfectly,

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:07.290
I think, with the culture
that we had seen here.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.246
But they had some
really tough decisions

00:35:09.246 --> 00:35:10.620
to make right off
the bat as soon

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:13.050
as he came in as head coach.

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.090
One of those was
this idea that, oh,

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:17.010
whether or not they
should trade away

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:19.590
Klay Thompson for Kevin Love.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:21.800
So this was--

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.300
I think he'd only been on the
job for about a month or so,

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.160
and the Minnesota
Timberwolves come

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.857
to the Warriors and
this idea that we're

00:35:27.857 --> 00:35:29.690
going to offer Kevin
Love for Klay Thompson.

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:31.980
That was basically the
centerpiece of the package.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.480
This was something
a lot of people--

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.530
there were a lot
of Warriors fans

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.580
that thought this was
kind of a no-brainer.

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.640
Kevin Love could
shoot the three ball.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.520
He was taller.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.477
He wasn't a defensive upgrade.

00:35:43.477 --> 00:35:45.810
I think they were a little
bit of a wash in that regard,

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.270
but this idea that
Steve Kerr is coming in.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:52.440
He's going to institute this new
kind of motion kind of offense.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.320
Mark Jackson had a very sort
of traditional pick and roll

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.610
offense, that kind of thing,
script out these three-point

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:00.956
plays for Steph and Klay.

00:36:00.956 --> 00:36:03.330
And with Steve Kerr, it was
going to be a little bit more

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:04.871
not improvisational,
but it was going

00:36:04.871 --> 00:36:06.517
to be a little bit
more free-flowing.

00:36:06.517 --> 00:36:08.100
It was going to be
more about spacing.

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.290
It was going to be more
about these plays that

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:12.510
were predicated on
timing, and the idea

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.400
was that somebody
like Kevin Love

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.710
might fit into that
a little bit better.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.500
And so-- but this was one of the
big decisions they had to make.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.690
And so it ended up,
as I read in the book,

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:25.440
that they had all these
guys in a room trying

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.700
to make the decision,
including Joe Lacob,

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.894
including Bob Meyers and top
management, this idea that,

00:36:30.894 --> 00:36:32.310
are we going to
pull this trigger?

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:33.685
And so there were
a lot of people

00:36:33.685 --> 00:36:35.930
in the room that wanted
to make that move,

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:38.190
but there were two voices
in that room that were

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:39.450
pretty staunchly against this.

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:43.020
And one of those was Jerry West,
who they brought in not to be

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.642
a decision-maker but
to be a guy who could--

00:36:45.642 --> 00:36:47.850
he specifically did not want
to make those decisions.

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:48.870
He told them flat out.

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.870
But I can point you guys
in the right direction,

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:53.276
and you can value my counsel
or not if you want to.

00:36:53.276 --> 00:36:54.900
So this was a case
where Jerry West was

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.540
speaking up and
saying, you guys,

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.400
I really think you
should stand pat.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.850
You shall hold your ground.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:03.750
Don't be enticed
by the idea here.

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:05.220
And the other guy
was Steve Kerr,

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.781
and he said, I like the
team that we have here.

00:37:07.781 --> 00:37:09.280
I like the players
that are in here.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.904
I don't think we need
to make this sort

00:37:10.904 --> 00:37:14.580
of drastic bold kind of move.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.550
And it was-- obviously,
it was Steve and Jerry

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.240
that sort of ruled the day.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.160
Their voices carried
the most weight.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.240
They were the most
persuasive, and Joe Lacob,

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.860
he's fine with that.

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.200
I mean he's a guy I think
that could have gone

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.970
either way on that,
but he chose to listen

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:31.450
to these guys' counsel.

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:33.091
And I'll just read a little bit.

00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:33.840
DAVID BARRY: Yeah.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.548
ERIK MALINOWSKI:
Something from the book,

00:37:35.548 --> 00:37:38.490
something that he says sort of
directly in relation to that.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:42.090
You know, Lacob says, "We
encourage very strong debate,

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:44.460
but then it's my job
to make the decision.

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:47.280
I certainly listen most of the
time to what the group decides,

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.740
and then we just
do it, and we go.

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.750
I do think that that
is what's different.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.040
That's what separates us.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.040
That's the Silicon Valley
way, the entrepreneur way.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.180
That is not the
big company way."

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:02.140
And so I think that's really
sort of representative

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.740
of in that whole
anecdote, this whole idea

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:07.440
that it would have been
very easy to sort of bow

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.110
to the pressure, to
bow to the tantalizing

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:12.270
idea of bringing a
guy in with Kevin Love

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:13.687
and into this new offense.

00:38:13.687 --> 00:38:16.020
I think it helped a lot that
one of the guys telling him

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:19.470
not to do it was Steve Kerr,
the guy who would eventually

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:21.600
have to coach him.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.450
But it was this idea that we're
going to give everyone a voice.

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:27.000
We're going to try to look
at everything objectively,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.431
and we're just going to try
to make the decision that's

00:38:29.431 --> 00:38:30.180
best for our team.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.060
We're not going to let any
of those external pressures

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:33.652
weigh on us.

00:38:33.652 --> 00:38:35.610
We're going to try to
look at it in a very sort

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:40.190
of narrow, goal-oriented
and driven kind of way.

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:43.110
And again, sometimes--
I like that anecdote,

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:44.287
because it's not about--

00:38:44.287 --> 00:38:46.620
sometimes it's not about the
decisions that you do make.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.230
It's about the decisions
that you decide not to make.

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.600
And in this very
specific case, I

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.810
think history has sort of
validated their decision

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:56.310
not to make the decision.

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:57.840
DAVID BARRY: Absolutely.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.340
And yeah, at Google,
we have a motto

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.940
having to do with the HiPPOs,
the highest paid person.

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:05.020
You Don't necessarily
just blindly follow them.

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:08.200
At least weigh the ideas
for their intrinsic value.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:12.570
So it sounds like a
very similar situation.

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:16.510
So what do-- for the people in--

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:20.070
so what do Warriors
fans, like the die-hards,

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:24.150
they may not be season ticket
holders, but people who have

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:25.320
followed the team closely.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.590
What can they take
away from the book?

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:32.530
ERIK MALINOWSKI: I think just
understand that we have--

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:34.874
so people that are season
ticket holders or not?

00:39:34.874 --> 00:39:35.540
DAVID BARRY: No.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.350
ERIK MALINOWSKI: They're
not season ticket holders.

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:38.157
DAVID BARRY: But
still very good fans.

00:39:38.157 --> 00:39:39.990
ERIK MALINOWSKI: I think
that just this idea

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:44.530
that this whole ascent
has been so fast.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:46.190
There's so much
that goes into it.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:50.160
There's so much that goes into
building a team from scratch,

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:50.910
basically.

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:53.160
Even just through, I like--

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.177
this has been a pretty
ephemeral amount of time.

00:39:55.177 --> 00:39:56.760
We're only talking
five, seven years--

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.771
five years of the
playoffs, seven years

00:39:58.771 --> 00:40:00.270
since the new
ownership has come in.

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:03.197
But there's just so
much that goes into it.

00:40:03.197 --> 00:40:05.280
There's so many little
decisions and machinations,

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.420
and there's so many
parts along this path.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.880
It's a lot more
winding than linear,

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.550
but there's so many
parts, where it just all

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:16.020
could have gone terribly wrong.

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.715
None of this was--

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:20.599
this was no foregone
conclusion that these guys were

00:40:20.599 --> 00:40:22.140
kind of good men,
and they were going

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.197
to institute these principles
and this new philosophy

00:40:25.197 --> 00:40:27.030
and that it was going
to work out like this.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:31.320
And at the same time, it's
not just a matter of-- it's

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.469
not just so reductive
as just saying,

00:40:33.469 --> 00:40:35.760
oh, it's just because they
have a Steph Curry or a Klay

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.259
Thompson.

00:40:36.259 --> 00:40:36.960
I think that's--

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.050
I mean I think there's
validity to that.

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:43.860
I don't discount the
importance of having talent.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.721
Obviously, I think
talent, in some ways,

00:40:45.721 --> 00:40:47.220
is the biggest part
of the equation.

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:51.390
But just the fact that
we are seeing a team--

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:54.200
I mean we've seen elite
teams before in the NBA,

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.860
but just that we're
seeing a team now

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.080
that has reached such--

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.200
I mean is literally doing things
every season that we've never

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.970
seen a team do before.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:06.120
And then, also, now that we're
seeing teams sort of copy that

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.750
in such a way and trying
to not use that necessarily

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:14.580
as a blueprint for success, but
at least try to put themselves

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.890
in a position to take
advantage of the good fortune

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:20.220
or development curves the same
way that the Warriors have.

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:23.940
But just this idea that
they can read this book

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.740
and understand that it's a lot--

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.240
there's a lot more
complexity to it.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.400
It's a lot more nuanced.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.120
Obviously, having
a Steph and a Klay

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.580
and a Draymond and
a Kevin Durant,

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.050
obviously, that helps out a lot.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:36.570
But there's really so much
more that goes into that,

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:40.740
and it really is not just
about what is on the court.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.410
But it's about, what is
the front office doing?

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:44.880
What are the coaches doing?

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.830
What is everyone
in the organization

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:49.830
doing to help everyone
sort of play the best

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:53.225
basketball they can, be the best
kind of employee they can be?

00:41:53.225 --> 00:41:55.350
And I feel like on some
levels, a lot of that stuff

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:58.314
would be relatable,
because I think we've all--

00:41:58.314 --> 00:42:00.480
anyone's that had a job has
sort of found themselves

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.594
in that kind of
position, where they want

00:42:03.594 --> 00:42:04.760
to be happy where they work.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.170
They want to thrive.

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.670
They want their colleagues to
help pick them up when they're

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:09.711
down, that kind of thing.

00:42:09.711 --> 00:42:11.562
And so I feel like
people read through it,

00:42:11.562 --> 00:42:13.770
and it's like, yeah, I mean
I feel like they can kind

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:14.894
of relate to a lot of that.

00:42:17.079 --> 00:42:19.620
DAVID BARRY: So a lot has been
made of the Warriors embracing

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:23.250
new tech and analytics to take
the team to the next level.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:26.730
But in real terms, what
does that look like?

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:29.760
And how do they maintain their
advantage over other teams

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.040
in the league, who are
now trying to catch up?

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.498
ERIK MALINOWSKI:
I mean it's tough,

00:42:33.498 --> 00:42:36.030
because like I
said, it was easier

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:38.100
in the beginning for
them, because they

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.770
were one of the first
signatories of Sport View.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:43.440
And so it was pretty
easy in some ways

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.094
to see that that
was the direction

00:42:45.094 --> 00:42:46.260
that the league was heading.

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:49.140
So at that point, it
was really just a matter

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.969
of investing the money, hiring
the right kind of people,

00:42:52.969 --> 00:42:54.510
and then, I think,
in time, just sort

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:58.170
of hoping that it kind of
panned out to some extent.

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:00.450
It's become harder over
the years to do that,

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:03.180
because Sport View
is so ubiquitous now.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.090
And every team has analysts.

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:09.360
Every team sends people to
the Sloan Sports Conference

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.330
every March in Boston,
so everyone sort of

00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:14.890
understands a lot
of those things.

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:17.340
And so for the
Warriors especially,

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.334
trying to maintain
that edge, it's about--

00:43:20.334 --> 00:43:21.750
I mean they've got
a lot in place,

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:23.416
because they have a
guy like Steve Kerr.

00:43:23.416 --> 00:43:25.260
And more than Steve
Kerr, they have

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:27.060
he has hired
assistant coaches that

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:28.800
really understand these things.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.127
Even you talk about old timers
like Ron Adams and people

00:43:32.127 --> 00:43:33.960
like that that have
been around a long time,

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:37.600
but yet understand the value and
the importance of those things.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.460
But for them, it's about trying
to find the next frontier.

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:44.640
It's about monitoring
sleep patterns.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:49.020
It's about issuing personality
tests and things like that

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:53.040
and regular player
evaluations and not

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.980
judging all of these
things individually,

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:58.790
but trying to look at
them in their totality

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:00.710
and looking at that
and saying, what

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:03.590
sort of a picture of
my basketball team

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:06.234
are all of these different
criteria painting?

00:44:06.234 --> 00:44:08.150
And how do I apply that
in a basketball sense?

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:13.856
And so they can understand
when guys might need a day off.

00:44:13.856 --> 00:44:15.230
The term they use
is "redlining."

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:18.200
Are these guys getting
too close to the zone,

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:22.354
where they might suffer an
injury, that sort of thing?

00:44:22.354 --> 00:44:24.020
I mean that really
is sort of the next--

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:28.180
and no one has really perfected
that part of the puzzle yet.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:29.810
I mean, the next
frontier really is

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:32.090
sort of like injury
prevention in whatever

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:33.536
form that [INAUDIBLE] itself.

00:44:33.536 --> 00:44:34.910
The worst thing,
I think, they've

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:38.420
got a lot of that figured
out in terms of monitoring

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.430
player fatigue and energy.

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:42.140
You can't do this
during the games yet,

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.606
and there's very
good reasons why,

00:44:43.606 --> 00:44:45.230
and the collective
bargaining agreement

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:46.979
is very clear about
these sorts of things.

00:44:46.979 --> 00:44:49.110
But they can monitor
these guys in practice,

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:50.870
and they can look at
the Sport View data

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:52.328
from the games
themselves, and they

00:44:52.328 --> 00:44:54.710
can understand the amount of
dribbles that they're taking

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:56.090
or how fast-- literally,
how fast they're

00:44:56.090 --> 00:44:57.344
running up and down the court.

00:44:57.344 --> 00:44:59.510
And they can look at all
of these things in concert,

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:02.824
and they can say it's
about resting these guys.

00:45:02.824 --> 00:45:05.240
It's about, who do we then put
in the lineup and that sort

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.449
of thing.

00:45:06.449 --> 00:45:08.490
And to some extent, that's
really all you can do.

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:11.240
But it's about how far
you can drill down on that

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.310
and how many different
criteria you can all

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:14.970
bring into this equation.

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:16.970
So for them, I think it's
really the bottom line

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:19.430
is it's all about,
what new information

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:21.740
can we gather that
we're not gathering?

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:24.260
And then the second
step is, how do we apply

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.430
that in a basketball sense?

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:27.980
And so that's why they're
always looking to partner up

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:32.199
with these new third party
tech ventures and initiatives,

00:45:32.199 --> 00:45:33.740
and they're always
willing to listen.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.656
They're always willing
to have a conversation,

00:45:35.656 --> 00:45:37.610
and not all of these
things pan out.

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:40.100
And they start partnerships,
and they end partnerships,

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:43.072
but I think they're
always looking--

00:45:43.072 --> 00:45:44.780
again, because they
have the convenience,

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:47.660
they have the geography
on their side,

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.225
and they can work to take
advantage of these things that

00:45:50.225 --> 00:45:52.632
I think that a lot of
other organizations can't.

00:45:52.632 --> 00:45:54.590
So I think they're
cognizant of that advantage,

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:56.360
and I think they just
figured, we're just

00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.350
going to use this to
our most advantage.

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:02.450
DAVID BARRY: It sounds
like similar data

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:06.240
is being employed for injury
prevention in other sports

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:06.740
as well.

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:08.420
Keith Law was here
recently and talked

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:11.940
about the sleeve that pitchers
are using now in baseball.

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:19.670
So on that note, what can
other NBA teams, but also teams

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:20.960
just in any sport--

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.280
what can they take away?

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.870
What can they learn
from the book?

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:25.370
ERIK MALINOWSKI: I
think a lot of it

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:28.980
is, again, this sort
of sounds obvious,

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:31.820
but it's not as ubiquitous
as you might think.

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:34.614
But it's really just about
listening to your athletes.

00:46:34.614 --> 00:46:36.530
It's about in the same
place in the workplace,

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:38.520
it's about listening
to your employees

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:43.460
and valuing their opinion and
their place in the workplace.

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.790
But it's about understanding
what they're going through.

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:48.410
Everybody is different.

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:50.690
Everybody processes
information in a certain way.

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:55.700
Everyone fatigues in a certain
way in an athletic sense.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.509
But understanding that
you're really only going

00:46:59.509 --> 00:47:01.550
to be able to predict
these things as well as you

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.008
can talk to your
athletes, that you

00:47:03.008 --> 00:47:05.150
can gain their trust,
that you can have

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:08.510
a dialogue about these things.

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:10.550
These are things that
the teams they thought

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:12.500
were unquantifiable,
or they would not

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:15.681
be able to discern anything
of any import from,

00:47:15.681 --> 00:47:17.180
but I think what
we're understanding

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:20.840
is as these fields get
more mature, and more

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.750
is invested in them over time,
that there is a lot to learn,

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:26.450
that the athletes themselves
are really the best

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:27.950
source of this information.

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:30.290
And so if you can apply
that in a way that

00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:32.960
works best for
your team, yeah, I

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.610
mean you can prevent injuries.

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:38.360
You can improve
team cohesiveness.

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:42.380
These are hard concepts for
a lot of teams to invest in,

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:46.520
because some of them are pretty
nebulous, or in some cases,

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.156
you're relying on
athletes' words.

00:47:49.156 --> 00:47:53.300
You don't necessarily have
hard data to back it up.

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.970
But if you can combine
these things with the data

00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:59.240
that you are
aggregating, I do think

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.730
you get a more fuller
understanding of the athlete

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:04.760
or your employee.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.010
And just you can help
improve your workplace

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.730
in a lot of ways.

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:11.630
I think that on a foundational
level, a lot of these concepts

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:13.825
are-- they can be applied
in all sorts of ways.

00:48:13.825 --> 00:48:15.950
DAVID BARRY: And taking a
lesson from the Warriors,

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:17.960
the first step might just
be collecting the data,

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.270
and then worrying
about the analysis.

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:20.270
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Yeah,
worry about it later,

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:22.850
but you have to be willing to
make that initial investment.

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:24.890
That's a leap of faith.

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:27.401
I mean that's not something
that a lot of organizations do,

00:48:27.401 --> 00:48:29.900
and to some extent, I understand
why some would be skittish.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.730
But you have to
have the foresight

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:33.740
to see where your
industry is going,

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:36.760
whether that's a sport
or a business or what,

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.410
and just sort of, on some level,
take it on faith that it's

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:42.290
going to pay off in the end.

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:44.450
DAVID BARRY: So covering
the team for as long

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:46.730
as you did, having spent
a lot of time with them,

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:49.100
could you talk a little
bit about the players?

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:54.080
ERIK MALINOWSKI: They
are agonizingly normal.

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.790
For the amount of
success that they have,

00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:57.881
you would assume that--

00:48:57.881 --> 00:48:59.630
I mean you can look
at a guy like Draymond

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:00.835
Green and his bluster.

00:49:00.835 --> 00:49:02.210
I mean that's just
his character.

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:04.107
I mean that's just who he is.

00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:04.940
He's not like that--

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:05.040
DAVID BARRY: Controversial.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:05.495
ERIK MALINOWSKI: --all the time.

00:49:05.495 --> 00:49:06.200
What's that?

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.325
DAVID BARRY: Controversial.

00:49:07.325 --> 00:49:08.420
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Yeah.

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.610
But that's the role
that he has to play.

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:12.350
He understands that that's--

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:14.060
when other guys aren't
going to speak up,

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:15.726
he's going to be the
guy that speaks up.

00:49:15.726 --> 00:49:18.800
So if there's an
archetype on the team,

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.555
that's the role that he plays.

00:49:23.505 --> 00:49:25.880
Again, they've experience so
much success over the years,

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:30.410
but they still are able to
have these moments, where--

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:33.710
I remember one game last season
where the Charlotte Hornets

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:34.730
came into town.

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:36.830
And so Steph Curry's
dad, Del Curry, who

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:39.980
played 16 years in the
NBA, he was very much

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:43.930
a guy like Steve Kerr, shot the
three balls, a super sixth man.

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:46.250
But so he's an announcer
for the Charlotte Hornets,

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:49.040
and so there was a time after
that game in the locker room,

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:49.790
where--

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:52.700
and understand that the
Warriors are, basically, again,

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:54.680
at the top of the
NBA, and basically

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:57.620
rolling to another championship,
their second in three years.

00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:01.310
And you can have a moment,
where Del Curry basically

00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:02.840
walks into the locker room.

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:04.580
He's got his backpack on.

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:08.060
He's in full dad mode, and he
walks up to Steph's locker,

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:10.400
and there's nobody
standing, basically,

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.390
within 10 feet of them.

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:13.550
And they're just having
a quiet conversation.

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:15.040
I couldn't tell you what
they were talking about,

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:17.165
because nobody was standing
close enough to listen.

00:50:17.165 --> 00:50:20.780
But to have that sort of
private sort of intimate moment

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:25.160
between a father and a son
and just the idea that people

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.030
would sort of--

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:28.113
you're in a position, where
that can sort of still

00:50:28.113 --> 00:50:29.900
happen with this team.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:33.475
I feel like this team,
in time, sort of may--

00:50:33.475 --> 00:50:34.920
I think they're
well on their way

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:37.117
to their pantheon
in the all-time NBA

00:50:37.117 --> 00:50:39.200
and this conversation of
the all-time great teams.

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:44.050
But they still value personal--

00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:46.550
just the atmosphere
and the chemistry.

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:48.500
And to have a locker
room and a clubhouse,

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.990
where a dad can come in
and just sort of talk

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:53.000
to his son for a few
minutes, it doesn't

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.060
matter that the son is Steph
Curry, one of the top three

00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:59.600
megastars on the planet, that
this is an environment where

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.530
that can still happen.

00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:03.300
I think that maybe in
two or three years,

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:06.410
maybe that's not going
to be feasible anymore.

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:08.589
Maybe everyone's star is
just going to be so much,

00:51:08.589 --> 00:51:10.130
or the atmosphere
is going to be such

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:13.010
that we're not going to be able
to see those moments anymore.

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:15.500
But I'll say that for
this moment in time,

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.964
the Warriors have put themselves
in a position, where they

00:51:17.964 --> 00:51:19.880
can still have those
moments, where they still

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:23.450
value that sort of normalcy.

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:25.580
We'll see if that lasts
another two or three years,

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:29.030
but for now, that's indicative
of where this organization is.

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:32.070
And I think in a lot of ways,
that works to their benefit

00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:33.992
and explains how they've
been so successful.

00:51:33.992 --> 00:51:35.450
But now they're in
a position where

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:37.658
they can keep the success
going for a few more years.

00:51:40.717 --> 00:51:43.050
DAVID BARRY: So what was it
like to cover the last three

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:47.340
finals, the two wins, of course,
but also the tragic, tragic

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:48.360
loss?

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.770
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Up and down
and up, I guess you could say.

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:54.900
Well, I should say I'm not
a lifelong Warriors fan.

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.150
I'm a Knicks fan, actually,
for 20 years or so.

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:59.342
So in some senses,
that helped writing

00:51:59.342 --> 00:52:01.050
the first couple of
chapters of the book,

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:04.320
because I have a lot of
experience writing about poorly

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.890
run inept franchises with
the Warriors-- team owners

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:09.740
that you just wish
would just go away,

00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:12.073
and literally anyone else
would come in to buy the team.

00:52:12.073 --> 00:52:19.410
But yeah, it's been an
experience seeing the crowds

00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:21.450
and seeing the level
of success they've had.

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:23.730
I will say that right up until--

00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:27.000
I was in Oracle Arena
for that game seven,

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.270
that gutting loss
in June of 2016,

00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:32.280
when they lost on the
Kyrie Irving three.

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:33.960
But it was really weird.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.270
Right up until that point,
for all of the failures

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:38.040
that they had for
all those years,

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.540
with this new
iteration of the team,

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:42.257
it was you just didn't think
that anything bad like that

00:52:42.257 --> 00:52:43.090
was going to happen.

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:43.950
You just didn't
think that they were

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:46.500
going to lose at the moment,
where they could least

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.004
afford to do so.

00:52:48.004 --> 00:52:49.920
And it happened, and it
really just showed you

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:52.020
that no matter what
level of success

00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:55.670
you have, no matter
what you've built up,

00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:58.500
you're just sort of
privy to the basketball

00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.961
gods or a vengeful sort.

00:52:59.961 --> 00:53:01.710
And you just never
know what they're going

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:03.670
to decide on any given day.

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:06.300
And those sorts of thing--
and a historic collapse,

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.520
the kind of which we've
never seen before can happen.

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:13.740
It doesn't matter if
you won 73 games or not.

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:15.360
But it was fascinating
then to see

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:19.650
an organization that had been
basically publicly humiliated.

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:23.070
They became an internet meme,
basically, in and of itself,

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:24.390
blowing a 3-1 lead.

00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:26.510
This has become
part of the lexicon.

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:29.360
It's become part of
the vernacular now.

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.990
But to see them pick
themselves up from that,

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:33.990
and of course, I think
signing Kevin Durant does

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:35.920
a lot for the healing process.

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.350
But it wasn't just as simple
as sending Kevin Durant.

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:40.500
It was about-- in some
ways, it was almost

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.946
about this idea of
steering into the skid.

00:53:43.946 --> 00:53:44.820
You know what I mean?

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.430
Like almost in some ways,
embracing the failure,

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:51.480
not being afraid of it,
not running from it.

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.662
You know, I went to the Warriors
at a very sort of delicate time

00:53:54.662 --> 00:53:56.370
in this process and
told them, basically,

00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:58.940
that I was going to write
this book on you guys,

00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:01.710
and you can sort of be
involved to whatever extent.

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:03.750
Obviously, they can
make my life easier,

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:05.934
or they can make it harder.

00:54:05.934 --> 00:54:08.100
They didn't make my life
easy, but at the same time,

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:08.975
they didn't obstruct.

00:54:08.975 --> 00:54:11.610
And they literally
said those words--

00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:13.510
we're not going to
make this hard for you.

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:14.850
And I really appreciated
that, because I

00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:17.308
think that sort of did come at
a very sort of critical time

00:54:17.308 --> 00:54:19.085
in my reporting for the book.

00:54:19.085 --> 00:54:21.210
But at the same time, they
made it very clear to me

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:26.010
that we don't want to seem like
we're puffing our chest out

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:28.527
in any way or taunting
people, or now

00:54:28.527 --> 00:54:30.360
we're the team that's
getting a book written

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.680
about them, that sort of thing.

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:34.180
And this was all, again, all
in the wake of the Kevin Durant

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.250
signing.

00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:37.390
But if you fast forward
a few months later,

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:40.380
they're literally selling
Super Villains t-shirts

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:41.910
in their team store.

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:44.480
So they are embracing
this persona.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.410
They are now, in
fact, profiting off

00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:49.800
of this persona
and this backlash,

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.410
and so I think that
just comes from taking

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:57.120
a step back and understanding
that this is the reality.

00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:02.370
This is what has befallen us,
and we can either run from it,

00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:03.870
or we can embrace it.

00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:07.860
And I think they decided that
they were going to embrace it.

00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:10.380
And I think-- and then you
saw what happened last year.

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:14.340
They had some
periods of adversity.

00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:16.010
Kevin Durant got
injured pretty late

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:17.760
in the season, sprained
his knee ligament.

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:21.030
They lost-- I think it was
like five out of seven games

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:22.320
or something like that.

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.772
And then they wound up
winning 14 games in a row.

00:55:24.772 --> 00:55:26.730
And then he came back at
the end of the season,

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:28.729
and we all know what
happened with the playoffs.

00:55:28.729 --> 00:55:31.710
But this was a team that
put itself in a position,

00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:34.440
where we're not going to run
from any sort of adversity.

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:37.407
We're going to meet it
head on, and in some ways,

00:55:37.407 --> 00:55:39.990
it definitely sort of helped the
book become a little bit more

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.520
interesting.

00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:44.040
It certainly made for a more
interesting ending to it.

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.440
But that's just who they
are, and that's just what,

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.290
I think, again, that was
sort of indicative of what

00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:51.260
they've built up over
the last few years here.

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.010
DAVID BARRY: And
speaking of the playoffs,

00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:55.110
we're going to take
some audience questions

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:57.880
in just another minute or so.

00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:03.360
But speaking of the playoffs,
we have seen with the league,

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:09.060
talent has gotten
concentrated in a few teams.

00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:10.980
And you mentioned how
after the lockout,

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:14.940
there were things done to
try and address this issue,

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:18.210
yet you still see like
in the Kevin Durant

00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:21.630
move to the Warriors, how it
seems like this there's still

00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:23.060
a tendency for this to happen.

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:24.482
So what's your thought on that?

00:56:24.482 --> 00:56:26.190
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Yeah,
this was something

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:30.150
that we saw with
the 2011 lockout,

00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:33.480
which some of the things
that resulted from that

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:36.750
were a direct response
to LeBron James going

00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:40.730
to Miami in the summer
of 2010 and the decision

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:44.004
and all of that and as a
response to this allowing teams

00:56:44.004 --> 00:56:45.420
to create super
teams or whatever.

00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:47.270
And so the idea is
that you're just

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:50.505
going to try to entice them
now more to sort of stay

00:56:50.505 --> 00:56:51.380
with their own teams.

00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:54.320
You offer more years, more
money, that sort of thing.

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:56.270
But with the Warriors,
it was just--

00:56:56.270 --> 00:57:00.270
I mean in some ways, they
were just a product--

00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:02.350
in a lot of ways,
the timing was good,

00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:03.740
and their fortune was good.

00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:06.746
The idea that Steph is going to
have all these ankle injuries

00:57:06.746 --> 00:57:08.870
in such a way that it's
going to depress his market

00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:11.831
value that he can sign
a four-year $44 million

00:57:11.831 --> 00:57:14.330
contract, when by all rights,
he probably should have signed

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:15.204
something a lot more.

00:57:15.204 --> 00:57:17.180
We saw right after he
signed that contract,

00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:21.680
he sort of took his
game to a new level.

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:25.490
But lot of it was good
fortune, but they also

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:29.420
put themselves in a position
to maximize their good fortune.

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:34.430
It was about-- it's not lucky to
have a guy like Draymond Green

00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:37.370
take a several million dollar
haircut on his new contract

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:37.930
extension.

00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:42.410
It's not lucky to bring in a
guy like Shaun Livingston, who

00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:45.330
has never really played his
full potential in the NBA.

00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:48.230
I mean Andre Iguodala did not--

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:50.780
when he signed his
four-year deal before,

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.380
it was not for
below market rate.

00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:56.660
So it was just about
certain pieces of the puzzle

00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:58.190
coming together
at the right time.

00:57:58.190 --> 00:58:01.010
It was not-- is not
something that you can really

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:03.830
legislate out of the
NBA, and so that's

00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:06.594
why I'm really hesitant
when people say, oh,

00:58:06.594 --> 00:58:07.760
can they just read the book?

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.790
And so what the Warriors
did-- is it a blueprint

00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:11.884
for other teams to follow?

00:58:11.884 --> 00:58:12.800
I don't think you can.

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.520
I don't think that they could--

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:17.180
you can't just follow
steps A through Z and say,

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:20.180
if you do these things, this
is how you build a super team.

00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:25.010
But there are concepts that
you can apply to your team

00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:27.260
to put yourself in
a better position

00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:29.567
to take advantage of
certain moments of luck

00:58:29.567 --> 00:58:31.150
and good fortune and
things like that.

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:35.469
But yeah, that's why it was
always-- it was this thing,

00:58:35.469 --> 00:58:37.760
especially after they signed
Kevin Durant, it was like,

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.130
oh, we've got to change
something in the CBA

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:42.080
to prevent this sort of
thing from happening.

00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:44.090
But it's not really
something you

00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:45.860
can legislate out of the NBA.

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:48.630
I call it competitive imbalance.

00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:51.866
But it's the idea that I never
understood when people say--

00:58:51.866 --> 00:58:53.240
to me, it's like
the larger issue

00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:55.699
is that not that the Warriors
themselves are scooping up

00:58:55.699 --> 00:58:56.490
all of this talent.

00:58:56.490 --> 00:58:58.160
I think it's easy
to look at them

00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:01.160
and say, oh, they've got
these four superstars.

00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:04.100
We have to institute something
to prevent this in the future.

00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:07.340
But to me, in some ways, I
would say the bigger issue

00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:10.730
is you have the teams right
below them, who already

00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:11.731
do have a lot of talent.

00:59:11.731 --> 00:59:13.396
And they're now the
ones that are trying

00:59:13.396 --> 00:59:14.690
to scoop up this elite talent.

00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:17.100
And so it's not about the
Warriors getting this talent.

00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:18.830
It's about a team like
Houston going out,

00:59:18.830 --> 00:59:20.830
and they've already got
a guy like James Harden,

00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:23.240
but now they worked
this mega trade,

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:25.070
and they bring in a
guy like Chris Paul.

00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:27.270
And you look at that sort
of in an objective way,

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:30.080
and you think, there's
really no sense in having

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:33.500
a guy like James Harden
and a guy like Chris Paul,

00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:36.800
these high usage guys, who
are used to running offenses.

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.850
And there's almost no--

00:59:39.850 --> 00:59:41.630
and so now it just
becomes a talent grab.

00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:43.100
And now it's just like--

00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:45.050
in some ways, it's a
little bit of desperation

00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:46.425
when you have
teams saying, well,

00:59:46.425 --> 00:59:48.440
we just need to close
that talent gap in any way

00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.400
that we can.

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:51.579
So you have a team
like Oklahoma City

00:59:51.579 --> 00:59:53.870
that goes out of its way to
bring in a guy like Carmelo

00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:57.440
Anthony and to bring in a guy
like Paul George, who both Melo

00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.620
and Paul George may not be there
after this year or whatever.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:03.200
So it's extremely risky
on them, but they're

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.910
in a position,
where they just have

01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:07.160
to do something to try
to close this talent gap.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.380
So to me, I think
that's where you end up

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.665
seeing more of the imbalance.

01:00:10.665 --> 01:00:13.040
It's not just with the Warriors,
but all these other sort

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.300
of tier one teams--

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.967
they're trying to compete.

01:00:15.967 --> 01:00:18.050
Maybe it's going to make
things more interest come

01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:19.841
the end of the Western
Conference playoffs,

01:00:19.841 --> 01:00:23.220
but you really are diluting
all of these other teams.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:26.720
And so I think that whenever
these mega super teams will

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.097
play each other, I think those
games will be more interesting,

01:00:30.097 --> 01:00:32.430
perhaps, than they've been
in the last one or two years.

01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:35.420
But I think it's going to
make the rest of the NBA

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:37.610
really suffer, because
now you've diluted

01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:39.580
the rest of that talent pool.

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:40.850
DAVID BARRY: Yeah, the
James Harden and Chris Paul

01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:42.433
sounds a little bit
like the Warriors,

01:00:42.433 --> 01:00:44.262
like the Steph Curry
and Monta Ellis.

01:00:44.262 --> 01:00:45.220
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Right.

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:45.800
Exactly.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:46.300
Exactly.

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.600
I mean that was a case, where--

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.460
yeah, I get to that in a
lot of detail in the book.

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.460
But yeah, that was a case,
where we've basically

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:54.837
got two guys that are
almost the same physically.

01:00:54.837 --> 01:00:56.420
They basically play
the same position.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:00.094
They bring a lot of the same
game, but we have to decide.

01:01:00.094 --> 01:01:01.760
In the Warriors case
there, they decided

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.370
to trade the guy who was
the fan favorite, who

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:06.005
was the most tenured Warrior.

01:01:06.005 --> 01:01:07.760
But yeah, he was
the oldest player.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.530
But they realized
that we're going

01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:11.720
to have to take this
backlash, because he's

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.044
stunting Steph's development.

01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:14.960
He's also stunting Klay
Thompson's development

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.070
to some extent.

01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:18.023
And you saw that once
they traded away Monta,

01:01:18.023 --> 01:01:20.180
Klay Thompson started all
those rest of the games

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.054
the rest of the season,
as I say in the book.

01:01:22.054 --> 01:01:24.540
And that was really what brought
his development on track,

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:26.427
so it wasn't even just
about helping Steph.

01:01:26.427 --> 01:01:27.510
It was about helping Klay.

01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:30.530
But yeah, in some ways, it's
like the reverse Monta Ellis,

01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:34.120
because now you've got
guys-- and so I'm not

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.620
the most optimist-- we can look
back at this in a few months

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.110
and see how Houston's
season turned out.

01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:40.780
And I think in a
small sample size,

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:43.030
I think against the Warriors,
their games against them

01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:44.071
will be more competitive.

01:01:44.071 --> 01:01:46.540
But it's not just about the
games against the Warriors.

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:47.990
It's about playing
a whole season.

01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:50.685
It's about creating the right
kind of chemistry and coherence

01:01:50.685 --> 01:01:51.310
with your team.

01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:53.957
So in some sense, I'll be really
interested to see how Houston

01:01:53.957 --> 01:01:56.290
turns out, because I don't
think it's a guarantee at all

01:01:56.290 --> 01:01:58.990
that they're going to just
bring in a guy like Chris Paul,

01:01:58.990 --> 01:02:00.992
and things are going to
automatically improve.

01:02:00.992 --> 01:02:02.950
And I think that's what
I saw with the Warriors

01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:04.345
over the years was
it was just about

01:02:04.345 --> 01:02:06.094
you have the money,
so you're going to try

01:02:06.094 --> 01:02:07.600
to bring in the most talent.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.059
But is it the right
kind of talent?

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:10.516
And that was a
mistake the Warriors

01:02:10.516 --> 01:02:12.970
made for a lot of years, right
up until this new ownership

01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:14.640
came in.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.980
DAVID BARRY: OK, I know you
touched on this already,

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:19.340
but I wanted to
expand a little bit.

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:23.060
The most common criticism of the
Warriors is, well, the only way

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:23.977
they keep winning is--

01:02:23.977 --> 01:02:25.351
the only reason
they keep winning

01:02:25.351 --> 01:02:27.440
is they have all this
generational talent, i.e.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.270
Steph Curry, Kevin Durant.

01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:33.530
To that, what do you say?

01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:36.060
ERIK MALINOWSKI: I say that's
a really big part of it.

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:38.210
And I just want to
make it really clear,

01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:39.831
and I hope that
people read the book,

01:02:39.831 --> 01:02:41.330
and they come away
thinking that I'm

01:02:41.330 --> 01:02:45.440
trying to minimize the
importance of talent,

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.400
because obviously, that is the
biggest part of the equation

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:48.900
here.

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:51.314
And this isn't like--

01:02:51.314 --> 01:02:52.730
in some ways, with
"Moneyball," it

01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:56.360
was like it was a
matter of resources.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.920
And they really
just couldn't go out

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.360
and get the right
kind of talent.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.170
So the way that they were going
to the market inefficiency,

01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:05.246
and they were going to
try to exploit it was

01:03:05.246 --> 01:03:07.160
try to get guys that
were undervalued

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.510
and could get on base and
all these sorts of things.

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:11.510
And these aren't problems.

01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:14.450
The Warriors-- obviously,
they have resources,

01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:17.000
and they have been allowed
to invest over the years.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.837
But for me, it's been
about understanding--

01:03:19.837 --> 01:03:21.920
and this is why I basically
spend the first couple

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.760
of chapters of the book laying
out the more recent history

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.147
and Steph's rookie year and what
the previous ownership group

01:03:29.147 --> 01:03:30.980
was and just how bad
the Warriors have been,

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:34.550
because I think you have to
understand just how far--

01:03:34.550 --> 01:03:37.010
just how bad they were,
I mean just how truly,

01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:39.600
truly terrible they were.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.890
And I think that once you
understand that, you understand

01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:45.740
not that just that they have
gone from some middling team

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:49.040
to an elite team, but that they
have gone from a historically

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.310
awful team to a team that's
literally doing things

01:03:52.310 --> 01:03:54.350
that we've never seen
do before in the NBA.

01:03:54.350 --> 01:03:57.920
And so I think that if it
were something like this, then

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.780
I think talent would be--

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.400
then I think it
would be something,

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.816
where you could
look at the talent

01:04:02.816 --> 01:04:05.780
and say, oh, this is
more of the factor that

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:06.920
is going to rule the day.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.810
But the idea that
the gap is just

01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:11.662
so wide between where they
were and where they are now,

01:04:11.662 --> 01:04:14.120
that there's just so much more
that goes into that equation

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.760
and that there is
more complexity to it,

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.010
and there's so many
other factors at play,

01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:21.830
and that it is more nuanced
than just saying it is a Steph

01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:22.680
or it is a Klay.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.362
So I hope that's
one of the big--

01:04:24.362 --> 01:04:25.820
I hope that's one
of the takeaways.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.520
I think that it's a common
frustration of mine when

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.160
I see people sort of take the
argument in those directions,

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.650
because I'm like, no,
no, no, step back.

01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:34.560
Read the book.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.600
It's really just about
so much more than that.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.095
But I understand people's
tendency to go in that dir--

01:04:41.095 --> 01:04:42.470
I don't begrudge
them in any way,

01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:48.050
because I do think that that's
a pretty common misconception.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.580
DAVID BARRY: OK,
well, I think we'll

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:53.330
take some audience questions.

01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:55.060
AUDIENCE: So when I
think of "Moneyball,

01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:58.840
I think of Billy
Beane finding ways

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:02.150
to find new players,
undervalued,

01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:05.550
and generate wins that way.

01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:08.140
But from the talk
and what I anticipate

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:11.920
in the book is that betaball--

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.960
how you view it is more
about than just using

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:17.270
data and finding
ways to generate ways

01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:19.500
of using data to help you win.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:22.090
It sounds like it's
more of the ethos

01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:25.780
of the organization as a whole.

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:28.880
And with the
"Moneyball" piece, it

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:32.530
seems like over the years,
that competitive edge has

01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:34.900
sort of disappeared a
lot, because everyone

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:35.700
started doing it.

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:36.190
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Right.

01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:37.606
DAVID BARRY: So
are there elements

01:05:37.606 --> 01:05:40.540
that you find that are
maybe slowly disappearing

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:45.220
through those methods
that are disappearing?

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.990
And what are maybe
some of the things that

01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:48.984
are unique to the Golden
State Warriors that

01:05:48.984 --> 01:05:51.400
are going to be very hard to
replicate across other teams?

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:55.090
ERIK MALINOWSKI: Yeah, I
think what you're seeing

01:05:55.090 --> 01:05:57.400
is that in terms of--

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:00.160
I always say in terms of
data-driven analytics.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.380
I think those are the
sorts of places where we've

01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:03.650
seen the playing field level.

01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:06.100
I think it's been
easier for teams

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.670
to sort of catch up
along those lines.

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:10.990
I think it's going to be--

01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:14.380
it's going to be in sort of
the areas that are a little bit

01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:16.930
more parallel to sports.

01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:19.610
I brought up before about
monitoring players' sleep

01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:20.860
patterns and things like that.

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:23.900
I mean it's going to be the
things that a lot of teams

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:26.530
look at and say--

01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:28.780
maybe they're not willing
to go that extra mile

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:30.550
or just look at that
aspect of sports

01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:33.320
or to understand, how
does this actually work?

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.530
How can we apply this,
practically speaking,

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:37.030
in a basketball sense?

01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:39.220
Those are the places that
the Warriors are starting

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:43.810
to look at, and it's also
things like virtual reality

01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:46.550
and things like that, and it's
about trying to understand,

01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:49.660
are there ways to
play basketball

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:50.690
that are more efficient?

01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:53.950
Are there concepts-- it's
about, are there ways

01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:56.800
that we can improve our
practice and training regimen?

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.534
And is that going to help our
team excel in some way that,

01:06:59.534 --> 01:07:00.700
perhaps, other teams aren't?

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:03.430
And I just think
that they really

01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:05.050
sort of value their geography.

01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:08.140
I think that it would be really
easy for some organization

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:11.386
to sort of be here and say
that, we're going to do things

01:07:11.386 --> 01:07:13.510
our way, or we're going to
keep things proprietary,

01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:15.200
that sort of thing.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.110
But they don't look at
that as competition.

01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:19.070
They really look at
it as collaboration.

01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:20.620
And so that's why
I think they like

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.480
to work with a lot of
these third parties,

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:26.140
and they don't expect that
any of these partnerships

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:29.020
are going to necessarily
change the moon and the stars.

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.300
But they understand
that if there

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.369
are ways that they can
incrementally get better, then

01:07:34.369 --> 01:07:35.410
they're going to do that.

01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:36.784
And at this point,
all the time--

01:07:39.887 --> 01:07:41.470
they don't really
have a lot more room

01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:43.600
to improve at this point,
which in some ways,

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.540
makes the equation a little bit
harder, not about motivation,

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:49.130
but practically speaking,
how much better can you get?

01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:52.480
You've had a team
that won 73 games.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.230
Are they going to
go 74 wins now?

01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:57.220
I mean I don't think anyone
really expects them to do that.

01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:58.947
I don't think that
they look at it--

01:07:58.947 --> 01:08:01.030
I think they've stopped
looking at basketball sort

01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:02.800
of in a micro sense
and sort of, how

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.260
can we change this little
thing and that little thing?

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:08.470
I think that they're looking
at it in a more long term macro

01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:12.190
sense and understanding that
their place in basketball

01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:16.330
history, the discussion of
the all-time great teams,

01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:19.510
their place in that
discussion is--

01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:20.560
it is still unwritten.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.439
I mean we don't know what the
ending is for this franchise

01:08:23.439 --> 01:08:24.370
and this organization.

01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:26.680
And I think they're
understanding

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:30.290
that a lot of this can come
crashing down pretty quickly.

01:08:30.290 --> 01:08:33.649
I think these things always
rise up faster than we think,

01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:36.390
and they can kind of end
faster than we think.

01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:38.140
Even though we feel
like the Warriors have

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:39.598
been good for so
long, they've only

01:08:39.598 --> 01:08:40.926
been elite for three years.

01:08:40.926 --> 01:08:42.550
They've only made
the playoffs-- you'll

01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:44.410
get a team like the
Spurs, who've made

01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:45.729
the playoffs 20 years in a row.

01:08:45.729 --> 01:08:46.300
What is it?

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.600
18 straight years
of 50 wins or more.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.950
The Warriors-- their
playoff streak at the moment

01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:52.340
is only five years.

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:54.520
So this thing is
pretty ephemeral,

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.979
but at the same time,
these things can burn fast,

01:08:56.979 --> 01:08:59.630
and they can burn
out pretty quickly.

01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:02.040
So I think they understand
that in some ways,

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:05.148
it really is up to them
what direction this goes.

01:09:05.148 --> 01:09:06.939
Are they going to be
a team like the Spurs?

01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:08.590
Are they going to
be a team that--

01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:10.029
are they going to turn
over their roster?

01:09:10.029 --> 01:09:12.237
Is that going to be how they
hold their advantage now

01:09:12.237 --> 01:09:14.109
is going to be a
Spursian kind of, well,

01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:16.432
we're just going to be
consistently excellent,

01:09:16.432 --> 01:09:18.640
and we're going to have a
puncher's chance every year

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.723
of winning a championship.

01:09:19.723 --> 01:09:23.260
Or do they go like
full Jordan era bulls,

01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:26.109
where they try to win
six titles in eight years

01:09:26.109 --> 01:09:27.020
or whatever it was?

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.350
And now you look at
the Bulls, they're

01:09:29.350 --> 01:09:31.540
probably the worst team
in the NBA talent-wise.

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:34.210
But they had their
run of success.

01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:35.890
They had their
impact on the NBA,

01:09:35.890 --> 01:09:39.254
and no one's ever going to
take that away from them.

01:09:39.254 --> 01:09:40.420
But what do they want to be?

01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:43.899
Do they want to be the team
that burns fast and burns out?

01:09:43.899 --> 01:09:46.620
Or do they want to create
something that is more lasting?

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:49.540
I think at this point in
time, if you were to guess,

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.189
they're trying to do the latter.

01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:55.640
They're trying to see more of
that Spursian kind of model.

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:58.090
But like I said, things can
change so quickly in the NBA.

01:09:58.090 --> 01:10:00.173
Sometimes we don't know
where that next innovation

01:10:00.173 --> 01:10:01.290
is going to come from.

01:10:01.290 --> 01:10:03.112
I think that they
think and they hope

01:10:03.112 --> 01:10:05.570
that they're going to be the
ones to embrace that, whatever

01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:07.820
it might be.

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:09.950
But these things
can be unexpected.

01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:12.080
So you just never
know sometimes.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.670
DAVID BARRY: Are you bullish?

01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:14.920
ERIK MALINOWSKI: I am bullish.

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.020
I think that you can't help but
sort of look at what they've

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:21.200
done these last three to
five years and seven years

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.110
since the owners have come
in, but to look at them

01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:25.220
and say that--

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:28.340
it's clear that there's
more at play here

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:29.930
than just getting
in talented guys,

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:32.513
that there is an effect that the
front office and the coaching

01:10:32.513 --> 01:10:35.360
staff has that they have
an important role to play,

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.180
and that as long as you keep, if
not those same people in power

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:43.280
and making decisions, but
similar people that just

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.299
embrace that sort of
mindset and that philosophy.

01:10:46.299 --> 01:10:47.840
Maybe it's not a
guy like Steve Kerr,

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.895
but it's one of his disciples,
or it's some part of the Steve

01:10:49.895 --> 01:10:50.750
Kerr coaching tree.

01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:53.930
Or we just saw Jerry
West left this summer.

01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:56.240
He left, and now he's
gone to the LA Clippers

01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.060
to be an advisor for them.

01:10:58.060 --> 01:10:59.810
Now, you're going to
see other guys that--

01:10:59.810 --> 01:11:02.270
Kirk Lacob is going
to have a larger role

01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:03.650
to say in the organization.

01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:06.470
You're going to go see a guy
like Larry Harris, who is not

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:08.210
maybe sort of a household
name to a lot of these guys,

01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:09.830
but he's going to have a
bigger role to play now.

01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:11.955
And he's been a guy that's
been around a few years.

01:11:11.955 --> 01:11:13.106
So you're going to have--

01:11:13.106 --> 01:11:14.480
now you're going
to start to see,

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:17.540
as success breeds
more defections,

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.710
and people want a piece
of what the Warriors have,

01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:20.480
and they start--

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.814
like I said, Travis
Schlenk, who has

01:11:22.814 --> 01:11:23.980
been the worst for 13 years.

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.470
Now he's the general manager
of the Atlanta Hawks.

01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:29.390
Now that he's trying
to change them

01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:31.857
in a way that he's learned,
not only under this ownership,

01:11:31.857 --> 01:11:33.940
but he was a holdover from
the previous ownership.

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:36.330
So this is a guy who
knows not what to do,

01:11:36.330 --> 01:11:37.762
but also what not to do.

01:11:37.762 --> 01:11:39.470
But you're going to
have these guys start

01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:41.330
to impart these
lessons across the NBA,

01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:45.260
and so the onus is going to be
on the Warriors to bring in--

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:47.930
to keep that going, to bring
in guys that understand that,

01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:51.480
to keep creating the next
generation of NBA executives.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.900
And I think, in
some ways, that's

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:56.000
a lot easier said than done.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.610
But based on their most
recent track record,

01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:01.026
it's hard to bet against them.

01:12:01.026 --> 01:12:02.900
DAVID BARRY: Well, thank
you, Mr. Malinowski.

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:04.910
Let's give him one
more round of applause.

01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:08.560
[APPLAUSE]
