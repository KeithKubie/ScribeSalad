00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here we have our two charges - a positive and a negative.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And let's assume they're equal in size so the positive charge

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is as positive as the negative charge is negative.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now might be a good time to introduce the Coulomb, which is the unit of charge.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We could say that this is a charge of +1 Coulomb and this is a charge of -1 Coulomb.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now let's make things interesting.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's say that another charge, a third mystery charge arrives on the scene.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm not going to tell you if this is a positive or a negative charge.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I want to know what direction is the net force on this mystery charge.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Is it up? Is it down? Maybe there's no force at all.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Or maybe it depends on whether this mystery charge is positive or negative?

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Think about this one and give me your best guess. I warn you it is a bit tricky.
