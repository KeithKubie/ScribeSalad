00:00:00.865 --> 00:00:01.706
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

00:00:01.706 --> 00:00:03.524
So I'm talking about how
to find the tangent plane

00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:04.457
to a graph.

00:00:04.457 --> 00:00:05.290
And I think the first step
of that is to just figure

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.189
out how we control planes
in three dimensions

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:10.224
in the first place.

00:00:10.224 --> 00:00:13.071
So what I have pictured here
is a red dot representing

00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:15.102
a point in three dimensions,

00:00:15.102 --> 00:00:16.735
and the coordinates of that point,

00:00:16.735 --> 00:00:18.152
easily enough are

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.866
one two three.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.549
So the x coordinate is
one, the y coordinate's two

00:00:24.549 --> 00:00:26.293
and the z coordinate is three.

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:28.285
And then I have a plane
that passes through it.

00:00:28.285 --> 00:00:29.831
And the goal of the video is going to be

00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:31.051
to find a function,

00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:32.715
a function that I'll call l,

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:35.868
that takes in a two dimensional input

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:37.051
x and y

00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:41.768
and this function l should
have this plane as it's graph.

00:00:41.768 --> 00:00:42.825
Now the first thing to notice

00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:44.289
is that there's lots of different planes

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:45.879
that could be passing
through this point, right?

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.996
At the moment it's one that's
got a certain kind of angle,

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:50.394
you could think of it
going up in one direction,

00:00:50.394 --> 00:00:52.098
but you could give this a
lot of different directions,

00:00:52.098 --> 00:00:53.678
and get a lot of different planes,

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:55.629
that all pass through that one point.

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:56.767
So we're going to need to find

00:00:56.767 --> 00:00:58.109
some way of distinguishing

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.858
the specific one that we're looking at,

00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:01.366
which is this one right here,

00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.726
from other possible planes
that can pass through it.

00:01:03.726 --> 00:01:05.661
And as we work through you'll see

00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:08.603
how this is done in terms
of partial derivatives.

00:01:08.603 --> 00:01:10.351
But as we are getting our head around

00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:12.503
what the formula for this graph can be,

00:01:12.503 --> 00:01:14.373
let's just start observing properties

00:01:14.373 --> 00:01:15.386
that it has.

00:01:15.386 --> 00:01:16.566
The first property

00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.679
is that the graph actually
passes through this point,

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:19.817
one, two, three.

00:01:19.817 --> 00:01:22.825
And what that means in terms
of functions over here,

00:01:22.825 --> 00:01:26.683
is that if you evaluated
at the point one two,

00:01:26.683 --> 00:01:29.163
the input pair where both
x is one and y is two,

00:01:29.163 --> 00:01:31.560
then it should equal three.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.839
It should equal three
because that's telling you

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:37.249
that when you go x equals
one and y equals two

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:39.362
and then you say what's
the height of the graph

00:01:39.362 --> 00:01:40.195
above that point,

00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:41.764
it should be the z coordinate

00:01:41.764 --> 00:01:43.186
at the end of the desired point.

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:45.057
So this right here is the fact number one,

00:01:45.057 --> 00:01:46.559
that we can take into consideration.

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:47.494
And beyond that,

00:01:47.494 --> 00:01:49.889
let's start thinking
about what makes planes,

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:51.516
what makes these kind of flat graphs,

00:01:51.516 --> 00:01:52.980
different from the sort of curvy graphs

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.721
that you might be used to in
other multi-variable function.

00:01:56.721 --> 00:01:58.065
The main idea is that if you intersect

00:01:58.065 --> 00:01:59.406
it with another plane,

00:01:59.406 --> 00:02:00.992
so here I'm going to intersect it with

00:02:00.992 --> 00:02:04.283
y equals two, this kind of constant plane,

00:02:04.283 --> 00:02:06.808
and so I'll go ahead and write that down.

00:02:06.808 --> 00:02:07.948
That plane that you're looking at,

00:02:07.948 --> 00:02:09.281
is y equals two.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.017
And you can think of this as representing,

00:02:12.017 --> 00:02:14.538
what is movement in the
x direction look like.

00:02:14.538 --> 00:02:16.441
As we move along the x direction,

00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:17.904
this kind of has a slope.

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:20.955
The two planes intersect along a line,

00:02:20.955 --> 00:02:22.825
and that's one of the
crucial features of a plane,

00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:24.735
is that if you intersect
it with another plane,

00:02:24.735 --> 00:02:26.482
you just get a straight line,

00:02:26.482 --> 00:02:28.109
meaning the slope is constant,

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.815
as you move in the x direction.

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:31.398
But it's also constant, that same slope,

00:02:31.398 --> 00:02:32.415
if you move in the y direction.

00:02:32.415 --> 00:02:33.799
If I had chosen a different plane.

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.810
If instead I had chosen y equals one,

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.045
which looks like this,

00:02:39.045 --> 00:02:41.275
then you get a line with the same slope.

00:02:41.275 --> 00:02:43.788
And no matter what constant
value of y you choose,

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:45.699
it's always intersecting that plane,

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.506
with a line that has the same slope.

00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:49.400
And now if you look back

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.305
to the videos on partial derivatives,

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:52.160
and in particular

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.251
on how you interpret the partial
derivative of a function,

00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:56.835
with respect to it's graph,

00:02:56.835 --> 00:02:59.032
what this is telling
you is that when we take

00:02:59.032 --> 00:03:02.933
the partial derivative
of l with respect to x,

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:06.427
because constant y means you
are moving in the x direction,

00:03:06.427 --> 00:03:08.133
this should just be some kind of constant.

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:09.754
Some kind of constant a.

00:03:09.754 --> 00:03:13.921
I'll kind of emphasize that
that is a constant value here.

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:16.785
And the same goes in the
other direction, right.

00:03:16.785 --> 00:03:18.533
Let's say instead of intersecting it with

00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:19.875
constant values of y,

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:21.663
we say well what if
you intersected it with

00:03:21.663 --> 00:03:24.507
a constant value of x, like x equals one.

00:03:24.507 --> 00:03:25.970
Well in that case what you should get,

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.189
'cos you're intersecting it with a plane,

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.101
is another straight line,

00:03:29.101 --> 00:03:31.425
so these two planes are
intersecting along a straight line,

00:03:31.425 --> 00:03:33.582
which means as you move
in the y direction,

00:03:33.582 --> 00:03:35.537
this slope won't change.

00:03:35.537 --> 00:03:37.245
But also as you move in the x direction,

00:03:37.245 --> 00:03:38.789
if you imaginee slicing it with
a bunch of different planes,

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:42.298
all representing different
constant values of x,

00:03:42.298 --> 00:03:45.214
you would be getting a
line with that same slope.

00:03:45.214 --> 00:03:47.048
And that's telling you
another powerful fact.

00:03:47.048 --> 00:03:49.079
The partial derivative
of l, with respect to y,

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.704
now if you're moving in the y direction,

00:03:50.704 --> 00:03:52.004
that's equal to some other constant,

00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:53.589
that I'm going to call b.

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:54.686
And now, keep in mind,

00:03:54.686 --> 00:03:56.387
these are very powerful statements,

00:03:56.387 --> 00:03:58.661
because the partial derivative
of l with respect to x

00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:00.205
is a function,

00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:01.665
this is a function of x and y,

00:04:01.665 --> 00:04:03.860
and that might actually
be worth emphasizing here,

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.935
that the partial derivative
of x with respect to y

00:04:05.935 --> 00:04:08.980
is something that you evaluate at

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.156
a point in two dimensional space.

00:04:12.156 --> 00:04:13.738
And we're saying that
that's equal to some kind

00:04:13.738 --> 00:04:14.958
of constant value.

00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.177
Now that's a pretty powerful thing right?

00:04:16.177 --> 00:04:18.048
Because it's telling you,
it's giving you control over

00:04:18.048 --> 00:04:20.080
the function at all possible input points,

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.556
for movement in a specified direction.

00:04:22.556 --> 00:04:23.694
And the same goes over here.

00:04:23.694 --> 00:04:26.051
This is telling you that. A
function is constantly equal

00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:30.218
to some value b, and we're
not sure what this value b is.

00:04:31.585 --> 00:04:33.356
But just geometrically

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.492
we can estimate what
these things should be.

00:04:35.492 --> 00:04:36.999
So if I take back the plane representing

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:39.761
a constant y value, and
we say what's the slope,

00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:42.197
you're moving in the x direction,

00:04:42.197 --> 00:04:43.703
we've got a constant y value,

00:04:43.703 --> 00:04:46.817
what is the slope at which this
plane intersects our graph?

00:04:46.817 --> 00:04:49.353
I would estimate this as
about the slope of two.

00:04:49.353 --> 00:04:52.075
You know you go over
one and it goes up two.

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:53.334
So what that would tell you is that,

00:04:53.334 --> 00:04:55.445
at least in the specific
graph we're looking at,

00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:58.621
this is at least
approximately equal to two.

00:04:58.621 --> 00:05:02.524
And then similarly if we
look at constant x value,

00:05:02.524 --> 00:05:06.419
and we say that represents
movement in the y direction,

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.573
what is the slope there.

00:05:08.573 --> 00:05:10.646
This looks to me like about one,

00:05:10.646 --> 00:05:11.498
as a slope.

00:05:11.498 --> 00:05:13.533
You kind of move over one
unit you go up one unit.

00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:15.931
So I'd say down here
that the constant value

00:05:15.931 --> 00:05:18.328
of the partial derivative
with respect to y

00:05:18.328 --> 00:05:20.198
is about equal to one.

00:05:20.198 --> 00:05:22.030
So we have three different facts here,

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.161
the value of the function
at the point of one two,

00:05:25.161 --> 00:05:28.415
the value of its partial
derivative with respect to x

00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:29.472
everywhere,

00:05:29.472 --> 00:05:32.317
and the partial derivative
with respect to y, everywhere.

00:05:32.317 --> 00:05:34.148
And this information
is actually going to be

00:05:34.148 --> 00:05:37.293
enough to tell us what the
function as a whole should equal.

00:05:37.293 --> 00:05:40.846
Now specifically, this idea
that the partial derivative

00:05:40.846 --> 00:05:42.563
with respect to x is constant,

00:05:42.563 --> 00:05:45.396
tells us that the function l of xy

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:48.175
is going to equal

00:05:48.175 --> 00:05:51.873
two times x plus something that
doesn't have any x's in it,

00:05:51.873 --> 00:05:54.427
something that as far as x
is concerned is constant,

00:05:54.427 --> 00:05:57.028
because the only thing whose
derivative, with respect to x,

00:05:57.028 --> 00:06:00.573
is the constant two is two x
plus something that's constant,

00:06:00.573 --> 00:06:02.432
as far as x is concerned.

00:06:02.432 --> 00:06:04.098
And then similarly over here,

00:06:04.098 --> 00:06:07.309
if the partial with respect
to y is the constant one,

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:10.722
then that tells you that the
whole function looks like

00:06:10.722 --> 00:06:13.403
this looks like a constant
as far as y is concerned.

00:06:13.403 --> 00:06:17.570
So once we bring in y, it's
going to be one times y

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:21.857
plus something that's constant,
as far as y is concerned.

00:06:21.857 --> 00:06:23.238
You know this part is already constant,

00:06:23.238 --> 00:06:24.538
as far as y is concerned,

00:06:24.538 --> 00:06:27.423
so anything that I add beyond
here has to be constant

00:06:27.423 --> 00:06:29.538
as far as both x and y is concerned.

00:06:29.538 --> 00:06:32.218
So that part has to actually
literally be a constant.

00:06:32.218 --> 00:06:35.672
So I'm just going to put in c for that,

00:06:35.672 --> 00:06:38.271
to represent constant.

00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:39.816
So, you can see this is a very

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:41.324
restricted property on our function,

00:06:41.324 --> 00:06:42.947
because the only place x can show up

00:06:42.947 --> 00:06:45.381
is this linear term and the
only place y can show up

00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:47.415
is as this linear term.

00:06:47.415 --> 00:06:48.797
And when I use the word linear,

00:06:48.797 --> 00:06:52.169
you can pretty much interpret
as saying the term x shows up

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:54.404
without an exponent or without
anything fancy happening

00:06:54.404 --> 00:06:55.237
to it.

00:06:55.237 --> 00:06:56.599
It's just x times a constant,

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.179
that's pretty much what I mean by linear.

00:06:58.179 --> 00:07:00.537
It's got more precise
formulations in other contexts,

00:07:00.537 --> 00:07:02.125
but as far as we're concerned here,

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:03.386
you can just think of it as meaning

00:07:03.386 --> 00:07:05.744
variable times a constant.

00:07:05.744 --> 00:07:08.350
So the question is what should this c be.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.901
And you can imagine that we can,

00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:10.958
based on this property,

00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.703
based on the value at the point one two,

00:07:12.703 --> 00:07:14.936
we can uniquely determine c.

00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:17.738
And you can plug in, x
equals one, y equals two,

00:07:17.738 --> 00:07:21.390
know that this has to equal
three and solve for c.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.378
Which we could do but
I'm going to actually

00:07:23.378 --> 00:07:25.043
do something a little bit more convenient.

00:07:25.043 --> 00:07:27.238
I'm going to kind of shift around where

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:28.456
the constants show up,
and I'm going to say

00:07:28.456 --> 00:07:30.529
that the whole function should equal

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:32.929
two times and then I'm
going to put a constant

00:07:32.929 --> 00:07:33.783
in with the x,

00:07:33.783 --> 00:07:36.995
I'm going to say x minus one,

00:07:36.995 --> 00:07:38.544
and then I'm going to do
the same thing with y,

00:07:38.544 --> 00:07:40.128
and I'm going to say plus one,

00:07:40.128 --> 00:07:43.423
here is the partial
derivative with respect to y,

00:07:43.423 --> 00:07:46.759
y minus and then I'm going to say two.

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:48.102
And the reason I'm doing this,

00:07:48.102 --> 00:07:49.525
notice this doesn't change

00:07:49.525 --> 00:07:50.948
the partial derivative information,

00:07:50.948 --> 00:07:52.822
it's just if we take
the partial derivative

00:07:52.822 --> 00:07:55.145
with respect to x, this will still be two,

00:07:55.145 --> 00:07:56.570
and when we take it with respect to y,

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.034
this will still be one.

00:07:58.034 --> 00:07:59.617
But the reason I'm putting these in here,

00:07:59.617 --> 00:08:03.518
is because we're gonna evaluate
it at the point one two

00:08:03.518 --> 00:08:05.186
so I want to make it
look as easy as possible

00:08:05.186 --> 00:08:07.703
to evaluate at the point one two.

00:08:07.703 --> 00:08:09.291
And then from here I'm
just going to add another

00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:11.693
constant, so instead of saying c

00:08:11.693 --> 00:08:13.642
because this is going to be
slightly different from c,

00:08:13.642 --> 00:08:14.781
I'll call it k.

00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:16.527
But the idea is that I'm
just moving around constants.

00:08:16.527 --> 00:08:19.250
If you imagined distributing
the multiplication here,

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.606
and having two times that negative one,

00:08:21.606 --> 00:08:23.396
and one times that negative two,

00:08:23.396 --> 00:08:25.102
you're just changing what
the value of the constant

00:08:25.102 --> 00:08:26.567
stuck on the end here is.

00:08:26.567 --> 00:08:27.749
Now the important part,

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:29.495
the reason that I'm writing it this way,

00:08:29.495 --> 00:08:30.919
which is only slightly different,

00:08:30.919 --> 00:08:34.380
is because then when I evaluate this,

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.837
at l of one two, this whole first part,

00:08:37.837 --> 00:08:40.602
cancels out because
plugging in x equals one

00:08:40.602 --> 00:08:42.717
means this whole part goes to zero.

00:08:42.717 --> 00:08:43.896
Same with the second part,

00:08:43.896 --> 00:08:45.242
because when I plug in y equals two,

00:08:45.242 --> 00:08:46.624
this part goes to zero.

00:08:46.624 --> 00:08:49.712
So k this other constant,
that I'm tagging on the end,

00:08:49.712 --> 00:08:52.313
is going to completely
specify what happens

00:08:52.313 --> 00:08:53.856
when I evaluate this at the point one two.

00:08:53.856 --> 00:08:56.055
And of course I want it to be the case,

00:08:56.055 --> 00:08:58.664
when I evaluate at one two I get three.

00:08:58.664 --> 00:09:00.533
I want it to be the case
when I evaluate at one two,

00:09:00.533 --> 00:09:01.961
I get three.

00:09:01.961 --> 00:09:04.902
So that tells me, that this constant

00:09:04.902 --> 00:09:07.159
k here should just equal 3.

00:09:07.159 --> 00:09:09.843
So notice the way that I've
written the function here,

00:09:09.843 --> 00:09:10.778
is actually quite powerful.

00:09:10.778 --> 00:09:11.955
We have a lot of control.

00:09:11.955 --> 00:09:14.842
This term two was telling us the slope

00:09:14.842 --> 00:09:16.264
with respect to x.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.421
So when you moved purely
in the x direction,

00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:20.044
and that was kind of illustrated here,

00:09:20.044 --> 00:09:21.264
purely in the x direction,

00:09:21.264 --> 00:09:23.541
that's telling us the
slope with respect to x,

00:09:23.541 --> 00:09:25.082
and then this term one here,

00:09:25.082 --> 00:09:27.477
was telling us the
slope with respect to y.

00:09:27.477 --> 00:09:29.630
So when we moved purely
in the y direction,

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.135
that's telling us the slope there.

00:09:31.135 --> 00:09:32.926
And we could just turn those knobs if we

00:09:32.926 --> 00:09:34.833
change the two and we change the one,

00:09:34.833 --> 00:09:36.583
that's what's going to allow us to

00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:39.920
basically change what the
slopes of the plane are.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.180
I'm going to say slopes plural

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.823
because it's with respect to
the x and the y direction.

00:09:43.823 --> 00:09:46.103
And that will give us control
of various different planes

00:09:46.103 --> 00:09:46.956
that pass through.

00:09:46.956 --> 00:09:50.327
If I'm looking at the one right here,

00:09:50.327 --> 00:09:54.230
then the movement in the y
direction is very shallow,

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.142
so that would be turning this knob lower,

00:09:56.142 --> 00:09:58.503
and instead of one it
might be point zero one.

00:09:58.503 --> 00:10:00.662
And if I were looking at
movement in the x direction,

00:10:00.662 --> 00:10:02.165
you know this looks actually negative.

00:10:02.165 --> 00:10:03.794
So this would tell you
that it's going to be

00:10:03.794 --> 00:10:05.054
some kind of negative number.

00:10:05.054 --> 00:10:06.922
So you can kind of dial
these knobs and that changes

00:10:06.922 --> 00:10:10.053
the different planes that
pass through that same point.

00:10:10.053 --> 00:10:13.141
And then, plugging in
this one two and three,

00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:14.807
tells us what point we're specifying.

00:10:14.807 --> 00:10:17.082
We're basically saying when
you input x equals one,

00:10:17.082 --> 00:10:18.629
and you input y equals 2,

00:10:18.629 --> 00:10:20.340
the whole thing should equal three.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.497
So this form right here's
is powerful enough that

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:25.258
I want you to remember
it for the next video.

00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:26.847
I want you to remember the
idea of writing things down

00:10:26.847 --> 00:10:28.636
in this way where you specify

00:10:28.636 --> 00:10:29.816
the point its passing through

00:10:29.816 --> 00:10:32.787
with it's x coordinate y
coordinate and z coordinate,

00:10:32.787 --> 00:10:33.683
placed where they are,

00:10:33.683 --> 00:10:36.363
and then you tweak the slopes,
using these coefficients

00:10:36.363 --> 00:10:37.802
out front.

00:10:37.802 --> 00:10:39.264
So with that, I will see you next video.
