00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:12.219
&gt;&gt;Donald Kaberuka: Look, I'm confident that
2009 will be the beginning of recovery, but

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:18.520
very, very slow. I think the next couple of
years will be quite difficult. The numbers

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:28.020
at this point I think look quite somber: about
3.5 percent in 2009. With it probably one

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.550
or two percentage points higher in 2010. So
2009 is not yet a year when I could say we

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.329
are out of the woods. Certainly not.
