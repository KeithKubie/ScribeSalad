00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:01.417
- [Voiceover] So let's
go ahead and work through

00:00:01.417 --> 00:00:03.275
an actual curl computation.

00:00:03.275 --> 00:00:05.574
Let's say our vector valued function V,

00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:07.013
which is a function of X, Y, and Z,

00:00:07.013 --> 00:00:08.848
this is gonna be three-dimensional,

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:11.309
is defined by the functions, I don't know,

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.979
let's say the first
component is X times Y.

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.893
The second one is

00:00:15.893 --> 00:00:16.893
cosine of Z,

00:00:19.223 --> 00:00:23.223
and then the last component
is Z squared plus Y.

00:00:24.261 --> 00:00:25.655
Let's say.

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:27.280
So if you take this guy,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.530
how do you compute the curl

00:00:31.074 --> 00:00:33.817
of that vector valued function?

00:00:33.817 --> 00:00:35.767
So what you do, as I
mentioned in the last video,

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:38.693
is you imagine taking this del operator

00:00:38.693 --> 00:00:40.853
and taking the cross product between that

00:00:40.853 --> 00:00:42.501
and your vector valued function.

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:44.405
And what that means when you expand it

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:46.867
is that del operator,
you just kinda fill it

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:49.514
with partial differential
operators, you could say,

00:00:49.514 --> 00:00:51.511
but really it's just the
symbol partial partial X,

00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:53.011
partial partial Y,

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:56.446
partial partial Z.

00:00:56.446 --> 00:00:57.979
And these are things that are just waiting

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:59.628
to take in some kind of function.

00:00:59.628 --> 00:01:01.810
So we're gonna take the
cross product between that

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.109
and the function that
we have defined here.

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:07.442
So I'm gonna just actually copy it over,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.460
copy it over here.

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.288
And a little residue.

00:01:14.288 --> 00:01:16.030
And to compute this cross product,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.003
we take a certain determinant.

00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:20.070
So I'm gonna write over here determinant,

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.160
and it's gonna be of a
three-by-three matrix,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.412
but really it's kinda like
a quote-unquote matrix,

00:01:24.412 --> 00:01:26.572
because each component
has something funky.

00:01:26.572 --> 00:01:28.192
So the top row, just like we would have

00:01:28.192 --> 00:01:30.746
with any other cross
product that we're computing

00:01:30.746 --> 00:01:33.625
is gonna have i, j, and
k, these unit vectors

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:35.135
in three-dimensional space.

00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:36.504
And the second row here is gonna have

00:01:36.504 --> 00:01:38.548
all of these partial
differential operators,

00:01:38.548 --> 00:01:41.381
since that's the first
vector in our cross product.

00:01:41.381 --> 00:01:43.714
So that's partial partial X,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.009
partial partial Y,

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.565
and again, all of these are just kind of

00:01:48.565 --> 00:01:50.027
waiting to be given a function

00:01:50.027 --> 00:01:52.558
that they can take the derivative of.

00:01:52.558 --> 00:01:53.789
And then that third row is gonna be

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:54.950
the functions that we have.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.783
So the first component here is XY,

00:01:59.107 --> 00:02:02.032
the second component is cosine of Z,

00:02:02.032 --> 00:02:03.032
cosine of Z,

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.930
and then that final component
is Z squared plus Y.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.763
Z squared

00:02:09.602 --> 00:02:10.786
plus Y.

00:02:10.786 --> 00:02:12.226
Now let's all get some room here,

00:02:12.226 --> 00:02:14.524
maybe make it more visible.

00:02:14.524 --> 00:02:16.664
So this is the determinant
we need to compute.

00:02:16.664 --> 00:02:19.233
And this is gonna be broken
up into three different parts.

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:20.933
The first one,

00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:23.016
we take this top part, i,

00:02:24.187 --> 00:02:28.371
and multiply it by the
determinant of this sub-matrix.

00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:31.319
So when we do that, this sub-determinant,

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.781
we're taking partial
derivative with respect to Y

00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:35.638
of Z squared plus Y.

00:02:35.638 --> 00:02:37.101
Now as far as Y is concerned,

00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:38.239
Z looks like a constant.

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.818
So Z squared is a constant,

00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:42.813
and the partial derivative of
this entire guy is just one.

00:02:42.813 --> 00:02:45.019
So that'll look like one.

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.202
And then we're subtracting
off the partial derivative

00:02:47.202 --> 00:02:49.779
with respect to Z of cosine of Z,

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:52.124
and that just looks the
same as a derivative

00:02:52.124 --> 00:02:54.725
of cosine Z, which is negative sine,

00:02:54.725 --> 00:02:57.381
so that's negative sine

00:02:57.381 --> 00:02:58.214
of Z.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.932
So that's the first part.

00:03:01.932 --> 00:03:04.463
And then as the next
part, we're gonna take j,

00:03:04.463 --> 00:03:06.739
but we're subtracting, 'cause
you're always kinda thinking

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.454
plus, minus, plus, when you're
doing these determinants.

00:03:10.454 --> 00:03:13.171
So we're gonna subtract off j,

00:03:13.171 --> 00:03:15.307
multiplied by its own
little sub-determinant,

00:03:15.307 --> 00:03:18.140
and this time the
sub-determinant is gonna involve

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.462
the two columns that it's not part of.

00:03:20.462 --> 00:03:21.832
So you're imagining this first column

00:03:21.832 --> 00:03:24.177
and this second column as
being part of a matrix.

00:03:24.177 --> 00:03:25.942
So the first thing you do is you take

00:03:25.942 --> 00:03:27.846
this partial derivative with respect to X

00:03:27.846 --> 00:03:29.309
of Z squared plus Y.

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:30.516
Well no Xs show up there, right?

00:03:30.516 --> 00:03:31.909
That's Z squared and Y.

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.742
Each look like constants
as far as X is concerned.

00:03:34.742 --> 00:03:35.992
So that's zero.

00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:39.061
Then we take the partial with respect to Z

00:03:39.061 --> 00:03:40.454
of X times Y.

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:42.196
And again, there's no
Z that shows up there,

00:03:42.196 --> 00:03:46.677
so that's also zero, so we're
kinda subtracting off zero.

00:03:46.677 --> 00:03:49.556
And then finally, we're
adding this last component.

00:03:49.556 --> 00:03:52.575
We're gonna add that last component, k,

00:03:52.575 --> 00:03:55.454
multiplied by the determinant
of this sub-matrix

00:03:55.454 --> 00:03:57.474
of the columns that it's not part of.

00:03:57.474 --> 00:03:58.798
So this involves partial derivative

00:03:58.798 --> 00:04:01.497
with respect to X of cosine Z.

00:04:01.497 --> 00:04:04.748
Well no Xs show up there,
so that's just zero.

00:04:04.748 --> 00:04:06.583
So that's just a zero.

00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:08.301
And then we're subtracting off the partial

00:04:08.301 --> 00:04:11.064
with respect to Y of X times Y.

00:04:11.064 --> 00:04:13.456
Well X looks like a constant,
Y looks like the variable,

00:04:13.456 --> 00:04:15.870
so that partial derivative is just X.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.120
So we're subtracting off X.

00:04:19.888 --> 00:04:21.885
Which means if we simplify this,

00:04:21.885 --> 00:04:24.671
so the curl of our vector field,

00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:27.922
curl of our vector field as a whole,

00:04:27.922 --> 00:04:30.589
as this function of X, Y, and Z,

00:04:31.846 --> 00:04:33.285
is equal to,

00:04:33.285 --> 00:04:35.886
and that first component, the i component,

00:04:35.886 --> 00:04:38.138
we've got one minus negative sine of Z,

00:04:38.138 --> 00:04:39.903
so minus minus sine of Z.

00:04:39.903 --> 00:04:41.153
That's one plus

00:04:42.722 --> 00:04:43.555
sine of Z.

00:04:45.462 --> 00:04:47.505
And then the j component,
we're subtracting off,

00:04:47.505 --> 00:04:48.852
but it's zero.

00:04:48.852 --> 00:04:49.952
Usually if you're subtracting off,

00:04:49.952 --> 00:04:51.926
you'd have to make sure
to remember to flip those,

00:04:51.926 --> 00:04:55.107
but both of those are zero, so
the entire j component here,

00:04:55.107 --> 00:04:58.218
or the Y component of the output, is zero.

00:04:58.218 --> 00:05:02.385
And then finally, the k
component is zero minus X,

00:05:03.605 --> 00:05:06.938
so that entire thing is just negative X.

00:05:08.644 --> 00:05:09.759
And that's the curl of the function.

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.245
And in general, that's how you do it.

00:05:11.245 --> 00:05:13.938
You would take a look at the way

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:16.562
that your function is defined
in each component there,

00:05:16.562 --> 00:05:18.095
and imaging taking the cross product

00:05:18.095 --> 00:05:21.508
between this del symbol,
this partial partial X,

00:05:21.508 --> 00:05:23.412
partial partial Y, partial partial Z,

00:05:23.412 --> 00:05:24.420
and you take the cross product

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.184
between that and your function,

00:05:26.184 --> 00:05:29.389
and it involves taking six
different partial derivatives.

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.525
And mainly it's a matter of bookkeeping

00:05:31.525 --> 00:05:32.895
to make sure you do it right.

00:05:32.895 --> 00:05:34.828
And you'll end up with
something like this.
