RICHARD KASTELEIN: Hi, my name
is Richard Kastelein.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.640
I'm the founder of
hackfest.tv.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.250
And Hackfest has been
a journey for me

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.330
of about three years.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.590
I started publishing
Appmarket.tv three years ago,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.890
with the idea of looking into
and examining the media

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:36.420
convergence.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.220
So basically, TV apps,
connected TVs,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.840
smart TV, social TV.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.130
Multi-platform engagement in
transmedia, and how this whole

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.010
new eco system is evolving.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.550
One thing led to another.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.270
I never expected to be in
the events business.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.440
But I kept coming across all
these APIs and SDKs.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.740
And I'm like, wow, these
are fantastic.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.660
Developers need to have
more of this stuff.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.350
And I was writing
a lot about it.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.840
And thus the idea for TV
Hackfest was born.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.390
And we did the first show last
year in 2012 in London, along

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.690
with Transmedia Fest which was
great, because we had a lot of

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.699
creatives and writers
and stuff there.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.490
And this year we've come
to San Francisco.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.880
And we're going to be back in
London again after the summer.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.170
So it was kind of an organic
growth of an idea that just

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.150
came together.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.990
My main mission is to bring
together creative writers.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.190
People from the creative
community.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.230
Directors and producers into the
world of technology, and

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.120
vice versa.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.750
So they can understand
each other more.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.640
So it's a two way street.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.570
I also see TV as an industry
that's ripe for disruption.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.360
Music.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.000
Print.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.310
I used to be a journalist.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.150
I woke up one morning,
200 million bloggers.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.340
I went to the music industry.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.290
We know what happened there.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.398
I looked at TV and I went,
hmm you know what.

00:02:48.398 --> 00:02:49.970
I'm going to keep my
eye out there.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.330
So I started writing about
social TV three years ago--

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.550
four years ago now--

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.170
which was very early, the
concept of these worlds

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.060
meeting on the television
space.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.950
So that's basically the
story behind it.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.930
And we really hope to take the
Hackfest brand, or the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.880
Hackfest experience,
into other cities

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.910
next year as well.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:11.850
This year and next year.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.800
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.550
All right.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.050
So what are you hoping to see
from the contestants today?

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.030
RICHARD KASTELEIN: I would
like to see some great

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.380
examples of context.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.505
For me, people talk about second
screen and where does

00:03:23.505 --> 00:03:24.330
it become useful.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.780
And I don't engage with TV.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.230
And I only email.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.050
And it's true.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.050
The statistics prove it.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.820
Nielsen numbers show that people
aren't engaging with TV

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.630
on their second screen.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.850
Even though 88% of tablet owners
use their device while

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.970
watching TV once a month.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.510
And they have these phenomenal
numbers and things.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.100
Clearly they aren't
engaging with TV.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.260
I think there needs to be some
exploration of how to make

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.260
that marriage work, in terms
of companion experiences.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.570
And I think one of the things
that works really well is game

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.350
shows, like "The Million Pound
Drop" in the UK with 100,000

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.620
people playing in real time.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.580
But I also think context
is important.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.460
So how many times have you ever
got up from your TV, gone

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.796
somewhere, looked--

00:04:06.796 --> 00:04:08.970
gone online, sorry, not
gone somewhere--

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.690
gone online, looked up IMDb,
gone to Wikimedia, Wikipedia,

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.900
find out more information.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.300
I want that information
to be pushed.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.630
I don't want to have
to pull it.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.720
And I want that information
to be pushed to me in an

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.450
intelligent, timely manner.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.630
So I think ideas around
context are great.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.130
So TMS is here.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.250
They've got the data.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.810
We've got some great tools
around recognition technology.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.750
So let's see some
mix and match.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.596
And we'll see what
comes out of it.

00:04:33.596 --> 00:04:41.580
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.770
MARVIN FERRELL: I've been
writing for RootzWiki for a

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.360
very brief period of time now.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.460
But I'm happy to be with them.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.130
Kind of been writing around the
Android community for a

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.800
couple years now.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.920
So it's good to see that
going further.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.160
And I took an interest in Google
TV, though I'm not a

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.820
developer myself yet, anyway.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.330
I'm at the very cusp of
beginning that process.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.430
I have always been in my writing
career thus far, it's

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.240
always been involved with
websites that were

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.680
specifically geared toward
Android development and

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.650
Android developers.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.220
So at RootzWiki, our readership
is a great deal of

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.780
developers themselves, with apps
in the market or on the

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.320
RootzWiki forum.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.840
So that's kind of what our
articles are geared towards.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.950
So it's kind of a perfect
opportunity for me to give

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.490
them some feedback on my own
user experience with Google TV

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.640
since I began using it and
advocate for more development.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.210
Google TV is probably
my favorite Android

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.160
device that I own.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.400
I own several Android devices,
and I use Google TV every

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.650
single day.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.980
And I have since the
summer of 2011.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.310
So I've got a lot of experience
using it, yeah.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.490
First of all I replaced--

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.840
just to go over how I use
Google TV myself.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.420
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.010
my regular standard stock
launcher with Open Launcher,

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.516
by Entertailion.

00:06:10.516 --> 00:06:14.970
I also use Netflix
a whole lot.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.920
News Republic, YouTube, Chrome,
Evernote, Dropbox,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.090
Serenity, Plex, Snag, Control.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.410
[INAUDIBLE], Google TV,
remote, able remote.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.860
Chromemote for the Chrome
browser extension.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.590
Various web [INAUDIBLE],
you name it.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.370
Probably share a lot of YouTube
videos from my various

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.170
other devices.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.520
That's probably my
favorite featured

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.740
ability to share content.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.350
If I'm looking into something,
it's very easy for me to then

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.470
transfer that to my
Sony Google TV.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.370
And show other people that
are in the room.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.460
Or have it in a larger format.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.390
So basically from that
standpoint I'm very interested

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.410
in seeing Google TV
development grow.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.920
I'm actually a PC developer,
a web developer.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.150
Web designer.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.040
So I don't have a lot of
experience moving into Android

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.290
development.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.910
I've done a lot of interviews
with Android

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.200
developers over the years.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.170
I'm very connected into the
Android developement

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.360
community, I guess.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.000
I can say that.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.430
So I kind of use that as a
segue, maybe getting some of

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.360
those guys to bring some
of their stuff

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.870
into a Google TV format.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.160
Yeah.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.410
Carmen Delessio, the author of
that book, who I've had the

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.520
pleasure of speaking
with a few times.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.290
I originally wrote an article,
because I also volunteer for

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.430
another website, Google
TV Friends.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.540
You may have heard of Google
TV Friends as well.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.430
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.510
MARVIN FERRELL: I write a
few articles over there.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.050
So I got in touch with Carmen
first over there.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.080
And I thought that maybe if I
did something a little more in

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.780
depth, a little more hands on,
and kind of even some of that

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.040
stuff I'm looking at myself.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.120
Like I said as I'm trying to
get into development for

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.500
Google TV specifically.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.720
So I thought that it was good
to share that with other

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.730
people, especially developers
who are already established

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:15.700
and out there.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.950
And maybe get some attention
towards some of the features

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.180
and things I would like to
see added to Google TV.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.940
MALE SPEAKER: So what would
those features be?

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.280
MARVIN FERRELL: Most of these
things are things that I think

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.310
the development community, not
Google specifically, are

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:35.049
better positioned to bring us
in the way that I'd like to

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:36.299
see it, I guess.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.640
In the community we would love
to see some better Google

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.450
support, a dedicated
Gmail app.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.180
Google docs.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.310
More launchers.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.940
Some of the existing launchers
on the small Android screen

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.960
are fabulous.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.960
I would like to see some of the
innovation brought to the

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.770
big screen.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.750
As a matter of fact, I'm working
on an article right

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.860
now that's really basically
finished, it will probably

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.890
publish soon, about Google TV
launchers specifically.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.780
And how we would like to see
some of the creative ideas

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.990
that have been brought to the
Android small screen in terms

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:17.620
of launchers, and how much
better the performance some

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.040
developers can tend to squeeze
out of the launcher.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.180
In particular I cite Open
Launcher, which is currently,

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.380
as you may well know, another
launcher that is available for

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.930
Google TV, that really
brings some

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.740
features, an easier layout.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.810
I'll cite an example
for Open Launcher.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.580
My wife uses Android a lot.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.480
Android tablet.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.230
She uses her Android
tablet, 10" tablet.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.460
It's her favorite thing.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.890
For her, Open Launcher was a
little bit easier to grasp.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.660
It reminded her more of the
Android experience that she

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.260
was already used to.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.950
So seeing some more of that
kind of thing brought to

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.080
Google TV, because the creative
level that they take

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.180
in, they launch it on the small

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.870
screen, it's really nice.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.860
I think some of that could be
replicated on the big screen.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.090
Mostly, I think they haven't
even considered it.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.462
So that's where I'm trying
to start it.

00:10:14.462 --> 00:10:16.760
I'm trying to get more of them
to consider Google TV

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.040
development.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.960
I'd like to see them
consider it as a

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.420
lucrative thing as well.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.060
I mean there are legions of
Google TV fans that are just

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.670
waiting for some of these apps
to be made available on the

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:30.470
big screen.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:31.590
And we'll buy them.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.310
And that's kind of the point
that I'm getting at.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.630
So just to get them to even
consider Google TV development

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:42.590
as an option, as an option for
even more revenue, is more

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.040
what I'm trying to
get out there.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.550
And I think that's
what they do.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.710
I think a lot of developers
don't even give Google TV a

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.770
thought as they produce
apps for the tablet

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.100
and smartphone formats.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.810
So what I've tried to do with
my advocacy for Google TV is

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.090
kind of share my user
experience.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:06.900
I have about maybe 3,700
followers on Google+.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.330
And I try to let them know how
Google TV makes my day a

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.590
little bit brighter sometimes.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:16.690
It's a remarkable platform,
how it's developed.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.900
I'd like to see it
go a lot further.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.020
But I think what's missing is
that the people don't really

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.970
understand a lot.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.580
A lot of people haven't touched
smart TVs as yet.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.380
So they get to understand that
Google TV is how much it's

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.030
like Android and how many things
you can do with it.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.930
In the article I've cited an
example of my brother who

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:42.130
already owns a Sony Google TV,
but he purchased a Roku box.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.150
Mostly because he thought
he would get some more

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.490
hackability out of it.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.240
And he came to the conclusion
that his Google TV was a lot

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.200
more versatile than
he thought.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.670
So that's kind of what I think
is lacking, basically letting

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.890
the Android user-- because
there are a lot of us out

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.240
there who use Android
and we love it

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.380
and we swear by Android--

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.840
to get that same kind of energy
behind Google TV by

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.300
showing people that hey, it's
not that much different from

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.940
your tablet or smartphone.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.380
That's kind of where I think
we're missing it.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:22.885
So just kind of pushing the
format, letting people know it

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:26.410
is Android at its core.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.600
And it works basically
the same.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.370
And some of the versatility that
you can get out of it.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:38.420
It's interesting that you bring
up the SDK because in

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.140
another article that I wrote
recently on Google TV Friends,

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:45.170
specifically about Google TV
development, the focus of the

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.000
article is on some of the
changes you have made to the

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.900
SDK and kind of advanced it and
make it more accessible

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.990
for those other platforms.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.830
Apple and Linux, specifically.

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.140
So it's interesting that
you bring that up.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.840
I think I'd heard it was a
hurdle when they were trying

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.490
to, I don't know, something
with video playback or

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:05.950
something like that.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.750
That a lot of developers were
looking for the emulator to be

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:10.790
more functional for that.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.500
But I'm not sure because I'm not
really well versed in the

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.000
intricacies of what some of
the problems people were

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.900
having with the emulator were.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:23.020
But getting the word out there
that, like you said, it's just

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:28.830
as approachable as developing an
app for Android on any size

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.840
or scale, is important.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.330
And I think that's
lacking as well.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:38.790
And I see that as a hurdle for
Google TV to overcome.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:45.050
Other than that, there's some
different devices too.

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:48.370
I think for Google TV, when
Android first began it had

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.500
that same hurdle to leap.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.670
It's kind of the fragmentation
between devices.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.890
And different devices delivered
different levels of

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.790
performance.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.850
So you may have been an early
adopter who had a bad

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.130
experience.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.830
And now that Google TV has come
a long way, you're not

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.870
really aware of the progress
that has been made.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.230
So you kind of have a bad
taste in your mouth.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.100
And trying to get people to
overcome that is something

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.680
that I think needs to be done.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.800
Because Google TV is a
lot different now.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.500
It's a lot better.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.230
It's a lot faster and more
usable now than when I first

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.800
bought a Google TV.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.130
MALE SPEAKER: Which one
is your first one?

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.250
MARVIN FERRELL: Actually I'm
using the same one that I

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.790
initially bought.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:36.600
But the Honeycomb updates is
where I saw a turn around in

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.130
where I wanted it to go.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.520
It started to look more like
I wanted it to look.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.740
It started becoming a platform
that was easier for me to use

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.960
on a daily basis.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.330
Also the extension of my
other Android devices.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:49.880
This is important.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.130
This is something I
think is lacking.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:57.830
My Nexus 7 actually makes my
Google TV far more usable,

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.460
than the, for example the remote
control that came stock

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.310
with my TV.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.400
Let me see if I can show you.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.295
This deal.

00:15:04.295 --> 00:15:04.590
MALE SPEAKER: Mm-hmm.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.640
MARVIN FERRELL: Here.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.590
Not very user friendly.

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:15.200
But Google TV remote or able
remote, a third party app.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.810
Those two, like I said, my
family members primarily use

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.480
those now to control the TV.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.820
I mean it's just a
lot easier to do.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.130
And I think that we should
showcase that a little more.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.820
And that's one thing I want
to do at RootzWiki.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.260
In my case, I have
several TVs.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.530
The Google TV is kind
of my device.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:42.450
It's kind of an extension of
my Android collection until

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.200
it's time for Netflix or
something like that.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.010
So for me, I'm more of a
hardcore Google TV user.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:54.790
I use things like Evernote,
Dropbox, sideload apps and

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.040
things of that nature.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:01.060
This point you were making
about second screen apps.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:05.170
And that's kind of another big
deal that I've been speaking

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.370
out a lot about, because I like
what I've seen in the

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.780
early iterations of what
second screen apps were

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.630
looking like on Google TV.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.680
I mentioned, when you asked me
what apps I like to use, I

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:22.420
mentioned Control TV which has a
trivia game and a poker game

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.530
that use your Android device.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:28.860
Your poker hand is displayed
on your Android device.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.510
Everybody has a key.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.560
This is for people out there who
aren't familiar with it.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.710
Everybody enters a key and
their Android device

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.590
interfaces with the
television.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.550
Essentially the television
is the dealer.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.230
Now see that's an experience
that I'd like to see more of.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:47.040
It's a really, really great use
of the second screen app.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.170
And it's a great use of Google
TV, as a gaming platform.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.170
Kind of a group experience.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.830
And I really, really,
really enjoy that.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:01.050
Let's Draw is another one, that
kind of uses the tablet

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:05.890
or smartphone as a second
screen or controller.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.859
Sony has an app that they make,
that they also put out.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:13.050
It's basically just called
Smart TV remote.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:17.359
It has an on screen controller
on it that can be used across

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:19.880
other Google TV apps as well.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:24.280
So more things of that nature,
that make input and control a

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.089
little bit easier.

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:29.420
And also augment our
television watching

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:29.950
experience.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:33.460
Like I'm surprised that I
haven't seen GetGlue.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.260
This is a social network
that I've been a part

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.640
of for a long time.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.200
GetGlue is basically just about
earning achievements.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.150
They hand out these stickers for
checking in to programs or

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:46.080
books that you're reading.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.660
Or games that you're playing.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:52.080
You see that's an opportunity,
I think, that a lot of the

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.710
established brands
are missing.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.520
Because GetGlue could
be right in there.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.280
I could share it when I'm
watching from my TV screen.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.840
I could have that conversation
that I'm having on GetGlue on

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:06.265
my Nexus 7, with the person on
my TV instead of having to use

00:18:06.265 --> 00:18:08.160
a second Android device.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.750
And I just think that some of
the opportunities for Google

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.260
TV haven't caught on yet.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.360
And I'd like to see
more of it.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.300
I think we've basically got the
grasp of what we're trying

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.360
to do over at RootzWiki.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.225
What we're working on right now,
just far as the future of

00:18:24.225 --> 00:18:29.110
RootzWiki is concerned,
is a Google TV forum.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.220
A dedicated Google TV forum
is in the works.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.970
So I'm not sure where we are
along the process of

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.310
getting that done.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.990
But we'll be sharing that.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.450
And then if people know about
that as soon as we get it up,

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.650
and we would like to have some
feedback from you guys.

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:46.150
Or any other developers
out there.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:50.460
Because RootzWiki is kind of
what's a developer community.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.050
So it's already going
on our RootzWiki.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.700
So we hope to be able to
generate some excitement

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:59.070
through that kind of
thing on there.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.540
And of course I'll be writing
more articles about Google TV

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.010
in the near future.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:10.516
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:11.620
MALE SPEAKER: Hello everyone.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.620
In this episode, we are going
to talk about Google Play.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.290
And how you get your
applications for Google TV

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.670
into the Google Play store.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.090
So let's take a look.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.340
There is a lot of documentation
on how to

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.270
publish Android applications.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.460
So keep in mind Google TV,
it's an Android device.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.210
So all of the Android guidelines
apply just as well

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.840
as for all the mobile
and tablet devices.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.470
So take a look online on
developer.android.com.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.260
There is a lot of good
information about how to

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.440
publish your application.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.160
So first, of course, you
have to test your app.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.970
We assume you have developed
it and tested it for this

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:57.510
episode here.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.830
And we will talk a little bit
about some of the things that

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.610
are unique to Google TV.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:06.360
I'll get to that in a while.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.720
So one of the differences of
Google TV, and a lot of the

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.120
other standard Android devices,
is some of the

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.180
compatibility features
that it supports.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.460
Naturally a television is a very
different device from a

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.690
mobile phone.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.580
The biggest difference, of
course, is it does not have a

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.010
touch screen.

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:28.760
I'll show you that
in a little bit.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.450
If you choose to have multiple
APKs for the same application,

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.840
think about how this
impacts your

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.640
strategy in terms of pricing.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.840
Is your mobile app going to be
the same price as your TV app?

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.830
Or maybe there's different
features.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:47.510
So that's another thing
to keep in mind.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.550
Lastly, make sure you have
promotional graphics that of

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.870
course reflect your TV app.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:56.220
And make sure your APK
is ready for release.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:00.760
So let's look at what it takes
to get your APK ready to be

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.470
released on Play store.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.030
Again follow the Android
documentation.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.730
There is a really great
checklist that walks you

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:09.260
through all of the steps.

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.110
Probably one of the first things
you want to do if you

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:16.550
have not already published
Android applications in the

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:21.150
Play store, is you want to
create a cryptographic key

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.550
which allows you to sign
your application.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:29.680
Make sure you have a key that
you can keep for a long time.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:34.950
The key must be valid
until at least 2033.

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:36.970
And make sure you keep
that key safe.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.930
You will need that key every
time you update your

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:43.110
application in the future.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:47.370
OK let's look at how the Play
store chooses which

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.800
applications are available
on Google TV.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:56.270
So the filtering is strictly
based on Android features.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.530
So as I've mentioned earlier,
the big difference between a

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:04.250
mobile device and the Google TV
is that Google TV is not a

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:05.750
touchscreen device.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:10.230
So make sure when you declare
your manifest file, you add

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.920
the users feature Android
hardware touch screen, and

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.580
make it required equals false.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:19.810
By the way, this will not filter
out your application

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.690
from regular, normal mobile
devices with a touch screen.

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:26.960
It will only allow
it to also run on

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.960
non-touch screen devices.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.540
If you want to run on only the
Google TV, then you can

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.630
specify a separate feature
which is the

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:41.420
com.google.android.tv feature.

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:45.120
Also make sure you have the
right min SDK and max SDK

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.260
version set.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:50.450
We recommend a target
SDK of 12 or 13.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.540
Google TV currently, the version
that's most in the

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:57.610
market is API version 13.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:57.970
OK.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.720
Now let's take a look at what
it takes to get your

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.870
application tested
on Google TV.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:09.820
So first you need to connect ADB
to your Google TV device.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.090
On a regular Android mobile
device you would just plug-in

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:14.600
your USB cable.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.500
On Google TV we use
IP addresses.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.270
So you type adb connect and the
IP address of your device.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:26.470
As you can see, once you've done
this ADB recognizes your

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:29.220
Google TV as just another
Android device.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.210
And you can use all the
regular ADB commands.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:37.390
Things like adb shell, adb
logcat, adb install.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:41.910
All the ADB commands you know
and love from your Android

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:43.160
development.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:49.380
One other thing when you use adb
logcat, take a look at the

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.100
logs of your application.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.710
Before you publish your
application, you want to make

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:57.720
sure you clean up a lot of the
log and debugging messages

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.970
that may be in your app.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:06.130
So after you have connected
ADB you can see in Eclipse

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:10.790
IDE, you can actually access
your adb logcat

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.590
from within the IDE.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:16.200
And you can also do things like
run or debug directly on

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.060
your Google TV device
from Eclipse.

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:22.080
Let's take a quick
look at that.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.710
So just for an example, I've
set a break point here.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:30.440
And let's go and debug
this application

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.610
with this break point.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.480
As you see in the console, it
is connecting to the device

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.030
waiting for the debugger.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:41.350
And now things are
starting up here.

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:45.340
And when we change to the debug
perspective, you can see

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.620
we see the Dalvik
virtual machine.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:50.560
And we see threads running.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.250
And after awhile your
application started up and it

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.010
has hit the break point.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.020
Now what you can do is,
you can just single

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:57.930
step through it.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:00.050
You can watch your variables.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:03.420
It's a great tool to verify
your application.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.650
You can also check things
like CPU load or memory.

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:10.030
Or my favorite, take
a screenshot.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:14.350
This screenshot comes in very
handy later on when you upload

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.550
your application to the
Android Play store.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.810
You should actually use the
screenshots from Google TV.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:26.380
Make sure you scale them
to 1280 by 720 pixels.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.050
So you get great, good looking
screenshots on Play

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.270
store for Google TV.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.770
Now let's take a look at
the manifest file.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:39.010
The manifest file is really the
one place where a lot of

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:43.150
the features are kept that
influence how your application

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:45.260
is filtered on the Play store.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.590
So before you upload, make
sure your version

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:48.990
code is up to date.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:52.440
You have to increment your
version code when you upload a

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.120
new version to the Google
Play store.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.930
The version name is the
human readable form.

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.150
You can enter a string
or a more

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:03.200
explanatory version number.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.100
The key feature is really
Android hardware touch screen.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:11.760
If you are developing for Google
TV, make sure to set

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.620
the touch screen as required
equals false.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.280
The other feature is the
com.google.adroid.tv.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.450
You can set that to true or
false, depending if you want

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:28.380
your application to be exclusive
for Google TV.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.420
Take a look at the
support screen.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.160
Make sure you support at least
normal and large screens for

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.760
your application.

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.900
Normal is for 720p.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:45.680
Large screens is for 1080p.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.600
So when we look at the manifest
XML, it's always a

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.300
good idea to double
check the XML.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.590
Make sure everything is
the way you like it.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:57.520
By the way, here you
see the target SDK

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.780
version I've set to 13.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.970
And the minimum to 12, which
should cover all of the Google

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.360
TV devices.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.520
And here we see the
features for touch

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.310
screen and Android TV.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:12.320
So one of the property I want
to point out is the Android

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.880
package name.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:19.050
Make sure it is a meaningful
and unique package name for

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:20.990
your application.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.930
We recommend that you start
with something like your

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.540
domain name or your
company name.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:30.760
And keep in mind this package
name is unique to your

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.810
application.

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:35.140
And it will stay with your
application for its entire

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.750
life in the Google Play store.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:43.270
One other thing is, make sure
you turn off debugging mode.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.720
You want to turn this off.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.050
And on a real application when
you release it to market, you

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.940
may also want to obfuscate
it using tools like,

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.070
for example, ProGuard.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:58.210
During the development process,
your application gets

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:01.370
typically signed with
a debug key.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.550
Now when you get ready to
publish in the Play store, you

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:08.290
want to sign it with an
actual release key.

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.550
So how can you do that?

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:14.800
In Eclipse, you click on the
project and then you look at

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.390
the Android tools
and use export

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.770
signed application package.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:25.100
This will create a file that is
ready to be uploaded to the

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.220
Google Play store.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.860
So choose the correct project,
and then go and choose a key

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.410
store that you want to use
to actually sign this

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.320
application.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.760
Please make sure you keep a copy
and a backup of this key

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.700
store for future use.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.210
You will need the same key store
every time you update

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.920
your application in the
Google Play store.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:52.640
So it's very important to
keep this backed up.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.900
Now choose the proper key.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:58.880
Enter the password again.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:03.630
And this will create these
signed package for the upload

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.480
to the Google Play Store.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.990
You want to double check the
certificate is valid until at

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:12.000
least 2033.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.930
And make sure all the
information is correct in the

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:16.860
certificate.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:21.510
OK now that we have exported the
APK, let's take a look and

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:24.360
verify if all the settings
are indeed correct.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.390
The tool to use for this
is called AAPT.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:32.140
It's the Android Application
Packaging Tool.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.770
And you can use the parameters
dump badging.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:38.040
And your APK name.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:42.620
This will show you all of the
features and permissions, and

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.540
all of the meta information
in a very simple,

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.900
user, readable form.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.590
Take a look at the version
code, the target SDK.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:54.940
And especially double check
that the Android hardware

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.220
touch screen is listed
as not required.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:04.370
Also take a look at the icons
that you package with your

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:05.210
application.

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:10.790
You want to make sure you have
at least the 240 and the 320

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:15.020
dpi resolution icons, to make
sure it looks really brilliant

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:19.440
and sharp on a large
television screen.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.010
The other thing to verify
is you can use the tool

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:28.410
jarsigner, and you can verify
the certificates that have

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:31.660
been used to sign your
application with.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:36.126
It's just a good idea to make
sure everything looks good.

00:30:36.126 --> 00:30:39.850
In this case, we see that
the certificate used.

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:43.000
It uses my name, it uses
my organization.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.410
Things look pretty good.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:48.320
And the expiration date
is in the future.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.530
In this case it's 2036.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:56.030
Once you're ready to upload
to Google Play, go to the

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:57.280
play.google.com/apps/publish
developer console.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.340
In the developer console
you'll see a list of

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.370
applications which you own,
or which you have

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:11.160
uploaded in the past.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.380
And you can take a look
at the store listing.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.880
It will show you things like
the title, the description,

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.210
the featured image.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:21.920
And so on and so forth.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.010
It's a good idea to update some
of the information, some

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:26.290
of the description.

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.420
Update maybe the
release notes.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.700
And update the recent changes.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:35.320
So your users know what
is new in this update.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.470
Now let's look at the APKs.

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:40.580
When you click on APKs,
I suggest choosing

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.160
the advanced mode.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.490
This gives you a little bit more
features and a little bit

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:46.120
more flexibility.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.780
And you can upload a APK.

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:52.380
And you can simply browse,
select the file we just

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:56.260
created, upload it.

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.470
And the Google Play store
gives you a high level

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:04.040
overview of what are the
features of your application.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.290
What are some of the required
permissions.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:09.860
And it also gives you a list of
devices that are available

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.660
for your application.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.110
So just give it a look.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.995
Make sure it looks good to you,
and then save the file.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.670
The file is not active.

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.910
So it's not yet being pushed
out to developers.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.740
So you have a chance
to double check.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.360
You also can upload
this in advance.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.990
You can stage it.

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:35.840
And then at a given time,
whenever you're ready, you can

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.170
publish the application
to your users.

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:43.080
So now I can either
reset my draft,

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.430
re-upload a new version.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:47.900
Or if I'm happy with the version
I uploaded, I can

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:52.110
publish this version
with one click.

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:55.160
Now the application is being
published and is available

00:32:55.160 --> 00:33:00.480
through Google Play to
Google TV devices.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.640
Please be patient.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:05.470
The updating of all the back
end servers, it may take a

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.450
couple minutes to
a couple hours.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:10.120
So it may take a few
minutes for your

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.090
changes to actually appear.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.980
Another feature I want to
highlight is the statistics.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.730
So as an application developer,
you're always

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:19.600
interested who is
using your app.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.810
How many people are
using your app?

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:22.750
Which versions?

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.090
Which countries?

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:25.660
Which devices?

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:30.570
So our statistics page gives
you a very good overview of

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:33.820
the breakdown of
your customers.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:34.260
Great.

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:37.230
Now your app is uploaded
to the Play store.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:41.470
The last and final check is you
can go to play.google.com,

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:45.400
and you can check out your
listing in the Play store.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.050
As I said earlier, give
it a few minutes.

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:50.360
If your listing does not update
immediately, it can

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.960
take a little while.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:55.280
It can take up to one
or two hours.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.850
So take a look, check it out.

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:03.390
Verify, especially the quality
of your screenshots and the

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:05.380
quality of your graphics.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:08.889
And lastly, let us
know about it.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:12.400
Google TV is a great platform
to develop for, and we're

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.710
always excited for
new applications.

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:16.770
And we're always looking forward
to hearing from you

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:20.260
guys about what new apps you
have come up with that

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.699
run on Google TV.

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:24.469
So let us know in
our Plus page.

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:28.010
And I hope you guys have a
great week, and looking

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:30.270
forward to seeing all those
new applications.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:32.070
Thanks a lot and see
you next time.
