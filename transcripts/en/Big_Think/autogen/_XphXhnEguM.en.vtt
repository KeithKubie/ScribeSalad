you'd metabolize the seawater you live

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
you'd metabolize the seawater you live
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.990
you'd metabolize the seawater you live
and you're some living thing so there's

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000
and you're some living thing so there's
 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.420

always a solvent as we say in chemistry

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
always a solvent as we say in chemistry
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.090
always a solvent as we say in chemistry
there's always some liquid that

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
there's always some liquid that
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.549
there's always some liquid that
dissolves these things the chemicals and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559
dissolves these things the chemicals and
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.439
dissolves these things the chemicals and
you can move them around redistribute to

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
you can move them around redistribute to
 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.479
you can move them around redistribute to
make use of the chemicals and then the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489
make use of the chemicals and then the
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.770
make use of the chemicals and then the
solvent is largely unchanged so

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780
solvent is largely unchanged so
 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.050
solvent is largely unchanged so
astrobiologists have sought solvents and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
astrobiologists have sought solvents and
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.660
astrobiologists have sought solvents and
right now water is the best one anyone

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
right now water is the best one anyone

can think of now we haven't thought of
the other solvent on another world that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890
the other solvent on another world that
 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.120

you fans is liquid ammonia

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369
you fans is liquid ammonia
 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.370
you fans is liquid ammonia
well liquid ammonia okay we haven't

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380
well liquid ammonia okay we haven't
 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.469
well liquid ammonia okay we haven't
found anything on the earth or near the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479
found anything on the earth or near the
 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.060

earth that seems to live on liquid
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.859
earth that seems to live on liquid
ammonia but right now it's water water

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869

telescopes that will allow us to detect
water on another world and you would say

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
water on another world and you would say
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.580
water on another world and you would say
that how can you possibly do that dozens

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
that how can you possibly do that dozens
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.889
that how can you possibly do that dozens
hundreds of light-years away you're

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899
hundreds of light-years away you're
 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.780
hundreds of light-years away you're
crazy you're squandering our tax dollars

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
crazy you're squandering our tax dollars
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.350
crazy you're squandering our tax dollars
this is madness oh no my friends when

that would allow us to determine whether
 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.240
that would allow us to determine whether
or not their water and the other big

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250
or not their water and the other big
 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.670
or not their water and the other big
thing is is to look for the surface

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680
thing is is to look for the surface
 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.620
thing is is to look for the surface
temperature of the distant planet if the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630
temperature of the distant planet if the

surface temperatures 50 80 a hundred
 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.930
surface temperatures 50 80 a hundred
degrees Fahrenheit then you're probably

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940
degrees Fahrenheit then you're probably
 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.000
degrees Fahrenheit then you're probably
on to something if you're at millions of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010
on to something if you're at millions of
 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.150
on to something if you're at millions of
degrees Fahrenheit probably no liquid

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160
degrees Fahrenheit probably no liquid
 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.090
degrees Fahrenheit probably no liquid
water and so on
