This Goby fish in Hawaii can climb up 300
foot waterfalls. And physics students from

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.539
the University of Leicester have determined
that because of the doppler effect, hyperspace

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.699
travel would really look like...this....

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.520
Vsauce, Kevin here. This is Mind Blow.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.289
A clothing store in Japan has a hanger system
that displays video of a model wearing the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.039
clothes you remove from the rack. The hangers
have simple on/off switches depending on if

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:38.290
the article of clothing is hanging or is picked
up, and each have a unique ID that is tied

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.480
to a PC in the back which displays a photo
or video of the model wearing that piece of

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.890
clothing. It's kind of a digital take on mannequins,
but it's more of a novelty to try and get

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.370
online shoppers back into brick and mortar stores.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.200
These LED ice cubes let you know when you've
had too much alcohol. Developed by an MIT

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.540
Media Lab researcher, the edible gelatin ice
cubes hold a coin cell battery, a microcontroller,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.990
and a transceiver to track the number of sips
and total time drinking. They flash in sync

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.299
with ambient music, and change color to represent
the levels of intoxication.

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.310
Aspire Bariatrics has developed a system that
allows people to lose weight by emptying their

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.409
stomach with a valve after a meal. Aspiration
Therapy involves a tube in the stomach connected

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.569
to a Skin-Port that can be opened to empty
stomach contents before they pass into the

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.869
intestines where the calories are absorbed.
And then you just dump the stuff in the toilet...So,

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:36.719
yeah...

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:42.619
This is a newfound fossil of giant dolphin-shaped
predator considered to be the T-Rex of the

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:42.950
sea.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.130
VELOCIRoACH is the second fastest legged robot,
clocking in at 3.2 meters per second. It moves

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.579
like a real cockroach with its legs
hitting the ground 15 times per second, and

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.929
the cardboard roach can move 26 times its
body length in only one second, and also can

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.149
carry four times its weight.

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.179
Diego San is a humanoid robot toddler that
combines advancements in robotics, neuroscience,

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.200
computer vision, developmental psychology
and machine learning. Developed at the University

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.450
of California, San Diego, it mimics the expressions
of a one-year-old child, and the plan is to

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.060
use it in studies on sensory-motor and social
development- basically, how babies learn to

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.100
control their bodies and interact with others.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.290
The Power Loader Power Amplification Exoskeleton
Robot is being developed by Panasonic subsidiary,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.290
Activelink. It's a full body exoskeleton designed
to carry over 220lbs, and they hope to use

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.700
a more compact version for use in the reconstruction
of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.700
Finally, photographer Katka Pruskova took
7,100 photos in 730 hours to create this timelapse

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.230
compilation of 22 flowers...

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.110
I'm gonna leave you with a Disco Clam: a type
of clam that produces its own light show.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.110
And, as always, thanks for watching.
