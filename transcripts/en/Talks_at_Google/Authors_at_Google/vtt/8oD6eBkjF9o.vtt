00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:07.359
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Hello everyone. And welcome
to Sharon Bertsch McGrayne's talk on "The

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.820
Theory That Would Not Die." When I got the
announcement of the book and I asked for a

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.180
copy of it, I said, "This looks like a very
Googley book." Bayes' theorem is used all

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.060
over the place and when I asked you guys if
you're interested, it was either the first

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.000
or the second most popular book that I've
ever put up.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.550
So, it looks like we've had a very good turnout
given that everyone here probably knows more

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:38.580
about Bayes theorem than I do. And I know
a fair bit. I will turn it right over to our

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.580
speaker. Welcome.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.580
[applause]

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:47.780
&gt;&gt;Sharon Bertsch McGrayne: Thank you. Well,
thank you very much for inviting me and thank

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.890
you all for coming. I wanna start right out
with some truth in advertising and tell you

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.220
that I'm not a computer scientist. I'm not
a statistician, a scientist, or a mathematician.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.489
I come to you from newspaper reporting and
from science writing. However, I became intrigued

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.040
with Bayes rule seven or eight years ago when
I could Google the word "Bayesian" and get

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.430
fewer than a hundred thousand hits. And last
week, when I went on and I Googled "Bayesian,"

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.180
I got eleven million hits.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:28.979
So, today I wanna talk to you about how you
all are real revolutionaries. You're participants

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.799
in a remarkable--almost overnight--revolution
about a very fundamental scientific issue--how

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:44.229
you deal with evidence, how you deal with
data, how you evaluate the evidence and measure

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:53.150
the uncertainties involved, update it as new
knowledge arises and then hopefully, change

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.729
minds in light of the new data.

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.549
Now, usually when I talk about Bayes' Rule,
I start with a long list of examples of where

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.529
Bayes is used and I do not think I need to
do that with this crowd. Google often uses

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:21.290
naive Bayes and other Bayesian methods and
recently, Google's Bayesian driverless car

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.010
got headlines all over the world.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.370
And when I wrote a short piece about it for
Scientific American, it was one of the most

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.930
popular articles in that issue. So, it was
well-known. But there are a couple of examples

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:43.879
that I'd like to bring up today that you might
not know so much about. [pause] The first

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:52.260
is the Air France jet Flight 447 that took
off two years ago last month from Rio de Janeiro

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.700
bound for Paris overnight.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.319
Went into a high altitude, intense electrical
storm and disappeared without a trace with

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:13.109
228 people aboard. The world's most high-tech
search ever, naval search ever, lasted without

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:20.370
success almost two years. They were searching
for the wreckage and for these two black boxes,

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.720
which as you can see are actually red and
white.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.879
They're the size of shoe boxes and they were
searching in mountainous terrain two and a

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:36.299
half miles down under the ocean in an area
the size of Switzerland. They had no success.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.730
Last winter, the French government hired some
of the same people who appear in "The Theory

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.400
That Wouldn't Die" who developed Bayesian
Naval search methods.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.089
And their software calculated the most probable
sites for the wreckage, which was found in

00:03:53.089 --> 00:04:04.839
April after an undersea search of one week.
OK? Now, about a month ago, the agency in

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:11.060
charge of British archaeological sites announced
that a wonderful Bayesian program had shown

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.130
them that most of what they'd known about
Neolithic era in Britain was, in their words,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.130
bollocks.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.230
[laughter]

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:26.350
Neolithic people built these strange hilltops
surrounded by concentric circles of ditches.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.260
And they had not built them gradually over
the ages. They built and abandoned them, often

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.790
within the space of one generation. And most
of them had been built during a building spree

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.270
roughly five thousand, five hundred years
ago.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.430
Now, the remarkable thing to me about these
two examples is that the British and the French

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.240
governments were saying how wonderful Bayes'
had worked. And as we're gonna see today,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.710
a lot of people didn't even dare mention the
word 'Bayes' for decades in the 20th Century.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.230
So, to understand why you all are such revolutionaries
we're gonna have to go back to the beginning.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.320
And given the time constraints, I'm gonna
race through the beginning until we get to

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.200
the Second World War and when I'll slow down
some. But I hope we're gonna see two big patterns

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.810
emerging.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:30.620
First, Bayes becomes an extreme example of
the gap between academia and the real world.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.890
And second, military super-secrecy during
the Second World War and the Cold War had

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:46.670
a profound effect on Bayes. Now, Bayes rule
of course, is named for the Reverend Thomas

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:53.660
Bayes, a wealthy Presbyterian minister and
amateur mathematician who lived in a chic

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.200
resort outside of London in the early 1700s.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.110
We know very little about him. I'm not gonna
show you his portrait because it's indubitably

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:08.690
of someone else. We don't know his birthdate.
Wikipedia has his death date wrong. But we

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:15.760
do have something personal about Bayes. And
that is his handwriting. Goose quills in Latin.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.311
OK? And we know another thing about him, excuse
me. This, this handwriting comes from the

00:06:21.311 --> 00:06:28.720
Institute and Faculty of Actuaries in London.
And we do know something else about Bayes

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.290
and that is that he discovered his theorem
during the 1740s when Europe was racked by

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.040
a religious controversy.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:45.660
The issue is not unknown today. It was whether
or not we can use evidence about the natural

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:53.389
world around us to make rational conclusions
about the existence of God. They called Bayes,

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:58.300
in his generation, would have called God--.
Said it was not about God the creator, but

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.110
about God the cause, God the primary cause,
the first cause.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:10.180
We do not know that Thomas Bayes wanted to
prove the existence of God, but we do know

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.580
that Bayes tried to deal with the issue of
cause and effect, mathematically. And in so

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:21.530
doing, of course, he produced a simple one-line
theorem that we modify our initial beliefs.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:27.180
And he actually called it a guess. He used
the word "guess" and he said if, if nothing

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:38.020
else works, start with 50-50 odds that it
works and modify this, this guess with objective

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:45.230
new information and get a new and improved
belief, which in turn carries with it a commitment

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:50.240
to update that belief each time a new piece
of information arrives.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.260
But Bayes didn't believe in his theorem enough
to publish it. And he dies ten or fifteen

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:02.870
years later with it filed away in his notebook.
Now, going through Bayes' papers, a friend

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:11.780
of his, Richard Price, who was another Presbyterian
minister and an amateur mathematician, decides

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.760
that the theorem will help prove the existence
of God the cause.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:23.100
Now, unlike Bayes, Richard Price was famous
in his day. This is a royal society portrait

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:29.890
done by a famous painter, Benjamin West. He
later becomes a famous supporter of the American

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:34.889
Revolution, friends of our Founding Fathers
and a founder of the insurance industry.

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:43.099
And he spends the next two years, off and
on, editing Bayes' theorem. Gets it published.

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:49.670
Unfortunately, in a journal that primarily
the British gentry read and not particularly

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:55.910
continental mathematicians and it sank out
of view and was neglected. But certainly by

00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:03.559
today's standards, Richard Price would be
considered Thomas Bayes' co-author.

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:10.160
If, however, there were justice in this world,
Bayes' rule should be named for someone else

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:17.040
entirely. And that is the great French mathematician,
Pierre-Simon Laplace, who's better known today

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:25.779
for the Laplace transform. Now, as a young
man of 25, Laplace discovers the rule independently

00:09:25.779 --> 00:09:32.449
of Bayes in 1774 and calls it the "Probability
of Causes".

00:09:32.449 --> 00:09:41.060
Now, Laplace, also unlike Bayes, was the quintessential
scientific researcher. He mathematized every

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:47.790
science known to his day and he spends the
next 20 years, off and on, in the midst of

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.790
this enormous career, developing what we call
Bayes' rule into the form that's used today

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.040
and actually used it.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:07.629
But when Laplace dies in 1827, the Western
world begins almost a manic fad collecting

00:10:07.629 --> 00:10:14.439
precise and objective facts. There were clubs
that collected them. Even women could do it.

00:10:14.439 --> 00:10:20.680
Some of the famous numbers were the chest
sizes of Scottish soldiers, the number of

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:27.189
Prussian officers who were killed by kicking
horses, [laugher] the number of victims of

00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:29.339
cholera.

00:10:29.339 --> 00:10:35.819
And with lots of these precise numbers at
their disposal, any up to date statistician

00:10:35.819 --> 00:10:43.290
rejected Bayes' rule. They preferred to judge
the probability of an event by the frequency

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:48.620
that it occurred--nine times out of ten, three
out of four, and so on. And eventually they

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.779
will become known as the Frequentists.

00:10:50.779 --> 00:10:58.320
And the Frequentists become the great opponent
of Bayes' rule up until quite recently because

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:06.430
for them, modern science requires both objectivity
and precise answers. And Bayes, of course,

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:13.869
calls for a measure of belief and approximations
and the Frequentists called that quote "subjectivity

00:11:13.869 --> 00:11:18.629
run amuck," "ignorance coined into science."

00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:26.680
By the 1920s, they were calling it, saying
that Bayes "smacked of astrology, of alchemy."

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:34.430
And another said, "We use Bayes formula with
a sigh as the only thing available under the

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:40.819
circumstances." Now, the surprising thing
that I discovered in all of this time is the

00:11:40.819 --> 00:11:45.089
theorists and the philosophers denounced Bayes'
rule as subjective.

00:11:45.089 --> 00:11:52.170
People who had to deal with real world emergencies,
who had to make one-time decisions based on

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:59.860
scanty data, they kept right on using Bayes'
rule because they had to make do with what

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:06.860
they had. So, for example, Bayes' rule helped
free Dreyfus from the treason trials in the

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.009
1890s in France.

00:12:09.009 --> 00:12:16.429
Artillery officers in France, in Russia, and
the US, tested their ammunition and, and aimed

00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:25.790
their fire using Bayesian tables in both World
Wars. The Bell telephone system survived the

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:31.949
1907 financial panic and the US insurance
industry started our first and only--for many

00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:37.059
years--social insurance, workers compensation
insurance, almost overnight at the time of

00:12:37.059 --> 00:12:42.800
the First World War despite having few facts
about the safety of particular industries

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.199
or particular businesses.

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:54.290
Now, every good book needs a villain. And
the villain of our piece is Ronald Fisher.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:13:04.069
Despite Bayes' usefulness, Ronald Fisher started
attacking Bayes in the 1920s and '30s and

00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:10.740
theoretician's attitudes about Bayes changed
from tepid toleration to outright hostility.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:18.790
One of the reasons is that Ronald Fisher was
a giant. He was a superb geneticist. He founded

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:26.550
modern statistics for scientific work, randomization
methods, sampling theory, experimental design

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:33.069
methods--these are all some of Fisher's great
achievements. But unfortunately for Bayes,

00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:37.279
the thing that Fisher hated most was Bayes'
rule.

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:45.009
He was a fervent eugenicist with an explosive
temper and a remarkable inability to understand

00:13:45.009 --> 00:13:55.309
other people. For example, if Fisher got bored
at a meeting, he might pull out his false

00:13:55.309 --> 00:13:58.170
teeth and clean them in public.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.170
[laughter]

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:05.009
He, he interpreted scientific and statistical
questions as, as personal attacks. And his

00:14:05.009 --> 00:14:11.220
life became, a colleague said, "a sequence
of scientific fights, often several at a time

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:18.350
at scientific meetings and in scientific papers
and he hated Bayes' rule the most." He didn't

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.499
need Bayes.

00:14:19.499 --> 00:14:25.350
He didn't work with great amounts of uncertainty.
He was a eugenicist and he filled his house

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:32.059
with cats and dogs and thousands of mice for
cross-breeding experiments and he could trace

00:14:32.059 --> 00:14:39.760
their genealogy back for generations, precisely.
His experiments were repeatable and they produced

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.180
precise answers.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:49.040
And Fisher calls Bayes' approximation and
measures of belief "an impenetrable jungle,

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:55.389
perhaps the only mistake to which the mathematical
world has so deeply committed itself. It's

00:14:55.389 --> 00:15:04.239
founded on an error and must be wholly rejected."
And he kept up this very personal fight against

00:15:04.239 --> 00:15:13.800
Bayes for 40 years, into the 1950s when a
lone Bayesian at NIH was showing that cigarettes,

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.160
smoking cigarettes, caused lung cancer.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.489
Now, Fisher was a chain smoker. He even swims
smoking.

00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:25.189
[laughter]

00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:32.090
And he was a paid consultant to the tobacco
industry. And he proposed, believe it or not,

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:39.779
not that smoking caused lung cancer, but that
lung cancer probably caused smoking.

00:15:39.779 --> 00:15:50.639
OK? So, Fisher's stature and his utter inability
to discuss Bayes' rationally delayed its development

00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:58.079
for decades. And I think we have to say that
Fisher is an example of how a destructive

00:15:58.079 --> 00:16:04.629
personality can affect a field, particularly
a small field. Now, I wanna switch gears a

00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:10.589
bit and dwell on the personal history of Alan
Turing.

00:16:10.589 --> 00:16:17.410
First, because he's a hero of mine and second
because it illustrates how Bayes' worked as

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:24.339
a pencil and paper method, as one of the earliest
computer techniques, and as an illustration

00:16:24.339 --> 00:16:34.889
of the effect of government secrecy. This,
of course, is Alan Turing. [pause] Now by

00:16:34.889 --> 00:16:40.989
the time the Second World War began, as we've
seen, Bayes was virtually taboo as far as

00:16:40.989 --> 00:16:44.889
sophisticated statisticians were concerned.

00:16:44.889 --> 00:16:51.100
Fortunately, Turing was not a statistician.
He was a mathematician. And besides fathering

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:56.660
the modern computer, computer science, software,
artificial intelligence, the Turing machine,

00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:03.980
the Turing test, he will father the modern
Bayesian revival. Now, it's also important

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:10.260
to remember that during the Second World War,
England was cut off from the agricultural

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:17.180
produce and supplies of the continent, particularly
of France and could feed only one in three

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:25.650
of its residents. And it depended on convoys
of unarmed merchant marine ships bringing

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:33.040
in each year 30 million tons of food and supplies
from North and South America and from Africa.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:39.640
Now, Hitler said he thought that the U-boats
and their attacks on these convoys will win

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.900
the war.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:46.620
And Churchill said later "the only thing I
was really scared of during the war were the

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:52.760
U-boats" because of the attacks on the supply
lines. And in fact, German U-boats did sink

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:59.950
almost 3000 Allied ships and killed more than
50,000 merchant seamen.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:06.610
Now, the German Navy ordered the U-boats around
the Atlantic Ocean via radio messages that

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:13.940
were encrypted with word scrambling machines
called 'Enigmas'. The German government bought

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:18.800
the Enigmas during the '20s and distributed
them to all of its different agencies.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:25.850
So, the Navy had one set of codes and could
develop their own complexities and their own

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:32.010
security controls. The Army had another. The
foreign service, the Italians, the Spanish

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:39.350
nationalists and so on. The German railways
had one. And the most complex of all was that

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.740
operated by the German Navy.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:48.170
And this is a German naval Enigma. They're
had to sort out in pictures, but this one

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:54.240
comes from Frode Weierud's website called
'CryptoCellar'. Now, an Enigma machine, as

00:18:54.240 --> 00:19:00.679
you can see, looks like a complex type sturdy
typewriter. It had wiring coming out of the

00:19:00.679 --> 00:19:02.070
very bottom.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:09.500
It had wheels. This one has four wheels, but
they started with three and added more later.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:13.800
It had starting places. It had code books.
And it had many other features that could

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:19.740
be changed within hours if necessary, and
that could produce millions upon millions

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.740
of permutations.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:28.760
And no one, German or British, thought that
the British could ever read, ever read those

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:36.280
messages. So, this is one of the Enigma machines
that Alan Turing will use Bayes' to conquer.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:43.010
Now, on September 4th, 1939, Turing goes to--.
He's been working on the Enigma all summer

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:44.010
by himself.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:49.870
But he's ordered the day after the war is
declared to go to Bletchley Park, which is

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:57.000
the British super-secret center for decryption
efforts just north of London. When he arrives

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:05.450
at Bletchley Park he was 27. He looked 16.
He was handsome and athletic. His mother sent

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.940
proper business suits for him to wear to work.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:13.650
He preferred shabby sports coats. He had a
five o'clock shadow. Sometimes, his fingernails

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:21.640
were dirty. And he will spend the next six
years working on coding and decryption efforts.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:27.710
When he arrives at Bletchley Park, no one
is working on the all-important Navy code,

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:34.900
the one that will, will control whether or
not supplies can reach Great Britain.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.250
Turing, however, liked to work alone. And
after a few weeks, he announced that no one

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:47.050
was doing anything about it and "I could have
it to myself." And he goes up into the loft

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:52.330
of one of the stable buildings at Bletchley
Park and stays there during lunches and breaks

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:58.830
and the women on the staff organize a pulley
to take up baskets of food for him for lunch

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:02.260
and, and tea.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:06.521
And, and if you don't mind, I'll read just
a bit from "The Theory That Wouldn't Die."

00:21:06.521 --> 00:21:07.521
[reads from book]

00:21:07.521 --> 00:21:12.940
"Late one night, soon after joining Bletchley
Park, Turing invented a manual method for

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:19.230
reducing the number of tests that would be
needed to determine the settings for those

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:25.900
wheels. It was a highly labor intensive Bayesian
system that he nicknamed 'Banburismus,' for

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:30.860
the nearby town of Banbury where needed supplies
were printed.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:36.550
He wrote later during the war, 'I was not
sure it would work in practice, but if it

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:44.200
did it would let him guess a stretch of letters
in an Enigma machine, hedge his bets, measure

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:50.170
their belief and their validity by using Bayesian
methods to assess their probabilities and

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:53.150
add more clues as they arrived.'

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:59.520
If it worked, it would identify settings for
two of Enigma's wheels and reduce the number

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:06.240
of wheel settings to be tested from 336 to
as few as 18."

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:12.090
And at a time, obviously, when every hour
counted, the difference could save sailors'

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:13.090
lives.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:19.110
"So Turing and his slowly growing staff begin
to comb intelligence reports to collect what

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:25.310
they called 'cribs', which were the German
words that they predicted would occur in the

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:32.950
original uncoded German message. The first
cribs came primarily from German weather reports

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:36.700
because they were standardized and repeated
often.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:44.380
Weather for the night, situation Eastern channel.
And as one blessed fool radioed each night,

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:51.850
'Beacons lit as ordered.' Reports from British
meteorologists about weather in the English

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:58.690
Channel provided more clues, more hunches.
And in a fundamental breakthrough, Turing

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:06.570
realized that he couldn't systematize his
hunches or compare his hypotheses, their probabilities,

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.310
excuse me, without a unit of measurement.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:17.280
And he named his unit 'A Ban for Banburismus'.
And he defined it as quote 'about the smallest

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:24.160
change of weight in evidence that is directly
perceptible to human intuition.' End quote.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:30.000
One Ban represented odds of ten to one in
favor of a guess. But Turing normally dealt

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.780
with much smaller quantities, deciBans and
even centiBans.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:39.950
The Ban was basically the same as the bit,
the measure of information that Claude Shannon

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:46.010
discovered by using Bayes' rule at roughly
the same time at Bell Telephone Laboratories.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:51.270
Turing's measure of belief, the Ban, and its
supporting mathematical framework had been

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:57.910
called his greatest intellectual contribution
to Britain's defense.

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:04.110
Using Bayes' rule and Bans, Turing began calculating
credibility values for various kinds of hunches

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:11.840
and compiling reference tables of Bans for
technicians to use. It was a statistic-based

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.380
technique, produced no absolute certainties,
but when the odds of a hypothesis added up

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:21.880
to 50 to one, cryptanalysts could be close
to certain that they were right."

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:28.120
Now, Turing was obviously developing a home
grown Bayesian system. No one knows where

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:34.930
he got it, whether he discovered it and developed
it on his own, with his assistant Jack Good,

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:42.000
or whether he knew about the rudiments of
it from the lone defender of Bayes'--Cambridge

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:49.100
University during the pre-war period Harold
Jeffries, who used Bayes' for earthquake and

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:57.230
tsunami research to find out the epicenter
of the earthquakes.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:05.400
Now, within a year and a half of the war starting,
by June of 1941, Turing could read the U-boat

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:11.310
messages within an hour of arrival at Bletchley
Park. And the British could reroute the convoys

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:18.490
around the U-boats and for almost a month
that summer no convoy, no ship is attacked

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:21.630
by a U-boat.

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:27.980
By the fall, however, the fall of 1941, Banburimus
is critically short of typists and junior

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:37.160
clerks, otherwise known as "girl power". Turing
and the other decoders wrote a personal letter

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.850
to Churchill, delivered it to Downing Street.
One of them delivered it to Downing Street.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:49.390
And he responded immediately. Among the help
that was attempted, Ian Fleming, of James

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:56.620
Bond fame, plans an elaborate raid to capture
code books for Turing. Fortunately, it's so

00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:02.680
elaborate, it's better for a novel than--.
And it was cancelled. [laughter]

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:08.950
The Navy collected code books for Turing from
sinking German ships and two young men lost

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:17.360
their lives collecting code, code books for
Turing from sinking German ships. But breaking

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:27.400
Enigma--. If we could actually have that one
back. I think. [pause] Whoop. Not there. Never

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.110
mind.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:37.070
But eventually breaking the Enigma codes becomes
routine, like a factory at Bletchley Park.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:48.210
However, [pause] let's go back to Turing if
we can. There we go. Thank you. But shortly

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:56.340
after Germany attacks Russia in June of 1941,
the German army started using a vastly more

00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:02.520
complex code and word scrambling machine called
the 'Lorenz'.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:08.710
These were ultra-secret codes and the Supreme
Command in Berlin relies on these new Lorenz

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:16.200
codes to communicate high-level strategy to
high-level army commanders around Europe.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.780
And some of the messages were so important
that Hitler himself signed them.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.800
[reads from book]

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:30.390
"And a group of Britain's leading mathematicians
begin a year of desperate search. They used

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:37.190
Bayes' rule, logic, statistics, Boolean algebra,
and electronics. And they also began working,

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:43.470
work on designing and building the first of
ten Colossi, the world's first large scale

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:45.320
electronic computers.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:53.470
Turing invented a highly Bayesian method known
as 'Turingery', or 'Turingismus'. It was a

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:58.830
paper and pencil method again. The first step
was to make a guess and assume, as Bayes had

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:04.430
suggested, that it had a 50-50 percent chance
of being correct. Add more clues, some good

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:05.630
and some bad.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:11.480
And as one of the decoders described it 'with
patience, luck, a lot of rubbing out and a

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:16.800
lot of cycling back and forth, the plain text
appeared.'

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:23.780
Now, the engineer who built the Colossi, Thomas
Flowers, had strict orders to have the second

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:31.530
model of the Colossus ready by June 1, 1944.
He was not told why, but his team worked,

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:36.030
he said, so hard until they thought their
eyeballs would drop out.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:46.950
They get it ready by June 1. And on June 5,
there's a message that they receive from Hitler

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:53.440
that he's sending to his army commander in
Normandy named General Irwin Rommel. And Hitler

00:28:53.440 --> 00:29:02.620
tells Rommel, if there is an invasion of Normandy,
it will be a diversionary tactic and do nothing

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.010
for five days.

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:11.180
The real invasion will occur later, somewhere
else. The message is decrypted at Bletchley

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:16.930
Park. A courier takes it to General Eisenhower
where he and his staff are determining when

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:22.860
to launch the invasion of Normandy. A courier
gives the piece of paper to Eisenhower.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:29.100
We know this from Thomas Flowers, by the way.
He gives the paper to Eisenhower, who reads

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:35.570
it. He cannot tell anything, even to his top
staff about Bletchley Park and the decoding

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:43.860
efforts. He gives the paper back to the courier
and he turns to his staff and says, "We go

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.290
tomorrow morning."

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:53.090
November 6, 1944. And later, Eisenhower says
that the decoding at Bletchley Park, Bletchley

00:29:53.090 --> 00:30:02.850
Park shortened the war in Europe by two years.
Now, a few days after Germany's surrender

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:10.670
in May of 1945, a year later, Churchill makes
a surprising and still shocking move.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:15.980
Everything that showed that decoding had helped
to win the Second World War was to be ultra-secret.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:21.430
No one could reveal anything about what they'd
done at Bletchley Park. And Turing, of course,

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:27.020
could not be mentioned. And this Colossi were
to be destroyed.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:36.150
To be destroyed, cut into unidentifiable pieces,
except for the last two most complex ones.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:37.520
[crash] Bombing.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.420
[laughter]

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:45.460
Except for the two most--, the latest ones,
the most complex ones, which Britain apparently

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:52.264
used during the Cold War to decode Soviet
messages. But I think [sound of truck backing

00:30:52.264 --> 00:30:58.000
up] we have to think that without Churchill's
orders, it might have been Great Britain that

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.260
became the leader of the 20th Century computer
revolution.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:11.030
Now, after the war, Turing was working on
computers and other projects. No one knew

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:18.390
what he had done at Bletchley Park, when two
spies flee from Britain [door slam] to Moscow.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:24.180
They had been spying for the Soviet Union
all during the war. And they fled in 1950.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:30.700
One was named Guy Burgess and he was an openly
homosexual graduate of Cambridge University.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:37.980
And US Intelligence told Britain that the
spies had been tipped off by another homosexual

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:45.350
graduate of Cambridge, an art historian named
Anthony Blunt. And the government panicked

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:54.330
and thought that it was probably a homosexual
spy ring of graduates from Cambridge. [laughter]

00:31:54.330 --> 00:32:02.100
The number of arrests for homosexual activity
spikes. And the day after Queen Elizabeth

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:12.380
II is crowned, Alan Turing is arrested. He
is arrested for homosexual activity in the

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:20.450
privacy of his home with a consenting adult.
He is found guilty. He's sentenced to either

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:23.930
prison or chemical castration.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:33.050
He chooses the estrogen injections. Over the
next year, he grows breasts. And the day after

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:39.321
the 10th Anniversary of the Normandy Invasion
that he helped make possible, Alan Turing

00:32:39.321 --> 00:32:49.070
commits suicide. Anthony Blunt is later Knighted
and it's 55 years before the British government,

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:54.211
the Prime Minister in this case, apologizes
for its treatment of, of Turing.

00:32:54.211 --> 00:33:04.890
Yeah, thank you. Now, after the, the Second
World War, its wartime successes were totally

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:11.700
classified. And Bayes' rule also emerged from
the Second World War, even more suspect than

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:18.559
before. The anti-Bayesians still focused on
Thomas Bayes' starting guess, this outrageously

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:20.870
subjective prior.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:27.510
And without any public proof that their method
worked, the Bayesians were stymied. When Jack

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:35.720
Good, who had been Turing's statistical assistant
during the war, gave a talk at the Royal Statistical

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:40.772
Society about the theory of the method, no
mention of course of the application, the

00:33:40.772 --> 00:33:47.840
next speaker's opening words were "after that
nonsense."

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:53.520
During Senator McCarthy's witch hunt against
communists in the US Federal government, a

00:33:53.520 --> 00:34:01.590
Bayesian at the National Bureau of Standards
was called, only half-jokingly, "un-American

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:04.840
and undermining the United States' government."

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:10.710
At Harvard Business School, professors had
developed the very Bayesian decision trees

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:18.889
that MBAs use. But they were called 'Socialists'
and 'so-called scientists'. And a Swiss visitor

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:24.869
to Berkeley's very Frequentist department,
statistics department in the 1950s, realized

00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:31.040
that it was "kind of dangerous" to apply these
Bayesian methods.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:37.649
Now, the Cold War military, of course, continued
to use and develop Bayes' rule. So, they knew

00:34:37.649 --> 00:34:44.240
it worked, but it was secret. For example,
the 1950s wrestled with the problem of how

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:49.750
do you predict the probability of something's
happening if it's never happened before.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:57.119
There had never been an accidental H-bomb
explosion. So, the Frequentists said "you

00:34:57.119 --> 00:35:03.260
couldn't predict the probability of its ever
happening in the future." So, a post-doc at

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:09.970
Rand Corporation, Albert Madansky, used Bayes'
to warn that Curtis LeMay's strategic air

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:18.800
command--I think you know Curtis LeMay from
the movie 'Dr. Strangelove' --that his strategic

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:24.251
air command could have produced at least 19
H-bomb accidents a year.

00:35:24.251 --> 00:35:31.300
And the Kennedy Administration eventually
added safeguards. But there were other secret

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:38.570
Cold War projects, too. The National Security
Agency cryptographers used Bayes' to decode

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:41.050
Soviet messages.

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:47.330
And an advisor to the National Security Agency
and to the Institute for Defense Analyses

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:53.950
used it election nights to predict the winners
of a congressional and presidential elections

00:35:53.950 --> 00:36:01.040
for 20 years, but refused to let anyone say
that he was using Bayes', apparently, to keep

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:09.050
his connection to Bayesian cryptography totally
secret. And the US Navy used Bayes secretly

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:18.400
to search for a missing hydrogen bomb in Spain,
for a nuclear submarine, Scorpion, which sank

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.670
without a trace. And then, in a classified
story that's told for the first time in "The

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:29.240
Theory That Wouldn't Die" how Bayes' actually
caught a Russian submarine in the Mediterranean,

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:32.340
and convinces the Navy.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:40.580
Now, as a result, during the years of the
Cold War, Bayes becomes a real flesh and blood

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:49.530
story about a small group of maybe a hundred
of more believers struggling for legitimacy

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:56.020
and acceptance. And for many years, they concentrated
on theory, trying to make probability and

00:36:56.020 --> 00:37:00.550
Bayes a respectable branch of mathematics.

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:07.590
But many Bayesians of that generation remember
the exact moment when Bayes' overarching logic

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:16.530
descends on them and they talk about it like
an epiphany, where they're converted. To them,

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:22.820
Frequentism looked like a series of ad hoc
techniques, whereas Bayes' theorem had what

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:28.060
Einstein had called "the cosmic religious
feeling."

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:33.330
The reason, of course, was that it was concerned
with a very fundamental scientific issue.

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:39.710
As David Speigelhalter told me, "It was basic.
A huge sway of scientists say you can't use

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:45.020
probability to express your lack of knowledge
or to describe one-time events that don't

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.860
have any frequency to it."

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:53.810
And many scientists find this rather disturbing
because it's not a process of discovery. It's

00:37:53.810 --> 00:38:00.960
more a process of interpretation. So, both
sides were proselytizing their methods as

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:07.880
the one and only way to approach statistics.
It was, one statistician told me, a "food

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.740
fight, a devastating food fight."

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:17.450
And it was one that didn't subside until late
in the 20th Century. Both sides use these

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:22.230
religious terms when a Bayesian was appointed
Chair of an English statistics department.

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:25.460
Frequentists called him 'a Jehovah's Witness
elected Pope'.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.369
[laughter]

00:38:27.369 --> 00:38:35.570
He, in turn, asked how to encourage Bayes'.
He replied tartly, "Attend funerals." The

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:42.590
Frequentists reported in kind that if Bayesians
would only do what Thomas Bayes had done and

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:50.800
publish after they were dead, we'd all be
saved a lot of trouble. [pause]

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:56.711
The extraordinary fact though about Bayes'
during the Cold War is that although the military

00:38:56.711 --> 00:39:02.700
was using Bayes' and the civilian Bayesians
were under attack, there were very few visible

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:11.070
civilian applications. For example, it was
an MIT physicist who used Bayesian methods

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:17.920
to do the first nuclear power plant safety
study 20 years after the industry started.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:24.820
He did it in 1973. And he predicted what actually
would happen at Three Mile Island. But he

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:31.710
had the big, bad Bayes word hidden in the
appendix of Volume Three of the multi-volume

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:39.800
Rasmussen Report. And the only big public
application of Bayes was one using the words

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.410
in the Federalist Papers as data.

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:50.310
Now, the Federalist Papers were a series of
essays that appeared in New York State newspapers

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:56.640
to convince New York State voters to vote
for the Constitution. And some of them were

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:02.530
anonymous. And Fred Mosteller of Harvard and
David Wallace of the University of Chicago

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:09.410
launched a massive Bayesian study and concluded
and convinced everyone that all twelve of

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:11.630
the anonymous Federalist Papers were written
by James Madison.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:19.370
But they also came to what they called an
"awesome statistical conclusion." And that

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:26.180
was, they said that 'Thomas Bayes' beginning
guess is controversial hated subjective prior

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:33.890
was irrelevant if you have a lot of data to
update it with.' The problem was that Mosteller

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:42.490
had to organize an army of about a hundred
Harvard students to punch the data into MITs

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:47.210
computer center and no one else was willing
to undertake such a mammoth organizational

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:48.220
problem.

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:58.380
By the 1980s though, another factor was working
against Bayes, too. And that was the computer

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:03.531
revolution was flooding the modern world with
enormous amounts of data and with a lot of

00:41:03.531 --> 00:41:10.430
unknowns. And Laplace's method had involved
integration of functions and it was hopelessly

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:11.820
complex.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:19.530
So, it was beginning to look, even to many
Bayesians, as though Bayes was an old-fashioned,

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:27.940
18th Century theory crying for a computer
and software. But many academic statisticians

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:35.880
thought computers were a copout. They'd started
out as abstract mathematicians. Most were

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.880
Frequentists.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:43.040
They focused on small data sets, relatively
small data sets, with few unknowns. They didn't

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:50.800
need computers. Bayesians themselves during
this period also didn't realize that the key

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:59.450
to making Bayes useful in the workplace was
not more theory, but computational ease.

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:05.130
Theorist Dennis Lindley, who'd been programming
his own computer since 1965 and actually regarded

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:12.130
Bayes' ideal for computers. He wrote me, "I
consider it a major mistake of my professional

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:18.490
life not to have appreciated the need for
computing rather than mathematical analysis.

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:27.760
I should have seen that Bayes' enabled one
to compute numerical answers." It was a particularly

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:34.660
poignant case of the Canadian mathematician
Keith Hastings, who published in 1970 what

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:40.390
should have been a real breakthrough paper,
what's now called 'The Hastings Metropolis

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:43.680
Algorithm', or simply 'The Metropolis Algorithm'.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.970
He used Markov chains, Monte Carlo sampling
techniques. Published it. Got no reaction

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:54.290
at all. A year later, drops out of research
and goes to teach at the University of British

00:42:54.290 --> 00:43:01.970
Columbia. And it was not until 20 years after
his, after his work when he was fully retired

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:06.680
that he realized the importance of what he
had done.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:12.380
And Hastings told me with some anguish in
his voice that his work was ignored because

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:19.050
quote "a lot of statisticians were not oriented
toward computing. Statisticians took these

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:26.280
theoretical courses, cranked out theoretical
papers, and some of them wanted an exact answer,

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.770
wanted exact answers, not estimates."

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:39.210
So, as a result, during the 1980s as computers
were pouring out this fascinating new data

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:45.720
about pulsars and plate tectonics and evolutionary
biology and pollution in the environment,

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:52.990
it was not analyzed often by, by statisticians.
It was analyzed by computer scientists, by

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:56.880
engineers, physicists and biologists.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:04.260
And it would be imaging that would force the
issue because by the late '70s, early 1980s,

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:12.230
industrial automation, the military, and medical
diagnostics were producing blurry images from

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:18.830
their ultrasound machine, PET scans, MRIs,
electron micrographs, telescopes, military

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:23.369
aircraft, and infrared sensors.

00:44:23.369 --> 00:44:30.480
And there was Bobby Hunt, who in 1977, finally
suggested that Bayes' could be used for image

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:37.850
restoration. He had done it while working
on strategic weapons programs and digital

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:44.940
image processing at Sandia and Los Alamos
National Labs in New Mexico.

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:51.410
During this period, others were introducing
iterations and Monte Carlo. And, in 1974.

00:44:51.410 --> 00:45:08.800
in 1984, if I can get the next slide. Alan
Gelfand and Adrian Smith--. [pause] Sorry.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:17.750
It's just a picture of Adrian Smith and Alan
Gelfand. Thank you. [pause] Who decide to

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:23.390
start something new. And Gelfand, reading
around, discovers the iterations and Gibbs

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:24.390
sampling.

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:31.310
Adrian Smith on the left, at the University
of Nottingham at the time. Alan Gelfand at

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:36.960
the right at University of Connecticut at
the time. And when Gelfand, the minute he

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:42.850
saw the papers on iteration and Gibbs sampling,
he said all the pieces fell together. Bayes,

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:46.990
Gibbs sampling, Monte Carlo, Markov chains,
iterations.

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:54.320
And they wrote their watershed synthesis,
now called MCMC for Markov chain-Monte Carlo,

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:58.570
very, very fast 'cause they were scared other
people would put the pieces together, too.

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:06.100
But they also wrote it very carefully. They
used the word 'Bayes' only five times in 12

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.390
pages.

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:14.180
And Gelfand told me later, "There was always
some concern about using the 'B' word, a natural

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:19.650
defensiveness on the part of Bayesians in
terms of rocking the boat. We were always

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:25.490
an oppressed minority trying to get some recognition.
And even if we thought we were doing it the

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:30.880
right way, we were only a small component
of the statistical community and we didn't

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:34.080
have much outreach into the scientific community."

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:39.980
But Bayesians thought the paper was an epiphany
and the next ten years is, what I call, a

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:45.830
frenzy of research, solving, calculating problems
that for two and a half centuries had only

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:54.460
been dreams. Gelfand, of course, says that
they were lucky because the relatively inexpensive

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:58.261
powerful workstations became available at
the same time.

00:46:58.261 --> 00:47:07.650
Then Smith's student, a David Spiegelhalter,
came out with his BUGS software. BUGS standing

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:14.380
for Bayesian Statistics Using Gibbs Sampling.
It was off the shelf software. He comes out

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:22.940
with the first one in 1991 and it's BUGS that
causes the biggest single jump in Bayesian

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:23.940
popularity.

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:32.230
And it sends Bayes out into this scientific
and the technological world, where outsiders

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:40.880
from computer science, from physics, artificial
intelligence, refresh it, broaden it, secularize

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:49.830
it, de-politicize it and it gets adopted almost
overnight. It was a modern paradigm shift

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:52.000
for a very pragmatic age.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.580
It happened overnight, not because people
changed their minds about a philosophy of

00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:02.200
science, but because finally it worked. The
battle between Bayesians and Frequentists

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:11.000
subsided. Researchers adopted--could adopt--the
method they thought fit their needs best.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.490
Prominent Frequentists moderated their positions.
Bradley Efron, a National Medal of Science

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:23.510
recipient who had written a classic defense
of Frequentism, recently said, "I've always

00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:26.230
been a Bayesian."

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:27.520
[laughter]

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:36.770
And someone else, who once called Bayes "the
crack-cocaine of statistics [laughter] --seductive,

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:47.550
addictive, and ultimately destructive" began
recruiting Bayesian interns for Google. Thank

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:50.060
you.

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:52.570
[applause]

00:48:52.570 --> 00:49:01.390
Now I'd be happy to try to answer some questions,
but it would be very kind of you if you'd

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:06.490
use the microphone so people could hear the
questions. And I wouldn't have to maul them,

00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:07.500
summarizing them.

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:11.710
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: So what was the
Neolithic discovery?

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:17.001
&gt;&gt;Sharon Bertsch McGrayne: It was that the--.
It had happened all of a sudden, within a

00:49:17.001 --> 00:49:22.100
short time period five thousand, five hundred
years ago. And that instead of their being

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:27.790
used for rites over the ages and built over
the ages, that they'd actually been built

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:31.220
and abandoned in this very short time period.

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:37.200
And they're so excited by this Bayesian mega-analysis
that they've done that they're gonna try another

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:43.250
of the early Anglo-Saxon period in Great Britain
next. Yes.

00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:45.100
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: OK. So--.

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:47.700
&gt;&gt;Sharon Bertsch McGrayne: Now remember I'm
not a mathematician.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:48.700
[laughter]

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:54.090
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: So, my training
actually is mathematics and we have, our controversies

00:49:54.090 --> 00:50:00.869
are, we have what's called the axiom of choice
which is about the behavior of infinite sets

00:50:00.869 --> 00:50:06.810
and the continuum hypothesis and all these
other sort of questioned axioms.

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:12.590
And if you assume not the axiom of choice,
you get one mathematics. If you assume it,

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:16.990
you get a different mathematics. But mathematicians
will all agree that these are just models.

00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:21.369
These are abstract ideas. It's not that this
axiom is true or not true 'cause it's formalisms.

00:50:21.369 --> 00:50:29.161
In the real world, you can't even substantiate
an infinite set anyway. How come with the

00:50:29.161 --> 00:50:30.161
statistical community, 'cause in the math
community it was like, whether it's useful.

00:50:30.161 --> 00:50:42.250
It's like, you can extend math this way or
that way. Which one is more useful as a model?

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:43.250
Why weren't they able to say, "OK, Bayesianism
might not make sense in some platonic way."

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:45.599
Or it might, there's selecting the priors,
which is more of an art than a science. But

00:50:45.599 --> 00:51:00.690
just based on the fact that it's useful, why
weren't people able to go with it? [pause]

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:05.530
&gt;&gt;Sharon Bertsch McGrayne: It's very odd because
a whole class of people, physicists, did use

00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:13.340
Bayes'. And they used it even before the Second
World War. Fermi used to do computations if

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:16.460
he couldn't sleep at night. He'd do Bayesian
computations.

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:17.460
[laughter]

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:20.570
And then he'd come in the next morning and
announce how the experiments of the day were

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:30.420
probably gonna come out. Well, we're not all
Fermis, but--. And during the war, Los Alamos

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:33.400
used them.

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:39.021
And after the war, the physicists actually
tried to get statisticians to, to use them.

00:51:39.021 --> 00:51:45.300
There were NATO conferences and so on. So,
it's very puzzling. There were articles that

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:51.360
told statisticians you can do it manually.
There were non-statisticians. There were historians

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:54.599
in the '60s using computers.

00:51:54.599 --> 00:52:03.300
I think they were trapped. They were so defensive.
They were such a small group and they were

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:11.570
under attack. That's not a good way to be,
mentally. You can't burst out if you're under--

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:14.881
if your fortress is under attack. That's the
only thing I've been able to conclude.

00:52:14.881 --> 00:52:15.881
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: So, you mentioned
in your book but not in the talk on the Lindley's

00:52:15.881 --> 00:52:16.881
paradox and this research now in Princeton
about psychokinetic random number generators

00:52:16.881 --> 00:52:23.100
that, according to a Frequentist, there was
just as significant that people had random

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:32.960
number generating abilities, but Bayesians
said that this is silly and the same study

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:36.760
proves that it doesn't exist.

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:47.030
Would you go into that more? Like, the study
was cooked, then. Bad. Garbage in, garbage

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:49.854
out. But was this real data? [pause]

00:52:49.854 --> 00:52:55.000
&gt;&gt;Sharon Bertsch McGrayne: Was it real data?
Well, I guess he had his machines recording

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:04.970
it, but I think the statisticians don't record
it, regard it as real data at all. The same

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:12.609
question came up just recently of--come on,
what's it called--ESP. And Frequentists' analysis

00:53:12.609 --> 00:53:16.310
saying that ESP could work.

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:24.140
It was something routed in the last year,
I think. So, it's a long-standing problem,

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:32.430
but Dennis Lindley I think cooked that guy's
data and said it was garbage. Garbage in and

00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:33.860
garbage out.

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:34.970
[laughter]

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:41.720
Yes, there's some papers about it and they're
in the bibliography.

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:51.480
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: To follow up on
that, there's an article on this very subject

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:56.350
in the latest issue of the Skeptical Inquirer.

00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:59.400
&gt;&gt;Sharon Bertsch McGrayne: Good. Good.

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:12.280
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: I'll try to find
my copy and bring it in. I just wanna remark

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:17.119
about history. I've been in computing since
1964 and when I was at Cornell, there was

00:54:17.119 --> 00:54:18.490
a tremendous, there was actually--. Oh, my
phone's going crazy.

00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:19.490
There were actual random walk problems in
the textbook, the programming textbook, and

00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:22.180
the social scientists were just generating
reports this big. I don't exaggerate. I hauled

00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:25.230
them around, of computer analysis, factans,
and xtabs and all kinds of crazy stuff.

00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:28.560
So, I think there's this whole background
of -- that was going on underneath this controversy

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:29.811
that was preparing us for it.

00:54:29.811 --> 00:54:37.360
&gt;&gt;Sharon Bertsch McGrayne: Howard Raiffa gives
his--. I was in a totally different kind of

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:42.500
meeting and someone asked what I was working
on and I said Bayes' rule. And he said, "Oh,

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:48.540
Bayes' rule? Howard Raiffa taught Bayes' rule
at Harvard Business School in the 1960s."

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:55.400
And he dug out of his notes this reference,
too. It's 60 or 80 pages on Bayes, Markov

00:54:55.400 --> 00:55:08.690
chains and so on. So, you're absolutely right.
So it's such a puzzle why--. [pause] I really

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:15.099
think it must have been the fortress mentality
that -- it's just hard to break out of that.

00:55:15.099 --> 00:55:20.619
If there aren't any more questions, I would
be happy to sign anyone's books if they want

00:55:20.619 --> 00:55:21.619
me to.

00:55:21.619 --> 00:55:23.619
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thank you very much.

00:55:23.619 --> 00:55:23.990
[applause]
