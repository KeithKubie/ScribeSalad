00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.325
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.350
Bitcoin represents a way to
transfer money anonymously

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.270
and at almost no cost.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.650
And since it's an arbitrary
currency with no nationality

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.030
attached to it, you're
free to exchange it

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.950
with anyone in the world.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.620
What is money?

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.840
Resources are limited, and they
hold explicit value to people.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.590
Most resources are
physical and such,

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.870
needed to be traded
in a physical form--

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.170
diamonds, gold coins,
chickens, or bikes.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.110
At some point, it becomes
too difficult to physically

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.690
transact those objects.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.340
And it's easier to
agree, collectively,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.890
on the value of cash
instead of gold.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.430
As we know today, this
has many advantages.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.660
Credit cards and
the modern banking

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.780
basically gave us
another abstraction layer

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.530
on top of cash.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.350
There is a centralized
system which

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.390
defines who own what resources.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.940
All of these trades
are made virtually.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.519
This is the backbone of why
Bitcoin is a valid idea.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.120
What is bitcoin?

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.110
Bitcoin is decentralized,
anonymous, digital-only

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.800
currency that recently
received public attention.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.830
Bitcoin was originally
developed in 2008.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.290
Like in any good mystery,
someone using the alias Satoshi

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.590
Nakamoto published
a paper describing

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.380
how Bitcoin could work.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.270
There's a very interesting
story about this guy too.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.090
He must be very
smart, but he never

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.180
came forward to claim ownership
or any part of the revenue.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.380
Just one year later, in 2009,
Bitcoin started being traded.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.040
Where do they come from?

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.450
Think about gold.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.250
You could buy it or mine it.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.325
And it's the same
concept with Bitcoin.

00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:47.620
You do this by
using your computer

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.540
to hunt for 64-digit numbers.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.160
By having your
computer repeatedly

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.000
solve complex
mathematical puzzles,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.880
you're competing
with other miners

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.720
to generate the number that the
Bitcoin network is looking for.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.790
If your computer generates it
first, you receive bitcoins.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.200
The Bitcoin system is
programed to generate

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.620
a fixed number of bitcoins
by unit of computing time.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.980
It is also self-sustaining,
coded to prevent inflation,

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.890
and encrypted to prevent anyone
from disrupting its code.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.540
In the year 2140,
the total number

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.160
of bitcoins in circulation
will be capped at 21 million.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.840
So how much is a
bitcoin worth today?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.110
You'll need to google it.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.390
Just type, Bitcoin in
US dollars, for example.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.844
You could also check
it out at preev.com.

00:02:35.844 --> 00:02:38.240
Why are they anonymous?

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.900
Bitcoin are
[INAUDIBLE] anonymous,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.820
because they are built
upon decentralized system.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.200
The bitcoins themselves
are anonymous.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.370
The wallets are not.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.500
Here's why.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.770
The base algorithm
creates anonymity.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.730
But as the recent
court cases show,

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.260
if your Bitcoin Wallet is
identified and attached

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.240
to a person, then someone
can go through and track

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.490
every transaction you've made.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.880
Bitcoins exist
entirely on their own,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.810
because there's no central
infrastructure to shut down.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.870
You are identified by nothing
more than your Bitcoin Wallet

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.730
address, a string of
randomized letters and numbers.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.640
There are absolutely no
identifying characteristics

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.120
beyond it.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.140
For the paranoid
dude, you can simply

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.074
create a new wallet
for each transaction.

00:03:22.074 --> 00:03:23.740
Here are some interesting
start-ups that

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.880
pushed the technology forward.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.242
We are still in the
initial phase of bitcoins.

00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:30.200
And there are many
challenges and opportunities

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.160
ahead-- exchanges, wallets,
merchant services, security,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.330
and more.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.820
But this is something
for another episode.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.554
Until next time,
eat your vegetables

00:03:39.554 --> 00:03:40.720
and listen to your partners.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.770
