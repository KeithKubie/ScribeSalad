1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:01,730
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,760
Hey, what's going on it's spilled? Burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:04,761 --> 00:00:07,320
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,360
just checking in on you. I'm
just checking in on you. Du,

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,220
Du, Du, Du. Hey, guess what? What? I uh,

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,200
I am fucking on it this year when it
comes to Christmas. Hey, Christmas.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,520
Go Fuck Yourself. That's what I'm
saying. I'm talking all kinds of shit.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,850
I'm backing up. I'm wagging my
fucking head at your Christmas.

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,480
I'm sorry.
I'm just excited.

10
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,790
I got all my shit wrapped and I
shipped it out today. Fuck you over.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,673
Over.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,170
That's it. All I need to do is
get a pair of Jordans, right?

13
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:49,690
Whatever the fuck verse he says
in, in, that's it. It's over.

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,000
The greatest fucking feeling ever
this holiday is like, you know,

15
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:59,470
when you become an adult, it's dreadful.
It's like, Oh fuck man, I gotta. You know,

16
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:03,100
I got to bring the kid over here.
I got fucking get this person something.

17
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:07,960
Oh Jesus, what do I gotta get this guy
a calendar or something. I got to show,

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,940
I got to show them how much I care about
is stories that have no fucking point,

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,953
you know,

20
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,350
got at least get them a stocking stuffer
for how many minutes of my life did he

21
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,390
waste this year. Just the, the, the,
the, the fucking stress of that.

22
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,890
Um, I gotta tell you something by,
in the things and wrapping him,

23
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,710
slapping a name on them and then once
you mail that fucking thing I do,

24
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,990
it's like a high, it'd be like
runners talk about like runner's high,

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,400
you know,

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,010
which is hilarious because if you look
at the look on their face when they're

27
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:41,290
running, it does not look like
they're enjoying themselves.

28
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,680
Every person I've ever seen jogging
down the street, like not everyone,

29
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:47,650
but most of them, they look like they
should acquit. Like two miles ago,

30
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,630
they'll lean into one side. They kind
of got that fucking stroke mouth going,

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,230
you're not the fucking one. It's
like to just enough, already enough.

32
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:59,780
We get it. We get it, we get
it. You're a, you're, you're,

33
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,780
you're a fitness fucking grew guru. Slow
down. Walk. Go over to that Taco stand.

34
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,680
All right. Get yourself a fucking
Taco with something. All right.

35
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,840
Just relax. Um, who do you hate
more joggers of bike riders?

36
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,800
Yeah. Who Do you hate more
joggers of bike riders? Neither.

37
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:21,370
I like everybody on the poverty of force.
It balances out your life.

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,810
Get the hell out of my office.

39
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,840
And you crushed on the podcast.
Let's see if you've got another one in.

40
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:32,740
You don't hit me. I gotta go. I gotta
go to the gym by you go into the gym.

41
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:37,310
What folder you all Hollywood.
You're trying to get you
abs going for 2018. Yeah,

42
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,580
a beefcake.
Alright,

43
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,310
bye. Um, oh wait.

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,800
Oh is the anticlimactic then
you got to come back. Come on,

45
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:54,400
give me a kiss goodbye. Let me kiss
goodbye. Actually, you know what?

46
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:58,300
Give it to me when I come when you come
home. All right, I'll see. Asshole.

47
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,790
Gross. Oh, I got all the tags.
Nia for the gifts and stuff.

48
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,500
Yup. And I try to make your Nia when
I said from uncle bill and aunt teeny,

49
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:11,530
I try to make it look like
your handwriting, but it
clearly looks like mine.

50
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,060
It doesn't need to be.

51
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,600
Plus I'm left handed so it's smudged
across and I forgot to sign your name to

52
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:18,820
the card. The one that said
how much we care about them.

53
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,000
It's the second time I've done that.
You are the work.

54
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,140
There's going to be a lot of
Hosta. I didn't do that to
you. You need I'm kidding.

55
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,400
Come back please.
I'm

56
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,740
the fucking Shit that women are into
is just, you know, she got a card.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,370
Did sign my name to what
about yeah. All right. I mean

58
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,130
how could you do that? How everybody's
getting sick. I don't care.

59
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,650
No they're not. They
have lives. Um, anyways,

60
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:51,150
I got this shit fucking rap.
I got,

61
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,940
I got like one more thing to get my wife
and have all of that fucking wrapped.

62
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,090
All right. And I just see, here
you go. Alright, here you go.

63
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,860
Leave me alone and then I'm gonna, I
gotta like eloquently come off the wagon.

64
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,610
I'm still on the wagon. I
got 15 weeks in. All right.

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,290
I'm already a third of the year
in 26 weeks is half a year,

66
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,430
but that takes me into February and
I'm going to the rose bowl so that,

67
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:18,750
that's the next tough one.

68
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,430
That's the next hurdle I have to get
past is if I could somehow go to the rose

69
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:28,410
bowl and not get all fucked up,
which I've done before. I've done it.

70
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,130
I've done, I think I've done a couple of
times. I've done the Rosebowl sober. Um,

71
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,900
I don't know what, but, uh, I'm
actually, I was thinking the other night,

72
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:40,650
like when I come back to drinking,
all right?

73
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,510
When we rekindle our relationship,
you know, like you have a c,

74
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:47,310
there was a particular person out here in
Hollywood, had an abusive relationship.

75
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,790
Skye was beating the shit out of her and
stuff, and then she went back to him,

76
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,990
you know, being like, no,
we fixed it this time.

77
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,340
And I remember the talk show
hosts were like going like,

78
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,860
are you sure you know what you're doing?
This is me going back to Boosie. Um,

79
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,580
with my little barbed wire tattoo,
um,

80
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,350
I think I'm just going
to go straight to heroin.

81
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,270
Like I for some reason feel
like I can handle it at my age,

82
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,760
you know,
cause I know how stupid it is to do.

83
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:18,150
I would just do it like one time and
just be sitting there like right in the

84
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:22,050
living room to just don't, don't have
the shame that most junkies have.

85
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,420
You just sit down with your
family. You just say, listen,

86
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:26,040
this is something that I want to try.

87
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,290
I'm just gonna do it once and I would
appreciate it if you guys would hang out

88
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:36,000
during my entire high and make sure that
I don't tip over and bust my head open

89
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:39,260
on the coffee table with, even though
we have the kid proof things around it,

90
00:05:39,261 --> 00:05:42,990
it'd be actually a lot of that kid proof
shit becomes junky proof after a while.

91
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:44,640
You know,
I'm,

92
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,810
I'm kidding and I'm not making light
of the nationwide heroin epidemic,

93
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:52,650
but we all know that the nationwide heroin
epidemic is not the biggest story in

94
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:55,950
the country right now.
That's not the biggest story.

95
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:01,040
It's not that they've poisoned our food
supply fellow Americans. It's not that.

96
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,870
It's not that after all the protests,

97
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,840
they're still gonna put that
fucking pipeline and it's not that.

98
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,650
What is the biggest story?
Huh?

99
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,760
Matt Lauer buying a fucking Dildo
for the stand in weather person.

100
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,410
It's not that

101
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,440
having a president who's out of his fuck.
Nate's not debt.

102
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,730
The biggest story in the United States
of America right now is Eli Manning is

103
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:36,191
being sat on Sunday and it's 210 game
streak is coming to a close and all of New

104
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,250
York shot down.
They couldn't believe that Alicia Manning,

105
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,720
I didn't know his name was Alicia.

106
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:50,110
I have never seen such a
fucking ridiculous reaction
while ignoring real fucking

107
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:52,874
problems.

108
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,760
There's like 30,000 fucking tornado or
whatever the fuck we had. Hurricanes, Eh,

109
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,460
fuck all that. Miami is giving
you on the water like Dilla.

110
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,530
The fucking texts that I got from
New York sports fans, my friends,

111
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:10,460
like the level that they were
having a fucking meltdown, you know,

112
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,230
fuck the rope.

113
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,650
A dope that's going on in the Middle East
right now where you got a fucking band

114
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:15,651
,

115
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:20,651
a fucking 3,500 nitwits bankrupting a
billion dollar company is they got a bag

116
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:24,770
of rocks that were flying. F
eighteens, Adam blowing all our cash.

117
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,660
Fuck all of that.

118
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,470
Eli Manning is being sat on Sunday.

119
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,520
I got a buddy of mine.
He flipped out so bad.

120
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:38,270
He's actually betting against the
giants. It's like, dude, if Gino sucks,

121
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:42,230
which I don't think he's going to,
no one knows how good Geno Smith is.

122
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:43,460
He played on the jets.

123
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,290
No one knows how good anybody is when
they play for the jets. The jets,

124
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,430
sorry, everybody out in Queens. But you
know there's an element of truth to that.

125
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,120
Okay. The patriots used to
be like that. All right,

126
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:57,500
so there is hope for you guys.

127
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,550
God knows bill Belicheck is 70 years old
and we all saw Tom Brady try to recover

128
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:05,630
that bad snap last week. Right. You saw
when he was running after that thing,

129
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,620
he looked his age.

130
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,760
He looked like a guy who forgot to set
his parking brake and was still hobbling

131
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:14,390
after his fucking car and then realize
like, I'm not going to break my leg.

132
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,510
I don't fuck it. I got insurance on this
car and it just flopped on the ground.

133
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,670
Um,
deaf geno Smith shits the bed.

134
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:28,730
Eli's going to be back in the second
quarter. All right. And by the way,

135
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,110
this happens to every quarterback.
No matter how good they were,

136
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,420
no matter how good of
a class act they were,

137
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:40,421
this happens to everyone to fuck happened
to Peyton manning after all those

138
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:45,601
years of standing there with at least
19 inches of his 42 inch neck exposed

139
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:50,710
between his helmet in his shoulder pads,
it finally fucking gave out.

140
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,370
And what did that fucking Guy Jim or say,

141
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:56,180
ah,

142
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,660
the fucking national enquirer
of fucking sports owners.

143
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,130
He turned his fucking back on him.
Okay.

144
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,360
It Peyton manning, he went to fucking
eastern Europe. He went to Transylvania,

145
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:08,601
right?

146
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:12,530
And he got fucking child's blood pumped
into his fucking do whatever the hell it

147
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:16,970
virgin blood pump did do his fucking neck.
And he comes back to Jim Rsa and says,

148
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,230
[inaudible] right,
whatever that whatever the fuck he talks,

149
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,350
why don't you put me in
this week? Whatever the fuck
he said to them, you know,

150
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:30,880
probably make more money doing that.
And I had a board larger. Right?

151
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,130
What did Jim or say say he said Peyton,
with all due respect,

152
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,000
fuck you and your fucking
three feet and neck.

153
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,200
We'll move on on bore tank in the rest
of this season so we can get Andrew Luck.

154
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,180
That's what the fuck happened. Look what
happened at Brett [inaudible]. Right?

155
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,460
Be fucker. He actually had to
go to the jets. Eli Manning,

156
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,260
all these guys with his
quiver and bottom lip.

157
00:09:57,261 --> 00:10:01,700
All he's gotta do is sit on the fucking
bench for a couple of place. That's it.

158
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,250
Okay.

159
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,580
It's all you got to do.
Everybody losing their fucking minds.

160
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,950
How could they do this?

161
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:11,330
How could they do the exact same fucking
thing that they don't? Everybody.

162
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,550
You remember the end of Derek Jeter,

163
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,600
his career when all those sports
writers will fucking bitch and a bottom.

164
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:19,450
Sandy's a, he's costing the
team. He's too fucking old.

165
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:24,430
Should they move him over to first base?
This happens to everybody. You know.

166
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,260
You don't think that
talking about me right now?

167
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:27,660
Yeah.

168
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,310
The way I'm fucking look in these days.

169
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,110
I have like three friends of mine
that are are, I love the, the,

170
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:40,960
the biggest New York fans ever.
And I,

171
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:45,800
I got like fucking phone book
level texts about what was going,

172
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,580
you think it's going to
end pretty with Tom Brady?

173
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:49,590
This guy wants to play to least like 60.

174
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,400
It's some 0.0 fucking Bob Kraft is going
to have to sit down and be like top,

175
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:01,410
it's you're too old. I mean, look at yet
you still have a Beatle mania haircut.

176
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,900
What fucking year did
you come in the league?

177
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,273
Yeah.

178
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,790
You got a fucking Moe Howard haircut
with the fucking part. I mean,

179
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,640
I don't even know what to tell fucking
Bill Clinton was still president when you

180
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:16,474
came in.

181
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,733
Yeah.

182
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,780
MMM. I don't know what to tell you.
Uh, this happens to everybody. Yeah.

183
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:28,550
It's obviously a shame. Eli's
fucking great. Uh, I got to tell you,

184
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,050
it's sucks is a patriots fan watching
the giants just fucking dismantle.

185
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:37,100
And I wanted one more crack at them.
We had nothing to lose.

186
00:11:37,101 --> 00:11:38,960
You already kicked our ass fucking twice.

187
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,440
We'll come back like tex
Cobb for a third one.

188
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,360
And I was loving and there would always
be an asterick even if the giants made

189
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:52,850
the Superbowl. And even if with the
Patriots made the Superbowl this year,

190
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:57,480
if came back without Tom Kauflin and we
won that one, that still would be at,

191
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,970
that still wouldn't be the same.
They went.

192
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,860
That's the level of respect that I have
for fucking the giants organization,

193
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,570
Tom Kauffman and Eli, Alicia Manic. I'm
just breaking your balls. New York fans.

194
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:09,220
I know. It sucks. You know what?

195
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:12,910
It really is all you guys flipping out
and you're acting like you love Eli

196
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,720
Manning,
but you really are,

197
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,710
is you're a bunch of selfish cons
because watching Eli gets benched,

198
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,140
it's just reminding you of how
fucking old you're getting.

199
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,350
And now we're all gonna die.
It reminds you of your own mortality.

200
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,390
So rather than deal with that,

201
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,230
you call in sports shows
losing your fucking voice,

202
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,270
you know?

203
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,700
And meanwhile we're fucking blown $1
billion a month fighting people who have

204
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:39,450
slingshots and a bag of
dynamite. Um, anyway,

205
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,780
um, I swear to God, if I was running,
this is how I would handle isis.

206
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:47,880
I would just fucking
take, I would, I would,

207
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,140
whatever those fucking gamers are that
actually got to play on the giant TV

208
00:12:52,141 --> 00:12:53,850
screen in Dallas Cowboys Stadium.

209
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:58,090
If you're good enough to do those
guys with those drone races in,

210
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,680
in that stadium, like that would
be my defense against Isis,

211
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,580
some intelligence and that I have those
fuckers sitting in cowboys stadium where

212
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:10,170
the cowboys didn't have a game and I
just have them flying around, you know,

213
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:14,570
blowing up at jungle Jim's. I mean,
that's how I would handle it. Okay.

214
00:13:14,571 --> 00:13:19,370
And considering I haven't even physical
fiscally researched this on any level.

215
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,670
I haven't talked to anybody who is even
remotely informed about what's going on

216
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:29,780
over there. The fact that I did this
in my own self contained think tank,

217
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,680
I cannot even begin to describe to
you how much this makes sense to me.

218
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,300
You know, come on dude, you got,

219
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:39,330
you don't sit by yourself sometimes
and just start solving all the world's

220
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:43,060
problems. You start walking
around your house whispering,

221
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,480
pretending you're getting interviewed by
Oprah. Come on. We all do this though. We,

222
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,040
okay.

223
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,670
Oprah sitting across from you,
do you consider yourself a hero?

224
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:53,700
Um,

225
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,260
is you sit there and muttering to yourself
and then somehow you come into your

226
00:13:56,261 --> 00:13:57,450
fucking present,

227
00:13:57,451 --> 00:14:00,490
need you to sit in this scrubbing like
a fucking old rice checkoff a bowl,

228
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,210
and you have that split second of just
really stepping outside of yourself.

229
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,650
It'd be like, well, I'm really,
I'm a fucking crazy person.

230
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,060
Yeah.

231
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,640
And then all of a sudden the front door
opens and your family walks in and you

232
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,740
go right back into character
and they have no idea.

233
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,020
Could you stand in there with this
phony smile and awareness sweater?

234
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,180
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,640
Okay.

236
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,940
Anyways, a happy trails.
Matt Lauer, you know,

237
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:30,140
you did a hell of a job waking
everybody up, uh, for the last 20 years.

238
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,120
And uh,

239
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,273
okay.

240
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,540
Yeah,
you got a little sideways.

241
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:40,723
Oh,

242
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,833
okay.

243
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:46,210
How do you buy a sex toy for somebody
you work with and then write a letter?

244
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,480
I mean, Jesus for when it's
just walk around with a
fucking neon sign around your

245
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:52,490
goddamn neck. I swear to God,
did people get this successful?

246
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,130
And they just like want access
avatars their own fucking career.

247
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,900
Although maybe he's just like old school.
He came in,

248
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,930
he came in the league when that he was,

249
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,040
I don't know when you could do that
because you've got to think when he first

250
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,170
started buying like
fucking shit like that.

251
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,460
If it was the late nineties when you
think about the cell phone technology,

252
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:17,360
texting didn't even exist. There was
none of that shit. There was no Facebook,

253
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:18,194
there was nothing.

254
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,793
MMM.

255
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,050
I mean, what could, that won't pull a
woman. Do Rick run off a bunch of copies,

256
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,310
put them on telephone
poles? It just, you know,

257
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,580
and then you just have an assistant
run out and tear them down.

258
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,510
Matt Lauer screaming from the
window. I said, turned out right?

259
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:43,270
Um, I dunno. I Dunno.

260
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,000
Anyways, I'm going to be in New
Mexico, in Albuquerque, New Mexico,

261
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,390
southwest. Part of the state,
I mean as part of the country,

262
00:15:52,391 --> 00:15:55,990
and I'm going to be an Arizona
this weekend. Come on down.

263
00:15:55,991 --> 00:15:59,230
I mean at the route 66 casino. Where
the fuck am I going to be in Arizona?

264
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,700
I like Arizona Doodah Doodah because
it's only an hour away on a southwest

265
00:16:07,571 --> 00:16:12,460
flight. Again, on the fucking plane.
I listened to this stupid jokes.

266
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,410
Then they say,
we're beginning our initial descent.

267
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,130
Please raise all your tray
tables in your seats please.

268
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,300
How come this fucking thing isn't loading?
Why is my signal flow work?

269
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,240
Okay?

270
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,830
Oh, Jesus Christ. Well, we'll get
back to this, by the way, by the way,

271

00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:23,380
diamond casino in Sahar route.

287
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,370
I Sahuarita Saturday,
Arizona.

288
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,840
This is the degenerate tour.
Um,

289
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,400
and then on December 10th
I just added this date.

290
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:38,380
I'm going to be at the island [inaudible]
theater in Santa Barbara, California.

291
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,970
All right. Santa Barbara.
Speaking of Oprah Winfrey,

292
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,780
one of our giant houses is up there.
Maybe she'll show up to the show.

293
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
MMM.
[inaudible]

294
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,070
I'm going to be up there.

295
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:54,910
And then December 14th it'll be at
the hard rock live in Hollywood,

296
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:59,380
Florida in December 16th. Bob
Carr Theater in Orlando, Florida.

297
00:17:59,381 --> 00:18:03,520
And on the 15th, I'm going to the magic.
I got to get some tickets for that,

298
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:07,870
by the way. I got to figure out what
the fuck I'm doing over there. Um,

299
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,870
anyways, should I read some
advertising here? What else did I want?

300
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:14,830
All my ribs are feeling better. In case
you were asking case, you were wondering.

301
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,080
I got misused and I'm
trying to lay off the drums.

302
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,550
I'm trying. Um, did I mention that I'm
building a drum room finally in my house.

303
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:28,240
I've had it. I've had it with having
to drive to go to my fucking drums.

304
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,600
Just having a kid now you gotta wait
till they take a nap and then you run out

305
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:34,840
there and for fucking 20 minutes
to an hour and six minutes,

306
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,530
he play fucking drums with the
little kid monitor there. Right.

307
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,180
So you can see when she gets up,

308
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,280
then they go back and that's how I'm going
to do it. That's, that's my game plan.

309
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,970
Um,
you know what he actually did,

310
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:53,890
I have almost every modern
drummer from the 1980s. And,

311
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:59,260
um,
I was looking at him the other day and uh,

312
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,740
I saw that old Steve Jordan one that
they didn't like 86 or 85 where a Dave

313
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,020
Garibaldi broke down his ghost notes and
all that Shit for messing with the kid.

314
00:19:09,021 --> 00:19:12,610
I gotta get that down. I got
to learn that shit. That's,

315
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,310
that's my next fucking goal. All right?
My goal isn't to become a better person.

316
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:20,570
My goal is to recreate what was already
created and then hope that somebody

317
00:19:20,571 --> 00:19:24,240
notices and is impressed by
me. Um, all right, let's read,

I was saying was remotely amusing,

they show my, I show my age.

332
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,450
I don't think Christmas sweaters are
ugly. I think they're very festive. Uh,

333
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,740

rug that has like snowmen on it. Um,

344
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,470
Uh,
oh my God.

345
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:56,940
Yeah.

346
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,820
They got an Obama one that
says miss me yet on the back.

347
00:20:59,821 --> 00:21:03,090
They should have all his drone attack
with a list of all the people who weren't

348
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:08,040
terrorists. Can we fucking be balanced
in this country? Jesus fucking Christ.

349
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,040
I don't understand this hero
worship of that guy. I really don't.

350
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:16,290
What did he do? You know what
the best thing about Obama was?

351
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,480
He could deliver a fucking speech,
you know,

352
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,250
and I don't even know how
good he was considerate.

353
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,700
He was in between Bush and fucking
Trump. So that's really like, you know,

354
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:26,680
that's really setting
the bar for like low. He,

355
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,560
he finally won Shane [inaudible] and
you're not going to fool me again. I mean,

356
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:36,450
how do you not follow that? And then
I don't know what this other guy said.

357
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,100
Donald Trump is so fucking batty.
I actually had this thought the other day.

358
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:41,630
Well thank God Mike Pence is in there.

359
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,820
Um, okay. I got to give it up to
these guys. Tipsy elves. Yeah.

I like the suit though.

362
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,530
I going to be honest with you. I
am actually digging the suit. Um,

363
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,470

367
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:20,780
of the latest guy would get fucking ousted
out of his career for buying sex toys.

better in a suit. You know, guys,

382
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:24,370
when I sit on the promenade checking
out who's going to be my next boyfriend,

383
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,660
I have to admit I am,

384
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,340
I gravitate to a guy's junk
that's in a three piece suit.

385
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,030
I don't know what it is. I just feel like

lining, monogram, and more.

389
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,920
Indochino has been featured in
major publications including Gq,

390
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,350
Forbes, and the fat. I
think douchebags read Gq.

391
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,580
Don't take what kind of an asshole has
that kind of fucking time to pick out.

392
00:23:59,581 --> 00:24:01,500
Like the perfect pen and pencil set

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,860
is what you write out your fucking,
you know, $64 to the electric company,

00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:23,790
international spy but isn't one,
you know,

399
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,170
they're just kind of fucking old

back me on ds me on
[inaudible].

413
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:22,260
Why are we fighting these doses?
But Dude [inaudible] beyond the,

414
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:26,140
you could go out and I fucking pick Duke,
Bob and lately on this song,

415
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,570
why do I keep doing? I got to
pick an easier word to rhyme with.

416
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:36,780
[inaudible] just been off my game
lately. You know, me, me undies,

417
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,550
Isis is on a jungle gym due
due due to me on beyond Ds.

418
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,630
We could beat them with the Slim Jim.

419
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,220
Why go down that road every year?

420
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:50,370
Millions of people receive the least
like gift of all time, underwear,

421
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:56,040
underwear, right. Even if you get
your wife some sexy underwear,

422
00:25:56,041 --> 00:26:00,510
that's cause kind of a gross gift isn't
it? I guess on some level she psyched.

423
00:26:00,511 --> 00:26:03,480
You're still attractive, but you know
what you really are saying. You know,

424
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:07,050
I'd come on, you know, what are
you saying? You know what I mean?

425
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:12,810
I'm surprised feminists haven't
brought that up. Lingerie is slavery.

426
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:19,080
Um, but we still give it to our families
and our loved ones who just wanted,

427
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,460
isn't that a weird sentence
to just read out of context,

428
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,900
but we still give it to our families and
our loved ones who just don't want it.

429
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:32,280
It's kind of rapey. Uh, but yeah, maybe
it's not that underwear is the problem.

430
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,890

445

Put some bourbon in your Eggnog,

453
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:55,720
yet done at 35 bucks at a
department store, you're
looking at four to 500 bucks,

454
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:59,050
sorry, move or watches or just 95
bucks. Edited Department Store.

455

You're looking at four to 500 bucks.

456
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:02,740
Yeah.

457

459
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,140

that by selling online,

460
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:12,960
they were able to cut out the
middleman and retail markup,

461
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:16,290

470
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:51,990

it? I think that's like 28 minutes.

471
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,803
Um,

472
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,110
yeah.

473
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,490
Yeah. I'm going to try,
you know something.

474
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,530
I'm going to try and get out
and do some stand up tonight.

475
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,680
I think I'm going to do that cause I
got some gigs the next couple of nights.

476
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,530
Right. Go out there and
shake the fucking dust off.

477
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,760
I've been in the edit room almost every
night of this week. Okay. Only two nights,

478
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:13,690
but it felt like every night with my add.
Um,

479
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,560
we are currently editing season
three of f is for family.

480
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,300
Um, I don't know when it's going to be.
It's going to be out later on next year.

481
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:27,100
Uh, that's how it works. Animation.
It's a very slow process. But um,

482
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:32,380
I'm really loving all this
season is coming together
and I'm hoping you guys are

483
00:29:32,381 --> 00:29:32,770
too.

484
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:37,240
And if you don't then I guess we won't
get a season four and if we don't get a

485
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:40,570
season four, I will be sad. But
I'll also have a lot of free time.

486
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,910
So it's one of those deals. So
who knows, who knows what happens.

487
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,860
So maybe I'll just take the show and
just start fucking putting it up on my

488
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:51,280
website. Maybe I'll do something like
that. That would be stupid building.

489
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:53,830
You have to finance it
yourself and you go bankrupt.

490
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:57,460
Just fucking watch season three so I
could stay with my cushy deal. It Netflix.

491
00:29:57,461 --> 00:30:01,690
Can you do that for me? If not, can you
go to the Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit?

492
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,690
Uh, I'll be announcing more
special guests as we go.

493
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,050
We might have a surprise guest at night.
We're reaching out to some people.

494
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,290
We'll see what happens. Um,
it's always a great night.

495
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:14,390
We always tell Patrice stories,
we give each other shit and uh,

496
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,510
it's obviously for a great
cause. Okay. That's it.

497
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:20,950
Please enjoy the music as we transition
into a, an old school Thursday afternoon,

498
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:24,720
just before Friday, Monday morning podcast
from a Thursday from, I don't know,

499
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:29,080
years gone by or possibly earlier
this year. I have no idea. That's it.

500
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:33,460
Have a wonderful weekend.
Uh, you can't and I will,

501
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,570
I will talk to you on Monday.

502
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,433
Okay.

503
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,320
[inaudible]

504
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,690
guys, this youtube video. There we go.

505
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,010
Bill Barr was telling us that he found
a fine video club called best, uh,

506
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,420
best wrestling promos ever starring
this guy. Jump Jeff Farmer.

507
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,180
I'm judging,
I'm guessing that it's from like the 80s,

508
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,690
and this is before Vince Mcmahon sewed
everything up. So it's an independent, uh,

509
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,180
wrestling thing. I don't know. I don't
know where at, but this guy is legit.

510
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,600
So basically what it is, is this guy
jumping Jeff farmers get, you know,

511
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:12,510
he's going to promote the show.
Jeff Farmer jumping Jeff Farmer,

512
00:32:12,511 --> 00:32:15,900
he's going to promote his big wrestling
match coming up on the Saturday.

513
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,920
He's going to do the ric flair thing.
[inaudible] something.

514
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,110
He's supposed to be doing that shit
and eat it. Might have a little, uh,

515
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,430
a little bit of a tough, tough time.
We've all been spoiled by the, uh,

516
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,250
professionalness of the wrestlers and uh,
how,

517
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:31,380
how they're able to rock the mic and
really get on there and ad Lib and talk.

518
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,810
And uh, this guy apparently
doesn't have the skills.

519
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,470
He's still in the development phase.
I'm not going to judge this entire career.

520
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,340
Oh, so you got salmon.
He's a wrestling expert

521
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:43,600
as an expert. I mean, yeah,

522
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,360
Sam will really come running down
the hall of those floppy feet.

523
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,100
We've got to promote that. Kevin Smith's
calling the show today too. Oh yeah.

524
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,500
She'll just keeps getting
better and by Oh my God,

525
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,360
he tweeted awhile ago that he's,
he's sleeping on his phone right now,

526
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,830
so, so they'd wake them up for the,
uh, the interview today. So, uh,

527
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,840
Kevin Smith in about 15, 20 minutes.
All right, let's check this out.

528
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:10,180
Best Wrestling Promo. Ever earlier
we talked. Good jump in. Joe Farmer.

529
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,220
Let's go now to that interview folks.
There's jump in Jeff Farmer. Yeah.

530
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,340
Lot of back. What a Matthew
had with mildly. Yup.

531
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,160
Probably the hardest back
I ever had in my life

532
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,720
when things aren't going my way.
Motley Crue,

533
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:33,910
he turned the tables on me.
You turned the tables in a wrong way.

534
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,690
You got me mad.
Now I'll turn it around.

535
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:41,760
I've listened to everything you had
to say. I did everything necessary.

536
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:48,340
When you turn around and you back fed me
one way or another and you take me out

537
00:33:48,341 --> 00:33:50,680
of what rightfully mine.
When I get angry,

538
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:56,080
now I'm the one doing the challenging.
I'm issuing a challenge for you.

539
00:33:56,081 --> 00:34:01,081
Motley crews get in the
ring with me this time

540
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,680
going full bore.

541
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:11,280
Go Up and Joe Farmer
Jumping Jeff.

542
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,070
That guy is [inaudible].

543
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:17,770
That is the worst intro ever got
your ass kicked last week. Yup. Yup,

544
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,380
Yup.
Motley crews,

545
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,780
the panic on his face like he
looks like he's going to laugh,

546
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,330
but that's what I was supposed to,
I was supposed to go on with this shit.

547
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,580
He looks like he's going to piss himself
with math.

548
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,940
I was saying he played the fake
staying in one point. Is that True Sam?

549
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,050
Does he look familiar?
I don't think so.

550
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,000
He never had a career in wrestling really.

551
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,610
Someone was trying to say he's
in the wrestling hall of fame,

552
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:45,660

The refi arrests now how can it around?

555
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:00,130
I've lifted into everything. You
know that guy? Oh no, go ahead.

556
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,630
You had another guy. What are
you doing? Then you had to say,

557
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,070
oh, give a list of when you turn around
and you back there me one way or another,

558
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,790
and you treat me out of what's
rightfully mine. That when I get angry,

559
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:19,220
now I'm the one doing the challenging.
I'm issuing a challenge to you.

560
00:35:19,221 --> 00:35:22,680
Motley crews get in the ring with me.

561
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,793
Um,

563
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:34,720
go up and Joe Farmer, that
guy's classic too, by the way.

Find a way. All Wrestling Promo
bloopers are, she's a genius and

565
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:45,330
Great Kim Proterra. It's just fantastic.
Some bloopers out there, dude.

566
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,810
Have you ever seen the one where booker
t calls Hong Kong in the n word and then

567
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,780
grabbed his head because he's humiliated?

00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,840
[inaudible] calls Tony Atlas a black
boy back when he was a thunder lips.

569
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:03,160
Oh, this one's great. Yeah. What's the

570
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,053
right here?

571
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,613
I should

572
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,190
[inaudible] best is when he turns around.
He looks at the girl and his crew like,

573
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,270
Vince is going to kill us.

574
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,233
[inaudible]

575
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,163
I should

576
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,650
[inaudible] which he
should have been able to

577
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,950
[inaudible] his character.

578
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:58,330
Genius. Genius. LEX Luger's genius.

579
00:36:58,331 --> 00:37:02,820
The Lex Luger blooper right there.
[inaudible] slugger one

580
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,393
[inaudible]

581
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:16,270
the best part is he goes to cover his
face and then he makes it look like he's

582
00:37:16,271 --> 00:37:17,410
rubbing his hands together.

583
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:22,670
He's thinking maybe this will fly
after all, so I got to cover up.

584
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:25,850
I just fucked up the whole time he's
got his chest, his pecs, doing that,

585
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,950
moving up and down.
This one's good because it's taken,

586
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,300
like when they do smack down,

587
00:37:31,301 --> 00:37:33,970
they'd tape it to rebroadcast
and they edited sometimes. Yeah,

588
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,200
but if you have a satellite dish,

589
00:37:35,201 --> 00:37:37,960
you can pick up the satellite
feed and watch it live.

590
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,950
So they got the satellite feed of Hong
Kong and just completely like fucking

591
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:44,620
starting over,
but okay.

592
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,460
Oh,
he messes up in front of the him.

593
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,740
The fact that I had something to do with
building this company just makes you

594
00:37:58,901 --> 00:37:59,734
sick.

595
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,630
The fact that I am the one that
put this company on the map,

596
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,720
it helps you make it what it is today.

597
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,480
That makes you sick to
your stomach brother.

598
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,283
Yeah,

599
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,210
we're all those weird sets that you have.

600
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:19,090
All those billions of dollars,

601
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,850
the houses that your kids live in,

602
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,400
the $20 million they case your
home and blah blah blah, blah.

603
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,820
Like just shut up because
of these maniacs. Shut up

604
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:36,430
just by half
fucking Vince

605
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,610
[inaudible] the tell you something.

606
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,260
Either you're starting to believe
in your own bullshit. Hogan.

607
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:52,810
I could have had anybody
play the part of whole token.

608
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:56,330
I could have had anybody bring whole on

609
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,930
one second McMahon.

610
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:02,090
You actually think anybody
could have ran with Hulkamania.

611
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:07,110
Look at all the guys you gave the ball
to look at all the guys that had the bell

612
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,600
with all the guys that red to the go on.

613
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,680
Nobody ran as hard and as
long as I didn't make man.

614
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,950
Sounds like a real argument.

615
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,693
Sweet thing.

616
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:25,030
If you actually think I was just
the right guy at the right place,

617
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,270
if the raw at the right time.

618
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:33,290
Let me say it one more time
so you completely understand.

619
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,110
If you actually believe,

620
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,610
I don't mind if you actually think
that I was just the right gay guy.

621
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,330
Right place at the right time.

622
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,440
Well then Europe liger delusional bastard
that I thought you weren't Mcmann,

623
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,900
right? Gay. Yes.

624
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,560
Campania going wild and
do what I say right now,

625
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,980

Right now we just settled

626
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,190

627
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:11,180
They just paddling and you were the
one that I wanted to get in the ring.

628
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:12,770
You were the one

629
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:20,060
holy mother's gun goes off forever
saying what happened.

630
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,130
This is why would you do
this? You're losing them, man.

631
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,870
We got to get bid here.
Closing them.

632
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,680
You go with the fucking board minutes
that they really did mess up didn't they?

633
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:34,910
Yeah. What the fuck is sounded
like a regular pillow to me.

634
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,520
He said,
and this is good.

635
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,840
You've got to make up with the a little
girl and the Kemper terror one. Dude,

636
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,833

but his voice is just
regular regular voice.

654
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,613
Don't do the point.

655
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,790
What's that? What's that one saying? This

664
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:35,340
I can re fabric cover while
you recuperate by beyond that.

665
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:36,580

he said 30 yard dumpster here.

669
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:46,950
It's a matter of time. Like

You're all gonna go down one by one

Turn around.

679
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,740
Yeah, right. Great. I'm going
to carry the cards for awhile,

680
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,100
but I do and I view all right,

681
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,800
a little too visual because

682
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:39,980
[inaudible] this,
someone's been a, this is,

683
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,560
this sounds really good,
but there's a couple of things coming in.

684
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:46,570
A botch mania on youtube and
shock master. Yeah, shock master.

685
00:43:46,571 --> 00:43:50,080
You've seen it before. I think shock
master roster mania is very visual, but a,

686
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,460
okay, 10 labs in my life, I'm
shocked. Master's up their shop.

687
00:43:55,210 --> 00:44:00,170
It might be in the top five. Shock Master.
This is my favorite one. It's Cyco city.

688
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,790
He doesn't realize he's
live. Okay. All y'all fans,

689
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:07,880
but there are a lot of skeptics that
think that perhaps you can't take it.

690
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,160
How do you address those skeptics?

691
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:15,060
All the skeptics and all the people
that have a little bill five house.

692
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:20,590
Sorry, live pal or answer tonight. Well,

693
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,870
they're here to man or keyword.
Psycho said back to you.

694
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,530
You're live is as, let me do
that again. Yeah. We covered.

695
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:32,280
Phoned our man of few words.
You start words.

696
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:38,670
This is a the shock master. What does
it look, man? What's the set up on that?

697
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,990
Basically they were the first version of
it. Oh Rick flair. They were supposed to,

698
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:47,340
uh, they had a mystery partner and you
were supposed to be like the next big,

699
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:50,010
a good guy in WCW.
Yeah.

700
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:55,050
And he was supposed to bust through the
wall but nobody told him there was a

701
00:44:55,051 --> 00:44:59,520
support to buy for under like
at the base of the wall. Yeah.

702
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,370
So he trips right over the two
by four falls flat on his face.

703
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:09,340
Got Ahead staying the entire thing is
the funniest thing you've ever seen.

704
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:14,760
It's staying in the British
bulldog or horrendous.

705
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:18,160
They were supposed to big this
big pump up the shot master.

706
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:23,520
But when he fought,
I'm Tom when ric flair,

707
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:29,270
cause he's one of the greatest of all
time at this surrounded by five bombs.

708
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:34,200
Awful.
And his reaction to what happened,

709
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:39,120
I watched this 700 times in the
Shag cry every time. Shock Master.

710
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,610
He was just an old wrestler
from the date of UAE, from,

711
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,230
he was tugboat and Dadada I remember you
said they put a storm trooper helmet,

712
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,500
literally a storm trooper helmet.
Did they covered in glitter?

713
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,800
All sparkles and always make
sure you have the, the, the,

714
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,950
the sting lead in Iowa Soda. You
know, this was actually so bad.

715
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,860
Did this guy had a whole gimmick. He
was going to be the next main event guy.

716
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:06,060
They changed his entire gimmicks so that
he was just a Klutz that always lost.

717
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:10,040
They couldn't do anything with it
after that because of his debut. Yeah.

718
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,910
Our partner is going to be

719
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,560
none other than,

720
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:24,763
hey

721
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,360
miss,
please

722
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:39,510
tell me what happened.
All ready.

723
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,680
I'll like go on the wall and then he
lost his helmet and how to go get it and

724
00:46:46,161 --> 00:46:50,380
put it back on his head. He covers his own
face, so it's like, that's his gimmick.

725
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,470
The way is there.
The waffle,

726
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:02,930
like a pot of glittered potted
plants on top was fucking head.

727
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,790
Do you think other wrestlers laughed
at him for this? Gone voice was done.

728
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,550
His voice was done by a guy who

729
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:15,720
the said who had a live Mike all,
they didn't tape it. He did it live.

730
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:20,490
So when he trips you can hear them go,
Oh God no.

731
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,950
That was ric

732
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,070
flair. He goes, let me
tell you something. If

733
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,490
you watched the whole thing would at home,

734
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:38,120
you gotta understand the Harlem Harlem,
he who would just fuck.

735
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:45,230
He was doing a promo.
Vicious,

736
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,170
vicious was going to band from it.
Now we just watched too bad promos.

737
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,110
British bulldog and staying.
We'll awful and ric flair had,

738
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:58,950
this was like the Rick flesh show so he
was trying to put this together and Rick

739
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:03,760
Flash turn them. But, but when, when
he fell through the wall, ric Flair,

740
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:08,950
when, Oh God, that fall,

741
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,870
the greatest thing that
has forever and slow shit.

742
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:23,080
How bad the promo with up to that point
panicked grabbing for that helmet.

743
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:26,820
This is in front of an audience, Yo Yo
this a live audience and it's live on TV.

744
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:31,250
It's like this is their big
thing leading up to a paper view.

745
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,430
Live television by the paper view.

746
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,580
So you could see this guy make you
think that was supposed to be his debut.

747
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:39,240
He fits
this

748
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,910
perfectly clear. They're expecting
big things from the shock man.

749
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,890
But you have state maybe the next hole,
Stengel for a shock,

750
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,320
right it completely chin. Yet. For the
most part it ended. Just get to stay on.

751
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:54,760
If you have it wrestles,
he wrestled.

752
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,830
Click the audio is a little low
on this. This is the best. Yeah.

753
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:05,500
Bare with us around it a little further.
She could get some more lead up

754
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,490
admissions. Bad Promo. Yeah.

755
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:24,803
No,

756
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,680
they're all nervous cause flares
there where it's just like disgusting.

757
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:35,950
Oh my God.
Is he yelling?

758
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,900
That's the brace boob. I'm talking about.

759
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:55,783
The

760
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:11,320
worst outfit I've ever
seen you have is listed.

761
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:17,510
It looks like he's wearing
a pumpkin on his head. Fuck.

762
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:20,630
You have to understand what?

763
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,570
Oh he said what? Tough. Oh my God

764
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,930
is held up
shaking his head.

765
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:39,690
He's gotta put his helmet on because the
other guy's going to do his promo forum

766
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,670
so you can see his mouth
shot.

767
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:50,690
It's in the top left

768
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:56,580
just because it's like, it's not
even a regular rest. If statements,

769
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,030
the shock master

770
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,580
Paul is supposed to break through.
I watched,

771
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:09,340
I watched this live in 1993 it's the
greatest moment in pro wrestling history.

772
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,820
There's never been a better time.
It's killing me.

773
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:16,380
Eight different things
that are making you think.

774
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,980
They watched this and just laugh.
They did.

775
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,630
It completely destroyed his career.
Now not only do you have to,

776
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:27,600
you have to be as quiet as you can because
you can hear Rick flair say, Oh God.

777
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:31,250
Then you can hear offset
where he's supposed to.

778
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:33,320
We're getting ready to
do his promo for them.

779
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,080
You can hear them making fun of him.
Okay,

780
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,313
let's try to be

781
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:44,000
funny to laugh to yourself if you can.

782
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:48,900
Just fucking fat.
Gut of

783
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:54,240
day.
I've been through them.

784
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:58,790
I was trying to drill a hole I made.
You know what,

785
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,120
and we're doing his costume
of injustice. Yeah. He had a,

786
00:52:02,121 --> 00:52:07,121
for a giant fur vest that was
three quarter lane with no buttons,

787
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:11,120
giant sparkly helmet and jeans and boots

788
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:17,880
and no shirt shop master.
The shock pastor was in the ass.

789
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:22,580
They literally, after this show,
they changed his entire gimmick.

790
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:25,790
He became a construction worker
that constantly falls down.

791
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:30,110
That was his career
on bell's Palsy.

792
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,730
The stroke master tapes,
having them.

793
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,840
Okay guys,
shock mess the rules.

794
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:42,560
I don't think I give you her license and
she's the greatest thing I've ever seen.

795
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,580
Tony Smoke. Okay. Everybody
contained so high. We'll try.

796
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:49,690
It's like big Jack,

797
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:56,440
our partner.

798
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:14,690
You're
my boy.

799
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:28,490
His voice has started yet.
You see him,

800
00:53:28,491 --> 00:53:32,280
you see them motioning with his hands,
but his voice didn't start yet.

801
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,440
The guys behind stage isn't talking yet.

802
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:37,320
He's just motioning like he's
talking like he's a mine.

803
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:42,440
None of them said you fell
through the wall. I'm like, Yo,

804
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:46,140
she impressed with this guy to
be able to yell without laughing.

805
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,260
He's so bad. He probably
didn't know. Still

806
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:59,450
don't know muscles at all. He's
just heritable shots. Reducer

807
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:04,710
on tight. Get chickens. I had
to have my stomach stapled.

808
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,080
I keep breaking the wall and falling.

809
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,290
I wish we could hear the audio better.

810
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:18,410
I was trying to nail a foundry logo to
the Ali's pummel you with how cupcakes

811
00:54:19,171 --> 00:54:20,310
are made.
Dvds.

812
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:25,570
He fell and this is the thing too,
if you,

813
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:31,050
you fell no hands on his head like

814
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:36,420
flat on his fucking fucking stupid
helmet and his elbow and fallen.

815
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:41,660
He's got down on the fucking floor
like a fish sand pail on his head.

816
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:46,020
Oh
No.

817
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,890
Stopping him to do when
he put the helmet back on.

818
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:54,480
I love the fact that he's staying at,
he has to wipe the grounder off his head

819
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,010
hurt and look at staying is bad.

820
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:02,610
All I have to say is he's calming
everybody down. Here's the moment.

821
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:07,770
All I have to say is all part
is going to shock. So word

822
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:16,890
my ro ro was off.
Timing was

823
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:26,710
I got to see it again.
You get to talk Yo. Yeah.

824
00:55:26,711 --> 00:55:31,500
Do you want to hear it was good. It's
really hard in here. The whole outfit.

825
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:36,180
Everything a mistake.
He doesn't ever been body terrible.

826
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,073
Hello.

827
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:53,940
Wait, stop it. Stop it. Stop
it. Stop it. Stop it. I'm
sorry. You gotta understand too.

828
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:59,220
If this was sid vicious in Harlem heat
and they were beaten up British bulldog,

829
00:56:02,241 --> 00:56:07,241
a sting for like months and this is
the guy who Dan is going to match the

830
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:10,490
intensity.
These are the top three guys,

831
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,990
the top bad guys in the company
versus the top good guys.

832
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:18,240
They had no one with him. And then
the day. Then this is the guy.

833
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:23,241
They fucking got to stop
it on slide Doron foot

834
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,060
or less. Most of them do you? I would
love to know what they're, what,

835
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:31,060
like what is the shock best
you're thinking after his
helmet goes on, he's like,

836
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:32,530
I just ran the

837
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:42,030
big ball
all.

838
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,740
I wish I could see that from behind him.

839
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:52,080
Shot red zone is the best
on somebody tweeted that.

840
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:56,520
They made fun of this on raw recently.
Yeah, we get it with the club show.

841
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:58,240
I can get you to clap right
here. All right, good. Yeah.

842
00:56:58,241 --> 00:57:02,690
Supposedly they went real inside
and made fun of this one wrong.

843
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,280
It's about a year ago. Less
than a year ago. All right.

844
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,290
Here's one more from the shock master.
Yeah.

845
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:15,230
None other than,
hey,

846
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:29,230
he just felt there's no two
by four that he just fell

847
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:36,940
and everybody,
we got to,

848
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:37,933
we got on here.

849
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:39,570
Wait a minute.
This is what he's doing.

850
00:57:39,571 --> 00:57:42,420
He's waiting for that guy to
start driving and when he yells,

851
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:47,220
he thinks it's his voice.
Pantomiming the was yelling at him.

852
00:57:47,221 --> 00:57:51,660
He thinks that it's his voice.
His uh, backstage voice guy,

853
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:56,760
but it's not if the guy,
and he can't even pay to mind

854
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:04,570
is this five seconds,
which seems like a million years where

855
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:09,340
everyone is collecting themselves.
So for 10,

856
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,410
this shit did audience,
the front flap,

857
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:15,510
the shot master,
hello.

858
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:20,270
Everybody went holy Shit.
His helmet.

859
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,790
So discombobulated.

860
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,860
What he's hearing is where he's
supposed to be saying they're all,

861
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:32,350
here's a storm trooper helmet. He
got that down a Halloween. Yes. Yes.

862
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,300
It's not an exaggeration.
It's the storm,

863
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,110
the storm trooper helmet with Glen
Brown. Anyway, until the next style,

864
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:43,200
he got the captain caveman and cap
as genes that he drove to the arena.

865
00:58:43,211 --> 00:58:47,140
And I think I heard a better version from
the guy that just tweeted me. Hey Man,

866
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:50,020
I gotta I gotta pick up at nine 45.

You've got to go bill. Yeah. I,

868
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:56,500

be back on the show next week. All right.

871
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:09,680
Thank you Mr Bern. Keep up the podcast.
I'm a big fan belt. Take it easy.

872
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:13,300
Oh, there it goes. This shot. They're all
looking at and go into shock messages.

873
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:16,150
Fell through. They all see the
whole gear going down the toilet.

874
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:18,360
Could you go back?
Could you go into shock master on Rod?

875
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:21,620
Just see if it's a better clip
shot. Master on Ra is, is the,

876
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,460
is the shock master on wrong? Like that's,
that's the one they made fun of him.

877
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,260
That's not the original shock master.
Yeah,

878
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:30,660
they have a clip of it though in the
beginning just to set it up. All right.

879
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:34,310
What'd you go with this? I just to that
the audio [inaudible] to hear his promo.

880
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:35,283
Yeah,

881
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:39,820

883
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:47,800
Call me the shock master.

884
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,450
But you just felt you want the world that

885
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:57,950

patient? Maybe they want to

886
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,840
comment that got master race.
I'm ready.

887
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:07,230
Hello.
Can you pause this glitter?

888
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,100
I think he has a glitter
storm trooper helmet

889
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:18,680
on his chest from when he fell

890
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:24,610
and got that fucking storm trooper
helmet sparkles. All local.

891
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:27,600
I think it's coming.
And why did it sit?

892
01:00:27,601 --> 01:00:29,910
All scared of him cause
he looked all scared.

893
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,050
Why did he turn around and Douche bag?
He just fell through the fucking wall.

894
01:00:34,051 --> 01:00:36,090
Shock master is a dud.

895
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:41,100
And then the promo is terrible and
embarrassing. Be this brutal villain.

896
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:46,070
This guy from another planet. Oh
my God. Jeans and boots and uh,

897
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:51,030
and and, and, and there's always the
first thing you see is him falling.

898
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:55,330
You on want a patient? Me, I just fell
through the wall. Oh motherfucker.

899
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:56,791
That is so funny.

900
01:00:56,791 --> 01:01:01,680
Now what is the set up on this now is
this is from 19 or 2009 it was a year ago.

901
01:01:01,681 --> 01:01:06,250
They made fun. Oh, much better
audio. His Promo on this phone.

902
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,120
None other than shock.

903
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:12,863
Rob Scott.

904
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:16,540
Oh God.

905
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,950
Yeah.
You heard someone say,

906
01:01:21,951 --> 01:01:25,840
what did he 40 40 for the low voice.

907
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:31,090
What did he has by stage?
Roy's Alemany fall. Oh,

908
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:31,993
I love this guy.

909
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,990
None other than me shocked.

910
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,010
I told you,

911
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,120
Oh God,

912
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:48,300
no,
go

913
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:54,280
told you it's just so bad.
It's everything about is poorly done.

914
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:55,653
Everything man,

915
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,230
that was added from the original
one there just cut out some awkward.

916
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:05,540
Oh yeah. And then one thing
I noticed, yeah, this is when
they, uh, and then Rod, uh,

917
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:08,060
did a spoof on it a year ago.
Yeah. Cause they were putting out,

918
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,200
when was the original shock
master? 1993. I saw the fucking 17,

919
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:16,490
almost 17 years later. Raw fucking goofed
on here. Let's see how they goofed on.

920
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:20,040
No, but where's that coming from?
I think it's coming from that

921
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:24,010
wall or your voters. You know,
it sounds like it's coming
from over here. Yeah. Hmm.

922
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:33,740
Whoa. No smart.

923
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:36,643
Awesome.

924
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:45,640
Show you.
Where's the,

925
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,470
where's the voice that voice
young for? I don't know. You know,

926
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:54,500
it sounds like it's coming from
right over there. Oh, there it

927
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:00,580
is.
A crap.

928
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,510
Did they anyone even get it?

929
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,990
Brands. I love the shock. Master
Clinton. Yeah. Oh yeah. It's,

930
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:12,820
that is out of [inaudible] member. A
lot of labs. I had that shock mashed up.

931
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:15,070
That's great. And then they
were dusty rose. Who is,

932
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,530
who was probably in the top five,

933
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:22,550
like Mike guys of all time
to like dusty flare flair.

934
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:25,030
Always the best. Was the rock
the best mic guy? No, not at all.

935
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,260
Not probably not even. He might not
even be the top five. Really? Yeah.

936
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:32,530
He was great though. He
was fantastic. Dusty.

937
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:37,720
Ric flair. Flair is better than
Roddy Piper. Um, hi, my name five.

938
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:39,830
Uh,
I'm trying to think.

939
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:43,290
I said that was the rock was good at
making catch phrases. How about sergeants?

940
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:47,470
No, no. Um, oh my Jake.

941
01:03:47,471 --> 01:03:51,130
The snake isn't in the top of the
top five probably. And um, you know,

942
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:52,840
not the rock is not in the top five.

943
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,850
Top 10 stone hall was probably better
on the Mike in the Rocco's if probably

944
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:57,850
that's the five, right? The Rock.

945
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,880
We just going to make an catchphrases
and then he does is the best though.

946
01:04:00,881 --> 01:04:05,500
Dusty and flare are neck and neck
also. See One, they're all saying,

947
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:09,160
oh and hard. Had a really good one.
Really good blooper. Uh, well, yeah,

948
01:04:09,161 --> 01:04:14,010
the best food for a long time, but
come on. Oh, that's terrible. I,

949
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:19,060
I was saying that damn a goddamn shock
master do that is one of the bed that is

950
01:04:19,721 --> 01:04:22,840
hysterical. Oh, I like on, we
able to laugh until I come.

951
01:04:22,841 --> 01:04:26,500
Actually fucking tears coming
down my eyes. You didn't
try the on her one. Funny.

952
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:30,290
I just recently stopped watching it like,
yeah,

953
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,160
but you still watch it
with this thing like wow.

954
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:37,540
You went right on his fucking head is
the worst thing that could have happened.

955
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:38,710
The worst thing,

956
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:43,600
dude right there and the helmet falling
off and he scrambles to put it on and

957
01:04:43,601 --> 01:04:47,620
it's so clumsy and then he's just
standing there trying to be tough.

958
01:04:47,621 --> 01:04:49,960
Be tough with all the
glitter on his chest.

959
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:18,733
[inaudible]

960
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:32,820
beauty. The surrounds, Right

961
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:38,010

really? Yeah, she, Lisa and Jersey.

962
01:05:38,011 --> 01:05:38,844

I just chose the product of woman.
He's wet.

965
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:50,920
I just can't believe that
women fall for his crew.

966
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,940
Oh, you're an easy mark.
Listen to you. Yeah.

969
01:06:03,631 --> 01:06:07,130
Sweetie. I can tell you go. This
is classic. Yeah, right. Whatever.

970
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,430
Here's what [inaudible] is on your mind.
I'm an big arrogant,

971
01:06:10,431 --> 01:06:13,730
big mouth fucking ass hole,
right? And you want to curb,

972
01:06:13,731 --> 01:06:16,860
you want to destroy that any way you can.
So here's what you do.

973
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:21,350
If you're a pretty, this is when pretty
girls fuck up. Did they try to hear,

974
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:24,500
hear a giggling is this is,
here's what pretty girls fuck up.

975
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,470
They try to get me because
I'm a fat motherfucker.

976
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:28,970
So what they try to do is
they play the love game.

977
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:32,000
They give me something they think
is precious, which is plus he,

978
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,730
that's what girls have
to give. But after that,

979
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:39,060
that can on attack mode,
you have a plan.

980
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:42,410
Can you have other than your Plessy on it,
if you want to,

981
01:06:42,411 --> 01:06:46,820
if you want to destroy a man's fucking
arrogance, what do you do to do that?

982
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:48,110
Other than use your pussy.

983
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:49,893
Yeah.

984
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,340
Oh my God. Oh my God. I
hear what she's doing.

985
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:56,320
The singing because she didn't really
don't have an answer. Oh my God.

986
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:01,450
It's like, what else can you do?
Talk about fucking a fringe memory.

987
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:05,780
Ever with me yet. What you
mainly talk about that? Yes.

988
01:07:05,781 --> 01:07:10,370
I could in Nagley in mainly, here's
what you got to understand, ma'am.

989
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:14,330
We don't like you no matter what you know,

990
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:18,250
we don't care if you know all the
quarterbacks in NFL, we don't know.

991
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,960
We don't care if you
know every team color,

992
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,910
we don't care if you know all the GMS.

993
01:07:22,911 --> 01:07:24,470
We don't care if you
know every basketball,

994
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,980
we don't care because it
mainly we don't like you,

995
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:32,600
so you try to infiltrate
your personalities on us
and you realize that you're

996
01:07:32,601 --> 01:07:36,440
not interested in. Then you try
to fuck us when that doesn't work.

997
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:39,280
Your hours. Okay. Okay.

998
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:45,660
You're interested in it at first and
then look at if I work hard to get what I

999
01:07:45,981 --> 01:07:49,070
want, which is pussy. Right. You agree
with that? That we work hard to get pussy,

1000
01:07:49,071 --> 01:07:54,020
right? Yes. What he did at the,
I do what I do. What's your job?

1001
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:57,600
Oh, you did. Don't you
like the companionship or

1002
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:01,960
well, yes, but in a, in a possession
kind of way, like, like you,

1003
01:08:01,961 --> 01:08:06,230
you go wash this girl cheat. You know
what women have to do grow on you.

1004
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:11,120
My girl been around for four
years. Grow on you. Oh my God. Yes.

1005
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:14,600
You love what you girlfriend you love.

1006
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:18,210
I imagine that you're
dating an intelligence.

1007
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:23,060
Beautiful. She's a genius. Really. She's
fucking genius girl. I begged doctors,

1008
01:08:23,061 --> 01:08:27,470
lawyers, teachers, people tell you I don't
pay no fucking homeless people. Retards.

1009
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:29,830
No one that dates on Paxil
or no shit like that.

1010
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:33,460
He's telling you, she's telling you
that she just had a miscarriage.

1011
01:08:33,461 --> 01:08:34,890
That sounds like an intelligent woman.

1012
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,580
Oh, well that's a goofy bitch.
But that's, that's the bitch.

1013
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:40,170
You fuck when you just meet the visuals,
the lactaid

1014
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:45,600
got a miscarriage. That's,
that's the, that's the,

1015
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:48,290
that's the price you pay when you
meet a bitch on off the street.

1016
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:51,650
That was a snack for procure.
I'm just talking about like,

1017
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:54,200
like the girl I went to dinner,
we would go out to dinner,

1018
01:08:54,201 --> 01:08:56,090
you and curse me out for a little while.
You would,

1019
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,310
you would understand because you innately,

1020
01:08:58,311 --> 01:09:01,490
you don't have your own philosophy cause
you're not really saying anything now.

1021
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:04,700
Yeah. You waited when Patrice brought
up the fact that uh, the pussies,

1022
01:09:04,701 --> 01:09:08,360
the weapon when they go with, when you
girls go into battle for the first time,

1023
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:12,650
this is before any get to know you
get to know you, whatever. It's just,

1024
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:15,750
that's why we know that's all
you want in the beginning.

1025
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:19,670
Well that's all we want, but in the
beginning that's not all I want to listen.

1026
01:09:19,671 --> 01:09:24,340
That's all you got now. Are you good?
Is Pussy. Why would I try to phone

1027
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:26,310
sounded like that. You
sound like, you know,

1028
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:29,190
this is the way I keep
her on track and this is

1029
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:32,380
yes. I'm like, look at my
look at your mouth like that.

1030
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:35,760
You can tell there's no guidance in
your life because you're too comfortable

1031
01:09:35,761 --> 01:09:36,920
yapping about nothing.

1032
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,313
Yeah,

1033
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:43,220
okay. For sure. Nothing
all the time. Right?

1034
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:46,290
Because I'm a guy and that's what we do.
But you,

1035
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:49,160
the stuff you talk about
that you think is about some

1036
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:53,340
talk constantly. Constantly. Thank you.

1037
01:09:53,341 --> 01:09:57,270
But it's always interesting when
guys talk. All Right Lisa, thank you.

1038
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:02,780
We got a couple more here. Let's go to
Kevin and Nebraska. Kevin. Bye guys.

1039
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,830
Jump in.
Find your spot and go,

1040
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:09,820
hi doctor on man, you need to shut
off. My wife was to this show.

1041
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,690
You're giving away all my stuff.

1042
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:16,980
I'm sorry man. I only get no good soldiers
in trouble. But this the statement,

1043
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,790
let's go right to Colorado.
Kirsten, what's up?

1044
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:24,240
Hey, I totally agree with Patrice.
Absolutely agree with Patrice.

1045
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:27,420
Women need to know their place.
No.

1046
01:10:27,421 --> 01:10:31,770
What they do do it well and please
their math and their man will be around

1047
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:35,640
forever. Good girl. Wow.
Or ever. Absolutely.

1048
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:40,440
Men need a writer to be a writer. It's
not that difficult. Keep your mouth shut.

1049
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,980
Do what you're told.
Be who you are.

1050
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,910
Is that what you're saying? Is that
what you do with your girl? Oh,

1051
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:55,950
thank you. Karsten let's go
to John and Utah. John Deep
Voice. Yeah. That's just one

1052
01:10:56,730 --> 01:10:58,420
treat. Saved my marriage. I was the, uh,

1053
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:03,130
the doting the doting husband and
was solid. It was all about her,

1054
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:08,410
uh, start, listen to him and things were,
were going bad. So I started going, Whoa,

1055
01:11:08,411 --> 01:11:11,590
whoa. The trees do. I
started following his advice.

1056
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:12,710
What would Patrice

1057
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:18,380
first, but it's turned around and
work happier than we could possibly.

1058
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:22,190
No Way. Your job, when you see
t shirts, here's what he said,

1059
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:27,410
he's here when he said we're happy.
A happy man is a happy relationship.

1060
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:30,770
A happy woman is a miserable man.
Wow.

1061
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:32,940
You want it?
She wanted me to be the man.

1062
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:37,840
That's what fucking point is.
You got to do a one shot deal,

1063
01:11:37,841 --> 01:11:42,310
a relationship advice show for the
shot, like one hour, two hours,

1064
01:11:42,311 --> 01:11:45,040
whatever you want to handle it.
This is just simple. We'll, we'll,

1065
01:11:45,041 --> 01:11:49,090
we'll work that out with Washington. We'll
get Patrice on on the show by himself.

1066
01:11:49,091 --> 01:11:53,230
Just taking calls. Why your relationships?
Here's why you can and here's why.

1067
01:11:53,231 --> 01:11:55,330
You should always understand
why is legitimate.

1068
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:58,420
I'm a fucking mess physically.

1069
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:01,840
Like I'm trauma trying to get in
shape one these days but naked,

1070
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:06,160
if you look at me naked next to my
girl, you will go, what the fuck?

1071
01:12:06,161 --> 01:12:10,690
Like my self esteem has to like when I
fuck I have to go. Why is she fucking me?

1072
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:14,770
I would never give me no pussy and
it's like I'm looking at it going,

1073
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:17,770
what's she up to?
This is like my low self esteem.

1074
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:23,350
He gotta be an ulterior motive.
My self esteem is so low is high.

1075
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,810
I go, what is this bitch after? But I
started realizing it's a mind thing.

1076
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:33,040
All they want, all they want is just a
motherfucker they can look at and blink,

1077
01:12:33,041 --> 01:12:37,630
slow and respect and anyway,
it's not about beating them
in and subjugating them.

1078
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:41,890
It's about they look at you and feel
like they don't need to be your Mama.

1079
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:46,720
That's it. They go, wow this
motherfucker is in my corner.

1080
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,930
He handles his business,
you know said this is what I'm saying.

1081
01:12:49,931 --> 01:12:51,040
You'll house situation.

1082
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:55,090
You become a million times
sexier cause that's a man.

1083
01:12:55,091 --> 01:12:58,270
Shit you did is buy a fucking mansion.
That's a mansion.

1084
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:00,100
You bought a mansion Anthony.

1085
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:04,810
So it's like your girl can't help it go
this mother fucker when you're renting,

1086
01:13:04,811 --> 01:13:08,290
she can kind of that other half of
her voice that tries to put you down.

1087
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:10,960
She can look at you and
go this faggot in Renton.

1088
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:14,170
It 59 but now it's like

1089
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:21,490

1090
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:25,280
She wants you more 59 finally,

1091
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:29,320
you're hotter than you was when you
was written. It's a fat fuck man. Wow.

1092
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:34,120
That's really good. Hey, uh wait.
Hold on man. Let's go to John. Jay,

1093
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:37,950

1094
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:39,860
Hi Patrice.
I'm a bread.

1095
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,650
You know how to keep you over
the line without a contract.

1096
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,990
Yeah man, it's my shit. Dude is
mine. I'm telling you. It's like,

1097
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:51,620
it's like it's pimping without beaten.
I'm Megan to sell pussy.

1098
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:55,720
It's just stay one back dude.
Don't ever let him convince it on one day.

1099
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:58,860
What will they do without
like a man's guidance?

1100
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:00,820
You haven't seen a woman at once.
Like they try to,

1101
01:14:01,090 --> 01:14:05,110
you see how did success to a woman is
doing is being like a guy. It's like, I,

1102
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:09,190
I do this, I do Vat, I
do listen vac and, and,

1103
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:13,920

Like fuck it.

1104
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,930
I'm a female ob like a woman,

1105
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,570
a woman as in same
position that is always in,

1106
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:23,860
is not any sexier than the bitch that
works at Mcdonald's. If she's cute.

1107
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:28,010
That's the thing about us. We don't point.
Very good point. I'll see a woman walk.

1108
01:14:28,011 --> 01:14:31,450
A lot of people are calling you the
black doctor, Phil black doctor.

1109
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:35,110
That's the name of your show. We're going
to get to choose like one or two hours.

1110
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,560
How it goes.
Black seal.

1111
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:41,910
There's black doctor Phil with
Patrice O'neil as Philip. Alright,

1112
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:45,820
Don's listening. We got to set that up.
You want to do a, I don't know when,

1113
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:49,060
when would it make sense?
It sounds like get my fucking hole,

1114
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:50,021
my straight like that.

1115
01:14:50,021 --> 01:14:53,800
Just go off with a on an improper turn
on the freaking channel and just let the

1116
01:14:53,801 --> 01:14:56,400
phones rang and see what
happens for an hour. Yeah,

1117
01:14:56,510 --> 01:14:59,490
we'll we'll set that up in the very near
future. Let's go to turtle from WAC. Pag.

1118
01:14:59,491 --> 01:15:00,324
Turn off.

1119
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:03,330
Hey guys, listen. Patrice,
you're absolutely right.

1120
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:07,130
I've been jumping through hoops ever since
I met my wife trying to get the pussy

1121
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,960
and once you got it,
they put up more hoops to jump through.

1122
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:13,490
I got to go home and implement
the o' Neil standard in my own,

1123
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:15,360
the Neil standard.
Wow.

1124
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:19,380
She knows eventually you're going to
figure out if she doesn't constantly apply

1125
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:23,280
pressure that you're going to figure
out. Holy Shit. What? Like my man,

1126
01:15:23,281 --> 01:15:25,530
he was nervous that his wife
was going to leave him and I go,

1127
01:15:25,531 --> 01:15:28,260
let me ask you a question. Like if
you really, if we really sit down,

1128
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:32,970
if my woman left Yo woman left Illumina,
you go, what would you really miss them

1129
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:39,830
exactly like what would you miss?
It's your own arrogance.

1130
01:15:39,890 --> 01:15:43,810
Our arrogance is men because
their possessions and if
they leave it's like, um,

1131
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:45,770
it's like losing your favorite pencil,

1132
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:49,850
but it's like Penn is waiting,

1133
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:54,470
waiting, a relationship,
loving relationship in years.

1134
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:59,330
Maybe your favorite favorite print
doesn't even sound like it's a number two

1135
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:00,493
pencil stuff.

1136
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:27,250
[inaudible] Betty

1137
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:40,730
[inaudible] we break peaches

1138
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:10,743
[inaudible]

1139
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:22,050
[inaudible].
