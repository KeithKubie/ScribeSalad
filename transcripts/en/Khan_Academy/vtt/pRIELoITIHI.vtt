00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.730
Everyone's talking about
inflation and deflation these

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.760
days, including myself, and
that's because it's important.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.060
And in order to really have an
informed view on it, I think

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.670
it's important to actually
look at how

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.170
inflation is defined.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.510
And right here, I actually
took a screenshot from my

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.420
Bloomberg terminal, of the
basket of goods that makes up

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.800
the Consumer Price Index.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.365
The index that sets everything
from the coupons on Treasury

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:27.760
inflation-protected securities--
this is the index

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.470
that dictates what Social
Security payments are, how

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.220
fast they're going to grow.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.020
I'm sure a bunch of union
agreements and pension

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.290
agreements are dependant
on the CPI.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.810
So this is the underlying basket
of goods that really

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.080
tells us what inflation is.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.760
At a first level, it's just fun
to look at, because you

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.490
can compare your own household
to what the government thinks

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.720
is a typical household.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.400
For example, the government
says that the typical

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.870
household spends 15.7% of their
disposable income on--

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.830
and that's essentially the
income that you take home

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.240
after paying taxes--
that they spend

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.599
15.7% on food and beverages.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.560
That seems reasonable.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.910
What's even more interesting
is that they break it down.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.020
They get very granular.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.220
They try to figure out how much
do you spend on eggs, and

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.160
fish, and poultry, and
bakery products.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.810
And that's good because, let's
say, everything else stays

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.180
constant, but the price of eggs
goes through the roof

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.790
because the Atkins diet
becomes popular again.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.870
Then you can actually make an
informed decision as to why

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.340
inflation is going up or whether
inflation will go up

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.900
going forward.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.540
So that's just interesting
to look at.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.740
If you look at the
major categories.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.540
They have food and beverages,
housing-- And I'm going to

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.020
come back to housing because
this is, in general, just a

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.000
very interesting area to focus
on, because it makes such a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.920
big portion of the CPI.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.810
And it's been such a big
portion of the economic

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.600
picture, especially
the last 10 years.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.150
And obviously, it's become a big
problem, has become a big

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.220
factor, in terms of what's
causing the financial

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.910
crisis right now.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.630
But housing is about 43%
of disposable income.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.540
Apparel: 3%.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.910
Transportation: 15%.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.330
This includes things like
new vehicles, 4%,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.610
used cars and trucks.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.740
And I think the way they
calculate this is, they say,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.940
what percentage of Americans
are driving new vehicles

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.580
versus used vehicles?

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.830
And they put fuel in here.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.610
A lot of people, when I have
this inflation-deflation

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.040
argument, they make this
argument that China and India

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.480
are going to continue growing.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.440
And because of that, commodities
like oil and fuel

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.880
will continue to increase.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.390
Although people were making
that argument more last

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.390
summer, but even now people
are making that argument.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.640
But in a developed country, you
see that motor fuel, even

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.670
though it hits your pocketbook
on the margin, it isn't that

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.240
big a part of your total
expenditure.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.970
Especially when you compare
it to things like housing.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.440
And if you keep going down,
medical care: 6%.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.220
And then recreation.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.860
They break it down and you
could look this up.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.230
I think the Bureau Of Labor
Statistics has this broken

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.090
down as well, although it was
much easier to get it on the

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.850
Bloomberg terminal.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.250
Education: on average, 3%.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.990
Obviously, if you're sending
your kids to college that's a

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.170
much higher number, but, on
average, if you take the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.770
average household.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.540
And finally, other goods
and services: tobacco,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.610
et cetera, et cetera.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.050
So that one is just interesting
to look at.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.560
So whenever you have a
discussion on the things that

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.050
may or may not drive inflation,
it's important to

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.480
weigh them by these weightings
that the CPI gives them, to

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.600
figure out what the actual
impact on how we measure

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.630
inflation really will be.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.160
With that said, if you think
about it, really the biggest

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.650
portion of this is the
housing piece.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.490
I think that's fair.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.970
Housing is a large percentage
of most people's disposable

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.250
income, especially in
a Western society.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.190
You can imagine, if you live in
a Third World country, and

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.300
you're barely getting by, food
might be a huge part of your

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.920
expenditure, maybe rivaling
housing if you've just kind of

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.300
built a house someplace.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.510
But in a developed society,
housing is a huge

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.060
percentage of it.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.660
And I want to focus on one
thing, and a lot of people

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.380
have talked about this.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.130
And actually Mish once again,
from Global Economic Analysis,

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.790
he really encouraged me
to highlight this.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.529
So within housing, obviously
some people

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:20.899
rent, some people buy.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:24.320
And so they give a 6% weighting
of the whole basket

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.770
to rent, and then they give a
roughly 24%, 25% weighting to

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.620
something that they call,
owners' equivalent of rent of

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.890
primary residence.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.810
So this is essentially their
attempt to measure how much it

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.640
costs to live for people
who own houses.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.940
What's interesting, and you
probably have caught onto it,

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.980
is they use the words: owners'
equivalent rent.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.160
So what they do, and this is the
current methodology, they

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.390
don't say, how much
is your mortgage?

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.390
They don't say, how much does
it cost you to buy the house

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.280
and amortize it over the
reasonable life of the house?

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.490
They actually just say, how
much would it cost to rent

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.880
that house?

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.990
And they've kept waffling back
and forth between-- sometimes

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.720
they just look for equivalent
houses, and they say, well,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.980
how much would that
cost to rent?

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.900
At one point they were actually
surveying people and

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.330
they would ask them, how
much would it cost

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.000
to rent your house?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.120
Which is probably even
a worse number.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.050
But the bottom line is, they're
not factoring in

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.310
actual mortgages.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.300
And you can even see it
on the weighting.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.220
Right when I looked at these
numbers, I was like, well,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.080
roughly 66% of people
own houses.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.530
How come this number isn't
66% relative to

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.260
this number, right?

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.840
It's closer to 80%.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.220
I was like, oh, I know that's
fair because more people

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.460
actually live in homes.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:49.160
You could say that 66% of
overall households own, but,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.670
in general, homes are bigger,
there might be

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.560
more people in it.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.365
So you could either think of it
on a person basis or maybe

00:05:55.365 --> 00:05:57.670
on a square footage basis.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.880
It makes a little bit more sense
to weight houses higher.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.870
But what's interesting here,
is that this number,

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.790
especially if you add these
two, housing in general is

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.800
about 30% of disposable
income.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:19.730
And traditionally that was the
rule that a bank would use to

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.710
decide whether you can
afford a house.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.910
It shouldn't be more than a
third of your disposal income,

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.070
or at least a mortgage
payment shouldn't

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.960
be more than a third.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.970
We know, especially over this
last real estate bubble,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.020
that's become a much, much
larger percentage of people's

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.810
actual disposal income.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.260
So you wonder, why is this
weighting only 30% of

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.930
disposable income?

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.430
Well, that's because they use
owners' equivalent rent.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.910
They didn't actually
say what people's

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.190
mortgage payments are.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.980
So even though mortgage payments
might be going

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.430
through the roof, even though
the price of a house might be

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.780
going through the roof, it does
not get reflected in the

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.190
CPI number as of
the early `80s.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.750
This is straight from
the Bureau Of

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.250
Labor Statistics website.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.610
And they wrote-- and they're
actually using doublespeak

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.930
here, I just copied and pasted
it straight from their website

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.830
--"until the early 1980s, the
CPI used what is called the

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.740
asset price method to measure
the change in the cost of

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.400
owner-occupied housing."

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.840
That makes sense and I'm not
sure whether they just looked

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.380
at how much houses cost this
year relative to last year and

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.860
then they put that into the
weighting or they determined

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.960
the weighting based on people's
average mortgage.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.330
But in general, that's a good
way to measure it, right?

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.480
Either your mortgage payment, or
how much houses cost. They

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.845
said, "the asset price method
treats the purchase of an

00:07:35.845 --> 00:07:37.600
asset, such as a house, as it
does the purchase of any

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.910
consumer good." Fair enough.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.220
"Because the asset price
method can lead to

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.740
inappropriate results--" And
this is the key line. "Because

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.460
the asset price method can lead
to inappropriate results

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.990
for goods that are purchased
largely for investment

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.990
reasons." I agree with that.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.930
If something is purchased
largely for investment

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.940
reasons, if I'm purchasing gold,
maybe that shouldn't be

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.710
included in the CPI, because
it's largely for investment

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:06.980
reasons or for stocks.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.060
But then they use this kind of
completely disjointed logic.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.740
They say, you know, "because
asset price method can lead to

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.520
inappropriate results for
goods that are purchased

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.730
largely for investment reasons,
the CPI implemented

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.140
the rental equivalence approach
to measuring price

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.720
change for owner-occupied
housing." To me,

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.180
that makes no sense.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.730
Owner-occupied is not purchased

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.490
for investment reasons.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.270
That's a fair enough argument
if you're doing it for

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.380
rentals, or if you're doing
it for vacation homes.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.950
But for actual owner-occupied
housing, this

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.919
sentence makes no sense.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.559
Based on their own rationale,
there's no reason to transfer

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:47.120
to this rental equivalent
approach.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.850
The whole reason why I'm going
here is, because in the early

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.860
`80s, I think 1983-- they say
it right here, in January,

00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.260
1983-- because they switched
over to this, this kind of

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.350
inflation that we've seen
in the price of houses,

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.770
especially the real estate
bubble we've seen the last 10

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.270
years, in no way got
incorporated into the

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.560
inflation numbers.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.460
So it essentially understated
them.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.840
You can see that here.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.620
Well, two things: not only did
it understate it, but it

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.720
probably understated the
weighting itself.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.910
And Mish, he's had a couple
of posts about this.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.460
You really should use
something like the

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.240
Case-Shiller Index on this line
right here, instead of

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.210
doing this for owners'
equivalent.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.580
But I'd argue one
step further.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.910
Not only should you use
something like the

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.800
Case-Shiller Index, but to
actually gauge this weighting,

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.100
you should actually survey
people and say, what

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.460
percentage of your disposable
income is dedicated to your

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.430
mortgage and other things
related to owning a house?

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.650
And especially over the last
seven years, I would guess,

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.150
and I'm almost sure about this,
that it would be much

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.350
larger than 30% of your
disposal income.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.370
So not only was this number
being understated, or the

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.230
growth in that number, because
it didn't incorporate the

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.720
increase in housing prices, but
this weighting itself was

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.870
understated.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.060
And just to get a sense of
how much, this is the

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.410
Case-Shiller Index.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.650
And you could look up the
Case-Shiller Index, but, in my

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.400
opinion, it's the best index
for actual increases or

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.140
decreases in the
price of homes.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:17.280
You see from 2001 to 2006
roughly, houses were

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.740
increasing by 10%
to 15% a year.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.630
So if you use that instead of
the rental equivalent, then

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.360
over the same timeframe-- I
don't have a chart for rent,

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.770
but rent was not increasing at
anywhere near this pace.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.260
If anything, people were leaving
apartments to buy

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.930
houses, so rent was actually
staying pretty stable.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.870
But 10% to 15%-- this is year
over year growth, this is what

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:38.560
this chart is.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:46.790
So 10% to 15%, if you weight
that at 30% of the CPI basket,

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.370
then really the reported
inflation number was being

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.750
understated by 3%
to 5% a year.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.990
And I'd argue that this
weighting should have grown

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.860
over that time period because
people were spending more and

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.100
more of their disposable
income on

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.320
their mortgage payments.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.230
So really it was probably
understanding it by more.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.760
Then this weighting should've
been more like 40% and you

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.600
could have said you're
understanding it by 4% to 6%.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.450
And if you look here,
this is the actual

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:14.170
reported CPI numbers.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.870
What I'm saying is, over that
timeframe, the real inflation

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.180
number should have
been up here.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.790
And then, now that we have
actual deflation in home

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.560
prices, this is zero.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.270
So now, the most recent
Case-Shiller numbers say that

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.890
housing has depreciated
by 20%.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.650
We're essentially understating
the deflation now.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:36.420
So although right now the CPI
has us at kind of the zero

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.080
mark, if you actually
incorporated the real prices

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.705
of homes and you didn't use
rents as a proxy for it, you

00:11:42.705 --> 00:11:44.770
would actually get a much more
negative number here.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.870
And Mish actually did
that on his blog.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.870
And if you actually want to read
his blog, which I highly

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:54.000
recommend, do a Google search
for Mish, M-I-S-H.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.910
And this is directly from his
blog, so I have to give him

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.430
credit for that.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.470
And what he did here is, he
actually charted the actual

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.390
inflation numbers that
were reported.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.600
That's in blue.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.650
And then on top of that, he
put what he calls the

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:11.220
Case-Shiller CPI Index
and that's in red.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.600
And you see here, especially
over the housing boom-- These

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.340
are the inflation numbers we
got from the government.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.800
They peaked out in the 4% or 5%
range, which isn't low by

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.530
any stretch of the imagination,
and that's

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:28.100
probably why the Feds started
increasing interest rates

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.690
right around here, arguably at
the worst possible time.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:36.940
But if you look at the CS CPI,
or the Case-Shiller CPI, you

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:42.110
could almost say that the real
inflation actually peaked out

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:43.940
in the 8% range back here.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.240
And you could argue that, if
this was the actual number

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.140
that the Fed was using, it would
have actually been a

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.350
much better policy tool, because
they would have seen

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.460
the inflation pop up back
here in January '03.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.450
And they would have known that
they were keeping their

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.500
monetary policy too loose back
here and they could've avoided

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:03.030
this whipsawing that they did
and in 2007 and 2008.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.220
And I'd argue even further
that even this number is

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.080
understanding the reality,
because back here, as a

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:13.070
percentage of the actual CPI
basket, he just took the CPI

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.410
numbers and replaced the year
over year change essentially

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:19.010
into the same weighting as
the current CPI numbers.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.440
But if you actually weighted it
based on the actual amount

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.890
of disposable income people
were spending on their

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.680
mortgages, I would guess that it
would have looked something

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.580
more like this.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.530
And you would have seen actual
inflation peak out here,

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.420
probably in the 10%
or 11% range.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.350
There's a lot of social
commentary about this; why

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.210
they do it.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.310
One argument is, that a lot of
the government's or even

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:49.510
corporate liabilities are
indexed to inflation.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.875
You have an inflation index.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.540
On the other hand, the sale of
homes essentially transfers

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.570
wealth from one generation
to another.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.250
Especially when you have
a huge increase in

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.950
the price of homes.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.090
If they did this on purpose,
and I'm guessing that they

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.200
did, it allows housing prices
to increase dramatically.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.430
And when housing prices increase
dramatically, it

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.900
transfers wealth from the new
buyer generation to the

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.950
retiree generation, so it helps
subsidize the retirees.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.370
And, at the same time, by taking
it out of the actual

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.710
CPI index, it keeps the
government's, and actually a

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.590
lot of other corporate,
liabilities low.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.120
Because now Social
Security, it's

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.540
indexed to the CPI numbers.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.740
So if the CPI numbers are not
incorporating, are not raising

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.340
up here, you don't have to
increase people's Social

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.170
Security payments.

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:47.280
And you kind of get to project
this farce to people.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.870
You say, oh, in inflation
adjusted terms, you're doing

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.010
better than your parents'
generation did.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.290
Oh, but, by the way, you can
afford 1/3 the house now.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.160
And to some degree that's been
propagated-- it's obviously

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.640
all falling apart now.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.920
But the big takeaway from this,
if I had to give you

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.140
just one, is that the
CPI index is a

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.260
government created tool.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.550
It's based on a survey and, not
only has it not been the

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.890
same survey, but it's actively
changed over the years.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.020
And it's changed in ways that
significantly impact the

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.320
actual numbers that are reported
and, to some degree,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.910
play into what I think
the government

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.130
wants people to believe.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.270
Anyway see you in
the next video.
