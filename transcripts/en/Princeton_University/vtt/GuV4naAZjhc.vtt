Freddy Flaxman:
We started the dodgeball tournament in 2005. We wanted to create a monster event, that

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.579 position:97%
Freddy Flaxman:
was the biggest event on campus every single year, and something that would live far after

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.520 position:97%
Freddy Flaxman:
we left and graduated Princeton. So, one of the ideas that we had was to take the most

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.719 position:97%
Freddy Flaxman:
unlikely people around campus and give them dodgeball nicknames, throw their photos on

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.780 position:97%
Freddy Flaxman:
flyers and just plaster the campus. It was one of those things where once you got people

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.210 position:97%
Freddy Flaxman:
there, they had a great time, and so getting them back each year became easier and easier.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.440 position:98%
Freddy Flaxman:
And so the first year, we had about a thousand. The second year, we had about 2,000. By the

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.700
Freddy Flaxman:
third year, we had 3,000.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.190 position:98%
Daneeka Abellard:
I think that the dodgeball tournament is so popular because it's one of the chances for

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.420 position:97%
Daneeka Abellard:
lots of people... lots of the different organizations to get together, to rally and have a tradition

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.200 position:98%
Daneeka Abellard:
to follow, because Princeton has a lot of really big official ones, but this is a really big,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.410 position:97%
Daneeka Abellard:
fun event for everybody to do together. It's one of our chances to bond with people whom

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:42.000 position:97%
Daneeka Abellard:
we would never see ever, but at the same time, it's never actual mean competition. It's all in good fun.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.179 position:97%
Ian Auzenne:
Events like this are important. One, because it allows the students to blow off steam.

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.280 position:97%
Ian Auzenne:
There's no better way of doing that than throwing a dodgeball at somebody else with all your

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.000 position:97%
Ian Auzenne:
might, just to get that aggression out. It's like, "Yeah, I just nailed that guy."

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.500 position:97%
Ian Auzenne:
It's stress relief at its finest. But it also makes students realize that Princeton isn't just

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.000 position:98%
Ian Auzenne:
a place where you study, you can have a little bit of fun here.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.200 position:98%
Dave Slovenski:
Princeton dodgeball is a great new tradition because it brings everybody together, involves

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.050 position:78%
Dave Slovenski:
the whole campus and is just a great night of fun.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.000
Student:
Just come play dodgeball. It's fun.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.200
Ian Auzenne:

Shasanka Pradhan:
So, what I am thinking now is next year I'm just going to do my homework beforehand, before

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.810 position:97%
Shasanka Pradhan:
the day of the dodgeball, and alot the entire evening for dodgeball, because I just realized

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:48.780
Shasanka Pradhan:
how much fun it is.
