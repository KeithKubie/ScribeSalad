was all of a sudden everything was

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360
was all of a sudden everything was

available online information was

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599
available online information was
 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.499
available online information was
accessible you could get it on your own

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509
accessible you could get it on your own
 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.830

permanent and instantaneous at the same
 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.580
permanent and instantaneous at the same
time so the notion that there was only

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590
time so the notion that there was only
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.799
time so the notion that there was only
one way to deliver information and to

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
one way to deliver information and to
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.009
one way to deliver information and to
and to access information that blown up

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019
and to access information that blown up
 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.390

fundamentally changed and it was great

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:51.299
fundamentally changed and it was great
 

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:55.100

it was freeing it was liberating and but

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
it was freeing it was liberating and but
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.789
it was freeing it was liberating and but
it was but it was still limited in its

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:57.799
it was but it was still limited in its
 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:59.930

dimensionality it was basically

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940

dimension because all of a sudden you

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979
dimension because all of a sudden you
 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.130
dimension because all of a sudden you
add this component of interactivity and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
add this component of interactivity and
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.710
add this component of interactivity and
the customer is in charge and the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720
the customer is in charge and the
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.219

closed systems is basically

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619
closed systems is basically
 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.529
closed systems is basically
participatory interactive open

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539

boom so you took something that exploded

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399
boom so you took something that exploded
 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.330
boom so you took something that exploded
time space and add another dimension

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340
time space and add another dimension
 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.480
time space and add another dimension
which is you're stepping inside of it

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
which is you're stepping inside of it
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.010
which is you're stepping inside of it
it's almost I mean I don't want to be

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
it's almost I mean I don't want to be
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.510
it's almost I mean I don't want to be
too I don't know that much about physics

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520
too I don't know that much about physics
 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.300
too I don't know that much about physics
but what I know about physics is when

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310
but what I know about physics is when
 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.940
but what I know about physics is when
you go into quantum physics the game

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
you go into quantum physics the game
 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.349
you go into quantum physics the game
changes because the participant

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359
changes because the participant
 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:55.760
changes because the participant
determines the outcome of the experiment

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770
determines the outcome of the experiment
 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.510
determines the outcome of the experiment
that's web 2.0 okay it's no longer

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520
that's web 2.0 okay it's no longer
 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.300
that's web 2.0 okay it's no longer
changing space-time it's reinventing

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310
changing space-time it's reinventing
 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.569
changing space-time it's reinventing
reality so that the participant

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579
reality so that the participant
 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.340
reality so that the participant
determines the outcome of the experiment

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350
determines the outcome of the experiment
 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.690
determines the outcome of the experiment
and that blew the game open even more

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700
and that blew the game open even more
 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.650
and that blew the game open even more
what happens with 3.0 4.0 I am waiting

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660
what happens with 3.0 4.0 I am waiting
 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.770
what happens with 3.0 4.0 I am waiting
to see stay as my friend Keith Yamashita

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780
to see stay as my friend Keith Yamashita
 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.670
to see stay as my friend Keith Yamashita
used to say watch this space
