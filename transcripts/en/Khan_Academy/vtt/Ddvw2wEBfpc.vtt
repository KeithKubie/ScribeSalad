00:00:00.558 --> 00:00:02.485
- [Voiceover] We're told
to fill in the blanks

00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:07.292
to complete the equation
that describes the diagram.

00:00:07.292 --> 00:00:09.544
So let's think about
what's going on over here.

00:00:09.544 --> 00:00:14.536
If we start at zero, and we
move one, two, three, four

00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:17.810
spaces to the right of zero,
this arrow right over here

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.062
represents positive four.

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:22.430
We already see that right
over here in the equation.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.913
Then from positive four,
from the tip of this arrow,

00:00:25.913 --> 00:00:30.913
we then go one, two,
three, four, five, six

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:34.597
spaces to the left.

00:00:34.597 --> 00:00:36.640
So what we just did here is we just added

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.914
a negative six to the positive four.

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:41.841
Positive four plus negative six.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.374
Where does that put us?

00:00:43.374 --> 00:00:46.137
Well we see it puts us one, two spaces

00:00:46.137 --> 00:00:48.505
to the left of zero and
each of these spaces

00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:49.898
in this diagram are one.

00:00:49.898 --> 00:00:52.429
So two spaces to the left of zero

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.400
is going to be negative two.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.260
This is fun. Let's keep
doing more examples.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.339
Write an addition equation
or a subtraction equation,

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.823
your choice, so they're
giving us some choice,

00:01:06.823 --> 00:01:08.263
to describe the diagram.

00:01:08.263 --> 00:01:09.935
Alright, let's see what's going on here.

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:12.814
We're starting at zero
and we're going one, two,

00:01:12.814 --> 00:01:16.065
three, four to the left.

00:01:16.065 --> 00:01:17.876
So if we're going four to the left

00:01:17.876 --> 00:01:22.876
or so we can say negative four, -4.

00:01:22.984 --> 00:01:26.583
And then we're going
to go another one, two,

00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:31.583
three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine to the left.

00:01:31.784 --> 00:01:35.731
So we could write this as
negative four minus nine

00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:37.937
is equal to.

00:01:37.937 --> 00:01:39.818
And when you go four to the left

00:01:39.818 --> 00:01:41.629
and then you go another nine to the left,

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:46.629
you end up 13 to the left of
zero which is negative 13.

00:01:47.088 --> 00:01:49.145
Equals negative 13.

00:01:49.145 --> 00:01:51.746
So this way I've written it
as a subtraction equation

00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:52.582
I guess you could say.

00:01:52.582 --> 00:01:56.761
Negative four minus nine,
is equal to negative 13.

00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:57.992
Now another way I could have done it,

00:02:00.992 --> 00:02:05.283
I could have said negative
four plus negative nine

00:02:05.283 --> 00:02:08.568
is equal to negative thirteen as well.

00:02:08.568 --> 00:02:10.008
Either of those would
have been legitimate.

00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:13.746
Now I've written it as
an addition equation.

00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:15.279
Let's keep going.

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:17.345
Fill in the blanks to
complete the equation

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:19.621
that describes the diagram.

00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:21.514
So we're starting at zero, we go three

00:02:21.514 --> 00:02:24.360
to the left of zero,
that's negative three.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.768
Then we go another three
to the left of that.

00:02:27.768 --> 00:02:30.485
So we're going to add
another negative three.

00:02:30.485 --> 00:02:32.621
We're going to add another negative three

00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:35.268
and that puts us six to the left of zero.

00:02:35.268 --> 00:02:40.005
Well six to the left of
zero is negative six.

00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:42.075
And we're done.
