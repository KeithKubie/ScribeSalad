00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.251
RSA can be used for
encryption and signature.

00:00:03.251 --> 00:00:07.918
Its security is based on the assumption
that factoring a large number is

00:00:07.918 --> 00:00:08.710
very hard.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.668
Diffie-Hellman is used for key exchange.

00:00:11.668 --> 00:00:16.239
Its security is based on the assumption
that the discrete log on large numbers

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.090
is very hard.
