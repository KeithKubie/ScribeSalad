00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.565
So now, let's consider division. I know division is the inverse of

00:00:03.577 --> 00:00:07.585
multiplication. So it should also take higher priority over addition and

00:00:07.596 --> 00:00:11.270
subtraction. So we know in our hierarchy of the order of operations,

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:15.590
multiplication and division should come first. Let's consider this problem:

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:19.985
negative 3 plus 24, divided by 4 times 3. Here are the two expressions that I

00:00:19.997 --> 00:00:24.260
could write. This first expression has the parentheses around the 24 and the 4.

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:28.405
The second one has parentheses around the 4 and the 3. In this problem it's

00:00:28.417 --> 00:00:32.575
unclear whether or not we're dividing just by 4, or dividing by 4 times 3. We

00:00:32.587 --> 00:00:36.295
assume that this is true whenever we see the division symbol without

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:40.520
parentheses. The number immediately after it is included or divided into the

00:00:40.532 --> 00:00:44.662
number before it. So, there's no need to solve this problem. Here's one other

00:00:44.674 --> 00:00:48.563
word of caution. Whenever we think about simplifying this expression, we don't

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:52.171
actually want to use PEMDAS. If you've heard of PEMDAS, then you probably

00:00:52.183 --> 00:00:56.206
remember that multiplication comes before division. But, this is not necessarily

00:00:56.218 --> 00:00:59.923
true. Multiplication and division have the same priority whenever we do the

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:03.774
order of operations. Students who learn that multiplication comes first using

00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:08.133
PEMDAS would be incorrect. We know we should carry out this division before we

00:01:08.145 --> 00:01:11.650
do the multiplication. In general, we should think about doing our

00:01:11.662 --> 00:01:15.883
simplification from left to right, because multiplication and division have the

00:01:15.895 --> 00:01:20.077
same priority in the order of operations. So these parentheses are assumed to be

00:01:20.089 --> 00:01:24.056
the case, so let's evaluate this expression. I have -3 plus 6 times 3. And

00:01:24.068 --> 00:01:27.673
negative 3 plus 18. Negative 3 plus 18 makes 15. In doing our order of

00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:31.849
operations, it's important to remember the hierarchy. That multiplication and

00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:35.758
division have the same priority and should be done from left to right in the

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.745
order of operation.
