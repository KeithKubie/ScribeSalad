00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090
in yourself you have to have really good
 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.850
in yourself you have to have really good
mental health and really good you know

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860
mental health and really good you know
 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.450
mental health and really good you know
just health I think and I didn't have I

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460
just health I think and I didn't have I
 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.160
just health I think and I didn't have I
just didn't have the concentration so I

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170
just didn't have the concentration so I
 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.270
just didn't have the concentration so I
started to try and write it as a

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280
started to try and write it as a
 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.220
started to try and write it as a
screenplay and I and I got absolutely

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230
screenplay and I and I got absolutely
 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.920
screenplay and I and I got absolutely
nowhere it was a disaster actually so I

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930
nowhere it was a disaster actually so I
 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.750
nowhere it was a disaster actually so I
thought no case not a film it's

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760
thought no case not a film it's
 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.340
thought no case not a film it's
definitely a book and I went back and

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350
definitely a book and I went back and
 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.660
definitely a book and I went back and
then we were in Ireland and I just

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670
then we were in Ireland and I just
 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.880
then we were in Ireland and I just
started to write and I and so it took me

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890
started to write and I and so it took me
 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.110
started to write and I and so it took me
about two and a half years and I just

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120
about two and a half years and I just
 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.050
about two and a half years and I just
wrote the book and then about three

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060
wrote the book and then about three
 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.160
wrote the book and then about three
quarters of the way through writing the

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170
quarters of the way through writing the
 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.780
quarters of the way through writing the
book I started to see double like this

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790
book I started to see double like this
 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.250
book I started to see double like this
certain way that I have where like I

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260
certain way that I have where like I
 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.440
certain way that I have where like I
start to see it double like I start

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450
start to see it double like I start
 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.490
start to see it double like I start
seeing it film two and once I once that

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500
seeing it film two and once I once that
 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.040
seeing it film two and once I once that
happened it was really the book was

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050

really finished fundamentally finished
 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.670
really finished fundamentally finished
but I was starting to kind of add things

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680
but I was starting to kind of add things
 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.170
but I was starting to kind of add things
on and pad things and take things away

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180
on and pad things and take things away
 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.090
on and pad things and take things away
and that's when I already knew so then I

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100
and that's when I already knew so then I
 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.040
and that's when I already knew so then I
had it more or less finished and I wrote

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050
had it more or less finished and I wrote
 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.960
had it more or less finished and I wrote
the screenplay and then I went back and

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970
the screenplay and then I went back and
 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.160
the screenplay and then I went back and
I finished the novel and sort of at the

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170
I finished the novel and sort of at the
 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.260
I finished the novel and sort of at the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.030
very end they started kind of talking to
each other a little bit but I find them

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040
each other a little bit but I find them
 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.740
each other a little bit but I find them
for me the best thing is if I'm gonna do

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750
for me the best thing is if I'm gonna do
 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.360
for me the best thing is if I'm gonna do
it like I do that with personal velocity

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370
it like I do that with personal velocity
 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.830
it like I do that with personal velocity
to that I it's better if I'm not

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840
to that I it's better if I'm not
 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.589

the wound is open and then it's almost
 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.229
the wound is open and then it's almost
becomes like part of the same thing I

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239
becomes like part of the same thing I
 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.280
becomes like part of the same thing I
don't know what it would be like to

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290
don't know what it would be like to
 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.570
don't know what it would be like to
write a book and then 10 years later

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580
write a book and then 10 years later
 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.880

would I don't that hasn't been how I've

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240
would I don't that hasn't been how I've
 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.550
would I don't that hasn't been how I've
done it ever

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560
 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.160
it's really it's interesting I don't I

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170
it's really it's interesting I don't I
 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.350
it's really it's interesting I don't I
mean I sort of feel that PIPA in the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360
mean I sort of feel that PIPA in the
 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.390
mean I sort of feel that PIPA in the
book he's always gonna be pepper in the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400
book he's always gonna be pepper in the
 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.840
book he's always gonna be pepper in the
book like that PIPA will never be erased

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850
book like that PIPA will never be erased
 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.260
book like that PIPA will never be erased
or substituted by anything else although

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270
or substituted by anything else although
 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.309
or substituted by anything else although
I think that for that what's so for me

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319
I think that for that what's so for me
 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.809
I think that for that what's so for me
and I'm not really I don't think of it

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819
and I'm not really I don't think of it
 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.240
and I'm not really I don't think of it
almost like it's not really adapting the

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250
almost like it's not really adapting the
 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.949
almost like it's not really adapting the
book as much as kind of almost

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959
book as much as kind of almost
 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.559
book as much as kind of almost
reinventing it from the same nub and the

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569
reinventing it from the same nub and the
 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.050
reinventing it from the same nub and the
same idea because the film is actually

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060
same idea because the film is actually
 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.930
same idea because the film is actually
completely different form than the book

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940
completely different form than the book
 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.400
completely different form than the book
but I think that Robin Wright Penn who's

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410
but I think that Robin Wright Penn who's
 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.080
but I think that Robin Wright Penn who's
playing PIPA actually kind of she she

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090
playing PIPA actually kind of she she
 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.790
playing PIPA actually kind of she she
gets this essence of PIPA like what I

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800
gets this essence of PIPA like what I
 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.350
gets this essence of PIPA like what I
was saying before about this essence she

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360
was saying before about this essence she
 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.250
was saying before about this essence she
really does embody a certain kind of

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260
 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.210
sort of a annek an acceptance that PIPA

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220
sort of a annek an acceptance that PIPA
 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.100
sort of a annek an acceptance that PIPA
has of other people and the world around

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110
has of other people and the world around
 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.979
has of other people and the world around
her and a kind of grace but she has

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989
her and a kind of grace but she has
 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.400
