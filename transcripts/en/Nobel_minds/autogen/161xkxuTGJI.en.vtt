so throughout the day we've been hearing

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500
so throughout the day we've been hearing
 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.880
so throughout the day we've been hearing
of all sorts of challenges that we face

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890
of all sorts of challenges that we face
 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.530
of all sorts of challenges that we face
when considering the future of food and

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540
when considering the future of food and
 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.900
when considering the future of food and
the challenges are going to require

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910
the challenges are going to require
 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.330
the challenges are going to require
creativity and we thought that there's

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340
creativity and we thought that there's
 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.090
creativity and we thought that there's
no better assemblage of people to talk

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
no better assemblage of people to talk
 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.970
no better assemblage of people to talk
about creativity than a group of six

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980
about creativity than a group of six
 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.420
about creativity than a group of six
visiting Nobel laureates so I'd like to

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430
visiting Nobel laureates so I'd like to
 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.630
visiting Nobel laureates so I'd like to
start by asking them about what they

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640
start by asking them about what they
 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.130
start by asking them about what they
think is the best condition for

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140
think is the best condition for
 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.340
think is the best condition for
fostering creativity let's start at the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350
fostering creativity let's start at the
 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.630
fostering creativity let's start at the
end of the row Steve well I think it's

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640
end of the row Steve well I think it's
 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.180
end of the row Steve well I think it's
the immediate environment that we find

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190
the immediate environment that we find
 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.060
the immediate environment that we find
ourselves in immediate environment means

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
ourselves in immediate environment means
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.729
ourselves in immediate environment means
colleagues but there's also another

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739
colleagues but there's also another
 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.069
colleagues but there's also another
thing and that is there's also it's

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079
thing and that is there's also it's
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.540
thing and that is there's also it's
about food but I'm gonna talk about

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550
about food but I'm gonna talk about
 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.580
about food but I'm gonna talk about
another hunger that people are driven

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590
another hunger that people are driven
 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.349
another hunger that people are driven
because they really want to understand

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359
because they really want to understand
 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.479
because they really want to understand
how the world works there is another

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
how the world works there is another
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.649
how the world works there is another
thing and they really want to do some

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
thing and they really want to do some
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.870
thing and they really want to do some
good in the world and especially in my

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880
good in the world and especially in my
 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.770
good in the world and especially in my
career as I got older I began to that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
career as I got older I began to that
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.230
career as I got older I began to that
began to dictate what I was getting

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
began to dictate what I was getting
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.140
began to dictate what I was getting
interested in and as after coming out of

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
interested in and as after coming out of

and do you feel conditions for

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909
and do you feel conditions for
 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.859
and do you feel conditions for
creativity these days are improving

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869
creativity these days are improving
 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:36.410
creativity these days are improving
generally you it's mixed I think what

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
generally you it's mixed I think what
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.240
generally you it's mixed I think what
you need is you have to have an

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250
you need is you have to have an
 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.980

like that
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.569
like that
I think there's it's a mixed bag I think

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
I think there's it's a mixed bag I think
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.639
I think there's it's a mixed bag I think
like a lot of the younger people don't

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649
like a lot of the younger people don't
 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.809

was growing up in the United States but
 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.600
was growing up in the United States but
I grew up in a split

really train the new generation of
 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.010
really train the new generation of
scientists you know but why shouldn't

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020
scientists you know but why shouldn't
 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.380
scientists you know but why shouldn't
that be challenges like that now there

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390
that be challenges like that now there

this is what we have to do what we're
 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.770
this is what we have to do what we're
facing in terms of climate change in

whole thing this is a calling that's

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160
whole thing this is a calling that's
 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.520
whole thing this is a calling that's
huge and a huge scientific challenge and

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530
huge and a huge scientific challenge and
 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.199
huge and a huge scientific challenge and
and rather than going to arms or being

love what Patti Smith said when she

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580
love what Patti Smith said when she
 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.080
love what Patti Smith said when she
invoked silence because to me that's

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090
invoked silence because to me that's
 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.810
invoked silence because to me that's
where that's where the wellspring of

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820
where that's where the wellspring of
 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.620
where that's where the wellspring of
creativity really really comes and and I

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630
creativity really really comes and and I
 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.590
creativity really really comes and and I
think it's when you you look at the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600
think it's when you you look at the
 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.070
think it's when you you look at the
wonder of nature I I'm president of the

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080
wonder of nature I I'm president of the
 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.390
wonder of nature I I'm president of the
Salk Institute and one of the young

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400
Salk Institute and one of the young
 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.660
Salk Institute and one of the young
scientists said to me when I walk across

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670
scientists said to me when I walk across
 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.910
scientists said to me when I walk across
the courtyard of the Salk Institute and

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920
the courtyard of the Salk Institute and
 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.310
the courtyard of the Salk Institute and
I look at the Stars I think anything is

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320
I look at the Stars I think anything is
 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.920
I look at the Stars I think anything is
possible and she just said this to me

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930
possible and she just said this to me
 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.350
possible and she just said this to me
and I just thought no I'm that's what I

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360
and I just thought no I'm that's what I
 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.030
and I just thought no I'm that's what I
love is being in a place where people

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040
love is being in a place where people
 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.000
love is being in a place where people
have that sort of inspiration from what

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010
have that sort of inspiration from what
 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.789
have that sort of inspiration from what
they do but I think that's where we have

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799
they do but I think that's where we have
 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.490
they do but I think that's where we have
to let silence sort of happen so we can

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500
to let silence sort of happen so we can
 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.090
to let silence sort of happen so we can
let that creativity rise up I'm reminded

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100
let that creativity rise up I'm reminded
 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.009
let that creativity rise up I'm reminded
of these jellyfish images which is like

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019
of these jellyfish images which is like
 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.410
of these jellyfish images which is like
the thoughts of their creativity coming

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420
the thoughts of their creativity coming
 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.539
the thoughts of their creativity coming
up so I think we have to make space for

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549
up so I think we have to make space for
 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.100
up so I think we have to make space for
silence and I think that's where

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110
silence and I think that's where
 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.310
silence and I think that's where
creativity will grow I guess it's harder

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320
creativity will grow I guess it's harder
 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.170
creativity will grow I guess it's harder
and harder to find space for silence

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180
and harder to find space for silence
 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.660
and harder to find space for silence

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519
Kristiana what do you think much - my
 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.190
Kristiana what do you think much - my
thoughts - I mean silence is perhaps not

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200

coming up there I think it's really

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610
coming up there I think it's really
 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:03.640
coming up there I think it's really
important

you shouldn't do this I always think

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600
you shouldn't do this I always think
 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.480
you shouldn't do this I always think
maybe there's something really good to

maybe there's something really good to
 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.420
maybe there's something really good to
do there but if they say I'll do this I

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430
do there but if they say I'll do this I
 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.730
do there but if they say I'll do this I
think that's going to be mundane and so

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740
think that's going to be mundane and so
 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.910

totally you need to be inside yourself
 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.610
totally you need to be inside yourself
from time to time so that you can really

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620
from time to time so that you can really
 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.020

interesting going on that you would like
 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.670
interesting going on that you would like
to know how it works my own work at the

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680
to know how it works my own work at the
 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.980
to know how it works my own work at the
moment is of bacteria and there is

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990
moment is of bacteria and there is
 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.900
moment is of bacteria and there is
something very interesting going on in

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910
something very interesting going on in
 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.510
something very interesting going on in
bacteria and we understand a little bit

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520
bacteria and we understand a little bit
 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.140
bacteria and we understand a little bit
of it but there's a big swath of it that

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150
of it but there's a big swath of it that
 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.060
of it but there's a big swath of it that
we really don't understand at the moment

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070
we really don't understand at the moment
 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.610
we really don't understand at the moment
and so for me that's what gets me up in

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620
and so for me that's what gets me up in
 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.050
and so for me that's what gets me up in
the morning it's what stops me from

you've got six attested or how many of

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:24.630
you've got six attested or how many of
 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.550
you've got six attested or how many of
us yeah six attested creators here so if

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560
us yeah six attested creators here so if
 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.840
us yeah six attested creators here so if
you want to know more about creativity

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:29.850
you want to know more about creativity
 

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.480
you want to know more about creativity
maybe you should ask the people who were

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.490
maybe you should ask the people who were
 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:38.390
maybe you should ask the people who were
not creative and why they were not if

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400
not creative and why they were not if
 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.520
not creative and why they were not if
you want more creativity then you know

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.530
you want more creativity then you know
 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.250
you want more creativity then you know
you've got to get for those people it's

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:43.260
you've got to get for those people it's
 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.170
you've got to get for those people it's
clearly true that you need to sink into

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180
clearly true that you need to sink into
 

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.440
clearly true that you need to sink into
yourself so that part of it I think we'd

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:48.450
yourself so that part of it I think we'd
 

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.900
yourself so that part of it I think we'd
probably all attest to you need lonely

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:50.910
probably all attest to you need lonely
 

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.110
probably all attest to you need lonely

thing that I'm not sure is widely

00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:58.950
thing that I'm not sure is widely
 

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.520
thing that I'm not sure is widely
appreciated is just how important the

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:01.530
appreciated is just how important the
 

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.790

social incentives are for creating
 

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.290
social incentives are for creating
creativity so I think throughout history

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:08.300
creativity so I think throughout history
 

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.810

there's a sort of micro view of someone

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:11.820
there's a sort of micro view of someone
 

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.050
there's a sort of micro view of someone
sitting there waiting for creativity to

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:15.060
sitting there waiting for creativity to
 

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:15.930
sitting there waiting for creativity to
fall on their head

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:15.940
fall on their head
 

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.180
fall on their head

something going on in the environment
 

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.200
something going on in the environment
which is pressurizing people to solve

which is pressurizing people to solve

that problem this is not mechanical at

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:28.750
that problem this is not mechanical at
 

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.720
that problem this is not mechanical at

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.930
society how this can be the while that
it gets more challenging and more

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:18.940
it gets more challenging and more
 

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.580
it gets more challenging and more
creative it becomes because that's where

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:20.590
creative it becomes because that's where
 

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.920
creative it becomes because that's where
now in fascination comes and maybe we

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:22.930
now in fascination comes and maybe we
 

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:24.450
now in fascination comes and maybe we
should get together make it happen

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:24.460
should get together make it happen
 

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.560
should get together make it happen
I like how you said the phrase

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:25.570
I like how you said the phrase
 

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.330
I like how you said the phrase
fairytales because people would

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:27.340
fairytales because people would
 

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.210
fairytales because people would
presumably mostly dismiss it as childish

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:30.220
presumably mostly dismiss it as childish
 

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.160
presumably mostly dismiss it as childish
but maybe that's where every way we

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.170
but maybe that's where every way we
 

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.650
but maybe that's where every way we
should be thinking about what we should

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:34.660
should be thinking about what we should
 

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.270
should be thinking about what we should
be aspiring for how important is

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:36.280
be aspiring for how important is
 

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.730
be aspiring for how important is
creativity how much of a role did it

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:38.740
creativity how much of a role did it
 

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.580
creativity how much of a role did it
play in your own I would say the core of

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:41.590
play in your own I would say the core of
 

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.310

human being without creativity human

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320
human being without creativity human
 

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.640
human being without creativity human
being just like another species which is

being just like another species which is
 

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.430
being just like another species which is
not much to contribute human being takes

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.440
not much to contribute human being takes
 

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.490
not much to contribute human being takes
challenges as imagination and that

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:53.500
challenges as imagination and that
 

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.340
challenges as imagination and that
imagination triggers all the creative

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:56.350
imagination triggers all the creative
 

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.250
imagination triggers all the creative
power inside of them to make it happen

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:58.260
power inside of them to make it happen
 

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.540
power inside of them to make it happen
human being I don't think they accept

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:00.550
human being I don't think they accept
 

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:04.820
human being I don't think they accept
Impossibles they get always get kind of

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:04.830
Impossibles they get always get kind of
 

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.020
Impossibles they get always get kind of
challenged by seeing something

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:07.030
challenged by seeing something
 

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.030

impossible I always say why can't we do

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040
impossible I always say why can't we do
 

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.890
impossible I always say why can't we do
it possible which ways do we do that

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:10.900
it possible which ways do we do that
 

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.080
it possible which ways do we do that
so we keep on pushing the door pushing

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:13.090
so we keep on pushing the door pushing
 

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.090
so we keep on pushing the door pushing
the frontier making it happen that's why

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:15.100
the frontier making it happen that's why
 

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.160
the frontier making it happen that's why
things start happening there is you're

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:17.170
things start happening there is you're
 

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:22.020
things start happening there is you're
nodding do you want to say yes I think

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:22.030
nodding do you want to say yes I think
 

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.790
nodding do you want to say yes I think
you were saying does that play a role

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:23.800
you were saying does that play a role
 

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.630
you were saying does that play a role
and but yeah you know we we saw

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:27.640
and but yeah you know we we saw
 

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.250
and but yeah you know we we saw
something happening with DNA that

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:29.260
something happening with DNA that
 

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.750
something happening with DNA that
shouldn't have been happening you know

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:30.760
shouldn't have been happening you know
 

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.130
shouldn't have been happening you know
the textbook said shouldn't be happening

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:32.140
the textbook said shouldn't be happening
 

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.830
the textbook said shouldn't be happening
so I had to imagine there was something

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:34.840
so I had to imagine there was something
 

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.310
so I had to imagine there was something
and I imagined an enzyme right and you

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320
and I imagined an enzyme right and you
 

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.170
and I imagined an enzyme right and you
knows it said well this thing that

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:40.180
knows it said well this thing that
 

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.070
knows it said well this thing that
doesn't exist maybe it exists and so I

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:44.080
doesn't exist maybe it exists and so I
 

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.830
doesn't exist maybe it exists and so I
think that was a creativity aspect of it

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:46.840
think that was a creativity aspect of it
 

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.100
think that was a creativity aspect of it
who made having it what's there before

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:49.110
who made having it what's there before
 

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.480
who made having it what's there before
then you had there was hard work going

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:51.490
then you had there was hard work going
 

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.060
then you had there was hard work going
in and actually finding it but I think

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:54.070
in and actually finding it but I think
 

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.070
in and actually finding it but I think
you had to first imagine the possibility

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:56.080
you had to first imagine the possibility
 

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.600
you had to first imagine the possibility
of something that nobody ever said

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:57.610
of something that nobody ever said
 

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.500
of something that nobody ever said
should be going on so that's very

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:01.510
should be going on so that's very
 

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.220
should be going on so that's very
important thank you I think creativity

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:05.230
important thank you I think creativity
 

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:09.870
important thank you I think creativity
in innocence is combining facts which no

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:09.880
in innocence is combining facts which no
 

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.780
in innocence is combining facts which no
one else had combined before so finding

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:12.790
one else had combined before so finding
 

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.240
one else had combined before so finding
connections between things which are

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:15.250
connections between things which are
 

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.660
connections between things which are
everybody can see but to get the

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:18.670
everybody can see but to get the
 

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.880
everybody can see but to get the
connections in your brain means that you

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:20.890
connections in your brain means that you
 

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.670
connections in your brain means that you
have you let these different things

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680
have you let these different things
 

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.740
have you let these different things
enter your brain and then play around

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:25.750
enter your brain and then play around
 

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.470
enter your brain and then play around
and we all know this that you think

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480
and we all know this that you think
 

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.750
and we all know this that you think
about something very hard and you can't

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:30.760
about something very hard and you can't
 

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.550
about something very hard and you can't
find a solution and next morning you

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560
find a solution and next morning you
 

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.560
find a solution and next morning you
wake up and all of a sudden you know the

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:34.570
wake up and all of a sudden you know the
 

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:37.020
wake up and all of a sudden you know the
solution and this is in the mind somehow

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:37.030
solution and this is in the mind somehow
 

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.650
solution and this is in the mind somehow
uses the info the information input and

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:40.660
uses the info the information input and
 

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.990
uses the info the information input and
and and somehow it is working in the

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.000
and and somehow it is working in the
 

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.360
and and somehow it is working in the
brain in your unconsciousness and I

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:45.370
brain in your unconsciousness and I
 

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.150
brain in your unconsciousness and I
think but it's very important as a basic

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160
think but it's very important as a basic
 

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.550
think but it's very important as a basic
basis for that is to have the right

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560
basis for that is to have the right
 

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.560
basis for that is to have the right
surrounding which gives you this input

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:52.570
surrounding which gives you this input
 

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.260
surrounding which gives you this input
which you can use so I think when

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:55.270
which you can use so I think when
 

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.970
which you can use so I think when
when young people ask me where they

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:56.980
when young people ask me where they
 

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.710
when young people ask me where they
should go what they should study also I

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720
should go what they should study also I
 

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.930
should go what they should study also I
always say go to a good place where

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:00.940
always say go to a good place where
 

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.630
always say go to a good place where
there are smart people who pop up ideas

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:03.640
there are smart people who pop up ideas
 

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.760
there are smart people who pop up ideas
and information which is interesting and

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:05.770
and information which is interesting and
 

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.100
and information which is interesting and
not just to places where yeah the babies

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:08.110
not just to places where yeah the babies
 

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.870
not just to places where yeah the babies
I mean very it's just not interesting

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880
I mean very it's just not interesting
 

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.240
I mean very it's just not interesting
and interesting means something special

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:12.250
and interesting means something special
 

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.510
and interesting means something special
and you get several interesting aspects

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:15.520
and you get several interesting aspects
 

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.920
and you get several interesting aspects
and then you combine them in your head

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:16.930
and then you combine them in your head
 

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:18.840
and then you combine them in your head
and then you create something new I

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:18.850
and then you create something new I
 

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.780
and then you create something new I
think that's that's the sense thank you

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:21.790
think that's that's the sense thank you
 

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.120
think that's that's the sense thank you
we're getting very close to time we're

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:24.130
we're getting very close to time we're
 

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.350
we're getting very close to time we're
getting also very close to the end of

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360
getting also very close to the end of
 

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.880
getting also very close to the end of
the year and in some ways it's been a

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:26.890
the year and in some ways it's been a
 

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.550
the year and in some ways it's been a
pretty tough year

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560
pretty tough year
 

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.980
pretty tough year
so shall we end with some something

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:31.990
so shall we end with some something
 

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:36.660
so shall we end with some something
positive Steve give us a positive

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:36.670
positive Steve give us a positive
 

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:42.990
positive Steve give us a positive
thought hope to make it for the next

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.000
thought hope to make it for the next
 

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.320
thought hope to make it for the next
four years no seriously I think since

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:49.330
four years no seriously I think since
 

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.650
four years no seriously I think since
we're here celebrating you know Nobel

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:52.660
we're here celebrating you know Nobel
 

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:57.900
we're here celebrating you know Nobel
Prize science it is something where I

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:57.910
Prize science it is something where I
 

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:01.410
Prize science it is something where I
feel very deeply that it's not only fun

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:01.420
feel very deeply that it's not only fun
 

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.610
feel very deeply that it's not only fun
to do but it can really help in many

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:05.620
to do but it can really help in many
 

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.699
to do but it can really help in many
respects sometimes it helps decades

00:16:08.699 --> 00:16:08.709
respects sometimes it helps decades
 

00:16:08.709 --> 00:16:12.710
respects sometimes it helps decades
later in a very unintuitive ways and so

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720
later in a very unintuitive ways and so
 

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.110
later in a very unintuitive ways and so
that just doing what really interests

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.120
that just doing what really interests
 

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.350
that just doing what really interests
you and knowing historically that the
