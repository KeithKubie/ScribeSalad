1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.310
Yeah.
It's very biking.
Yeah.
Yes.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.240
Acts just acts is always land the right way.

3
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:08.400
That's what always Fripp freaks me out.
I feel like it would,

4
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:11.760
my handle would bounce off the wall and it would just fly somewhere weird in a

5
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:12.390
movie.

6
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.390
The guy grabs the knife by the blade like this and it always lands with the

7
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:18.750
blade in the body.

8
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.780
Imagine if someone threw a knife at you and the handle hit like this.

9
00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:23.760
You're like,
oh bitch,
you just can't.
You have a knife.

10
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.500
This knife and I'm going to hold on this after death grip and slide it into your

11
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:30.060
rib cash.
You mentioned this yesterday,

12
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:34.530
but someone duals that were a lot of duals.
I heard a stat.
I didn't,

13
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.520
I never knew about it that Andrew Jackson was in something like a hundred duels.

14
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.290
What?
He only killed one person.

15
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:44.070
I thought he killed a lot of you usually get shot in the arm or like you know

16
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:48.240
like a musket ball would go like your legs are the one where he killed the guy.

17
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.940
He actually,
it was a,
I forget the actual guy's name,

18
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:53.340
but he was known as being a really good doula.

19
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:55.650
He killed a lots of p like 26 people or something like that.

20
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.540
So we challenged this guy and he thought the only way to win would be to let him

21
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:04.500
take the first shot.
So he let him take the first shot,
got hit in the chest,

22
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.610
was bleeding,

23
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.920
covered the hole and then shot the guy and he died.
Whoa.

24
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.601
He shot him in the head.

25
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:15.030
He city fell immediately and then died like a couple hours later I think.

26
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:19.310
I don't know if he was the president at the time,
but the doctor said like,

27
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.800
I don't know how you stood and took that shot and he said,

28
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.120
if he shot me in the brain,

29
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.610
I was going to stand and take that shot to kill this guy.

30
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:28.050
I don't know if you said like motherfucker or whatever,

31
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:31.560
but like Andrew Jackson was crazy.
This guy.
Yeah,
he's a crazy dude where his,

32
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:35.550
where is where the statue of him is and I'm in Jackson Square in New Orleans.

33
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.240
There's that church that's behind it and that this is why New Orleans is

34
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:42.930
supposedly the most haunted city is because they'd had the most duals.

35
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:46.890
Because once a Andrew Jackson contacted John Laffite and was like,

36
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.110
I need an army.
And John the feet was basically a gangster,

37
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:51.060
which is basically someone that can get you anything.

38
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.870
Like that's what a connected guy does.
And so he got him freed slaves,

39
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:57.720
native Americans,
creoles Cajuns and just,
you know,

40
00:01:57.721 --> 00:01:59.880
angry men and they repelled the British.

41
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:03.810
But then they stayed and they just lived in the bars and they were dual happy

42
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:07.320
because their egos were so big.
And I've looked for these and I can't find him.

43
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.930
What they had was dueling cards where if you had one,

44
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.150
it would say Joe Rogan have your face.
You know,

45
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:14.520
probably that image and it would say,
you know,

46
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.220
dueling card and someone bumped into you and you were like,

47
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:19.880
you just give them your card and be like,
see you in the morning motherfucker.

48
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.850
And that means we're,
we're shooting it out.
Whoa,
you would dual over nothing.

49
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.150
And the guy I went in the scope,
this ghost tour and the guy taught me,

50
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:29.220
they told me this story and he said,

51
00:02:29.221 --> 00:02:34.050
imagine the amount of guys who are hung over woke up like,
oh fuck,
what did I do?

52
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.650
I've got a dual now.
And you'd go behind that cemetery.

53
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:38.910
That's where they'd have their dual.

54
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.080
And imagine laying there with a bullet or a piece of round led and your liver

55
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:46.620
and going like,
I'm dead over this shit.
It's like I stepped on my foot.

56
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.060
They keep cards like dueler carts.
No,
this is just like a picture of one.

57
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.340
They also said that a lot,
a lot of times the uh,

58
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.460
the dual wouldn't actually happen.
Like they might not actually shoot.

59
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.050
It was more of a test of will of like,
yeah.
Will you go through with it?
Yeah,

60
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.750
it was all honoring.

61
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.320
They'd have to bring a second guy to make to like verify that the dual actually

62
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:07.750
went down and said one was a pussy or whatever.
Serious.

63
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.130
He's like the judge of the event.
He's laying odds.

64
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.960
It's like,
he's like,
ah,
do certain states were duals or legal?

65
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:20.440
I think there's still legal in Arizona or the used to be because there was a cop

66
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.510
who shot someone in a duel like years back.
Really?
Yeah.
It was a,

67
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:26.410
it was a weird thing.

68
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:30.670
Like a cop was off duty and he shot someone in a duel.

69
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.150
Oh Man.
I want to say this is more than 10 years ago,

70
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:37.240
so maybe they changed the law,
but I remember reading that going what?

71
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.850
You can do dual dashboard saying Texas.
Well,
yeah,

72
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.710
this only,
what's that fist fucking dude?

73
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.470
What is that?
Well.
