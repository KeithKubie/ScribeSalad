00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.390
Alright Charles, let's, let's figure this one out. It turns out,

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.600
as I said, there's lots of different ways to make this work,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.370
but, what we're going to do is move that line that we had

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.140
for conjunction. If we, what we really want to do now is figure

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.290
out how to move it down ,so that now, these three points,

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.870
are, in the green zone. They're going to output, one, because they're the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.170
or, and the only one in the, that's left in the zero

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.800
zone in the, in the red zone is the zero, zero case.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.920
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.408
&gt;&gt; So, How are we going to be able to do that?

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:29.980
&gt;&gt; Well, since ,we want it to be case that, either,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.130
X2 or X1, being one get you above the line, then, we need a threshold

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.890
and a set of weights ,that put either one of them over. You

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.510
don't have to have both of them, you only need one of them.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.900
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.350
&gt;&gt; So, let's imagine a case where X1 is one

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.570
and X2 is zero ,then basically, oh, there you're right,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.230
there's a whole lot of answers, so a weight

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.120
of 1, for X1, would give you a one. Right?

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.300
&gt;&gt; Yes, Huh

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.190
&gt;&gt; And so, if we made the threshold 1, that would work.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.440
&gt;&gt; What about weight 2?

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.740
&gt;&gt; Well, we do exactly the same thing. So, we set, weight 2 equal to 1.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.940
And that means, that in the case where both of them are 0, you get 0 plus 0,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.560
which gives you something less than 1. If ,one of them

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.120
is 1 and the other is 0, you get 1, which

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.660
gives you right at the threshold. And, if both of them,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.830
are, one then you get two, which is still greater than one.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.260
&gt;&gt; Good, alright, that seems like it worked. The other

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.140
way we could do it, is we can keep the weights

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.700
at in another way we can do it, is keep

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.010
the weights where they were before, that just moves this line

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.510
nice and smoothly down. And then, right? So

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.550
before, we had a, a threshold of, one

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.710
and a half. Now we need a threshold of, like, a half ,ought to do it.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.410
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.190
&gt;&gt; Or even less, as long as it's greater

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.840
than zero. So, a quarter should work, as well.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.750
&gt;&gt; So, good, so, lots, lots of different ways

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.320
to do that. And, cool. Can we do not?

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.880
&gt;&gt; What's not of two variables?

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.720
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.030
Let's do not of one variable, then.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.729
&gt;&gt; Okay.
