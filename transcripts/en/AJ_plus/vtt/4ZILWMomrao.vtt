About seven women are killed in Mexico every day.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.440
Over the last seven years, 8,900 women were murdered in Mexico.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.160
And less than a third of those cases were properly investigated as femicides,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.200
or the killing of women because of their gender.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.200
The latest case to spark outrage is that of 8-year-old Ana Lizbeth Polina Ramírez.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.600
She was abducted near her mother’s workplace in Juárez, Nuevo León.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.000
Her body was found two days later in a vacant lot.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.840
One single mom is trying to break the cycle of violence.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.680
She wants to save the lives of women, including her teenage daughter.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.480
Dayra Fyah is a mom and self-defense instructor. She is also a rapper who uses her music to stand up against gender violence.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.560
She lives with her daughter in Ecatepec. It’s arguably one of the most dangerous places for women in Mexico.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.400
The Mexico City suburb has one of the highest rates of killings and disappearances in the country.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:48.960
Here in Ecatepec, the Mexican government has issued a gender violence alert, warning the public that women are being targeted and murdered.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.960
Dayra doesn’t want women to be victims. So she organizes self-defense classes like this one to help them fight back.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.880
But Dayra’s motivation to teach women how to defend themselves goes deeper. 
She wants to protect her daughter Cynthia,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.800
who has already experienced sexual harassment at a young age.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.000
Cynthia is 14 years old. She doesn’t take public transportation by herself because of the widespread sexual harassment.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.640
Still, Dayra doesn’t want her daughter to live in fear and is raising her to be confident and independent.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.960
Although men dominate the hip-hop music industry, Dayra is defying gender roles and making a name for herself.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.120
She is currently recording her third album.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.720
