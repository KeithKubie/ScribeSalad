00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:01.550
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.503
&gt;&gt; It's a great privilege for me
to be here today to introduce one

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.286
of the finest writers on the staff
of the Washington Post, Wil Haygood.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.253
What distinguishes
Wil, as those of you

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.093
who have read his newspaper writing

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.680
or his several excellent biographies
will know, is his exquisite sense

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.640
of history and his
pitch-perfect ear for dialect.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.193
He is brilliant at describing
the unsubtle tectonics of race

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.773
in our land and he's possessed
of a wise empathetic voice

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.973
that subordinates itself
to the narrative.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.210
His writing never overpowers the
extraordinary tales that Wil likes

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.983
to tell of other people's
remarkable lives

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.596
yet Wil's own life story
is one for our times too.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.566
He's a child of Columbus, Ohio where
he was a self-described product

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.213
of a simple boyhood overlaid by a
complicated family, a story he told

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.293
in a memoir, The Haygood's of
Columbus, a love the story.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.860
He didn't set out to be a writer.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.706
In fact, he majored in city planning
during the 1970's which thus

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.946
to be old enough to
remember or recall that was

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.036
when the New York Daily News ran the
headline, Ford to City: Drop Dead.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.166
New York may not have
taken a hint but Wil did.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.600
He switched over and took a
management training program

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.960
in a big department store
from which he was soon fired.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.230
He jokes he was reading
books in the stockroom

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.006
which may have been good
training for what came next.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.000
He figured if he couldn't make it

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.466
in retail he could
always try journalism.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.000
It was a goof fit.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.733
He worked his work for the
Charleston West Virginia Gazette,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.656
the Boston Globe, and for the
last 20 years or so for The Post

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.343
where he's now on a national staff.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.060
One of his unique talents
is describing the lives

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.233
that are the threads and
the tapestry of our times.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.126
Some like Sammy Davis Jr. and Adam
Clayton Powell Jr. are famous.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.516
Others are less so.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.383
Three days after President
Obama's inauguration,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.250
Wil wrote a memorable
profile of Eugene Allen,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.336
a black man as Wil put it, unknown
to the headlines who had never

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.470
in all his years serving as a White
House butler imagined he would see

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.616
someone who looked like
him in the White House.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.540
The book Wil will talk about
today is Sweet Thunder.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.750
His biography of Sugar Ray Robinson,
the boxer and cultural icon

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.763
and owner of a famous pink
Cadillac that I will let Wil explain

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.913
if he wishes, please
join me in welcoming Wil

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.560
to the national book festival.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.060
[ Applause ]

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.410
&gt;&gt; Thank you and welcome and
certainly on a day like this I know

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.626
that the executive editor of the
Washington Post has a million

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.503
and one things he could be doing, so
I'm quite touched that he took time

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.510
to come out here to introduce me.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.876
Somebody just asked me a
few minutes ago if I grew

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.823
up fighting in a gym, boxing.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.670


00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.223
And I've been trying to tell
ladies from the second grade

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.656
on that I consider myself much
more of a lover than a fighter.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.400
[ Laughter ]

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.486
&gt;&gt; But there was one experience
I had in the boxing ring

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.246
in my hometown in Columbus,
Ohio I was in the 16th grade

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.030
and somebody talked to me into
stepping into the boxing ring.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.470
I might make the team if I
was fast enough in the ring.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.343
And the other person hit me
very hard and I went down.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.270
And the pain went in one ear down
my back, down the back of my leg,

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.150
over to the other side of my body

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.416
and I'm still feeling
that pain today.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.170
So no, I never became a boxer, but I
had a lot of admiration for somebody

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.640
who had a life as fascinating
outside of the ring

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.926
as they did inside of the ring.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.310
And while this book is
a book about a fighter,

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.716
Sugar Ray Robinson it
really is much more it's a--

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.346
what I like to think it's
about as Langston Hues put it,

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.330
the sweet flypaper of life.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.526
Sugar Ray Robinson had 3
very dear friends in Harlem.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.466
They were Langston Hues,
Lena Horne, and Miles Davis.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.783
And a lot of this book is about
the wonderful cultural swirl

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.520
that Sugar Ray Robinson made happen.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.526
A lot of the night clubs in New
York City in the 30's and 40's

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.520
as you know were segregated

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.790
and so Sugar Ray Robinson took
it upon himself with his earnings

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.983
from the ring to build a nightclub
that was called Sugar Ray's.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.963
It was very elegant and folk
could come all races, all hues.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.133
They could come and sit down and not
worry about the color of their skin

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.343
and that in turn proved

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.833
to the wonderful Jazz giants
Duke Ellington, Sammy Davis Jr.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.493
who is an entertainer and others

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.506
that Sugar Ray's was the
place to be in Harlem.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.770
I went on a book tour and I'm
just gonna tell you about 2 things

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.753
that happened that standout
a great deal and made me know

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.153
that the 5 years I spent on
this book were well worth it.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.586
I was interviewing somebody and they
said you have to go find Mel Dick.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.166
And I said, who is Mel Dick?

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.830
And this person said "well, Mel Dick
knew Sugar Ray Robinson for many,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.640
many, man y years more than 35
years and he's some place in Florida

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.790
and you must find Mel Dick.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:14.556
It's going to add a lot to this
story that you're trying to tell.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.170
And so I was able to track Mel
Dick down in Miami, Florida

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.683
and this is Mel Dick's story.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.630
When he was 8 years old he
lived in Brooklyn, New York.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.296
He played hooky from school, he
went into New York City to a gym,

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.426
Steelman's gym where Sugar Ray
Robinson happen to be sparring.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.070
Now, Mel Dick is white, and he told
me this story when I found him,

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.296
and he was the lone white kid
in the gym that day just sitting

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.000
in the audience watching
Sugar Ray Robinson spar.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.403
He played hooky from school
and he didn't tell his mom

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.800
and dad where he was going.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.426
Sugar Ray Robinson noticed him
out on the corner of his eye

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.063
and after he was finished sparring,
he walked down and was talking

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.996
to the other people, and he bent
down and asked Mel Dick who he was.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.150
And he said, "Sir, my Melvin Dick,"
and he said, "Why are you here?

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.600
And where's your mom and dad?"

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.476
And he said, "Well, my mom
and dad they're at home

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.430
and they do not know that I'm here."

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.306
And Sugar Ray Robinson said,
"Well, why are you here?

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:45.430
For heaven's sake,
why are you here?"

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.983
And he looked up at Sugar
Ray Robinson and he said,

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.776
"Because you're my
hero, and I love you."

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.333
And for the next 45 years, Mel Dick

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:02.110
and Sugar Ray Robinson were
extremely, extremely close.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.540
Sugar Ray Robinson was the
best man at Mel Dick's wedding.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.670
Mel Dick was there along
with Miles Davis in 1965

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:18.103
when Sugar Ray Robinson at the age
of 40 plus fought his last bout

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:23.876
and it was just a beautiful moment
to find somebody from their youth

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.943
on up who had known
Sugar Ray Robinson.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.486
And the second great moment for
me as a writer happened in Ailey,

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.796
Georgia and that's where
Sugar Ray Robinson was born,

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.823
although he was only there for a few
months and then his family took him

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:46.110
up north in Michigan, and
then from Michigan to Harlem.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.816
And I went to Atlanta, Georgia on
the book tour to give a reading

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:59.323
and the Atlanta officials took me
the next morning to Ailey, Georgia.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.886
A little, small rural community
and I'm thinking as we're driving

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.346
over that goodness there might not
be anybody there for the simple fact

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.100
that Sugar Ray Robinson had
left when he was 4 months old.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.346
And we drive and we roll into this
little tiny town in a little library

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.326
on the side of the road
and they had a marquee.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.213
And on the marquee it said, "Ailey,
Georgia welcomes Wil Haygood."

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:43.316
That may be the only time in my life
that my name will be on a marquee.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.850
I appreciated it though.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.453
Now, there were--

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.320
[ Applause ]

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.320
&gt;&gt; There were about 125
people in the lot next

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.246
to this little library just milling
about, men, women, mostly men

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:04.766
and women and they
were milling about.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.760
And my thinking is that, "Gee,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.533
something must be going
on at the library.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.040
I wonder what it is."

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.963
And I got out of the
car and I was in a suit.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.333
If you're gonna write a book about
Sugar Ray Robinson, you have to go

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:26.886
out and buy some nice
suits for the simple fact

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.436
that Sugar Ray Robinson was a
very elegant guy dressed very

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:36.390
beautifully, wore pink Cadillac
I mean drove a pink Cadillac.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.226
It was an era of lushness, his life
was an era of just true elegance

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.863
and grace and lots of poetry.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.556
But anyway, a man in the
parking lot walks over to me

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.326
and he has a very deep
southern voice and says to me,

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.410
"Would you by any chance
be the author?"

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.266
And I said, "Well,
yes, sir, I am, I am."

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.833
And he said, wonderful.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:11.196
He said, "We're all Sugar
Ray Robinson's relatives

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.453
and we have come out to
walk you into the library."

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.840
And I was so, so very touched.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.530
It was just wonderful and when I
got into the library, you know,

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.100
I was just so enormously touched.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:37.523
I started reading and there were
about 130 seats, so it really was me

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:45.150
and Sugar Ray Robinson's family,
and I would read certain sections,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:45.986
and they would yell back at me.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.320
"That's right, Sugar.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.920
Hit him, Sugar.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.386
Amen, Lord have mercy.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.986
That's my sugar.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.786
That boy was something else.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.486
And I'm reading, I'm looking out
at them, really, oh wow, hey, Amen.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.286
Lord, hit him, Sugar."

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.553
So those two experiences were
worth being away, you know,

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:16.703
on your little book advance
that you get, you know,

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.730
hoping that your editor is gonna
welcome you back into the newsroom

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.243
after the several years of-- you
know of hard work on the book.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:35.850
But it has been worth it, and
ever-- every sense of the word.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:42.026
This is the final book of what I
like to think of as a trio of books

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.470
about unheralded or lost
figures you might say in history.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.850
There was Adam Clayton Powell,

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:52.416
there was Sammy Davis Jr.,
and Sugar Ray Robinson.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:59.283
They're are all figures who I think
put a little more of the red, white,

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:05.183
and blue in this country and
made a unique difference.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.736
So thank you, and I guess we'll
open it up for some questions.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:13.510
[ Applause ]

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.736
&gt;&gt; I was curious, how many
women played a serious,

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.373
significant role in his life?

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:29.573
&gt;&gt; In Sugar Ray Robinson's life?

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.106
&gt;&gt; Yes, his mother, Layla
Walker was a very fierce lady.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.846
Sugar Ray Robinson used to
go outside when he was a kid,

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.136
8 or 9 years old and
he would get beat up

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:47.886
and he would be crying
and he would go home.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.406
And his mother would say,
"Don't come in here crying.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.230
Go back outside and fight."

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.320
So in a real sense, his mother sort
of shoved him into the fight game.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:04.560
I think Sugar Ray Robinson if
he would have had his brothers,

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.010
he would have been an entertainer,
he actually left boxing for 3 years

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.070
and became a hoofer, a dancer.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:16.386
He wasn't very good at it and then
in 1954 he went back to fighting.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.526
But his mother was, you know,
very important in his psyche.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.040
&gt;&gt; Were there a lot of
women attracted to him?

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.066
Pursuing him [laughs].

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.266
&gt;&gt; Oh, oh ladies, ladies.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.616
You're talking about the
ladies in the nightclubs, okay.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:37.663
I was a little slow on that one.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:43.596
[Laughter] Okay, ahh, you know,
as with all flamboyant figures

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:52.170
and as Raymond Chandler once
put it, there's always a lady

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.343
in Sugar Ray Robinson's life.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.076
I think there were a
lot of women around,

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.440
although he only had two
marriages, and he died married

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:15.096
to his second wife, Millie,
out in Los Angeles so.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.093
Okay I'll go over here.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:20.626
&gt;&gt; First of all, thank you
very much for the book.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.380
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.923
&gt;&gt; I too idolized Sugar Ray
Robinson when I was a kid.

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:28.416
I still can't believe
he lost to Joey Maxim.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.630
But I wondered if you could
compare his cultural impact

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:37.823
with Muhammad Ali's?

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.343
&gt;&gt; Uhmm. Well, now I
mean, great question.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:47.123
I think one of the main reasons why
Sugar Ray Robinson somewhat got lost

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:52.700
in history was that another fighter
who fought in the 1960 Olympics

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.350
in Rome, he came along and
the TV age was just starting

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.816
to explode you might say.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:07.856
And Ali really, really sort of wiped
Sugar Ray Robinson from a lot of--

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.180
a lot of our-- not memory
but a lot of our visual love,

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:26.850
Sugar Ray Robinson should have been
on those night talk shows like,

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.583
you know, or the daytime talk shows
like Merv Griffin or Phil Donahue

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.103
or whatever you had
in the 60s and 70s.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:40.183
But then you had this huge figure, a
cultural bullet across our airways,

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:50.086
Ali, and in a way, Sugar Ray
Robinson receded he moved to L.A.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.016
and he started a youth
foundation which is--

00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.226
which was just wonderful because in
his youth foundation the kids could

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:04.740
do a lot.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:06.873
They could dance.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.806
They could play the
piano, badminton, checkers,

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.026
they could paint but
there was no boxing.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.593
There was no boxing.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:20.926
Sugar Ray Robinson did not want to
have a child get into a boxing match

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:28.080
and go home and not have a father
open the door and tell the son

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:30.193
that everything's going
to be all right

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.746
because Sugar Ray Robinson's
father was not under his roof.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:36.970
And so that's very telling and
actually that was one of the reasons

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:43.036
that made me want to
really write this book.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:43.770
Sugar Ray Robinson was a fighter.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:46.253
He founded a youth program and
you could do anything you wanted

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.180
to almost in that program
except box.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.900
Okay, I'll go over here.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.300
&gt;&gt; Okay, hi.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.300
Two questions.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.300
&gt;&gt; Uhmm.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.366
&gt;&gt; Maybe you've implicitly
answered it in terms

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:04.366
of the physical toll of boxing.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.366
We know football players have
serious problems like get banged

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:08.653
on the head and we've seen some
horrendous consequences of boxing.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:12.323
So I wanted to ask what Sugar
Ray thought about all that?

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.903
And if I could veer to Sammy
Davis Jr. and your other books,

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:24.950
what real depth of knowledge
did he have of Judaism?

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:25.370
He converted and that
was always talked about,

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:28.080
but I wonder what it
really meant to him in terms

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:30.720
if his knowledge and his commitment?

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.333
&gt;&gt; Okay, that question is you
know is just a big layered,

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.786
layered question and there's
not enough time to the answer.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.336
But you'll find the answer in a
book called, "In Black and White:

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.236
The Life of Sammy Davis Jr."

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.370
[ Laughter ]

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:56.370
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:57.770
&gt;&gt; Your first question about boxing.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:00.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.570
&gt;&gt; Sugar Ray Robinson I
think foresaw all of this

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:03.770
that boxing was a very brutal sport.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.903
In 1947 he went to Cleveland, Ohio
he fought a guy named Jimmy Doyle.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.740
Jimmy Doyle had suffered
some severe knockouts

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.090
in the State of California.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:19.873
He shouldn't have been
boxing in the State of Ohio,

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.153
but he was allowed to box.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.553
This was in 1947.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.940
Sugar Ray hit him with a punch
in the chin and it killed him.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:39.830
Sugar Ray was threatened with arrest
and a charge of manslaughter in 1947

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.333
and so he knew that
boxing took an awful toll

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.140
on fighters, but he
lived in America.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.220
It was segregated at the time.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.620
There was no jobs on Wall Street
for blacks, no jobs in banks, few,

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.480
few, few jobs in Hollywood.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.346
And so boxing was one way

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:09.316
where a black man could become
somewhat wealth, and so Joe Louis,

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:20.436
Henry Armstrong, other fighters
they took that risk knowing that.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.713
Now, I might add that after
Sugar Ray Robinson killed Doyle,

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:29.650


00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.326
he took a tour and fought
four times and raised money

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.306
because Doyle was fighting
to buy his mother a house,

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.540
and Sugar Ray was struck to the core

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:47.083
that Jimmy Doyle died fighting
to buy his mom a house.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.003
So Sugar Ray Robinson went
and fought four fighters

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:56.153
and they were tough fighters,
but he gave his winnings

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:56.676
to Jimmy Doyle's mother so
that she could buy her house.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:04.470
I just think it's a very touching
part of his life, his history.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.060
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.060
&gt;&gt; Over here.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.260
&gt;&gt; Hi Mr. Haygood.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.060
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:15.926
&gt;&gt; I like your point
about three of the kind

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:17.660
of forgotten people
in American history.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:19.260
I just finished a master's thesis

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:21.660
at Georgetown University
on Nathan Hale.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.793
One of the, I think forgotten
heroes of American history.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:28.450
My question is I don't
know if it's been asked

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.450
but who gave Sugar Ray's name?

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.406
Where did that come from?

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.410
&gt;&gt; Okay, great question.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.573
He was born Walker
Smith Jr. Walker Smith,

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:45.323
Jr. I think that the ladies liked
Sugar Ray Robinson a little more

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.476
than Walker Smith Jr. But
anyway, he was a young fighter

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.720
on a young boxing team based in
a church in Harlem and they went

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.216
into Watertown, New York to fight.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:05.243
He was just 15-years-old
and there was a fighter

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:09.543
on the team named Ray Robinson,
but Ray Robinson got sick

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.836
and so young Walker
asked the manager,

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.133
George Gainford, if he could go on.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.923
If he fight in Ray
Robinson's-- his place.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.973
George Gainford didn't
think he was good enough,

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.956
but the young Walker
Smith browbeating

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:30.910
in the locker rooms said,
"Coach, please, let me fight.

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.630
Please I'm ready."

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:39.096
Walker Smith fights but George
Gainford, the manager has

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.490
to change the name
on the fight card.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:49.110
He has to-- he doesn't have an extra
fight card so he uses the fight card

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:54.023
that said Ray Robinson, and he told
the referee that the kid stepping

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.496
into the ring now is Ray Robinson.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.260
So he fought and he
knocked the other kid out.

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.976
I mean, boom, boom, boom.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.510
His skill was apparent even then.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:13.086
There was a sports editor named Jack
Case from the Watertown newspaper.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:18.976
Jack Case asked the manager,
Gainford, who was that fighter

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.403
and because he sure is sweet.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:23.540
And he said, "Well, his
name is Ray Robinson."

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.400
When Jack Case hustles
back into the newsroom,

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.040
he makes up the name
Sugar, sweet as sugar.

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:38.296
So he makes up the name, Sugar
Ray Robinson scores knockout

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.626
at arena and the name stuck.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:44.030
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.030
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yes.

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:51.096
&gt;&gt; Hi, at one time professional
boxers were really at the core

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.430
of the American consciousness.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.746
They were the real cultural icons.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.346
Joe Louis, Sugar Ray
Robinson, Muhammad Ali.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.330
I have to admit, I haven't a clue

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.373
who the heavyweight
boxing champion is today.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:11.490
What has happened that there's
no longer Sugar Ray Robinson's

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.590
or at least Sugar Ray
Robinson coming out of boxing?

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:18.563
&gt;&gt; Well, I think that in the
40's and the 50's boxing was

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.063
like NCAA football is now.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.080
It was epic.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.346
There were fights fought outdoors,
there were stadiums that were,

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:39.076
you know, full of people,
100,000 people.

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.113
They were fought at night.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.313
It was stunning to see
two figures in a ring.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.580
Radio was big.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.023
The rivalries were big.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:56.073
Joe Louis, Mash Melling [phonetic],
Jake LaMotta, Sugar Ray Robinson;

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:00.396
these figures were sort
of larger than life,

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.260
and I think because of the simple
fact that we have more sports now

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:11.336
that are seen by more people and
the fight game has suffered so much

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:18.220
as far as integrity, honor-- it's
just really suffered something

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.340
that it hasn't been
able to come back from,

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.066
and thus we really don't
follow fighters the way we used

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.886
to follow fighters in
the 50's and the 60's.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.700
And I mean that was
one reason why I wanted

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:47.790
to spend years unraveling
Sugar Ray Robinson's life.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.716
He was a big, big deal in
the 40's, 50's, and 60's

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.676
and yet he sort of vanished.

00:25:55.770 --> 00:26:00.170
And I just think that we found
other sports to watch and, you know,

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:08.870
so many comically and tragic
things have happened with fighters,

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:17.043
heavyweight fighters especially over
the last 15 years that it's hard

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.396
to sometimes take it seriously.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.330


00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:24.570
&gt;&gt; Okay. I'll go over here.

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:25.970
&gt;&gt; Hi Mr. Haygood.

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:27.770
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:30.503
&gt;&gt; Just first of all I want
to say congratulations to you

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:32.736
for being nominated for the 2010
Hurston/Wright Award for nonfiction

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:33.403
for your book and also for the--

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.270
[ Applause ]

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:38.270
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.870
&gt;&gt; Also for being nominated
or being a runner up rather

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:42.003
for the PEN/ESPN award
for sports writing.

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.603
Thank you very much.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.270
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:49.070
&gt;&gt; I really enjoy the book.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:50.403
I'm a writer so I'm gonna
ask a writer question.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.270
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:55.670
&gt;&gt; All of your biographies, they're
so nuanced and their so layered

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:57.803
and you give us so many things about
so many people in Sweet Thunder.

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.440
We found out not only about Sugar
Ray Robinson but we also found

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.300
about Lena Horne, Miles Davis.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.166
I mean you were able
to put so much into it.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:03.573
How do you keep all those thousands
of bits of information flowing

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:07.410
to be able to make a
really coherent and inviting

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.566
for the reader; first question.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.586
Second question is what
are you working on now?

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.276
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:19.210
Thank you so much.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.276
She said some wonderful
things that I swear I hope

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.266
that all the people
back in the 5th grade

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.653
who said I would never
amount to anything.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.680
I hope they heard that and I hope
their watching C-span today and--

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:33.560
[ Applause ]

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.626
&gt;&gt; I hope that they heard that.

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:41.510
Anyway, these figures, and it's
interesting when I wanted to,

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.520
you know, like have Lena
Horne and Miles Davis

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.093
and Langston Hughes swirling
throughout the narrative.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.800
My editor, Peter, gathers
wondered if it would work.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.060
And I said, well, let me
write the first 50 pages

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:06.743
and I think you'll see
what I'm trying to do.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:12.656
And you know, they all were
of the same time periods.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:16.963
You know, and they all, you know,
sort of flourished and worked

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:24.203
in Harlem and so that made it easier
but I did have a wall in my home

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:33.456
and up on the wall it
would say something

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.400
like Sugar Ray Robinson, 1947.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.206
And then I would have a
big piece of wall paper

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.676
and it would ask me I
would write the question,

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.160
what is Lena doing in 1947?

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.946
And then under that I would ask
the question where is Miles Davis

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:03.526
at in 1947 and then I would say
where is Langston Hughes at in 1947?

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:09.483
And then you know it skips ahead
and then I bring the reader

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.486
up to what Langston and Lena

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.593
and Miles are doing
say in 1953, you know.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:22.356
And so I knew that every--
every 50 pages or so I wanted

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:32.323
to remind the reader that there's
this wonderful cultural swirl

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:35.820
going on.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.820
It really is a book about
all the things going

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.140
on outside of the boxing ring.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:49.816
You know if you think it's
only a book about violence

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:52.763
and blood and boxing, it is not.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:59.166
It really is a book about
poetry, about music, about dance,

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:04.196
about night life, about
nightclubs, about New York City,

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:06.990
about Los Angeles, about Chicago.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.726
It's a book about America
and how she danced and sang

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.440
with these people in the
middle of the spokes wheel.

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:23.416
Okay, question over here?

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:25.396
Sorry I can't hear.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.366
Something is wrong.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.900
&gt;&gt; Hi, can you hear me now?

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.433
&gt;&gt; Yeah there we go.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.100
I'm a big fan.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.100
Thank you, you always
gift us with your words.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.700
I have a quick question.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.100
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.233
&gt;&gt; Which is just how do you choose
your subjects for biography?

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.366
Adam Clayton Powell, you
know, Sugar Ray Robinson,

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.433
Sammy Davis Jr. just wondering
what is it that a figure would have

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.566
to possess to get Wil Haygood
to take on their lives?

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:51.700
And then I will cede
the rest of my time

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:53.633
to the gentlewoman
from North Carolina.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.766
&gt;&gt; My quick question is why
did you become a journalist,

00:30:58.930 --> 00:30:58.970
and how has that training affected
the books that you've written

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:03.290
like the Sugar Ray Robinson book?

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:06.356
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:08.690
Last questions over here

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:12.223
and the first one how did
i choose the subjects?

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:17.550
Real quick answer, New York
Congressman, Adam Clayton Powell,

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:23.050
was you know a force on the hill.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.893
He went to congress in
1944 and left in 1970.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.400
He was big on the student loan
program and I would not have gone

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:42.030
to college were it not for the
student loan program and so

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:42.473
in the back of my mind, I just said

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.873
to myself one day many
years ago I simply wanted

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:51.223
to pay a debt back to
Adam Clayton Powell.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.496
And you know, it really was
a dream as simple as that

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.330
and so that's how that
book was birthed.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.566
Sammy Davis Jr. when
I was little growing

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.946
up in the 60s there was
not very many blacks on TV

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:09.666
and Sammy Davis Jr. was one of
those figures who was my mother

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:12.726
and my grandmother who raised me,
they would call me in the house

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:20.820
and say, "Sammy Davis Jr. is on
TV, Sammy Davis Jr. is on TV"

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.566
and so he meant something to them.

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:31.090
And so I just sort of told myself it
would be interesting to write a book

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.426
about Sammy Davis Jr. some day.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:37.316
These are figures who happened
to have had a lot of scandal

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.766
in their lives and they were
sort of burdened with scandal and

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:45.313
yet there was something heroic
about Adam Clayton Powell,

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:48.993
Sammy Davis Jr. and
Sugar Ray Robinson.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:51.090
I told you at the beginning
about the punch that I took

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:54.923
that I'm still feeling, so
I wrote this book to figure

00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.776
out where that punch came from.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:32:59.753
Thank you very much.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
