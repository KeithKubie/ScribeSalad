Speaker 1:          00:00          This listening to radio lab radio from W. N y. S? Yup. N. N. P. R. Okay. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. We are super, super excited to talk with you. Oh, same in me. I'm sorry about the delay and so, oh, that's fine. No, it's a busy day. Life is crazy. Life is crazy. I know. But uh, you were so enthusiastic, so I just, I need to talk to these guys. They really mean it. This is Alex Alexandre Gumbo, Gumbo, Ma. Are you Norwegian all the way back? Yeah. Typical Norwegian, you know, if typical includes things like biking Sahara and climbing Everest and things like that. He's kind of a professional adventurer and we got him into the studio because he made a video last year on one of his trips. Get tell you this video. It's maybe the most amazing Internet video I've ever seen. I think so too.

Speaker 1:          01:04          So let me just set the scene for you. Okay. What you see in the video is this Guy Alex kind of moving along this, he's on skis, this snowy snow scape [inaudible] he's filming himself. He's got the camera in his right hand. Where is he exactly? Antarctica. Oh, he's on a three month track to the South Pole and back by himself. And what he'd been doing is every couple of days on his trip, you know, everybody 200 kilometers. And so he would bury stuff in the snow, some, some fuel and uh, and sometimes a little bit of gear that I didn't use. Was that just to lighten your load? Yeah. You know, cause every ounce of unneeded weight has to go. So in this video, it's date 86, almost three months since I left. That's three months of walking 10 hours a day and I lost almost 25 kilos. 55 pounds. He's exhausted.

Speaker 2:          01:50          Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:56          he's come upon his last cash. So on the last cash where this video is captured, what you see is Alex Neil and the snow start to dig. [inaudible] I'm telling you that I'm quite hungry. Whatever's in this last cash in the snow, it's been three months since he buried it. So I didn't really recall what was there. [inaudible] he helps it sound good. Cool. So he digs up this bag of stuff, starts rifling through it. There's ticket and [inaudible] gasoline, some zinc ointment. It's just a mess.

Speaker 2:          02:37          Nothing. It's pretty much all press down.

Speaker 1:          02:40          Excuse me. That awesome bro. But then Yup.

Speaker 3:          02:54          Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:55          yeah. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:02          he holds up good. [inaudible] devil back of cheese doodles. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:12          then he throws it up in the air. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:17          and then this is, this is my favorite part. He just freezes and he's staring off into the distance. Almost like, did that happen? [inaudible] killer. Is it real?

Speaker 5:          03:33          Okay,

Speaker 1:          03:33          so he starts to dig some more and then

Speaker 4:          03:39          bye.

Speaker 3:          03:44          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          03:44          What's it? This huge chocolate bar. It's milk chocolate and then it's just like he finds the Mentos I find more and more and

Speaker 4:          04:00          Lauren Woo.

Speaker 1:          04:00          Have you ever been that happy in your life? Well, I've been thinking about that. How? When did you shout last time you were so happy.

Speaker 1:          04:09          I think that's why we've been watching this video over and over again because none of us can remember. It's like what stands between you and that feeling is a really interesting question. Yeah. It's a free mounts with hunger. Actually, I think the reason I liked this video so much is not just because he's happy. He said he somehow stumbled into this moment of perfection. It's just like a perfect situation by being so tired and so hungry and finding such a stash of candy that he had forgotten to, he left. He created a moment of just absolute complete bliss.

Speaker 5:          04:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:53          [inaudible] in this hour on radio lab, we're going to be searching for moments like Alex had up in Antarctica. We're going to be searching for bliss, bliss of all different sorts,

Speaker 6:          05:05          perfect moments, perfect worlds kind of blistered slips right through your fingers and the kind of bliss that just might last. And last,

Speaker 1:          05:21          right? We're going to begin with a story that, uh, kind of inspired this show. We would have never done a show about the word bliss, where it, not for the following story, which is about a bliss. A, what do you mean a better? That'll make sense in just a second. A story comes from our producer Tim Howard, and it begins with a box of tapes. Uh, alright. So check it out. This is in my office. And you've got a rectangular package here. What is, what is a very old looking box? It doesn't look like much. It's just about like 15 cassettes. Tape number six, singing and playing to friends in America. [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          06:00          okay, so this is Charles, Charles Casey. You'll bliss in both an amazing character. And that's Richard. Richard [inaudible]. He's a fellow who gave me the cassettes. He was a friend of Charles. Yeah. So these were just like sitting in his attic or something, garage. He looked like, I suppose a little known him, a little Leprechaun, almost [inaudible] he was short, bald and laughter the whole time. [inaudible] it's a lovable character. Simple as that. This is my favorite one. Gay Nicholas. Yet we just like, just explain why we're talking about this guy. Sure. Because these tapes tell an amazing story about a guy who really embodied

Speaker 8:          06:41          his name and he tried to save the world, but ultimately just tried too hard.

Speaker 9:          06:50          Fall into that void in my life. K in grade eight

Speaker 7:          06:53          we can start the story here. This is from a lecture that he gave decades later. So the story goes, it's 1908 and he's a little kid living in what's now the Ukraine. Okay. And His name is Carl Blitz, not Charles list, not Charles Bliss, Carl Blitz, B. L. I. T. Z. That's his original name and a little Carl was fascinated by tales of discovering adventure. My name is Erika Okrent. Erica wrote about Charles Bliss and there's a great book called in the land of invented languages. Getting back to the story one day, she says, when Carl was 11 a lecture came through town about some

Speaker 9:          07:32          Austin polar expedition,

Speaker 7:          07:33          polar expedition, two explorers talking about their trek across the North Pole and he was so inspired by what he saw and heard at that lecture did. Even decades later, he couldn't talk about it

Speaker 9:          07:45          and my father took me through this. I shoot me without getting choked up. [inaudible] my father took me to this lecture and fed. I show Nay who left? One Rose, just Jessica CUNY sisters. And when all people got into the ice and snow in on almost chipping this bull walk for a walk. We're in search of knowledge for a idea

Speaker 7:          08:16          as he tells it on those tapes. That was the beginning of his big idea that was going to change the world. Fast forward a few years,

Speaker 9:          08:24          they came to Ghana after the first girl who did end up going to the Technical University of Vienna. I was suddenly discovered to be the best mandolin player in Australia. And one time I played with a full opera orchestra under the action as a composer Francesca. Uh, so those were the days

Speaker 7:          08:43          and then everything changed. In 1938

Speaker 5:          08:52          [inaudible] across the Austrian border,

Speaker 8:          08:54          the Nazis came to town, Nazis came to town, he was sent to Depauw and then Buchenwald you know, the concentration camps,

Speaker 9:          09:04          feelings won't be shown desire to end my life

Speaker 8:          09:08          all around him. People were being worked to death or outright exterminated, but his wife Claire was a German Catholic with connections

Speaker 9:          09:16          and clear am I good vibes, sluggish, my mandoline and my guitar into the concentration game.

Speaker 10:         09:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          09:23          I became so famous amongst notches. For instance, I blocked fear would come into [inaudible]. I can say bitch [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          09:32          and you could say that it was here in book and wall that Carl started to develop his ideas about language, about the ways that you can manipulate words. For instance, there was this one song that all the prisoners saying, Yep,

Speaker 9:          09:44          well who fleet one of the [inaudible] songs? I can ever mean

Speaker 8:          09:48          the saddest lyrics in the world. At a certain point, Carl started to play around with this song. You know, he'd swap out some of the sad lyrics for some jokes, sing it for his fellow prisoners,

Speaker 9:          09:57          and then laughed and laughed and laughed and for God for a few minutes that the orange of darkest and the most terrible [inaudible].

Speaker 8:          10:06          And on the flip side, every evening the guards would march all the prisoners outside, force them to stand there in the cold, in front of these loudspeakers, make them listen to these speeches.

Speaker 9:          10:16          Wow.

Speaker 8:          10:18          Speeches of Hitler and Gerbils screaming Nazi slogan.

Speaker 9:          10:25          Yes.

Speaker 8:          10:25          Which means Germany above all

Speaker 9:          10:28          did I say I got to start with the rice bags [inaudible] words, which [inaudible] which does you mean? But

Speaker 8:          10:37          after about a year, his wife somehow wrangled a a British visa for him and he gets out,

Speaker 9:          10:44          thank heavens those dreadful times are gone and now I can play here for you and improvisation as it comes into my mind. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         10:52          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          10:52          in 1939 he went to Britain,

Speaker 9:          10:55          then got a job as a manager of [inaudible],

Speaker 8:          10:57          but he arrived in England just as

Speaker 5:          11:03          [inaudible].

Speaker 8:          11:03          The blitz begins, the German start to bomb every major city in England.

Speaker 10:         11:07          The noise did you hear at the moment is the sound of air raid siren

Speaker 8:          11:11          and every time he'd introduce himself to somebody new they shutter, that can't be your name. Yeah. Because of like blitzkrieg good to have that associate. Yes.

Speaker 9:          11:21          God going off, he had a good business was named like blitz and so I changed from the war, like rich to the peace for base.

Speaker 8:          11:32          That was how he became Charles Bliss. Bliss has all the right associations. So he went forward with the feeling of that he was now bliss and would bring happiness to the world. And a year later, he and his wife ended up in China and Shanghai where there was a big population of Xcel, Jews. Shanghai was the only place that would take them at that

Speaker 11:         11:53          time. And they're in China. And then in China, I got Joe Opportunity of my lifetime and now we come to his big idea. I realize what I did not know that the Chinese have a different way of, right. He became enraptured by the Chinese writing that he saw

Speaker 8:          12:14          the Chinese use symbols and each symbol is a word. And he writes about having this epiphany when he started the Chinese symbol for man,

Speaker 11:         12:22          he saw that the Chinese written form of man sort of looks like a man.

Speaker 8:          12:27          It looks like a stick figure man. And it means man, he doesn't even know what the Chinese word for man is. He doesn't know how to say man, but that doesn't matter. He is skipping the word and going directly into the meaning.

Speaker 11:         12:39          So here was a way of getting beyond language. You could think of the word in any language if you see it in the symbol

Speaker 8:          12:46          was a revelation. Why? Well,

Speaker 9:          12:50          Gotcha.

Speaker 8:          12:51          I mean, think back to the concentration camps when they were outside in front of those loudspeakers listening to Hitler's saying stuff like,

Speaker 9:          12:58          no. [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          13:01          Paralis you know, Germany above all that phrase [inaudible] Charles knew that it actually predated the Nazi.

Speaker 9:          13:09          That was cool a hundred years earlier in 1848

Speaker 8:          13:14          and originally it was meant as a rallying cry to bring together all of these separate principalities.

Speaker 9:          13:19          You see the robot where you can't go book structure, you can

Speaker 8:          13:22          that spoke German, but these were not one country. So when they said Deutschland Alice, it meant university

Speaker 9:          13:28          unified Germany,

Speaker 8:          13:30          the nation above the states. Oh, suit wasn't necessarily an aggressive thing. Yeah,

Speaker 9:          13:34          no, but Hitler turn this around.

Speaker 8:          13:38          Hitler changes the meaning instead of the nation above all states. He changed it to the nation.

Speaker 9:          13:43          Never seen. You've got all the conditional, the word bubble,

Speaker 8:          13:46          all other nations. So you'd see what happened. This phrase that started meaning one thing, unification. Yeah, became the opposite. Yeah. This is what the Nazis did.

Speaker 11:         13:57          Yours works nice.

Speaker 8:          14:00          It would bend words to obscure the truth of what they were doing. Extermination did call it solution. By doing that. As he saw it, they were able to convince good, sane people, his neighbors to go along with the genocide. [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         14:16          and I realized that [inaudible] must be done to make language more to it. The nature words were the problem. Words made people do cruel things to each other. They bear our society apart. Words were dangerous instruments. They caused violence. They cause wars. So when he saw the Chinese symbol for man, he thought this might be the answer. And that idea came up to me that I would should invent shimmers like the Chinese symbols, but even clearer, he just show simple and pictorial that even children can read them. If he could sit down and work it out. You look at the symbol and know what it meant instantly, regardless of what language you spoke, you wouldn't even need words which he felt could be manipulated. You could just have the symbol and get straight to the truth of the manner and the way he saw it. Right off the bat, you'd have all of these benefits.

Speaker 11:         15:08          Freshmen didn't finish English when an Estonian language barriers would be out the window. Everything from traffic accidents to health problems could be avoided. He thought if his symbol system would just be adopted. He had this vision that high level political and commercial negotiations would be done in symbols. Did he say anything as grand as like or wouldn't happen constantly and even of course he reckon Hitler wouldn't have happened basically that if the German people had understood the symbols, they wouldn't have copped gerbils propaganda. That's a pretty tall order, but it did seem to be what he thought. Everything could be cured by the system.

Speaker 7:          15:46          He's the biggest dreamer ever. Yeah. How did he go about doing this?

Speaker 11:         15:50          He started working out with the basic lines and shapes would be, he also wanted to make sure you could produce it with a typewriter, so it had to be a limited set of shapes out of which everything could be created.

Speaker 7:          16:03          Okay, so he works on it for seven years, seven years, and he comes up with that. Wow. That is a big way. This massive book called list symbolics, Symantec ology illogical writing for an illogical world. It says it all where he explains the logic of his system. For example here, here's a symbol for sword, which looks exactly like a sword. And then the sword plus a forward Arrow means attack. I buy it. And then if you see a symbol for sword and another symbol for sword and they're cross, that means war. So that's the idea that you take these basic elemental symbols and combine them. Exactly. All right. Here's another one. This symbol here is like the top half of a circle, like a little rainbow, but just one line that means mind, mind, it looks like the top of his skull. Ah. Now if I were to take that symbol for mind and I were to go like this or to put inside it, the question mark, that means, um, I don't know or I have no doubt.

Speaker 7:          17:05          And, and there are also, you know, ways to indicate verbs and adjectives and first person, second person, the past, the future. But kind of the one thing that it did that no other language or symbol system or anything is attempted to do, at least as far as I know, is that it would make clear when something was, um, well, he called the human evaluation, you know, basically an opinion. And what you would do is you'd put this a little, this little v symbol and you put it above this symbol and y, y v. Well, because you know, a v is balanced on a point and it's unstable at wobbles to him. That represents opinion's human evaluations. Anything that comes out in the mind or take metaphors [inaudible] the top four is he says, you must put up the [inaudible] sign to alert the reader. Do not take this. Literally stop [inaudible] not exactly bulletproof, but I can, I can see the, the thinking there. I actually think it's pretty impressive and okay, so what happens next? Well after he finishes this and he and his wife are living in Australia at the time, they spent all their savings on producing this book and sent it out to professors, government officials, heads of state, something like 6,000 people. And they waited for the orders to start rolling in and um, no response from anybody. And then they had nothing.

Speaker 6:          18:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          18:37          I can't say. I didn't see that coming. Yeah. And with great disappointment, Charles went to work as a welder and yeah,

Speaker 1:          18:45          factory at General Motors. Holden's he was working on the production line almost as a robot.

Speaker 7:          18:53          And a year later his wife died. You know, he had fought in world war one. He had been in a concentration camp. He had lived in exile, but he says this was the lowest point of his life until one day, 1971 this, as he said, this letter floated onto his desk

Speaker 8:          19:15          with this picture of this beautiful dimpled child. Proudly using his symbols.

Speaker 7:          19:24          Yeah,

Speaker 8:          19:25          it was a poster, a poster, a poster. This is Shirley, Shirley McNaughton and at the time she was a nurse at a place called D o c c c the Ontario crippled children's

Speaker 7:          19:38          center and named that we were very happy to leave behind us and they've since changed in the name. I started there in 1968 and Shirley was part of this group of teachers and nurses who worked with these kids who suffered from cerebral palsy. If you have cerebral palsy, it's the motor control from the brain that's been affected, which meant that they had trouble moving their arms or legs and even in some cases they couldn't speak. They couldn't form words

Speaker 1:          20:08          and then a film that was made of this class. You see these young kids, children from five to seven I'll sitting in wheelchairs and they're watching the teacher. She talks to them and you hear them try to talk to her, but they can. These kids had no way to communicate. Couldn't they learn how to [inaudible]? I read.

Speaker 7:          20:33          They could if you knew what they were understanding and they have no way to communicate that to you. The only thing all these kids had were pictures that they could point at. They had a picture of a toilet, picture of food, picture of a drink, a of a bed. They were limited to that kind of communication. But I knew they were bright. But if they couldn't move and they couldn't speak, how would you know? My uh, insight on that was the twinkle in their eyes. But she says a lot of doctors and nurses at the time thought I was crazy that there really wasn't much going on inside these kids' heads. You know, they thought I was projecting into the children what she needed. She said was a way to get through to them. And so one day she was at the library with a colleague and they come across this dusty old volume that had never been checked out, called, you guessed it, lists symbol, likes and what did you first think when you saw it?

Speaker 7:          21:27          Oh boy, can I get back to the group? How fast can I get back to the group with this exactly what we need. So do you remember what the first symbols were? I think it was I you, I looked kind of like a standing person. Upright line, small horizontal line at the base. Yep. Next to it, the number one, which means first person you as the same symbol but with a number two for a second person and then they had to have a verb and it was long heart with an air threat. So now they've got a sentence. I love you. One of our mothers, since the happiest moment she's ever had with her child was when her child came home and said, I love you. You know, so

Speaker 5:          22:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          22:12          surely and her staff started to add more symbol. They caught on and pretty soon they'd created this giant laminated chart. It had I and you and he, she, we and they, then it had mother, father, grandma, grandpa, doctor, nurse, teacher, therapist, postman, environment, library, dentist. Eventually they added adjectives, happy, sad and frustrated. All the verbs who had loved and liked and hey, want ni understand. Pretty soon the kids started to do amazing things with symbol combinations. They started to improvise. Shirley remembers asking one kid, Terry Martin, what did you want to be? Refer Halloween. Terry pointed first at the symbol for creature, a creature, not a person. Then he pointed at a symbol for drinks. Then blood night creature who drinks blood at night. Right. You want it to be of par. Ah, he spelled a new word.

Speaker 7:          23:10          It sounds like an explosion with these kids. It was. It was for the first time. She says she could actually talk to them like know who they were. Yeah. You've got to know who the leaders were in the classroom. Those who wanted to help others, those who copied others. And it was around then that she and the other teachers decided to send Charles Bliss. That letter. We were sharing our excitement for this gift deed given to the children. You know, he was in Australia, he was an elderly man. We had no thought that he would come and visit us, you know, didn't enter our mind. But Charles Bliss, he was delighted.

Speaker 12:         23:51          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          23:52          he had battled for so long, had recognition and now he headed,

Speaker 12:         23:57          yeah,

Speaker 1:          23:57          mortgages, his house and it flies over. Heavy, bad debt. Paid my mandolin and told him jokes and only he dances around and kisses everybody a Fusilli than laughter. I love that. Hello?

Speaker 7:          24:10          We had long conversations with the kids in symbols,

Speaker 12:         24:14          right? He was very happy about the children. Joy, joy,

Speaker 7:          24:21          okay. But somewhere along the way, he noticed this something surely, surely and the teachers had begun to

Speaker 5:          24:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          24:32          augment the system. They'd be going to add their own symbols such as the opposite meaning symbol. This allowed the kids to take one implicit standard symbols and just invert the meaning, opposite of happy, sad, opposite of uptown, opposite of Ian, out in to her. This would effectively double the number of adjectives which would be great for the kids and we developed rules for how to combine symbols for how to be more precise with the symbols. She thrown some new pronouns that we're missing. The difference between he and him and his. In short, I would make the adaptations I needed to make from the very beginning. We were using it to meet the children's needs, their specific needs, and of course that is not what he had in his mind. He wanted a system that was universal. Every change that she made created like a, a separate dialect. He would get very emotional about it. So when he got back to Australia, he started writing all these letters basically taking issue with her changes and her failure to understand how his system works. Meanwhile, thanks to Shirley, worried about blesses symbols had spread way beyond Canada too.

Speaker 1:          25:45          France, Sweden, Israel, Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe. Yeah. And then Argentina, Brazil, Finland, Iceland, Italy, Bermuda, Guam, Japan, Portugal, Spain, Netherlands, Hungary, Switzerland, Venezuela, Madagascar, Yugoslavia. It's spread to all these places. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          26:05          And in each place, the symbols bin Inevitably get tweaked to suit that country. For example, in Israel because the writing goes from right to left. Yeah. The bliss symbols went from right to left. Uh, but what really pained him the most, what really got him was that these teachers were using his symbols as a step toward English or French or German or Hebrew or whatever. It was just a way to get the kids to their native languages. The teachers always saw it the way they saw it. You start the kids on bliss and then you introduce reading and letters and eventually they're fully literate. At which point you don't need the bliss symbols. This was the ultimate insult to him. They were using his system to bring these kids back to the very thing that he was trying to get everyone away from evil words. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          26:55          why not? Why not?

Speaker 7:          26:58          If I tried to explain it to them, they don't want donation to me, then look, show me what should I do? I do that. I don't know [inaudible] and it's right about this point in the story that you start to hear a different Charles Place.

Speaker 9:          27:14          Shannon, if Norton has better that it never has been better than [inaudible].

Speaker 7:          27:19          Is he saying perverted? Yeah,

Speaker 9:          27:21          she smiles. She be guys. She she lies.

Speaker 7:          27:25          He kept sending Shirley and the other teachers letters and the letters got angrier. An angrier. This was not what the language was for. This was a universal language that had nothing to do with spoken language. You are ruining my system. You are abusing it and eventually he decided to take matters into his own hands and he traveled back to Canada and he started going to the various centers where the kids were using his symbols and seeing horrible things about me. Uh, and getting them very upset. That's when I got upset. I got upset when he got them upset. Not long after Shirley receives a summit I have taken to court. She, oh she, she in Dubuque. He sued them. Yeah. I added two more dependents. Ms Jalen ignored on the tapes, even suggest that he's going to have surely put away, put a whole knife for life.

Speaker 7:          28:15          Wow. Why was he so upset with her in particular? Well, because by this time she'd started the international organization, BCI Bliss Symbol, communications international, and she felt like this was a total unique and powerful tool which could, could and should transform lives around the world and more teachers needed to adopt it. Definitely. What was he asking for? Did he wanted us to use the symbols in his way? So in 1975 the BCI won a license agreement to use the symbols in the workbooks for the kids. But Charles Bliss, they should all be part, didn't give up, should all the part, he published endless tirades and sent them out to anybody who is listening. Please should note and hopefully to educate or oppose you, the patient. What was the question was just all in all this went on for over a decade and the administration of the program or surely was working was desperate to make him go away. He had basically destroyed the program. And so in 1982 he and the BCI finally come to an agreement.

Speaker 2:          29:24          Yeah.

Speaker 7:          29:24          It was a financial settlement that satisfied him. What was the financial settlement? $160,000.

Speaker 2:          29:33          Wow.

Speaker 7:          29:35          You know, we were a little program in the basement of the Ontario cripple children's center. We were, you know, just a classroom. Wow. That, so a guy who wanted to save the world ends up robbing a bunch of disabled kids. I mean, that's kind of putting it crudely, but that's how this, how it feels. Yeah. Basically that's the, yeah.

Speaker 5:          30:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         30:02          did the symbols ever go anywhere? Well, there was a lot of excitement about it in the beginning, but it never spread very far. It's used now at a few schools in Canada and Sweden, a couple other places. Uh, but it never went very far because he was constantly taking it down at every turn.

Speaker 5:          30:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          30:23          but here's what I find most surprising. When I, when I talked to Shirley, she didn't have any bitterness toward him. Not even in the worst moments when we were having the final legal, um, action. We'd go through that in the morning and as the players were packing up their papers, Charles Bliss would reach across the table and he'd say, surely will you help me? And so she'd go to lunch with him, sit with him, and then he asked me if I would come to his hotel that night and put the eardrops in his ears. And I did that every night. He was involved with this thing. That's just the way it was. And it wasn't just that she takes care of people for a living, you know, she, she felt and still feels that Charles Bliss had created something really new in the world. She even told me that when she uses blessed symbols, she actually thinks differently. Yes, definitely. Really, definitely. What's different? Oh, I just think so much more about what a word means and it, it's, it's like poetry in its purest form.

Speaker 5:          31:35          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          31:36          um, well I've been playing with stained glass down here in my retirement and you can, you know, you can just take the symbols and put them into one composite and they say things that only art can say. It's beautiful. They transmit a meaning that is beyond any words.

Speaker 6:          32:08          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]
