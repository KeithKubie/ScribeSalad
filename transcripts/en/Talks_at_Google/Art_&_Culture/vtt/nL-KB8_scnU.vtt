00:00:04.702 --> 00:00:07.160
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Please put
your hands together, welcome

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.214
to the stage Mr. Wyclef Jean.

00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:12.704
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.744
WYCLEF JEAN: Y'all good?

00:00:33.744 --> 00:00:34.660
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.270
WYCLEF JEAN: Sorry
for the shades.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.741
I'm a little smoked out.

00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:42.126
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.271
Cool one, two.

00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:50.770
Yeah.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.477
So could you turn
the mic up a little?

00:00:57.477 --> 00:00:58.310
Just for me, thanks.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.960
Yeah.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.640
So it's an honor to be
here with y'all at Google.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.410
And I was sitting over there.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.660
I was like, "man, I was such
a bad student in school.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.920
I don't know how this happened."

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.570
So I was coming here, and
I had my two guitar cases,

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.270
and dude's like,
"yo, this is Wyclef,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.395
where are your bodyguards?

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:19.270
You know what I mean?

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.940
And I'm like, "dude,
I'm from Brooklyn.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.240
What can a bodyguard do for me?

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.760
I needed the bodyguard when
I was in the projects."

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.930
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.520
I'm good now.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.780
But I move like this
because in my mindset,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.510
where I come from
being born in Haiti

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.260
and having the chance
to come to America,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.790
getting that chance to
experiment the American Dream,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.800
the reality of being famous
till today has not struck me.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.210
You know what I mean?

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.730
But two things have
made me realize

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.710
that I'm kind of famous.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.670
So the first thing that made
me realize I'm kind of famous

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.460
was when Young Thug was
tracking Lyor Cohen down.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.759
Like, "yo, you gotta
find me Wyclef Jean.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.310
I need Wyclef Jean now!"

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.121
And I'm like, "why is
Thugga looking for me?"

00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:14.620
Man.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.810
Just you know?

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.120
And then I get with
Thugga, and he's

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.850
like, "yo, you know you're one
of my greatest inspirations.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.750
You know my tattoo says Haiti,
my daughter named Haiti.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.204
I wish I was from Haiti, man!"

00:02:29.204 --> 00:02:31.550
So I was like "OK, cool."

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.790
So and then he named
the song "Wyclef Jean."

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.790
And the second thing
that occurred to me

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.670
was a couple of weeks ago I
get stopped by the police.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.380
I get cuffed.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.550
And as I'm being
cuffed, I'm like "yo,

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.170
my name is Wyclef Jean."

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.670
"Yeah.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.253
Yeah, your name is
really Wyclef Jean.

00:02:53.253 --> 00:02:55.040
Yeah, that's really
Wyclef Jean."

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.260
And I realized that
my name is actually

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.430
more famous than the person.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.184
So now I have to accept
that I'm kind of famous.

00:03:03.184 --> 00:03:05.600
So on that note, what I'm going
to do is I'm going to take

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.150
y'all on a trip.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.940
I call it "From Cassettes."

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.140
And the very last song
that I'll end up doing

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.140
is probably a song that's
streaming, I think,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.550
over 40 million.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.960
It's called "Hendrix."

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.660
So we'll start from
the Cassette Era.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.450
I'll just take y'all
through a flashback,

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.087
and then somehow I ended
up in the Streaming Era,

00:03:25.087 --> 00:03:25.670
which is cool.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:04:59.090
[MUSIC - WYCLEF JEAN, "READY OR

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.295
They call me Wyclef because
I flip the language.

00:05:01.295 --> 00:05:05.700
I called Donald Trump and

but they got convinced when

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.650
I flipped it in French, like--

Thank you, thank you.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.610
So Drake calls me Uncle
Clef when he picks me up.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.660
I'm getting kind of old, man.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.080
So that was a little
"Gone Till November."

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.430
My music is like--

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:40.590
I'm inspired by Bob
Dylan and Bob Marley.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.510
So in the hood, they
call me a thug hippie.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:49.765
Just give peace a chance,
trying to figure it out.

00:09:49.765 --> 00:09:54.842
So we'll move to another
era, which is cool.

00:09:54.842 --> 00:09:57.910
This is called "Someone
Please Call 911."

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.760

00:12:47.481 --> 00:12:49.936
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.740
So what y'all probably
realizing is like, "holy shit,

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.630
this kid is actually an
amazing singer as well.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:06.670
We didn't know he'd be
doing all them high notes

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.350
and shit for real.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.690
We thought he'd adjust it in
the studio with auto-tune."

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:16.300
Now, I was raised in my
daddy's church, so what I love,

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.770
I was a choir director.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.410
So I just loved producing music.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.870
So a lot of the stuff that I've
written for different people,

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:28.990
whether if it was Santana, or
Destiny's Child, Shakira, most

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.180
of the stuff, I demo it myself.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.420
So y'all don't get a chance
to actually hear the demos,

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.470
so this is actually cool because
y'all get to hear the cut, raw,

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.240
like before it
actually goes out.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.210
You know what I mean?

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.375
So like when I was in
the studio with Santana

00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:45.240
but before Santana?

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.380
So Santana got this.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.400
He got this demo.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.980
It was like-- let's see.

It was like--

[MUSIC - WYCLEF JEAN, "MARIA,

00:15:10.414 --> 00:15:13.080
And I know y'all ain't know what
the hell we were saying on that

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.500
"ola binga."

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.530
And I don't credit myself
for the "ola binga,"

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.400
but growing up, I
used to like listening

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.360
to a lot of Lionel Richie.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.810
And there's some shit
he'd do in, I think,

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.085
it's like "All Night
Long," where's it's like,

[SINGING GIBBERISH]

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.630
And I was like, "man."

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.810
I tell you, if Lionel
Richie could get away

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.440
with that, that's the man.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.942
All I gotta do is just make up
some "ola binga" and people--

00:15:44.942 --> 00:15:47.789
and it ended up rocking.

00:15:47.789 --> 00:15:48.830
So I'll do one more tune.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.300
This is the one
that's streaming.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.580

has reinvented me

to a new generation.

is a new rapper

00:15:57.159 --> 00:15:58.450
that Young Thug is putting out.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:15:59.660

MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: The
reason, or multiple reasons,

00:19:24.402 --> 00:19:25.110
why you're here--

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.610
I'm sure we can
make a laundry list,

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.370
but it goes back to the recent
release of "J'ouvert," which

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.880
was an EP signaling the
beginning of Carnival

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.300
and leading us to what will be
this summer's "The Carnival 3."

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.050
On the 20th anniversary
of "The Carnival,"

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:41.310
you're now releasing
"The Carnival 3."

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:45.990
What is the appeal to
being a sequel album?

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:49.320
Why are we still
living in the carnival?

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.630
WYCLEF JEAN: Well, the era
that we're in right now,

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:55.800
we're in the era of the Drakies,
the eras of the Rihannas,

00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:02.070
the eras of the afrobeat
movement, which is spawning.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:05.640
In 1997, when I was coming
out with The Carnival," which

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.590
is an album with a lot of these
like futuristic world beat

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.740
rhythms against hip
hop rhythms, this

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:18.600
is why it allows this new one
to be part of that sequel.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.050
So a kid who'd never
heard "The Carnival," one

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.590
like my daughter, she's
bumping "J'ouvert."

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.690
So while she's bumping
"J'ouvert," she's like,

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.030
"dad, do a song with Drake."

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.860
So Drake is like her Wyclef.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.284
You see what I'm saying?

00:20:33.284 --> 00:20:35.700
Now, but when Drake is like,
"yo, your dad is really cool.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.560
I listen to "The Carnival."

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.305
So now she hasn't heard "The
Carnival," so "The Carnival

00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:44.670
3" will be her first experience
with that explosion of what

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:48.600
happened in '97 mixed with 2017.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:53.490
And it's themed like that,
because it has a world

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.525
rhythm to it along with the
hip hop and everything else.

00:20:56.525 --> 00:20:58.650
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: You
mentioned the word "theme,"

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:00.712
and that's always been
a big deal for me.

00:21:00.712 --> 00:21:02.670
Because I think back to
the original "Carnival"

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:04.830
and even "The Score"
before that, and these

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.140
are not just
collections of songs.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.600
This is an album that
you sit, you listen to,

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.880
you get told a wonderful story.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.890
How important is this sort
of storytelling thing to you

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:18.880
in the creation process?

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.570
It's not just like,
"hey, here's a good hook.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.256
Build around it." it's like,
you've got a story to tell.

00:21:24.256 --> 00:21:26.130
WYCLEF JEAN: Yeah, it's
tricky because you've

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:27.880
got two generations.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.374
So my daughter, she's
just skip, skip, forward.

00:21:30.374 --> 00:21:32.040
She's like, "OK,
what's the next single?

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.330
What's the next single?"

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:37.410
But then she will sit there
and listen to Adele's album.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.960
Because at the end of the
day, it's a body of work.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.820
So you're dealing
with two audiences.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.730
You've got "The Carnival"
cult classic audience, which

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.524
is "The Score."

00:21:46.524 --> 00:21:47.940
If they hear
"Carnival 3," they're

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:52.410
not planning to go and put
on a CD and skip and skip.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.760
They know what the classic is.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.570
So they're going to see
if song one can go to two,

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.500
can go to three, can go to four.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.970
My daughter's generation
is a little different.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:03.930
So the way that we're going
to approach this is two sides.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.680
They'll be the audio
and the visual.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.810
So it's more of a
visual generation.

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.230
So what I want to do this
time, unlike on "Carnival 1,"

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.600
when I used the skits
to take you there,

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.740
because we weren't that advanced
with Google and everything yet.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.524
So I created my own Google.

00:22:18.524 --> 00:22:20.440
I was like, "ah, let me
do this audio Google."

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.250
So now in the era
that we're in, we're

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.460
basically-- what I'm going to
do is take the entire album,

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:32.310
and it's going to be what I
call a hip hop urban opera,

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.290
where all of the
visuals now will

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.610
be shot where the
visuals go thematically

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:38.730
with the next songs.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.830
And similar to
"Carnival 1," now you'll

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.430
be able to discover new
artists that you don't know.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:48.150
So the cool thing is with
"Carnival 1," who's John Forte?

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:48.840
Who is?

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.620
Now with "Carnival 3," a lot
of the talents, like being

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.550
able to come up, working with
Lauryn Hill, Beyonce, Shakira,

00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:00.630
Mary J, Little Wayne,
and not Little Wayne.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:04.874
Now I'm talking about Jah Rule,
50 Cent, all of this back then.

00:23:04.874 --> 00:23:06.540
I'm just saying, this
is how it started.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.540
I watched the evolution
of a lot of these kids.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.000
With "The Carnival
3," you will start

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.970
to see a lot of
evolution of what

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:17.970
we feel is the future of
where talent is going.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.845
So that's what's going
to make this exciting.

00:23:19.845 --> 00:23:20.886
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Cool.

00:23:20.886 --> 00:23:22.890
So we're looking forward
to a lot of new talent.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:24.346
Still staying on the
subject a little bit,

00:23:24.346 --> 00:23:25.929
and Madeleine, maybe
this is something

00:23:25.929 --> 00:23:30.210
that you can speak to, in this
idea of not just putting out

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.814
an album, with
"Carnival," you originally

00:23:32.814 --> 00:23:34.230
could get it on
vinyl or cassette,

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:35.355
like we were talking about.

00:23:35.355 --> 00:23:38.760
CD was the least seller
for that to come out.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.240
Now in the world, we're not even
really buying physical media

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:42.740
any more.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:43.200
MADELINE NELSON: Right.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.200
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: How
important from an artist

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.430
perspective and also
from a label perspective

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:50.790
is the diversification
of where you're

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:51.990
making yourself available?

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.230
You talked a lot about
streaming services,

00:23:54.230 --> 00:24:00.860
the sort of visual movie audio
thing for YouTube and online.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.276
How is this calculus done?

00:24:03.276 --> 00:24:06.030
MADELINE NELSON: So
it's super important.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:10.470
When Wyclef made "The Carnival"
album 20 years ago-- in June,

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:12.470
it's going to be 20 years--

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.050
people were buying that
album on cassette tapes,

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:17.020
on CDs, and on vinyl.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.870
The least amount of people
were buying on CD, though.

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:22.700
And then we did the
"The Carnival 2,"

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.300
which is then 10 years ago.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.720
So he's got these 10 year
gaps of these "Carnival"

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.300
albums, which I think is
also important to note.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.340
10 years ago it was all CD.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.200
But there was
still no streaming.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.140
I think none of the
services even existed

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.970
when "The Carnival 2" happened.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:40.700
And then there
was a serious gap,

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.380
because there was
tons of music that

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.010
was being made on Wyclef and
on other artists like Carlos

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.710
Santana, and Whitney
Houston, and Shakira,

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:52.310
all in between one and two.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:55.110
But between "Carnival 2"
and now "Carnival 3," Wyclef

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:57.450
wasn't putting
music on the market.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.960
So not only did
"Carnival 2" happen right

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.720
before streaming happened, then
there was just no from Wyclef

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.340
in the 10 year gap.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.290
So we hit 8, 9, 10
years later, and we're

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:12.950
starting to put music out
again, and essentially there's

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:14.390
only streaming.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:17.930
It is where the young
folks we're talking about

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.540
are running out to
physically purchase an album.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.330
So we really had
to sort how do you

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:28.110
take an artist who last released
music before streaming even

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:33.230
existed and make them relevant
on all those streaming

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:34.190
platforms?

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.620
The good fortune is
the artist is Wyclef,

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.629
and his music is amazing,
no matter how long

00:25:39.629 --> 00:25:42.170
it takes him to start putting
music back on the market again.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:46.040
But it's been interesting
for us as a label,

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.340
being a really, really young
indie label, never really

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:55.070
having dealt with physical, only
understanding digital, to work

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:58.970
with an artist like Wyclef,
who was all physical releases,

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:05.690
and now we had to figure our
way in this digital world.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:09.500
And what has happened is,
he's done something amazing.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:14.840
Because it is a huge, huge
20 year gap, and "Hendrix,"

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.580
like he spoke about, had a point
on Spotify on each playlist

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.310
that they would put it, all
the way up to Rap Caviar.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:26.000
If anybody knows, that the
creme de la creme on Spotify.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.350
But it was the least skipped
song on each playlist,

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:34.070
from a guy who hadn't put
music on streaming ever

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.800
before that song
went to streaming.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.380
So it's really, really
interesting to watch the path,

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.860
watch the journey, and to see
him do something really rare,

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.990
to be able to start
at cassette tape

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:47.390
and-- we call it "cassette
tape to streaming rates,"

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:49.640
is what we've been calling
the whole marketing

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.720
piece from "Carnival
1 20th Anniversary"

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.457
to putting out "The Carnival 3."

00:26:53.457 --> 00:26:55.790
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And what
do you think, as the artist

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.530
coming into this landscape?

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:01.540
It's not as simple anymore
as just cutting it to tape

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.330
and being done.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.850
There's a lot more work
involved now, it seems.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:07.550
WYCLEF JEAN: Yeah, but I really
don't look at life like that.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.470
You feel me?

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:12.140
I'm just a different breed.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:15.680
I don't believe
music is supposed

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.810
to be put out
because it's supposed

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:20.840
to go to a commercial
space, or you're

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:25.550
supposed to plan in your
brain "do these analytics."

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:28.520
I believe your life, you
should be doing a lot with it.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.600
So at times, music
is just the gift.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.420
And then I think public
service and different things

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.870
that we do, all of
these things are what

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:39.830
actually inspires the music.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:41.580
People inspire people.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.710
So I think what happens
is, it's like the death

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:49.670
of a lot of artists when their
whole existence in living

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:52.610
is to put out music
to please a public.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.350
I mean, that's the
most dangerous thing,

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.540
because you'll get
caught up in a gap.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.870
so it's like if we didn't
do "The Score," if we didn't

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:02.780
do "The Carnival," I
remember like "The Carnival,"

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.657
these albums, the companies
thought I was crazy

00:28:05.657 --> 00:28:06.740
when I was putting it out.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.990
But I was like, "yo, I
want to be like Basquiat."

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:11.960
When you put art out, art
will live long after you,

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.370
and we will discover it.

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.310
So I just feel like,
"OK, we're in the era

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:17.350
we have the YouTube."

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:21.200
So the YouTube for me is the new
record crates for my daughter.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.370
She sees a name.

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.430
That's where she goes back
and gets all this information.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:29.750
So I think that the space
that you take in between,

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:33.500
it's just important that, OK,
even if I ain't putting music

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.500
out, y'all still see
me doing other things.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.160
Because sometimes-- I call
it my John Lennon moment.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.026
Sometimes, there are things that
are more important than music.

00:28:42.026 --> 00:28:43.400
Then, when you
decide that you're

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.510
going to put the music out and
you're going to make it right,

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:50.780
the first thing is, you have
to find an executive that you

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.310
can really trust.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:58.430
So in no way am I calling myself
a genius, but at 17 years old,

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.500
I was a jazz prodigy.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.250
I played like 12
different instruments,

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:04.520
self-taught, all of that.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.310
So who the hell am I
going to listen to?

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.415
So you know what I'm saying?

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:12.380
So I'll tell you who
I'm listening to at 17.

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.440
I mean, I was listening to--

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.060
I did an off
Broadway musical play

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.660
called "Club 12," and
I saw Quincy Jones.

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.410
And I was amazed by
Q, and I was like, "Q,

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:24.090
I'm going to be
like you when I--"

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:27.050
He's like, "keep
going, young man."

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:30.530
And then years later,
I see Q at the Grammys.

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:34.730
And then having a chance
to work with Clive Davis,

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.160
spending time with Clive
Davis, spending time

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.900
with Jimmy Iovine, Tommy
Mottola, Donnie Ienner,

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.950
crafting through music.

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:46.692
I was like, "OK,
in this millennium,

00:29:46.692 --> 00:29:48.650
I'm in a new millennium
and I want to do music.

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.550
Who am I going to
do music with?"

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:54.300
Because the trust
factor is so important.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.690
And I bumped into a
small indie, where

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.490
it was completely run by women.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:59.480
You know what I mean?

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.330
I love men, but women,
when they do things, man,

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:04.940
they put that extra thing to it.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.240
So I got with this indie,
and all of a sudden,

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.520
we had the real conversations.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.240
And so my job is to
constantly make music.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.110
And I think someone
else's job has

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:21.110
to be to carve out how
they bring the music

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:22.910
to the next generation.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.560
That's not the part I'm good at.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.750
So I think that
when it works best

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:30.150
is when the artist and
the executive brain

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:31.520
gels as one brain.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.759
I think that's when
you get the magic,

00:30:33.759 --> 00:30:36.050
and I think that's what we're
getting out of everything

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:37.340
we're putting out now.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:38.900
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
That's great.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.240
I did want to touch on
a little bit of that.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.000
You talked about your
early on influences

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.200
and being inspired by greats
like Quincy Jones and this.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.201
Coming back to do
a new record, I've

00:30:51.201 --> 00:30:52.700
been listening to
some of the stuff,

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.074
and for a song like "Hendrix,"
you go and listen to that,

00:30:55.074 --> 00:30:58.640
and there's some very new,
very modern sonic stuff.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.180
A piece that leaps to mind
is the "El Chapo" portion

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:05.870
being a little on thee
designer-esque repetition

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:08.990
vibe in the sonic evolution.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:12.560
Was that a conscious decision
to look around at the landscape

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.050
and say like, "OK, this is
how I can bridge that gap?"

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:18.690
Because it's still very island
and world music as well.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:20.295
Or was that just the
nature of-- these

00:31:20.295 --> 00:31:21.920
are the influences
that are around you,

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.210
sort of passive influence?

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:24.510
WYCLEF JEAN: Great question.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:30.530
So the answer to that is, blues
gets translated into what?

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.690
It starts off as blues.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:33.740
We go into jazz.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.180
We go into bebop.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.490
What we do is we
adjust the cadence.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.440
So designer is a cadence.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.765
[SPEAKING GIBBERISH]
That's a cadence.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:49.260
But-- [SCATTING]
That's a cadence.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:57.410
So as someone who creates
music, every time has a cadence.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:00.470
And the cadence is the
way of communication.

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:03.110
So the '90s cadence
was like this.

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:04.596
Woodpecker.

00:32:04.596 --> 00:32:05.822
That was just the cadence.

00:32:05.822 --> 00:32:07.530
And people were like,
"yo, Wy, it's going

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:10.160
to break your neck like this."

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.360
And so the beat
was going this way.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.063
So now my daughter, their
cadence is like this.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.470
So it's very
important, because what

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:24.300
I'm doing is-- so
mathematically,

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.940
I'm adjusting to a cadence.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.000
Because the cadence
is what determines

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
if you get the pulse or
you don't get the pulse.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.940
So even like in Jay-Z
in the "Tom Ford" song,

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.990
you'll see he'll take
four bars and go [HUMMING]

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:41.240
and then he'll go back
to Jay-Z. OK, I get it.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:45.650
The problem is now, if you
don't understand the cadence.

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:49.220
So if we go from blues
to bebop to jazz to R&amp;B,

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:53.450
there's still cadences that
we have to incorporate.

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.260
So it's important
to understand that.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:33:00.090
Now, the bad part about it
is, if you don't understand

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:07.486
that, you heard Clef and I was
like [SINGING GIBBERISH] you'd

00:33:07.486 --> 00:33:11.715
be like, "what the fuck
happened to Wyclef?"

00:33:11.715 --> 00:33:13.340
MADELINE NELSON: And
that happened too.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.220
I was getting calls from
people like, "oh, Wyclef's

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.380
doing trap music now?

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.350
And so instead of getting
defensive, I said, "no,

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:25.480
he's doing acoustic
trap music now."

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.920
Those same people were calling
about the streaming numbers

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.955
of "Hendrix."

00:33:28.955 --> 00:33:29.996
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Yeah.

00:33:29.996 --> 00:33:31.640
Well, it does
accomplish the goal

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.254
of bringing a very
unique style of music.

00:33:34.254 --> 00:33:35.920
WYCLEF JEAN: Well,
communication is key.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.170
MADELINE NELSON: Yeah.

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:37.586
WYCLEF JEAN: Like,
if you're going

00:33:37.586 --> 00:33:41.360
to do music for
my daughter, it's

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.340
up to who you want
to do music for.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:48.044
So I say, "OK, I want to reach
out to now a new generation."

00:33:48.044 --> 00:33:50.210
So if you're doing that,
you have to know the lingo.

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:51.840
You have to know the language.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.020
You have to know
every form of work,

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.870
or you could just be like, "OK."

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:59.210
And I learned this being in
a studio with Michael Jackson

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:02.300
and understanding the pulse
is always with the child.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.850
Once you lose that
pulse of the child--

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:07.790
I don't care if it's
technology, music, movies.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:11.840
We could go back to books 2,000
years ago that we will read,

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.650
our kids will read.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:13.150
Why?

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:15.670
Because it's written
from that innocence.

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:17.600
So whenever it's
time to do that,

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.090
you have to at least
understand all of the cadence

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:22.090
that we're dealing with.

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:23.889
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Yeah, like
a foreigner in a foreign land.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:25.912
At least "hello," "thank
you," and maybe "how

00:34:25.912 --> 00:34:26.620
to order a beer."

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:28.703
WYCLEF JEAN: Yeah, and you
gotta know how to trip.

00:34:28.703 --> 00:34:31.570
And you know what's funny
is, when I'm going like--

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.170
[SPEED RAPPING]

00:34:39.505 --> 00:34:42.940
And then my daughter is
like, "dad, I love that flow.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.520
That sounds like the Migos."

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.739
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:46.870
And it's funny, though.

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:47.929
You see?

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:50.560
The cadence sounds
like the Migos to her,

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:53.714
but that's speed rapping
that we did in the late '80s.

00:34:53.714 --> 00:34:54.880
But you see what I'm saying?

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.870
But to her, Migos
introduced it to her.

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:01.470
Then I have to show
her Migos saying

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.995
"I'll be gone till November
on that Wyclef kush."

00:35:03.995 --> 00:35:06.170
And she says, "oh, OK, dad.

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.940
I see."

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:09.280
But it's cool, though.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:09.929
It shows you.

00:35:09.929 --> 00:35:10.720
But think about it.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.390
So I'm doing a flow like,
duh-duh-uh, speed rapping.

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:15.460
And now this same
flow comes back.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:17.950
Once again, it's that
cadence and being

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:19.780
able to adjust to the cadence.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.900
Always remember, the song--

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.210
the song is the song.

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:28.270
If you write an incredible
song, it's the song.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:31.750
Now, to adjust, all you
do is adjust to song

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:34.190
is you adjust the
sonics of the time.

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:36.310
The sun will always be the sun.

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:37.720
The moon will
always be the moon.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:42.070
But we humans, the sun was
out in the Egyptian times,

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:44.630
but they didn't have Google.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:46.940
Or maybe they did?

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:47.800
In a different form.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.490
I don't know.

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:50.630
But we did was we adjust.

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:52.420
As humans, we adjust.

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.480
So the songs, the
moons, that's the sun.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.240
And we as humans, we
adjust to the cadence.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.120
But we don't sacrifice
the sun for nothing.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:01.620
You know?

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.911
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Yeah,
it's always back like before.

00:36:03.911 --> 00:36:04.628
Very good.

00:36:04.628 --> 00:36:06.963
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.080
So there was a
mention of this 10

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.150
years of no music from Wyclef.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:16.260
But that's not because you were
just hiding out and relaxing.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.280
You were actually quite
busy during that time.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.080
WYCLEF JEAN: And I
was putting out music.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.570
It was just music that
wasn't in a commercial space.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:22.840
MADELINE NELSON: Yeah.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.790
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Right, OK.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:24.100
WYCLEF JEAN: Right?

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.350
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Of course.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:27.790
WYCLEF JEAN: You look at
every artist through history.

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:29.290
Even Stevie Wonder
taught me that.

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:32.410
We have what's called the
light days and the dark days.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:36.160
And the dark days are not
that we have writer's block.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.820
It just means that we tapped
out of a certain space.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:43.810
Because you can start and be
like, "yo, I want to be on TV!

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:46.520
I want to be--"
then, as you're going

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.820
and you're constantly
on TV, you're

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.430
constantly on the
radio, you're constantly

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:55.090
breaking chart records,
that could get boring, dude.

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:56.620
Believe it or not.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.870
Because you're like, "yo,
what am I going to do next?"

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:01.510
When dudes go, "yo,
all right, Wyclef Jean

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:07.370
just topped Michael Jackson
and Elvis Presley best radio

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:09.950
airplay song of all time,"
[INAUDIBLE],, you go,

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:13.499
"OK, man, it's just
failure for me."

00:37:13.499 --> 00:37:15.290
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Nowhere to go but down.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:16.706
WYCLEF JEAN: It
was sort of like--

00:37:16.706 --> 00:37:22.030
so I tapped out of music,
but if you look back ever

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:26.510
since the Fugee, whether it
was the Tibetan Freedom concert

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.490
or Rock the Vote,
different things,

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.530
we were more on the active side.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:33.630
So it wasn't even
trying to be famous.

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:34.440
So think about it.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.710
"Fugees" is short
for "refugees."

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:39.230
You could go back
in '96, '95, '94.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:42.390
Look at my interviews,
listen to what I'm saying.

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:46.100
I'm saying we chose this
name because, coming

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.650
from an immigrant background,
having family that

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:52.340
have died on the shores of Cuba,
trying to make it to Miami,

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:56.660
running from dictators, we
choose this name because we're

00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:00.320
going to take what they
look at as a negative

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.330
and we're going
to make it so fly.

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:05.040
So for me, this is my DNA.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.860
So 20 years later, when
I step out, I was like,

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:14.030
"I don't want to be that guy
when 250,000 of my people

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:17.059
are under the rubble, and all
of the youth in my country

00:38:17.059 --> 00:38:19.100
look up to me, and it's
like, oh, what did he do?

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.130
Oh, he sang some more
songs and he danced."

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:24.870
No, I believe in public service.

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:28.100
So I sacrificed my entire
career, everything.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.350
Politics is dirty, man.

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:32.875
I mean, Trump knows now.

00:38:32.875 --> 00:38:36.440
Politics is like, they'll
take anything and make it--

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.960
because it's almost like you're
entering a different realm.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.050
You have to understand,
once you're into politics,

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:47.870
you're basically saying,
"I have submitted myself

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:50.360
to my constituents."

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.670
Basically, your city, your town.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:56.150
And so I basically submitted
myself to my country of Haiti.

00:38:56.150 --> 00:39:01.580
That came first in those
10 years before the music.

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.740
So that's why the music
was like Dark Age,

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.830
because it was more like,
"how can I help my people?"

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:09.950
And all the way trying to become
the president of my country,

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:11.270
I mean, dude.

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:12.509
I mean, this is no joke.

00:39:12.509 --> 00:39:14.050
Like everything
you're reading about,

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:17.870
I mean, this little dude who's
sitting here, I'm no joke, man.

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:19.730
I could hear my
friends like-- you know

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:21.410
I mean-- in the background.

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:26.150
"Yeah, you know I'm going to--"
I've got my Luther King voice.

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:29.490
"I'm going to become
the president of Haiti."

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:33.190
And I could hear my boys in
that back, "that nigga crazy!"

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:35.370
You know what I'm saying?

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:39.530
But for me, it was
important that you step up

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:40.280
to the occasion.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.770
And this is what Martin
Luther King teaches us.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:46.880
Having spent one on one
time with Nelson Mandela,

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:52.650
like one on one, and
getting to pick his brain.

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:57.770
"Yo, Nelson, man, they had
you up, and you get out,

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:00.390
and you find forgiveness.

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:03.330
You set up these
courts, and say, well,

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:06.230
the oppressor could come
talk to the accuser."

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:08.312
What is this about?

00:40:08.312 --> 00:40:12.720
So in understanding this, it
always goes back to humanity.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.600
And our real weapon is love.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.830
So it was incredible to take
those 10 years out and figure

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:22.890
that out and be able to
come back in this space,

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:25.110
because I have so
much more to give now.

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.210
Because it feels
like a new start.

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:29.940
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well, and
it seems, as a fan of the music,

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.360
that one of the common
themes is the carnival,

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.172
the subcommon theme has always
been politics, sociopolitics.

00:40:35.172 --> 00:40:35.880
WYCLEF JEAN: Yes.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.480
MADELINE NELSON: Yeah.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.521
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And
speaking to those things,

00:40:38.521 --> 00:40:40.050
and actually seeing
an artist who--

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:42.392
P-Diddy can say, "oh,
go rock the vote,"

00:40:42.392 --> 00:40:44.100
and then he doesn't
even show up to vote.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.070
But you put yourself out there.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:47.750
WYCLEF JEAN: P-Diddy my man, yo.

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:48.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:49.440
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
I'm not trying

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.390
to take a shot at him, but--

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:51.848
WYCLEF JEAN: Yo,
dude, listen, man.

00:40:51.848 --> 00:40:55.020
Don't do that to P. Because,
dude, don't do that.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:58.829
I need my Ciroc delivered
at the next show, brah.

00:40:58.829 --> 00:41:00.870
Please, I don't want Diddy
to be like, "yo, Clef,

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:02.859
I saw you on Google
with your man.

00:41:02.859 --> 00:41:03.900
What's up with him, man?"

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.248
And I'm like, "P, let
me get that peach."

00:41:06.248 --> 00:41:07.794
"Nah, man.

00:41:07.794 --> 00:41:09.460
You're have to hold
up on that, Cleffy."

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:09.870
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: All right.

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:11.310
Very fair, very fair, very fair.

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:12.810
We do want to open
it up to audience

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:15.070
questions for the last
few minutes we have here.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.528
So if you have questions, please
make your way to the mics.

00:41:17.528 --> 00:41:19.200
But one last thing before we go.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.640
So "The Carnival
3" does come out.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.250
And it is the 20th
anniversary of "The Carnival."

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:24.270
WYCLEF JEAN: Yeah.

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:27.160
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: "The
Score" was released in 2000--

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.290
1996.

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:32.520
Does that mean 2021 we get
25th anniversary Fugees

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.490
"Settle the Score?"

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:34.573
WYCLEF JEAN: I don't know.

00:41:34.573 --> 00:41:35.323
That sounds great.

00:41:35.323 --> 00:41:37.320
I think you just hit--

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.910
I think you just pitched
in and Lauryn and Pras just

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:41.390
saw this right now.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.230
Yeah, it sounds great.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:47.324
And "Carnival 3," what's
the preorder date?

00:41:47.324 --> 00:41:48.240
The date it comes out?

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.880
MADELINE NELSON: So you will be
able to preorder on June 23rd.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.360
So that is the 20th
anniversary of "The Carnival."

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.850
So while we're celebrating
the 20th anniversary

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:58.950
of "The Carnival," you
can preorder "Carnival 3,"

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:03.360
and there's probably going to
be two amazing instant grat

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.250
songs for the preorder.

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:08.070
And then later this summer,
the album will be released.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:09.870
And we're not going to
talk about the date.

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:12.380
There's just going to be
a day when you can get it.

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.130
And you're going to
love the instant grat

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:15.630
so much that you're definitely
going to get the album?

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:17.070
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: When can
I get my limited edition 12

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:18.365
inch custom side vinyl?

00:42:18.365 --> 00:42:19.573
WYCLEF JEAN: You got it, man.

00:42:19.573 --> 00:42:19.956
We got you.

00:42:19.956 --> 00:42:20.340
MADELINE NELSON: Oh, of course!

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:20.802
WYCLEF JEAN: Definitely.

00:42:20.802 --> 00:42:21.430
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: All
right, perfect, perfect.

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:23.263
Let's take some questions
from the audience.

00:42:23.263 --> 00:42:24.720
Please.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.782
AUDIENCE: Hey, Wyclef.

00:42:25.782 --> 00:42:26.490
WYCLEF JEAN: Sir.

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:27.948
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for being here.

00:42:27.948 --> 00:42:29.256
WYCLEF JEAN: Thank you, baby.

00:42:29.256 --> 00:42:30.630
AUDIENCE: And for
sharing with us

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:34.560
these great songs and
information about the Egyptian

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.770
Google and light and dark days.

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:40.980
But thank you especially
for starting us off

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:44.170
with a couple of songs from
"The Score" and "Gone Till

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:46.740
November," and making
us older Googlers not

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.230
feel quite so irrelevant.

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:52.040
But as somebody who grew
up in New York in the '80s,

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.090
I have a more
important question,

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:58.010
which is those were the
days of Doc and Darryl.

00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:59.715
How can you be
wearing a Yankees hat?

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:03.940
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: He's
questioning your Yankees hat.

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.690
AUDIENCE: Are you
really a Yankees fan?

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:07.560
I respect the Yankees, but--

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.235
WYCLEF JEAN: Oh,
that's a good question.

00:43:09.235 --> 00:43:10.590
No, that's a good question.

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:13.250
I came out here today,
and I'm supporting

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:16.670
this Yankees hat because
of my daughter right now.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:22.580
So basically she's seen
a hat like this on Jay-Z.

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.260
And this is a true story.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.260
And she was like, "dad, you
should rock a fitted like Jay."

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:33.060
So purely, there is no baseball
analogy today at all for me.

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:36.470
But if we were to have
a baseball analogy, when

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:38.420
I used to collect
the cards, I used

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:42.160
to collect Reggie Jacksons
and Willie Randolphs.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.320
Those were my favorites
coming up in the '80s

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.360
that I used to collect.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.330
AUDIENCE: They
were pretty great.

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:48.980
WYCLEF JEAN: Yeah,
those were my homies.

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:50.563
I mean, I didn't
know them personally,

00:43:50.563 --> 00:43:51.860
but those were the cards.

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.390
AUDIENCE: Me neither.

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:54.536
WYCLEF JEAN: Exactly.

00:43:54.536 --> 00:43:55.994
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Please.

00:43:55.994 --> 00:43:59.470
AUDIENCE: Hi, you mentioned
about giving back to Haiti.

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:03.680
And I mean, Haiti still
has many problems,

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.860
the widespread poverty, and
infrastructure, and everything.

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.800
And last time, you tried
to give back to them

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.770
through Yele Haiti.

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:15.860
You got a lot of
criticism in the press

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:22.481
about it misappropriation of
funds and, like, for example,

00:44:22.481 --> 00:44:24.230
hundreds of thousands
dollars in contracts

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:27.020
to your brother-in-law that
didn't actually materialize

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:30.850
and $100,000 to you
for a benefit concert.

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:36.450
And I was wondering if that
experience, which was obviously

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:39.470
a really hard thing
to do, dissuaded you

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.963
from having a future
impact there, as well

00:44:41.963 --> 00:44:44.810
as a presidential
run as well, if you

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:49.490
are going to have similar
large-scale endeavors to help

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:54.505
Haiti, and if so, what you
would do differently then?

00:44:54.505 --> 00:44:55.880
WYCLEF JEAN: Well,
the first part

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:59.240
to the tear of your question
is, I denounce everything

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.130
that the New York Times said.

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:03.650
And I had an article
where I posted up

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:07.430
the response of denouncing
the fact that I used charity

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:12.980
funds to benefit myself, the
idea of taking contracts,

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:15.050
to lower that to my family.

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:19.370
The bigger picture of that is,
at the time, if you go back

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:23.360
and you look now, you'll see
that the billion dollars went

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:26.600
to Red Cross, and you can
see the amount of houses

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:30.080
they built. You could look into
different foundations and see.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:33.620
In the process, I felt that
Yele Haiti was a patsy.

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:35.360
It was a distraction
for a bigger

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:40.040
picture that was going on, and
I was the face of a celebrity.

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:43.880
And actually, in my country, it
actually made me more powerful.

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.130
Because in order
for you to break me,

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:48.560
you've got to turn
my people against me.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:53.150
So past that, if you noticed,
I took it a step further

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:56.050
and ran to become
president of my country.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:58.430
And past that, right
now I'm working

00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:59.960
with the current government.

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:02.450
And my plan is
basically to be part

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:06.380
of a watchdog for NGOs
coming into my country that

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:09.320
have tried to set me up,
and to make sure that--

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.240
Because whether you're
talking about Haiti

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.460
or you're talking about
Africa or different places,

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:17.150
these places are basically--
long before we were born,

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:21.500
they were created by designs to
be a back door, where one man's

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.090
tragedy is another man's gain.

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:25.010
I'm not saying that there
is not people that's

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:26.510
doing good work on the ground.

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:28.760
So through my experience,
what I've learned

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:33.070
is, the best impact for my
country will not be charity.

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:35.630
It will be social
entrepreneurship.

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:38.870
I feel like charity
and aid is a Band-Aid.

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:41.870
To get past the [INAUDIBLE],,
to get past that,

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:44.780
we have to work closer
with private sector,

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.090
with government, and
to get them to come up

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:49.070
with more job structures.

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:51.200
And this is not
just a Haiti thing.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.610
It's an American thing.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:54.020
It's in Afghanistan thing.

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.100
It's a Pakistan thing.

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.010
It's the idea of saying,
if you want to things

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:00.290
to change in the
rural communities,

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:03.860
we, as investors, have to
invest in these countries.

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:05.540
You've got different
telecom companies

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:07.248
that are coming into
these countries that

00:47:07.248 --> 00:47:08.900
are making billions of dollars.

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.202
And their whole philosophy
is, "they're poor,

00:47:11.202 --> 00:47:13.160
but they're going to buy
a pack of cigarettes."

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.182
You know what I mean?

00:47:14.182 --> 00:47:16.640
And then so the idea, if they
can buy a pack of cigarettes,

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.590
why can't you give them a job?

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:22.080
So through my experience,
we plan to be more powerful.

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.290
We're working with the
current administration,

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:27.920
but my goal moving forward now
is social entrepreneurship.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:29.910
How can I bring more
business into the country?

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:34.775
How can I get people to want to
hire these rural communities?

00:47:34.775 --> 00:47:36.650
And like I said, it's
not just a Haiti thing.

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:38.030
It's a Detroit thing.

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:39.260
It's a Compton thing.

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.390
The more we can work on
legislations and things

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:44.086
like that to help
pass, the less crime

00:47:44.086 --> 00:47:45.960
that we'll have in these
different countries,

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.980
and the more we'll have
the Wyclef Jeans coming out

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:50.307
of these countries.

00:47:50.307 --> 00:47:51.140
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:51.650
WYCLEF JEAN: No problem.

00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:52.030
MADELINE NELSON: Good question.

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:53.450
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Hey, Dama.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:54.700
AUDIENCE: Hey, good afternoon.

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:55.240
WYCLEF JEAN: Good afternoon.

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.340
AUDIENCE: My name
is Dama, and I'm

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.200
one of the leads of the
Black Googlers network

00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:58.800
here in New York.

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.970
So we just want to welcome
you and thank you for coming.

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:01.492
WYCLEF JEAN: Thank
you for having me.

00:48:01.492 --> 00:48:02.220
It's It's very important.

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:04.095
We have a few Haitian
Googlers in the office.

00:48:04.095 --> 00:48:05.053
Y'all raise your hands.

00:48:05.053 --> 00:48:05.900
WYCLEF JEAN: Yeah.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.608
[SPEAKING CREOLE]

00:48:07.608 --> 00:48:09.600
Good, good, good, good.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.940
AUDIENCE: And I think I also--

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:15.150
yes, actually-- I also want
to just amplify what you said.

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:18.945
WYCLEF JEAN: They said
"shalom," just so you know that.

00:48:18.945 --> 00:48:20.070
AUDIENCE: I'm Puerto Rican.

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:23.400
It's not that far off, and I
understand Creole very well.

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.110
But I just want to
amplify what you said.

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:27.030
It's very easy to
critique people

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:29.280
who are going to their
countries to do work

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.890
for their countrymen.

00:48:31.890 --> 00:48:34.380
I wish that here at Google,
we would focus as much

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:36.750
on what the American
Red Cross did in Haiti

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:40.110
and what we're not doing in
Flint as we are trying to focus

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:41.977
on what Wyclef did do in Haiti.

00:48:41.977 --> 00:48:43.060
And I'll leave it at that.

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:44.240
Thank you so much for coming.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.781
WYCLEF JEAN: Thank
you for having me.

00:48:45.781 --> 00:48:49.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.730
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:55.050
Not a question, just a thank
you for doing the open mic style

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:56.070
thing.

00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:57.780
WYCLEF JEAN: You
already know, baby.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:00.360
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure people
recognize how cool it is

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:04.620
and how hard it is to just
show up with a guitar and you.

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:08.070
And you gave us a behind the
scenes look at all these songs

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:08.709
that we love.

00:49:08.709 --> 00:49:10.125
And a lot of people
don't do that.

00:49:10.125 --> 00:49:11.260
So thanks.

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.218
WYCLEF JEAN: All right.

00:49:12.218 --> 00:49:13.260
Thank you, buddy.

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:15.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:19.120
AUDIENCE: Hey, thank
you for being here.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:23.170
I just had a question about how
you managed to get this far out

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:27.090
in your career and managed
to dodge so much shadiness

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:28.564
and snakiness in the industry.

00:49:28.564 --> 00:49:30.950
Because we hear about it all
the time from the outside,

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:32.991
and it seems that you guys
got a good thing going

00:49:32.991 --> 00:49:34.690
with independent
labels, companies

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:36.080
run by women and
stuff like that.

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:40.180
So how have you managed
to propel yourself

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:43.851
in the industry, that is
notoriously shaky, shady, stuff

00:49:43.851 --> 00:49:44.350
like that.

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:45.280
Is

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.690
WYCLEF JEAN: Just raw honesty.

00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:47.290
MADELINE NELSON: I want
to speak on that too.

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:49.090
WYCLEF JEAN: Just raw honesty.

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:50.405
What you see is what you get.

00:49:50.405 --> 00:49:51.280
You know what I mean?

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.730
It's like, if you have a
question and I can't answer it,

00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:55.630
we've got a problem.

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:58.900
And my father was a minister.

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:01.384
And he always said, "you
can't serve two masters."

00:50:01.384 --> 00:50:02.800
So when I decided
that I was going

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.630
to do hip hop music,
he was like, "oh,

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:06.320
you worshipping the devil now.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.560
You gotta get up
out of this church."

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.530
So he puts me upside
of this church.

00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:16.060
And so now I become
a young little Fugee.

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:16.990
You feel me?

00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:18.910
And I was like, "well,
what does he mean

00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:20.800
you can't serve two masters?"

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.090
Maybe he was saying it wrong.

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:23.004
You know what I mean?

00:50:23.004 --> 00:50:24.670
And I think the idea
of what he's saying

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:28.360
is, you're going inside of
industry, to your point, where

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.050
it's very, very turbulent.

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:33.610
And in order to stay
focused, it starts off

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:35.800
with the entourage
which is around you.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.110
So a lot of us, we slip.

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:42.850
And I'm telling you, the rapper
is the best guy you'll meet.

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:45.620
But if you meet them
dudes from our hood?

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:46.960
And they're rolling with me?

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.880
Like, if I bought 20 of them?

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:51.910
Like, y'all be shook.

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:54.300
But the thing is, if
I'm going to bring them,

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:55.550
I have to be like, "look, dog.

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:56.471
We going to Google.

00:50:56.471 --> 00:50:57.970
This is how we're
going to get down,

00:50:57.970 --> 00:50:59.330
and everyone has to chill."

00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:03.020
So what I've seen, what I've
seen through my entire career,

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:07.630
and it's a sad thing,
was the entourage

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:12.750
takes the rapper down.

00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:15.700
The execs will do
anything they can

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:18.280
to keep the artists
on cocaine, on drugs,

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:21.670
or whatever to basically
get what they need out

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:24.670
of the artist and
basically spit him out.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:26.800
And I'll let Madeline
continue on that, because she

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.130
has had a lot experiences.

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:30.940
Not that you spit me out.

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:32.500
MADELINE NELSON:
No, but to speak--

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.510
I wanted to really
speak to that as well.

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:39.700
Because our label
is women owned.

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.390
It's staffed only by women.

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:44.630
And the reason is because
I had an executive,

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:49.180
somebody I almost
worshipped, tell me

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:53.530
senior vice president at
Sony was maybe my pinnacle,

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:56.470
and maybe I would
get to be an EVP

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:59.290
and make a really great life
for myself, but as a woman,

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:01.750
I would never be CEO of a label.

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:04.430
And in that moment,
when the one Denzel tear

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:07.190
dropped from my left eye,
I don't remember which eye,

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:10.420
I knew I was going
to have an indie.

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:12.730
I was going to be
CEO of some label.

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:14.280
Maybe not a major.

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:19.540
But there is so much shadiness,
and not just toward women.

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:23.980
But the way you
navigate it literally

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:25.960
is to just navigate it.

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:30.310
One thing we knew with Wyclef
was that a "Carnival 3"

00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:31.390
had to come.

00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:33.730
If nothing else
happened, if he wasn't

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:36.940
going to do music anymore,
there had to be a "Carnival 3."

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:39.850
And so then how do you
then like look at him

00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:44.570
like a brand that maybe had not
been embraced for a long time,

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:47.360
just the musical part of him?

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.820
And how do we brand it?

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:55.251
And so that's what we did,
the five women on our staff.

00:52:55.251 --> 00:52:56.000
That's what we do.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.083
That's what we figure out.

00:52:57.083 --> 00:53:00.100
And literally how to just
learn how to navigate--

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:03.310
if you can't get
through a door, you do.

00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:05.170
You go find the back
door, the side door,

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:09.070
and you go find the person
who will champion you.

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:11.320
And you just never--

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.360
to quote Diddy, "can't
stop, won't stop."

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:16.180
We literally walk around our
office saying those words,

00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:17.920
"can't stop, won't stop."

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.410
You just find the door,
and you find the champions.

00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:24.085
There's always a champion
for a certain kind of music,

00:53:24.085 --> 00:53:26.680
a certain kind of
person, a certain kind

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:29.020
of what you believe in.

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:33.310
I was embracing what we could
do even on this platform,

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:35.200
on Google platform
and YouTube platform,

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.270
and having tons
of people tell me

00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:41.290
I was crazy for spending so
much time trying to sort it out.

00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:42.726
But here we are.

00:53:42.726 --> 00:53:43.476
WYCLEF JEAN: Yeah.

00:53:43.476 --> 00:53:46.360
Yeah, I'm going to tell
you, the toughest thing--

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.430
are you an artist?

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:48.400
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:52.052
WYCLEF JEAN: OK, so
the toughest thing--

00:53:52.052 --> 00:53:54.510
you seen that movie like Eddie
Kane, "The Five Heartbeats,"

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:55.340
you ever saw that movie?

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:56.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no.

00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:57.878
WYCLEF JEAN: OK, you
should check it out.

00:53:57.878 --> 00:53:59.230
Minus the drugs, that's like me.

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:00.480
Check it out.

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.680
Yo, I have absolutely--

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:06.310
I don't know how I ended
up being an artist,

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:09.070
because I just loved
the gift of music.

00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:11.410
The first thing
with an artist is,

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:14.140
we're very sensitive to our art.

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:15.450
That's the first thing.

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:16.470
And I'm talking
about whether you're

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:18.803
a painter, an inventor, or
whatever, when you sit there,

00:54:18.803 --> 00:54:19.440
you create.

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.930
I mean we got
fights, into fights.

00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:23.096
I was like, "man, I'm
canceling this studio session.

00:54:23.096 --> 00:54:23.940
I'm leaving."

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:29.460
But what happens is, if you
can get past the sensitivity,

00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.340
because I'm telling
you, this sensitivity,

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:36.070
I've watched my
peers commit suicide

00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:38.190
in the industry on
this sensitivity.

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:41.850
I've watched the
media take them down,

00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:44.360
and they've read every
form of what they're saying

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.930
and started doing pills.

00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:49.350
I think the first thing is, you
have to establish who you are.

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:53.550
So as artists, our job is to be
creative and bring creativity

00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:54.570
to the world.

00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:57.120
And for every negative
they say to you,

00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.675
you have to take
it as a positive.

00:54:58.675 --> 00:54:59.550
MADELINE NELSON: Yup.

00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:01.549
WYCLEF JEAN: And that's
the hardest thing to do,

00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:03.600
but this is what defines
success from failure.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:07.825
So when a man says, I will
not rise, I go like Confucius.

00:55:07.825 --> 00:55:08.700
You know what I mean?

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:11.850
Yo, the best thing is, after
I fall, I'm going to rise.

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:14.915
Easier said than done, but if
you can get to that pinnacle,

00:55:14.915 --> 00:55:17.290
you are going to get to the
point that you need to go to.

00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:19.339
But you have to believe
it in your heart.

00:55:19.339 --> 00:55:20.630
AUDIENCE: Thank you, thank you.

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:22.440
MADELINE NELSON:
Find your tribe.

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.680
Find who's going to
champion what you do.

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.190
AUDIENCE: I'm building them now.

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:28.756
WYCLEF JEAN: He's part
of the Beard Tribe.

00:55:28.756 --> 00:55:29.256
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:29.256 --> 00:55:30.589
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: I like that.

00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:32.714
AUDIENCE: I'm going
to watch that movie.

00:55:32.714 --> 00:55:34.380
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Unfortunately, we've

00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:35.566
run out of time.

00:55:35.566 --> 00:55:37.000
WYCLEF JEAN: She has one.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.670
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: We can
take a couple, then rapid fire.

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:40.940
Just hit us with your questions,
and we'll try and address

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:41.520
them both.

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:42.530
AUDIENCE: How you doing, Wyclef?

00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:43.440
WYCLEF JEAN: What up, baby?

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.040
AUDIENCE: Chilling, man.

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.240
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
We'll get back to you.

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:47.365
AUDIENCE: Being there you
come from an era of music

00:55:47.365 --> 00:55:50.710
where there's so much content
and message behind your music,

00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:53.610
how do you feel when
you have conversations

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:56.460
with your daughter and she's
into the Migos and things

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:57.180
like that?

00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:57.930
Let's not get it twisted.

00:55:57.930 --> 00:55:58.721
I like their music.

00:55:58.721 --> 00:56:00.764
Like you say, cadence
is everything,

00:56:00.764 --> 00:56:01.930
and it catches my attention.

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:04.290
But when I actually sit
down and listen to music,

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:06.075
it has no content.

00:56:06.075 --> 00:56:07.730
Like, I could
quote you in a song

00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:10.480
where you said, "in the
battle, I lost my finger.

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.950
The mic became my arm."

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:12.450
Feel me?

00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:14.699
That has a lot of content,
a lot of meaning behind it.

00:56:14.699 --> 00:56:16.750
And nowadays, a lot of
music doesn't have that.

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:17.955
What's your take on that?

00:56:17.955 --> 00:56:18.390
WYCLEF JEAN: Well--

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:19.070
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Before you take that,

00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:20.500
let's get this question as well.

00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:21.780
And then we can
address them both.

00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:22.930
AUDIENCE: Similar
question, first of all,

00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:25.429
thank you so much for the most
moving day within these walls

00:56:25.429 --> 00:56:26.150
I've had here.

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:27.892
So thank you.

00:56:27.892 --> 00:56:29.000
Question and a comment.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.200
Question-- similar
to what you said,

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.540
what is the biggest thing
you've taught your daughter?

00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:34.620
It sounds like your daughter
has taught you a lot about music

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:35.850
in the short time
she's been here.

00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:36.570
WYCLEF JEAN: Yeah,
she's my manager.

00:56:36.570 --> 00:56:37.830
AUDIENCE: And also--

00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:38.550
MADELINE NELSON:
And his stylist.

00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:39.690
AUDIENCE: Also a quick
comment/question.

00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:42.340
If you can close out with a
song, that would be the dopest.

00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:45.228
Just saying.

00:56:45.228 --> 00:56:45.728
Just saying.

00:56:45.728 --> 00:56:47.020
I'm just throwing it out there.

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:47.760
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: I
leave that up to you.

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:48.155
WYCLEF JEAN: I'll do it.

00:56:48.155 --> 00:56:48.550
Where's the mic.

00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:50.020
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Address the question first.

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:51.770
WYCLEF JEAN: I can,
and just take the mic,

00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:55.250
and then sing, and then
we rock out and be done.

00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:55.960
She's slick.

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.261
Boy, I told you, the women.

00:56:58.261 --> 00:57:00.546
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:00.772 --> 00:57:02.813
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: You
want to come off with me?

00:57:02.813 --> 00:57:05.278
MADELINE NELSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:57:05.278 --> 00:57:08.236
WYCLEF JEAN: I got
you, I got you.

00:57:08.236 --> 00:57:10.210
I knew I should have
taken my glasses off.

00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:13.300
OK, yeah.

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.670
So what happens is,
to your question,

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:17.837
there's a lot of things
that are going on.

00:57:17.837 --> 00:57:19.420
And one thing I want
you to understand

00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:25.130
is, if you're looking
for lyrics and content

00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:29.000
with young kids that are
doing what we're doing,

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.500
it does exist.

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:32.400
OK, let me tell you
where it exists.

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.980
So you're in a new era now.

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:36.710
You're in the era of streaming,
and everything is basically

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:38.240
on YouTube.

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:41.700
Are you aware of that battle
rapping around the world

00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:44.030
is one of the number
one cultures starting

00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:45.320
with Thailand?

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:49.550
And these kids are no older
than 20, 21 years old.

00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:52.370
They're breaking metaphors
like the Fugees down.

00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:58.160
They're doing this music
with absolutely no beats

00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:59.060
behind them.

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:00.800
So what happens
is, we were talking

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.320
about the transformation
of cadence.

00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.810
So there is a lot of
cadences going on.

00:58:05.810 --> 00:58:08.400
Look at how many views
battle rap is getting.

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:12.170
Now, as far as what's
going on on the other side,

00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:13.560
this is what's going on.

00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:16.490
So my analogy in
watching my daughter,

00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:21.040
she listens to music
purely for escape.

00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.200
For entertainment
and for escape.

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:29.786
Now, when I look at her, I said,
man, the Twin Towers go down.

00:58:29.786 --> 00:58:31.660
Every day, I mean you
go through the airport,

00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:34.540
you practically have
to get butt naked.

00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:37.300
The era that they're
living in right now,

00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:41.590
everything is so fearful,
and everything is just

00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:43.479
to scare them so
much that they got

00:58:43.479 --> 00:58:44.770
two things they're going to do.

00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:46.990
Either they're going to
start their revolution

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:48.590
and be like, "we protest.

00:58:48.590 --> 00:58:50.380
We're going to
vote for a gorilla

00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:52.720
before we vote for a person."

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:55.450
Or they're going to
escape with the music.

00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:58.390
And I think that if we
can get our politics

00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:02.390
right, our legislation right,
bring more love in the world,

00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:06.340
kids will start to write more
about what they are feeling.

00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:09.400
But right now, it's like
the kids are in escape mode.

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:11.740
We go to the party,
and it's like what do I

00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:13.770
want to do, watch CNN
or listen to Migos?

00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:16.660
I'll listen to Migos, because
I know exactly what CNN

00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:17.540
is going to do.

00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:20.650
But I think our job
though, my job, your job,

00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:23.080
is when we put these
kind of albums out,

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.425
and then they're following
us, and we got their cadence.

00:59:25.425 --> 00:59:26.800
And maybe through
the songs we'll

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:31.150
sing it'll inspire them to want
to do what we did back then.

00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:32.300
You know what I mean?

00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.636
So we'll try to do that.

00:59:34.636 --> 00:59:37.096
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:40.050 --> 00:59:41.483
What's your name?

00:59:41.483 --> 00:59:42.233
AUDIENCE: Justine.

00:59:42.233 --> 00:59:43.210

WYCLEF JEAN: Justine?

00:59:44.085 --> 00:59:44.709
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:59:44.709 --> 00:59:45.937
WYCLEF JEAN: OK.

00:59:45.937 --> 00:59:47.800

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:53.940
(SINGING) Justine,
you know what I mean.

00:59:57.610 --> 01:00:02.430
So sexy like a dream,
my Google girl.
