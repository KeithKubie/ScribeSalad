00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.870
So we just talked about how the evolution step in the case based reasoning

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.220
process when decided a correct solution in fact meets the requirements of

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.280
the given problem. Now that we have the new problem and the solution for

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.050
it, we can encapsulate them as a case, and store them in a case memory.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.170
We saw the advantages of this kind of storage earlier,

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.010
when we went from home to restaurant. We stored that case is memory so that

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.660
when wanted to go back from restaurant to home. We could retrieve that case and

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.740
try to adapt it. So case choice is an important way of learning.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.890
We are constantly accumulating and assimilating new cases. We talk

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.640
about two kinds of storage mechanisms. Indexing and discrimination crease.
