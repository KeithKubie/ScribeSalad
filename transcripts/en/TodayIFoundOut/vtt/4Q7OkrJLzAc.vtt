00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:10.820
The Real Reason Why Children Get the Summer
Off of School

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.920
The commonly touted explanation for students
having summers off from school dates back

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.830
to a time when the United States’ economy
relied heavily on agriculture in order to

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.010
survive.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.510
Students needed to leave school in the summer
in order to work on the farm alongside their

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.520
families.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.900
The U.S. is no longer the agrarian nation
that it once was, so why do students still

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.500
get the summer off from school?

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.329
Well, that is because the idea that the modern
school year is based off of one where students

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.030
needed to work on the farm during the summer
is false.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.200
The majority of farming work occurs in either
the spring or fall, so schools in rural parts

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.240
of the United States during and before the
early part of the 19th century typically only

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.480
held classes during the winter and summer
months.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.850
This allowed students time off to help plant
in the spring and harvest and sell crops in

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.489
the fall, and then they attended classes when
their families had less of a need for them

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:04.489
to work.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.250
All in all, students in rural schools attended
between five and six months of school per

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.250
year.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.890
On the other hand, schools serving students
in urban areas tended to remained open all

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.950
year with short breaks between academic quarters.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.030
But most states did not require students to
attend school until the 1870s, so classes

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.310
often suffered from poor attendance.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.259
Some school officials in Brooklyn reported
that only about half of their students attended

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.060
at least six months of classes during 1850.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.700
A number of factors, such as practicality
and parent wishes, transformed those two different

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.619
types of school years into the school year
of today.

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.549
Education reformers encouraged both urban
and rural schools to adopt a standardized

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.799
school year in order to get students across
the country on the same school schedule.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.310
This would make distributing standardized
tests and selling textbooks easier, among

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.380
other things.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.020
But a standardized school year meant that
rural and urban school officials needed to

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.759
compromise on when to hold classes.

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.540
At this point it was generally thought that
holding classes throughout the year could

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.360
be detrimental to students’ health, so the
schools needed to decide on when to allow

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.870
students a break from classes.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.040
The break would also give teachers time to
continue their own education and get ready

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.830
for the new school year.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.930
Summer became a natural choice for a term
away from school.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.330
Rural schools tended to be taught by teenage
girls in their mid- to late-teens in the summer,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.480
leading to a weaker term than in the winter
when students learned under older and more

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.810
experienced schoolmasters.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.920
Summer also worked for urban schools due to
the lack of air conditioning and the desires

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.000
of upper class and wealthy families to vacation
during those hot months.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.629
The added worry of a school that was both
hot and crowded potentially spreading a disease

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.209
also added to the decision to give students
summers off from school.

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.489
Today, there is a movement among some educators
and politicians to restructure the school

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.200
year so that students attend classes throughout
the year.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.940
The claim is that getting rid of summer vacation
would help students to perform on the same

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.310
academic level as students from other countries
by allowing for more hours of instruction.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.860
However, when the numbers are crunched, American
students appear to be spending the same amount

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.750
of time learning per year as students elsewhere
in the world, at least in classes.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.000
For instance, students from Massachusetts,
New York, California, Florida, and Texas all

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.400
spend 900 hours per year in school.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.140
Comparatively, students in India receive between
800 and 900 hours of in-school education per

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.940
year, while students in China receive 900
hours.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.720
Also contrary to the idea that more hours
are the answer, one of the highest rated education

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.510
systems in the world, Finland, only has their
students averaging about 608 hours of in-class

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.650
instruction per year.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.720
As you might have guessed from this, as with
just about everything, the issues at hand

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.010
resists such simplistic explanations and solutions.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.439
There is even a strong argument that students
in the U.S., on the whole, aren’t nearly

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:08.430
as far behind as is often claimed, though
of course there’s always vast room for improvement.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.560
For instance, the Programme for International
Student Assessment (PISA) assesses the competencies

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.430
of 15-year-olds in 65 countries and economies,
including in math.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.530
For 2012, the country/economy with the highest
scores in math was Shanghai-China, which was

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.180
closely followed by Singapore, Hong Kong-China,
Chinese Taipei and South Korea.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.680
Notably, Canada ranked 13th, Australia 19th,
Ireland 20th and the United Kingdom 26th.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.491
The United States’ kids ranked 36th.

00:04:37.491 --> 00:04:44.220
In fact, according to PISA, the performance
of one of the United States’ highest-scoring

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.560
states, Massachusetts, was so low, it was
as if those students had two fewer years of

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.080
mathematical education than the students in
Shanghai-China.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.040
PISA also noted that although the U.S. spends
more per student than most countries, this

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.340
doesn’t translate into performance.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.889
In 2012, per-student spending in the U.S.
was listed at $115,000, while in the Slovak

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:13.490
Republic, a country that performed at the
same level, they spend only $53,000 per student.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.699
However, the PISA’s results are drastically
over simplified.

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.479
For instance, as noted in a report by Dr.
Martin Carnoy of Stanford and Richard Rothstein

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.710
of the Economic Policy Institute, American
students actually perform better than the

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.030
much higher ranked Finland in algebra in general,
but worse in fractions.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.930
More importantly, when you normalize the results
between the countries, adjusting for the relative

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.370
poverty of the students taking the PISA tests,
the U.S performs significantly better, ranking

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.320
6th in reading and 13th in mathematics, a
drastic jump in both categories.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.669
Dr. Carnoy and Rothstein further note in their
report What Do International Tests Really

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.800
Show About U.S. Student Performance? that
when you divide the kids based on family wealth,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.669
the actual gap in performance isn’t so stark
between any country, with a not insignificant

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:11.100
portion of the ultimate ranking of each nation
being based on how many impoverished vs. middle

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.850
class vs. wealthy students are taking the
tests.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.990
For reference, about 40% of the schools the
PISA used in the U.S.’s sample had more

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.710
than 50% of their students eligible for free
lunch.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.980
So what about switching to year round schooling
with extra hours spent in the classroom?

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:29.980
Will it help?

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.180
After all, even if the U.S. isn’t so far
behind as is often claimed, that doesn’t

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.389
mean improvements shouldn’t be sought.

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:40.630
Year round schooling has been tried several
times in the last few decades in the U.S.,

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:46.680
such as efforts in Texas in the 1990s (peaking
at about 400 year-round schools) and California

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.500
in the 1980s (peaking at well over 500 schools
on this type of schedule).

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.730
The results were underwhelming.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.550
Test scores did not improve, attendance problems
were an issue at times (with families still

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.660
taking vacations, but now with students taking
off school at random times), and teachers

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:09.199
themselves were burning out (at a faster rate
than normal) with little spare time to pursue

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:10.660
required continuing education.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.880
Beyond the extra training outside of work
hours (along with grading, course planning,

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.520
corresponding with parents, etc. that also
generally doesn’t fall within paid hours),

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.539
as one educator, Heather Wolpert-Gawron, noted,
“Adult humans aren’t built to spend their

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:26.680
days with hundreds of children each day.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.430
It takes a lot out of an adult to have their
antennae up so high, so often, and so consistently.”

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:37.630
Beyond the teachers (and presumably students),
parents also tended not to like the switch,

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.780
due to cutting into family life and making
vacations difficult to manage.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.229
In the end, in the late 1980s when California
schools that had made the switch were given

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:53.490
the option to return to a more traditional
“summer off” schedule, 543 of 544 year-round

00:07:53.490 --> 00:08:09.970
schools chose to do so.
