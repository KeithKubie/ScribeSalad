&gt;&gt; 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:20.609
Role models are very important in the Middle
East. We are extremely in need of hope and

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.759
people expressing a lot of what they can overcome
from all those difficulties. For instance,

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:35.870
and I think now, as a Jew and Rabbi, about
the conflict with the Isreali's and Palestinians,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.500
and the ripped families, these people who
really suffer on both sides of war and attacks

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.170
and suppression and lose, lost there really
loved ones who cooperate together in peace

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:58.280
and hold each other's hands and go on thinking
of ways and doing things to increase peace.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.910
These are extremely important role models.
And you know, in my life, I was born during

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:14.970
the second World War and saved by a Catholic
woman who was 47 years old and when I speak

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.120
about my own experience. For instance, when
living with Rabbi's and Iman's a few years

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:29.270
ago, to pray together for peace suddenly the
mood changes. It's, here's an example, this

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.900
is of course in business, in culture, in not
only people who achieve greatness, but people

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:45.490
who find dignity and share dignity with others.
And I've seen it, mostly in my work in schools

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:53.110
that we ask for their respect and people of
the community come into the classroom and

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:00.740
discuss, how do you give respect, how do you
receive respect. And these are people who

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.940
are accomplished musicians, are anethesitists,
just simple people around the corner who work

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:14.569
with like Bill Gates. When they speak about
how their own life, how they went through

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:21.249
mistakes and this illusion have kept hope
and then achieved what they have achieved.

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:29.829
That helps the young people to go forward.
So in short, role models, we see it in sports,

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:38.889
we see it in the media, we see it in people
who are exceptional, how it works. Role models

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:46.040
are very important all through the world of
Islam, the world of Judism, Christianity where

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.719
we sometimes see the bad effect of religion
and inter-religous actions that's not how

00:02:52.719 --> 00:03:00.349
it works. To see role models where it works
when you have [inaudible] and dignity you

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:07.979
are creating an image of hope. So please continue
to be role models and find hope.
