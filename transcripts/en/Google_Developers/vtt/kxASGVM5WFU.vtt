WESLEY CHUN: Hi,
this is Wesley Chun,

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.860
Developer Advocate of Google.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.100
They say the only constant
in the world is change,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.470
and Google is no different.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.040
And in fact, Google won't
exist without change.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.950
So

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.180
[DRUM ROLL]

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.050
We're happy to announce that
the Launchpad Online video

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.760
series that you're familiar
with is branching out.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.290
IDO GREEN: Yes, we are.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.920
WESLEY CHUN: On the
Google API side,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.680
we're creating a new series
called "The G Suite Dev Show"

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.020
where we'll continue to
show you a variety of things

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.580
you can do with the G Suite set
of APIs and developer tools.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.840
Many upcoming videos will
be done in a similar style

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.280
as before, with code
samples and all.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.270
But we'll also feature no-code
episodes like use cases

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.110
with multiple APIs, best
practices, common API features,

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.470
and special guests
from time to time.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.980
Now, I'm happy to introduce
my friends, Alison and Ido,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.666
to tell you more about the
other side of the house.

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.040
IDO GREEN: On the
Launchpad side,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.620
the updated Launchpad
program is taking off,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.390
focusing on making your
startup more successful.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.090
As you know, Launchpad is Google
Developer's startup program.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.820
Our goal is to help you,
developers and entrepreneurs,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.684
through special
mentorship programs.

00:01:04.684 --> 00:01:06.975
Even if you can't attend one
of our programs in person,

00:01:06.975 --> 00:01:09.810
we will bring here a lot
of the useful solutions

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.100
that we learned about.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.000
This series is
going to be focused

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.750
on startup best
practices that we

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.360
develop after
working with hundreds

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.429
of startups in the past years.

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.970
ALISON CARROLL: And if you're
in San Francisco, come visit us

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.580
at our new Launchpad
space where you

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.890
can get free technical training,
one-on-one mentoring, and more

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.020
education, all aimed at
driving your success.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.850
IDO GREEN: Join us on
our YouTube channel,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.017
and at
developers.google.com/startups.

00:01:34.017 --> 00:01:35.100
WESLEY CHUN: Thanks, guys.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.680
While our existing video
series is splitting up,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.240
our goal is to further enhance
the overall Google Developer

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.100
experience, and we believe
that two is better than one.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.510
Now we'll have a
pair of programs

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.447
to help you become
more successful.

00:01:46.447 --> 00:01:48.280
Thanks for tuning in,
and we'll see you soon

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.840
on "The G Suite Dev Show" and--

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.300
IDO AND ALISON: See you
soon on the Launchpad.
