&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra:
Good morning.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.530
Welcome to the Library and
the Veterans History Project.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.830
We're so glad you're here.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.130
Can everyone hear me?

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.240
I have a cold, so, yeah, great.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.850
I'm so, so just honored
and pleased to be here

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.340
in recognition of Veteran's Day
with colleagues and friends,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.660
our amazing panelists all day
for this all-day symposium.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.950
The Veteran's History
Project, as you probably know,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.690
was started in October of 2000
through unanimous legislation

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.400
of Congress and passed into
law by then President Clinton.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.180
And we have over 108,000
individual stories

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.950
of first-person veteran's
experience from World War I

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.360
through the recent
conflicts, and those come to us

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.260
through voluntary donation
from the people who create them

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.750
from all over the country.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.200
Some of them we create ourselves
with our staff and colleagues,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.650
and the vast majority,
though, come from donation.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.500
The Veteran's History Project
considers a first-person

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.150
narrative to be anything
that speaks

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.680
to that first-person experience,
whether it is an oral history,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.950
our specifications are 30
minutes or longer of audio

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.750
or video oral history.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.330
But also, items of personal
reflection that tell

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.820
that narrative arc,
so collections of ten

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.130
or more photographs,
letters, documents,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.180
or 20 or more pages
of journal or memoir.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.960
And that gets us to today and
one of the reasons that we're

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.090
so excited to kick off this
symposium, The Road Back,

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.340
looking at poetry and
literature, participating in it,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.510
creating it, discussing
it, to cope with

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.260
and express the veterans'
experience.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.760
I'm really excited to
introduce you to our panelists,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.880
and I'll do that
in just a second.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.310
But I also wanted to
acknowledge our panelists

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.670
from the second panel who
will be with us this afternoon

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.550
and invite you to
stay, grab some lunch

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.180
and come back and
see that panel.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.640
And we also have a film this
afternoon in the Pickford.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.670
Just so you know,
that's across the street

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.440
in the Madison Building.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.160
And while you're here,
you might as well check

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.040
out the World War I
exhibit, which is part

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.580
of the reason we're
all gathering today.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.650
So to begin, I'd like to
share a little bit about each

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.640
of the panelists who are going
to be speaking with us today

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.420
and a little bit about
their organizations.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.340
Immediately to my left
is Lovella Calica.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.230
She is a writer,
and I'm reading this

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.110
because I want to get it right.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.060
A writer, photographer
and multimedia artist.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.620
She is the founder and
director of Warrior Writers,

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.920
a creative community

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.820
for veterans articulating
their experiences.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.760
She has edited four
anthologies of veterans' writing

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.130
and artwork, has received
three art and change grants

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.630
from the Leeway Foundation
and was honored

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.590
with the Transformation
Award in 2009.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.060
A self-published author of
two chat books of her poetry,

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.030
she is currently at
work on her next book.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.490
Lovella is a cofounder

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.630
of the Pilipino-American artist
collective, Tatlo Mestizas

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.980
and served on the board

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.890
of Culture Trust
Greater Philadelphia.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.030
Having worked closely with
primarily post-9/11 veterans

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.160
for 14 years, she has trained
staff of arts organizations

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.430
and universities around the
country on how to better work

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.480
with and understand veterans.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.720
She is also part of the
Caregiver Program of the VA.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.510
A little about Warrior Writers.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.250
It's a national nonprofit based
in Philadelphia whose mission is

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.550
to create a culture

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.590
that articulates
veterans' experiences,

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.640
builds a collaborative community
for artistic expression

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.830
and bears witness to
war and the full range

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.160
of military experiences.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.750
They employ writing, painting,
photography and a host

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.600
of other mediums to reflect
on those personal experiences

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.850
and express them creatively.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.460
Just to her left is
Mohammed Sheriff.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.040
Can I say Moe for everyone?

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.820
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Yes.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.120
&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra:
Moe is a literature

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.850
and arts education
division coordinator

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.480
at the National Endowment
for the Arts.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.590
Before taking this position,
he managed the translation

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.900
and creative writing
fellowship programs for the NEA.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.280
Prior to the NEA,
he spent four years

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.080
in the United States Marine
Corps and served in Korea,

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.780
Kuwait, Japan, Marshall
Islands and Iraq.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.810
He received his MFA and
arts graduate certificate

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.300
from American University.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.010
As you may know, the
National Endowment

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.560
for the Arts was established
by Congress in 1965.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.760
It is an independent
federal agency whose funding

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.970
and support gives Americans
the opportunity to participate

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.350
in the arts, exercise
their imaginations

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.910
and develop their
creative capacities.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.980
Through partnerships with state
arch agencies, local leaders,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.210
other federal agencies and
the philanthropic sector,

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.320
the NEA supports arts,
learning, affirms

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.960
and celebrates America's rich
and diverse cultural heritage

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.840
and extends its work to
promote equal access to the arts

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.980
in every community
across America.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.310
I love our collection of names.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.270
Stefanie Takacs is
the executive director

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.290
of the Touchstone
Discussion Project

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.370
where she leads organizational
management

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.380
and oversees educational
curriculum and development,

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.910
teacher training and coaching.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.290
She codesigned with
Howard Zeiderman,

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.270
Touchstone's cofounder,
completing The Odyssey,

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.680
a Journey Home, an NEH, National
Endowment for the Humanities,

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.330
funded program for veterans,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.140
among other numerous
Touchstone Discussion Programs

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.540
and several textbooks she
developed or codeveloped.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.230
She is also the author
of five books

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.830
on first peoples published
by Scholastic Press.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.400
Miss Takacs earned a BA from
Saint Johns College in Annapolis

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.220
and an MS in educational
psychology

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.390
from Fordham University.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.090
As part of her commitment to
ensuring all people have access

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.220
to Touchstone's educational
programs,

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.930
she runs two weekly
discussion groups as a volunteer

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.340
within the Maryland Correctional
Institute for women.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.300
The Touchstone Discussion
Project is an educational

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.420
nonprofit dedicated to
building critical thinkers

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.720
and collaborative leaders

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.930
through inclusive
dialog and community.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.250
Since 1984, their
programs have engaged more

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.320
than five million people from
school children to [inaudible],

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.000
from the most vulnerable
and at-risk populations

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.820
to executives and
political leaders.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.600
Rooted in collaborative
learning and leading,

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.910
they use a train the leader
approach and replicable programs

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.470
to partner with teachers,
leaders, community builders

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.540
and volunteers running
Touchstone discussion groups

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.900
in 47 countries and
in six languages.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.180
So you see, it's quite a panel.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:34.580
VHP, the Veterans History
Project, is a program

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.460
of the American Folklife Center
here at the Library of Congress.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.020
And it has been known
since the beginning

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.480
when it was called the
Veterans Oral History Project

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.360
as primarily an effort
of oral history.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.130
However, as I mentioned
earlier, we also seek

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.140
to capture the personal
narrative of veterans

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:59.160
and their experience and notice
the influence and the emphasis

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.470
on personal narrative
as expressed

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:06.390
through the way they want to do
that themselves through letters,

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.860
journal, diaries
and creative works.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.180
Those creative works
are two-dimensional.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.750
We are not looking
for sculptures

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.720
of spent ammunition, thank you.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.460
But we are looking for poems and
other ways of self-expression

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.580
and that two-dimensional
capacity poetry.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.040
And I'm going to
take this with me

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.420
and disappear behind the podium,

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:33.780
because I found this
amazing collection

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.050
that I think really
illustrates a lot

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.560
of what we're talking
about here today.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.840
This is Joseph Rosenblum, and
you can see one of the 80 pages

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.650
of his journal from World War I.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.730
Mr. Rosenblum was born
in Romania, in Romania,

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.370
and he was drafted into the
US Army in April of 1918.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:59.490
He served in the states
in field artillery.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.500
In between guard duty
and 13-mile hikes

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.340
and all the other
duties you normally hear

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.790
about in these journals
and diaries and expressions

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:12.530
of veterans' experience,
he actually talks more

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.200
about the sonnets and
fugues that he was thinking

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.150
about from his time
playing the piano.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:23.380
And his entire journal isn't
full of the daily doldrums

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.650
of what it was like to be
a soldier, but instead,

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.230
of how Voltaire made
an impression on him.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:33.120
Of how Tolstoy made
an impression on him.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.780
I love this page in particular.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.310
Down at the bottom
you can perhaps see

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:41.740
in his beautifully
expressive script,

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.100
one is made to kiss their books,

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:49.030
expressing such truth
and sincere thought.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:54.920
So you can see from this how
much even in the midst of duty,

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.930
the need to express
and create and interact

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:02.100
with these items can be
so important to veterans.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.700
One other collection I want
to draw your attention to is

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.830
that of Rona Marie Knox Prescott
who served during Vietnam

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.280
as a nurse in country,
and unfortunately,

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.950
lost a dear friend of hers

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:18.660
through really difficult
circumstances.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.070
But when she came back,
she found solace in poetry.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.010
And her poems brought
her great comfort,

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.210
and she left them
at the Vietnam Wall.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.370
Because she left them
at the Vietnam Wall,

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:32.470
the family of her friend, who
passed away, was able to connect

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.910
with her, and they found
solace in her poems.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.320
So I just set these sort of,
to beg a terrible analogy,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.540
touch stones to our
conversation here this morning.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.490
And I'll go ahead and sit down
now and join our panelist.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.200
The format will go this way.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.810
I'll ask them questions, and
they will respond to them,

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.440
hopefully, in a conversational
manner.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.800
And then towards the
end, we'll try to engage

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.670
with some questions for
those of you in the audience.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.970
Thank you.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.980
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Test, test.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.280
It's on.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.430
&gt;&gt; Stefanie Takacs:
I don't think I'm on.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:14.730
&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra:
So thank you, again,

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.010
for being here with us.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.890
This question I thought
it would be nice to throw

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:24.600
out to all three of you
for considering, which is,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.850
I just gave two examples
of collections that are,

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:39.300
that are so important from the
personal narrative perspective,

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.640
and I'm wondering if you
could talk a little bit,

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.080
anyone who wants to go first,
from your experience in the work

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.460
that you've done either
in your organizations

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.930
or as an individual that's
military-connected or a veteran.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.600
A little bit about
the importance

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:02.410
of self-framing their
narrative for veterans and how

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:06.280
that relates to the
creative and coping process.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.640
Is that too tough to start with?

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.430
Is that a tough questions?

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.730
&gt;&gt; Lovella Calica:
Jump right in.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.810
&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra:
Is that too much?

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.130
Well, you want to think
on that one, and Stef,

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.950
I'll throw you one I think
it'll be easier for you.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.250
Would that be easier?

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.140
&gt;&gt; Stefanie Takacs: I can
speak to the initial question.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:32.390
I think for us, in this work
that we started with veterans,

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.470
while our work in prison
for many, many years,

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.100
has included incarcerated
veterans.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.150
The work that we did through
the NEH-funded program,

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:45.460
titled Completing the
Odyssey, a Journey Home,

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:50.150
really gave us an opportunity to
hear from veterans, perhaps even

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:54.360
for themselves even for the
first time, an articulation

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.640
of what their experience
of service was like.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.620
For many of the veterans,
what they discovered

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.240
and what we discovered along
with them through their process

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.620
of revisiting and
exploring experience,

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:15.550
was a current relevance
of that experience.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.760
And they may have tucked it away

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:25.480
and not really revisited
those memories or the,

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.340
any of the connections that
they had made to others

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.450
or the connections of
service to their current life.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:36.930
It really was a moment of
reintegration in ways I think

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.880
for many of them that they
had not really been afforded

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.680
or given themselves before.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.620
&gt;&gt; Lovella Calica: I think to
follow up on that, I think it's,

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:52.030
I think in some ways, you
know, society expects veterans

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.610
to have certain specific
experiences, you know,

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.460
sometimes the victim
or the hero,

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.260
and I think when
you do the writing,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.980
when you encourage people
to do honest writing,

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.520
they get to a place
where they're sort

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.050
of pushing past those, you know,

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:09.180
stereotypical feelings
and experiences.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:14.550
And you allow, you hope
to allow veterans to come

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:18.030
to a better place of digging
deeper and maybe seeing things

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.490
in a different way and
seeing things in a way

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:21.790
that they couldn't before.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.630
So in the military, you know,
you can only think a certain way

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.250
or believe certain
things or, you know,

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.630
if you're in a hospital
setting, you know,

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.520
maybe you can't really talk
about some of the problems

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.820
with the care you're receiving.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.670
And I think for us
it's really important

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.660
that we encourage
veterans at Warrior Writers

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.200
to just not censor
themselves and be really,

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.650
push for that honesty and
be really open and come

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.350
to deeper realizations.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:47.650
And through the writing do that.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.360
So, you know, some of
them have said, you know,

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.190
I'm facing problems
with my care.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.390
Or I feel guilty
about what I did.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.410
So I think, I think in a lot

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.610
of places you can't really
say what you need to say

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.510
or you can't maybe feel angry
or you can't feel betrayed

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.810
or you can't feel guilt.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.320
And I think it's
just really important

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.200
that veterans can feel just like
anybody else, whatever they need

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.060
to feel and say what they
need to feel about it.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.960
So I think framing
it that way is,

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.900
in terms of like just
being really open

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.910
to whatever needs
to come out is okay.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.560
And I think in certain
cases, you know,

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.840
not everybody's willing
or able to hear that.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.400
But I think it's just
really important.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.460
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Yeah, I
think for me, specifically,

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.340
writing was always
something I always engaged in.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.690
And for me, writing my personal
experiences sort of starts

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.140
from my childhood, I have
to go all the way back.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.290
So my parents are from Liberia,
and we came to this country

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.360
because of the Liberian
Civil War.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:49.420
So we were in the war for at
least a year with all kinds of,

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.310
you know, terrible experiences.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.470
And that sort of,
that experience sort

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.500
of put a signature on my
entire life, right, you know.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:01.680
And I think, for me, after going
through the military and going

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.540
to the military to
sort of understand what

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.800
that crazy experience was.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.010
For me, the writing
was a way of sort

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:11.320
of making those experiences
abstract where I could look

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.730
at them and see, this
would speak to this,

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.260
and this would speak
to this, right.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.080
And to your point of being able
to express yourself openly,

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.550
it was something I always did

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.390
because I had to
get it out, right.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.460
And for me, writing was that
medium that just played so well.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.480
Even when I was in Iraq, I
would write every day, you know,

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.750
because it just had to, if
it didn't come through me,

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.450
it would just stay in me, right.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.420
And then, you know,
going to do my MFA,

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.080
they sort of structure what
you're saying and allow you

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.540
to really frame yourself
and see yourself on a page

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.380
to make yourself a
character, right,

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.480
where you can really
objectively look at yourself.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.140
And it's extremely cathartic,
obviously, and useful.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.070
&gt;&gt; Lovella Calica: I think too,
writing, what we talk about is

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.850
that it provides a
little bit of distance.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.150
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Yeah.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.450
&gt;&gt; Lovella Calica: So you
can kind of look at it

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.280
with a different perspective
instead of being in it

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.220
and all these experiences being
in your head and on top of you.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.500
You have that distance and
you say, well, you know,

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.040
what word do I want to use?

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.340
Or what was that
experience really?

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:13.120
And so it's kind of like playing
with Tetris or, you know,

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.450
just kind of figuring it out
and you have that distance

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.200
and it allows just
a little space.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.250
And then you have that
perspective and you can see it

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:23.200
in a different way than sort
of being consumed by anything.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.500
&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra: It's
interesting when you talk

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.810
about making it abstract and
making yourself a character

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.700
and finding that distance.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.830
It leads me to consider
a little bit

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:39.650
about what Touchstones is doing
with the like Homer's Odyssey.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.240
And I'm wondering, Stef, if
you could talk a little bit

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:48.470
about the role of existing
works of poetry and literature

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.340
and examining veterans'
experience,

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.590
because it strikes me that
those themes are very connected.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.460
&gt;&gt; Stefanie Takacs: When we were
looking at our program design,

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:03.040
part of the structure was to
include works of literature

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.150
from two different
periods of conflict.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.270
So we had the Odyssey
representing an

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.960
ancient conflict.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.180
And then we wove in
more contemporary voices

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:19.510
through personal accounts
and fiction and poetry.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:25.690
And so for us, those
literary excerpts

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:30.330
or selections are
similar in the way

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.080
that you described
providing distance.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:37.490
For us, the text also
provides distance.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:43.400
It allows some space between
the immediate experience.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:48.340
And you read about whatever
it is that Odysseus is doing

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.900
and considering how your,

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:55.460
one's own experience
is or is not like that.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:19:00.720
That distance allows you to
sort of go closer or not, right.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.200
You can sort of choose
how close you want

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.360
to get until you're ready.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.440
And we bring in the
more contemporary piece,

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.850
which really is closer,
simply the language is closer,

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.740
the experience is closer.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:21.310
So it was very interesting to
sort of watch over the course

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:27.260
of the discussions how the
veterans would first look

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:32.560
at this ancient work and relate
their own experiences to it.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.530
And then look at a more
contemporary piece.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.060
And it would become
much more, you know,

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.970
closer to home, obviously.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:44.500
And I think in that, being
able to take those risks,

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:50.680
that are part of
that self-exploration

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:55.880
and using these, whether it's
writing or pieces of literature

00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.350
as tools for self-examination.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.800
&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra:
In your experience

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.320
in helping the veterans
see themselves or maybe

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.080
from personal experience,
as a central character

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:17.060
to this larger story, did you
find specifically you, Stefanie,

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.940
but anybody who wants to answer,

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.050
did you find it shifted
the way it expressed

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:28.120
as the program goes along, the
way they expressed themselves?

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.780
&gt;&gt; Stefanie Takacs: We did find
that, and part of what was,

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:36.990
I think for us, really
so meaningful in terms

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:38.290
of the feedback at the end

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:41.790
of the program was the
veterans themselves recognized

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:47.030
that there had been a lot of
movement within them personally.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:54.580
And sort of a type of redefining
of and reclaiming of experience

00:20:54.580 --> 00:21:00.750
that they may really not have
known what to do with prior

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.530
to going through this process.

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:07.680
But I think it was, and
with the writing, it's also,

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.140
it's the process, right.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.760
This takes place over time.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.650
And I think that's a really
an essential component

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:24.090
in having this become
fruitful for each individual,

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.390
on an individual basis.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.540
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff:
Yeah, I think, you know,

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:33.290
I think it's a really great
narrative out right now,

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.110
kind of empowering in words,
but anything [inaudible].

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.020
For me, reading those
narratives, it's sort of,

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.600
it's like when you meet
another veteran, you guys,

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.320
it's almost like you speak
a different language.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.140
You understand point by point
exactly what the experience is.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.440
And you're speaking words,

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.670
but you're seeing a whole
world attached to that.

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:53.970
And that's not experience.

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.830
I think, oftentimes when
I'm reading something,

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.130
I'm like do they even
get what's going on here?

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:58.430
Because this is like
speaking to you.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:59.730
This is my experience.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.150
And you see yourself, you
know, luminating in some sense.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.450
And it feels like home.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.860
It feels like, yes, this is my
voice, this is my experience.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.660
I'm not alone in this, right.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.420
You also get a chance to revisit
it in a safe space, right.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.810
And I think that's very
important, at least a safe space

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:20.010
in your head, I guess,
because it affects you.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.730
But it's just the other half of
why I think writing, you know.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.280
&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra: It's
interesting that you say that,

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.140
because it seems like it
doesn't matter where in time

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.950
that veteran's voice
is coming from.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.340
Is that true for you personally?

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.640
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.940
&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra:
That's really interesting.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.040
We face this theory,
this conception,

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.470
maybe it's a misconception,

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.360
quite a bit in the
work we do here

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.660
at the Veteran's
History Project,

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:49.030
this notion that veterans
are reticent to talk

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:53.430
about their experience and
that, you know, oh, you know,

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.610
my dad served or my mom
served, but she just,

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.210
she really doesn't want
to talk about that.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.140
Or my director served,
and she thinks her story

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.440
isn't important.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.410
You know, there's sort of this
barrier that you have to get

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:09.160
across about that they're
not just reticent to speak

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.780
about their experience
but that that pushes them

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.840
to another direction
of also being resistant

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.040
to seeking support
or help or therapy.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.580
And you know, there's this
notion they talked about this

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.590
that there's no I in team.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:27.290
And you know, from a veteran's
perspective, you are so used

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:30.400
to being, having a
mission and having a team.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:35.640
And I'm wondering,
specifically, I'm thinking here

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.040
of stuff here and Lovella.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:41.080
But if you'd like to talk from
that first-person experience.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.080
If you could both
share a little bit

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.870
about how do you overcome
those potential barriers

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:48.220
to participation?

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.970
Is that a concept that
affects your work?

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:52.430
And to make it really
complicated,

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.250
I'll throw another
twist in there.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:58.930
How do you overcome that
barrier to reach the veterans

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:02.010
with whom you work, and
then how do you expand

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:05.040
that past just the
veterans that you're working

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.540
with in this moment
to get your message

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:12.290
across to other key
stakeholders in the community?

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.310
&gt;&gt; Lovella Calica: Well I think,
first of all, to your point

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:17.520
about it's hard for people to
talk about, veterans to talk

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.820
about their experiences.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.040
I mean I think that's
based in history, right.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.010
So for how many years
has everybody been told,

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.140
oh don't ask grandpa
about the war, right.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.040
So that's a cultural thing
that's been happening

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.830
for however many years.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.270
And I think our generation
it's different now

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.570
because we have Facebook.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:34.870
We have Instagram.

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:36.170
We have all these things where
everybody's trying to speak.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:37.900
So I think that's changing.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.270
But part of it, it's culture.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.770
And I know about, you know,
I've read about veterans

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.390
who came home and sort of
people didn't want to hear

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:46.690
about their experience.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.040
Or they started to talk, and
then everybody left the room.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:54.870
So, I think it's hard to
also find opportunities

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:56.640
to really talk about
those things.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.820
Like, you know, you're not just
going to walk up to someone

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.580
in a bar and say oh,
so how was it in Iraq?

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.310
And if you do, it's not
really the right moment

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:04.610
or space to do that.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.590
And you also don't know if that
person is going to ask you,

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.920
have you ever killed anybody?

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.760
You know, so we need
to create these spaces

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.810
that are appropriate
to talk about.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:14.780
So the things that we're
doing with Warrior Writers

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.070
and Touchstones Project,
these are the ways

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:21.880
that people are able to do this
because the space and the time

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.340
and the moment was created to
say okay, we're going to talk

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.830
in depth about these things.

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:27.240
And one of the things

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.900
that Warrior Writers does
is we do these working

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.730
with vets 101 training where
we say, don't ask things like,

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.030
did you ever kill anybody.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.060
You know, we talk about
posttraumatic stress.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:38.100
We talk about how these things
happen and how to interact

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.660
with veterans in a
way that's healthy

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.820
and supportive to
really listening.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:47.320
In terms of speaking about these
things and also seeking help,

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.040
I think that's culture too.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.710
So it wasn't until
the 80s I think

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.860
that posttraumatic stress
was even put into the books

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.730
as a real disorder
or a real condition.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:01.550
So, now that everybody knows
that it's a thing, that's good.

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:03.970
But we still need to talk
about what that really means,

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.080
and we need to make it
okay to talk about that.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.300
So at Warrior Writers we
say it's okay to be angry.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.000
It's okay to talk
about these issues.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.120
And we're not therapists.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.420
I'm not a therapist.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.330
None of our team members are.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:19.400
But we are connected, we are
well-connected to resources

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.650
and alternative healing
and other people

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:24.380
and other opportunities
for people to get support.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.130
So, we don't just say
go talk to a therapist.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:28.350
We'll say, hey, do you
want some referrals.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.110
Do you want me to sit with
you while you call someone?

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.150
Do you want me to take
you to an appointment?

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:34.980
And we follow up with
people and we say, you know,

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.280
there's also acupuncture.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.580
There's also massage.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:38.880
There's also reiki.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.180
There's lots of other
opportunities.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.730
And I think, you know,
culturally, we're sort of stuck

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:44.670
in this talk therapy thing
which not everybody likes to do,

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.280
veterans or not,
especially veterans.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.910
But also just kind of
thinking about the whole self

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:52.280
and the whole body in
terms of what that means.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.950
And also not just, it's
not just that veteran's job

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:58.360
to go get help, but it's our
job as culture and society

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.210
and community to be involved
in this reintegration process.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.160
I think people see the VA
and they see, you know,

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.460
these programs out
there for vets.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.950
So the veterans are
getting taken care of.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:08.680
Well, no, that's all
our responsibility.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:12.460
The VA is not funded enough, and
we can all be engaged in this.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.670
And so for Warrior
Writers, we really believe

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.070
that art can help do that.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.380
And it allows people
a way to connect.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.830
You can really say
things through art

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:23.200
that you can't easily
say just on a panel

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.510
or an academic conversation.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.520
So I think with art and
community involvement,

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.850
we can really sort of set the
stage and say this is an open

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.370
and welcoming space for healing
and connection and talking

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:37.180
about these hard things that's
there's not really opportunities

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.860
for in everyday life.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.800
&gt;&gt; Stefanie Takacs: I think
in our experience, which is --

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.660
&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra: Pardon me.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.970
&gt;&gt; Stefanie Takacs: very
similar, the initial approach

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:55.800
with gaining trust from
people requires time.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:01.150
And that is not something
that can be accelerated.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:06.160
So we build that
into our programs.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.880
And we, these are
not one of moments

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.340
where people come together.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:17.130
But these are, you know, eight,
nine, ten-week long programs.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:21.100
We also have brought
veterans in to train veterans

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.670
to run the discussions together

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:26.200
so that it is a partnership
already.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:31.250
Going across the different
line from civilian to veteran

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:37.760
and building trust across
those different sectors

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.410
of our society.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:45.870
Going forward, what, in training
veterans to run the program

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:50.290
that we developed
through that NEH funding,

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.760
one of those discussion leaders
is a Vietnam veteran then took

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.270
the program to a homeless
shelter in Baltimore City

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:03.560
and replicated the program there
with a very different population

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.180
of veterans than who we had
seen in our first two programs.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:11.890
But that is part of
our hope and our aim is

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:15.110
that these are highly
replicable programs.

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:19.580
And when veterans themselves are
trained, then it's no longer,

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.760
it can go out and have wings,

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.990
and their work can
reach other people.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:28.930
Because the level of trust
from veteran to veteran is

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:34.050
so much greater initially
than what we could hope

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:36.240
to achieve as civilians.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:41.980
But that is, as we look at our
next iterations of programs,

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.740
we are, not only will we
replicate the work that we did

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:50.850
with the Odyssey Program,
but we are building a program

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:55.440
that is deliberately bringing
civilians and veterans together

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.230
to look at a couple of works.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:03.190
And we hope that, again, we'll
be able to train veterans,

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.950
and we'll also train civilians
in that program to then take

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:10.720
that program out to
other communities.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:18.710
So I think the need is great and
creating opportunity for people

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:22.480
as volunteers to
have something to do.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.490
I think many people aren't
sure what they can do.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:30.700
And so, you know, I think that
that's part of what these types

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.310
of programs are offering
to people.

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:35.040
&gt;&gt; Lovella Calica: To add to
that, I think it's important

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.140
to recognize the value of
veterans' family members.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.780
So I'm a military family
member as well as you.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:47.130
I think that the family
member community is interested

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:49.900
in engaging and talking
and getting the veterans

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.280
to talk about this stuff.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.730
So I think we also, Warrior
Writers also got an NEH grant,

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:56.580
the dialogues and the
experiences of war.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.110
And so we're doing
discussions in Philly,

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.490
and we have family members
as part of that as well.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:05.310
So I think the family members
are interested in coming out

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:08.530
and participating and, you know,
there's lots of conversations

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.810
across the, you know,
veteran community

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.110
about engaging family
members more.

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:15.090
Because the family members,
I think, well obviously,

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:16.390
they have access
to the veterans.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:19.000
But also, they are really
looking and needing the kind

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.100
of support and conversation
because obviously,

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.290
it affects us all so intimately.

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:26.170
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Yeah,
I'll just piggyback off

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:28.290
of that your earlier point.

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:29.800
I think there's something
greatly unique

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.120
to having a community of people
who are focused on writing

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.420
but also focused on
veterans' writing.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:38.580
I think there's a distinction
there when I was in my MFA,

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.140
and it was okay because, you
know, you become this anomaly

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.520
and you're writing
about something

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.220
from a unique perspective.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:48.110
But it's also very isolating,
and you feel alone and you feel

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.410
like you're saying something.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.190
And you're very scared to say
all the things you want to say.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:54.120
You're really scared
to write all the things

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.920
that you really want to write
in the way that you want

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.660
to express it, because
you are self-conscious

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.200
about how you will be perceived.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.060
The difference of this
community is that everyone sort

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.360
of shares that experience.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.350
Everyone has quote/unquote
extreme things

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:07.650
to express, right.

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:10.410
And there's a safe space
where you don't feel judged.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:11.950
Where you don't feel
like you're saying

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.080
to much or doing too much.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.480
And that's why I think it's
very unique to have these places

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.830
and get the word out for
veterans to go to these type

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:22.480
of places as opposed
to your regular MFA.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.890
&gt;&gt; Lovella Calica: And
I think that the trick

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:26.610
about what you're
talking about too is

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.790
if you're the only veteran in
that space then they're going

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:30.600
to see your experience as
the veteran experience.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.900
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff:
Right, exactly.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.200
&gt;&gt; Lovella Calica: And
I think we, you know,

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.230
we really need to push those.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.680
You know, you mentioned
a couple of books.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.320
The books out there right now,
you know, Phil Cly [phonetic],

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.050
Kevin Powers, these are also
all like straight white males.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:47.310
So we really need to push
to include those voices

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:50.750
of the female veterans, people
of color, indigenous veterans,

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:53.930
queer veterans, they're out
there, and their voices need

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:55.600
to be held to the light.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.760
And if we don't do that,
you know, we're just sort

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.830
of hearing the same sort of
stories and also just kind

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:05.350
of saying okay, this is
the veteran experience,

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.620
and we just really need
to push back on that.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.460
&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra:
So many themes here

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.930
that I was really hoping we'd
get to exploring the notion

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:16.520
of veteran to veteran is
something we've been talking

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.810
about with some of
the other panelists

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:21.850
in the conversations
leading up to this symposium.

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:26.650
The notion of where the
powerful connection happen.

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:30.110
It doesn't have to be veteran to
veteran, or can you reach past

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.040
that because from our
perspective, part of the power

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.350
of the work that we do at the
Veterans History Project is

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:39.210
in connecting people to
the veteran and giving them

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:42.400
that tool for a meaningful
activity

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.190
that exempt inappropriate
questions

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.640
or uncomfortable questions,
but allows them to do

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.260
that important self-framing.

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:54.490
And the notion of it
sounds a lot like the ways

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.300
in which you overcome
those barriers

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.430
to finding the veteran is
through that veteran pipeline,

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:01.700
veteran to veteran, family
member to family member

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:06.680
and that need to have the
authentic beyond putting a

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:10.440
flier, you know, at the library
or the local coffee shop.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:15.010
But one thing that you've each
touched on too is, you know,

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:17.650
the work that each of
us does really dances

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:21.740
around that we are not
medical professionals.

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.210
We're not sociologists.

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:25.880
We're not people
who are counselors.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.850
But we're engaged in work
that enables self-expression

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:31.760
and so enables a
kind of freedom.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.480
And I'm wondering
if you could talk,

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.690
and I think really all three
of you would have things to say

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:40.220
about this, but this idea

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:45.110
about these writing programs
can sometimes be or working

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:48.750
with arts or working
with discussion,

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:54.030
that it's therapeutic.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:59.670
But is there some other, what
other benefit or, I mean,

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:03.340
if we're not therapists, why
are we all here doing this?

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.380
Is there some other benefit
that isn't therapeutic

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.010
to what this process is?

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:10.960
And would you mind
talking a little bit

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.780
about specifically
the creative process

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:17.530
and whether that's tapping
into existing creative items

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:20.280
or engaging in the
creative process that you,

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.530
from your perspective,
see as beneficial

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:23.830
to the veterans you're
working with.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:25.880
You want to go first, Moe.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.180
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Yeah, sure.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:31.440
I would say, I mean the
one daunting this is

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.640
that veterans commit
suicide a lot

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.530
because they don't have
a certain space or venue

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.370
or outlet for a lot of things.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.910
I think that, number one, just
reaching people, allowing people

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:47.550
to be visible and deal with
their issues and get it out

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.630
and feel like they can do
that in the same space.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:53.230
I think that alone is a good
measure for why it's important.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:58.160
I think, you know, taking your
experiences that are terrible

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.190
or maybe deemed terrible
and making art

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:02.650
out of it helps other
people, right.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:04.320
If I see that and I
see that experience

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.760
and I know I'm not alone in this
experience, but also you get

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.060
to own your experience.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:09.360
It doesn't own you.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.660
And I think that's
the most important.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.520
And that's not something
that you come

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.230
across in any other
sense, right.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:18.280
Like art allows you to feel
like I own this experience.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.580
I crafted.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:20.880
I make it.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.180
I mold it.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.480
I present it.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.780
You know, I can make the most
horrible things sound beautiful

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.080
and poetic and all
these other things.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.380
But I own that, right.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.020
It doesn't own me,
and it's not in me

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.020
and it's not tearing
me apart, right.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.560
I think that, and giving
somebody the awareness of that,

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:41.110
to have that ability of
power, I think is, you know,

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:42.550
absolutely worthwhile.

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:45.660
&gt;&gt; Lovella Calica: I think
for a lot of veterans that,

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.940
so we work with active duty
service members in the D.C. area

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.170
who a lot of them are
sort of getting gout

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:52.970
of the military,
transitioning out.

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:54.930
And I think there is at the end

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:58.110
of that military career
a question of identity

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:00.300
and purpose and mission.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:07.010
And so I think that the artistic
process I think can really be

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.400
helpful in figuring
out, you know,

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.010
who am I now, what am I now.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:14.480
We do a prompt with the
active duty service members,

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.670
sort of when I say I
am an American soldier.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:21.080
And so we encourage them to
say when I say I'm a parent

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.200
or a teacher or a lawyer

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.060
or whatever other identities
they're starting to dig

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.010
into in thinking about
what's next for them.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:31.730
So I think it's helpful in terms
of finding identify, you know,

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.790
obviously a lot of folks we
work with find a new identity

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:38.720
and purpose in writing and
art and sharing that process

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.790
with other veterans
and disadvantaged youth

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.610
or whomever they
want to work with.

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:49.240
I think the other part is to
speak back to another point

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:54.330
that I made about sort of
painting the full picture

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:57.190
of the military experience.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:00.290
So I think sometimes
veterans assume, it's okay,

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:03.980
that we're sort of asking them
to paint a specific picture.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.160
Okay, we're only looking for
the combat medic to paint this,

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.520
you know, sort of gory picture
of their military experience.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.680
Well, that's not what
we're looking for.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.560
We want to paint the
full picture of the range

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.180
of military experiences.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:19.310
And so we want every
piece of that puzzle.

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:22.500
We want the full painting,
and it's really important

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.040
that everybody is part of that.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:28.690
And so I think knowing
that your story

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:32.200
and your perspective is
part of the broader picture

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.940
and not just sort of feeding,
you know, society and the media

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.150
and the, you know,
the movies, you know,

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:39.450
the same sort of thing.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.200
But that there are
boring days of war, right.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.690
Or that military
sexual trauma happens.

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:47.450
Or, you know, all these
different sort of experiences

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:49.050
that are not part
of the mainstream.

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:52.080
And I think it's really
important that people recognize

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.740
that there is an audience
for that and we are looking

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:58.710
to hear those full experiences
and not just, you know,

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:01.390
when you're deployed
but when you come home.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.930
I mean that's what we're
all dealing with together.

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:05.230
You're deployed.

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.530
You're far away.

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:07.830
That's over.

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:09.500
But when you come back, we're
all going to do this together.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.620
So I think that's also
what's important and part

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.980
of this whole picture is that
you have to talk about that too

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:19.100
because that's something that
we're all engaged in still.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.750
I don't know if I
answered your question.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:24.050
&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra:
You made me think

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:25.350
about a lot of other things.

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:27.600
Stefanie, did you
have anything to add?

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.620
&gt;&gt; Stefanie Takacs: Yeah, I
was just going to, in our work,

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:38.270
part of the creative process
for us is the return home in

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:43.410
and of itself we see as a
creative process, right.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:44.780
What is a home?

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:49.860
And for us, that is
not a static thing.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.240
And for veterans who
are transitioning back

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.740
to civilian life, to give
themselves the freedom

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:02.790
to understand that as a
process rather than a place.

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:06.960
And to use dialogue
and writing to discover

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.570
and formulate that place.

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:14.060
While it's therapeutic,
I think also what happens

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.890
in the process is there's a lot

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:18.040
of critical thinking
that's happening.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:25.590
And it was really very rewarding
for us to hear from the veterans

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:30.400
with whom we worked how
important it was for them

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.770
to be able to think critically
about their experiences.

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:38.100
And of course, in our model,

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:40.110
we're also tapping
into the leadership.

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:43.260
Every person who's been

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:46.370
in service has had a
leadership capacity.

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:51.660
And our goal is in
developing a way for

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:52.960
or a better understanding

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:57.980
for how those leadership tools
can come to play every day

00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:59.750
in their civilian lives.

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:04.140
So, really, those connections,
building new connections

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:07.530
or recognizing the
connections that are there

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:13.380
but that have not been formally
tapped into or recognized

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:17.620
within the veterans' community
is really an important part

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:18.920
of the process.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:23.520
&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra: I love the
way you frame the road home

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.080
being something that
is not static.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:30.570
And it seems like
so much of the work

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:35.370
around helping foster
self-expression

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:39.450
in veterans is a notion that
it's a process not a product.

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:43.220
And that connects, again,
to so much of what we do

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:46.500
that I really appreciate is oral
history and these collections

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:52.760
of first-person narratives have
so many moments of benefit.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:57.610
And they have this, an oral
history is both a process

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:58.910
and a product.

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:01.230
So you get this emergence

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:04.940
of two states happening
at the same time.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.860
Which I think is very common
in the creative process.

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:11.170
So you create a poem
and you create a poem

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:14.490
and you create a poem because
it's, when you write it and then

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:15.790
when someone else reads it.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:17.590
And then when you read it aloud,

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:20.030
and so much of what
you're talking

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.410
about resonates with that.

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:24.960
You also, each of
you have mentioned

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:31.740
in your responses touching on
the aspect of working primarily

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.600
with recently returned veterans

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.930
or having a Vietnam
veteran lead a discussion

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:41.650
and the veteran pipeline
getting one veteran

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:45.600
to help another veteran
understand about this project

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.400
or this effort that
you're engaging in.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:52.220
Do you find in particular,
and I'll start with Stefanie,

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.370
and I'd love for each of
you to respond to this.

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:59.550
Do you find that there
is a particular benefit

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:03.020
or a particular, it doesn't
have to be a benefit,

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:06.520
I'm trying to frame this
as open ended as possible,

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:12.840
but what is the result of
engaging across generations?

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.640
So with World War II
veterans, Vietnam veterans,

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.700
Korea veterans, to
recent conflicts.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:22.520
Is there anything that you can
share about that experience?

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.680
&gt;&gt; Stefanie Takacs: I think what
we heard was a real appreciation

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:31.630
within the cross
generational groups for the,

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:37.960
I guess universality
of experience.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:46.350
And while each person's specific
experience in service is unique,

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:51.490
to recognize the way in
which service over time

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:56.210
in many ways, it's
a shared bond.

00:43:56.210 --> 00:44:01.770
And sometimes that bond has
to do with the call to serve.

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:05.740
So how a person ended up
in service to begin with.

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:09.410
Sometimes the bond
is the branch.

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:12.360
Sometimes it is where
one served.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:18.210
There are so many opportunities
to recognize those bonds

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:21.860
within a space where at first,

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:25.100
one may think those
experiences are going to be

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.840
so radically different.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:32.490
And yet, one finds, again,
that the commonalities are

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:37.060
so much more prevalent
and so much richer

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:41.680
than one might initially
anticipate.

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.980
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Yeah,

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:46.450
I think there's something
very special and important

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.570
and credible about
getting veterans

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:50.540
that recently transitioned.

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:56.030
For instance, when I got out
in 2008, I had no idea any

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:57.620
of this was available.

00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.020
People there, there's
a community outside

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:00.320
of the military.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.620
And I went through periods

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.130
of extreme loneliness,
extreme separation.

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:09.400
And for me, I threw
myself into like school

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.100
and suppressed everything
else because I didn't feel

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:13.730
like there was a safe
space for me to deal

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:16.420
with things, to talk
about things.

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:19.050
I also felt that I wanted
to be, I thought dealing

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.510
with things was to be as
far away from anything

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:22.810
that resembled the military.

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:24.960
So I think there's
something else to putting

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.150
out that narrative that
like this is a safe space.

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:30.590
You can transition
smoothly here in a calm way,

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:33.780
as opposed to trying to bury
your demons or self-medicate

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:36.410
or other things, right.

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:39.490
And I just think that recent,
it's just very important

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:42.230
to get them that, you know.

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:46.100
&gt;&gt; Lovella Calica: Yeah I think,
we've, I've talked to veterans

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:48.780
who said that they didn't talk
about being a vet for 20 years.

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:53.070
And I think, obviously, I
think the more you hold in,

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:54.700
the more dangerous
it gets, right.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.830
So we think we're
protecting ourselves,

00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:58.740
but we're really just sort
of setting ourselves up.

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.950
So I think it is important
to get folks to talk now.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:03.780
But you know, we have
folks, like Bruce, who,

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:05.380
our Vietnam veterans
and are sort

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.230
of mentoring our veterans
and working together.

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:11.430
And I think definitely, we
need to look at their work.

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:13.380
But I think what's
more valuable really is

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:14.680
to build those relationships.

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.850
Because you have Vietnam
veterans who have been dealing

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:20.840
with posttraumatic stress
for 20, 30 years and can talk

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.690
to the younger vets
about how to do that.

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:23.990
They can talk about writing.

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:25.520
They can talk about
all these other things.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.260
But, you know, I'm
always the person who has

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:28.680
to bring up the hard things.

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.200
And I think there's
part of what's difficult

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.970
about that is that, you know,

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:38.150
some of the younger veterans
are, you know, really, you know,

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.590
they're in with the
times, right.

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:43.280
So they're open to
people that are trans.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.800
They're open to gay people.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.780
They, you know, they're
not racist.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:51.340
So I think some of the older
veterans that are veterans come

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:54.340
into contact with our having
that sort of struggle with how

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:56.750
to manage the generational
differences.

00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:59.000
And I've seen that play out.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.530
But I've also seen the opposite
of that where people are,

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:03.370
you know, really on the same
page and really getting a lot

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:04.930
of those relationships.

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:08.190
But I think definitely
there's a lot of value there,

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:12.220
not just looking at the work
but in really engaging in those.

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.770
And even though some of those
relationships are difficult,

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:17.150
I think it's, I think
there's value in kind

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:19.940
of engaging those differences
and conflicts and trying

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:21.360
to figure it out together.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.820
Because those veterans
are more likely to listen

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.840
to the other veterans and have
those conversations and maintain

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:29.940
that relationship and try to
figure it out together instead

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:31.460
of just arguing with
someone on the street.

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:32.760
That's going to go nowhere.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:34.710
But if they're veteran to
veteran, they're kind of trying

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:36.280
to figure it out together.

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.600
That work is going
to be happening.

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.590
&gt;&gt; Melanie Mohindra: At the risk
of taking time away from some

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:44.020
of the other things we
wanted to talk about today,

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:48.970
I'm so interested in whether you
see a direct result between that

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.200
and the creative process?

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.360
Do you think it impacts
what's happening

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.050
when they're creating works?

00:47:57.050 --> 00:48:01.400
&gt;&gt; Lovella Calica: In terms of
those relationships with the?

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.900
Yeah, I mean I don't, I think
that the veterans are going

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.590
to write their identity.

00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:08.100
So I'm thinking of Ryan
Holleran who writes

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:10.020
about being gay in the military.

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.570
And I don't think that he's
necessarily writing more or less

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.960
because he's engaging
with these conflicts,

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.010
but I think he should.

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:20.760
I think that that's where
that sort of work happens.

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.300
I know those kind of
things can happen,

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.860
but I don't necessarily
see it happening

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:28.010
in what I'm doing
and what I'm seeing.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:29.310
&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra: Some

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:30.610
of the conversations
we've been having leading

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:34.600
up to this have been about
the tension between whether

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.320
or not the creative
sparks or whether you're

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:40.150
from our perspective talking
about creating an oral history

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:41.710
or a first-person
narrative together

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:45.030
or whether you're talking
about writing, whether it has

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:49.660
to be veteran to veteran
and where the benefit comes

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.900
from broadening the circle

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.720
and making sure you're
getting other people,

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:55.640
and Lovella, you speak to this.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:59.520
You've spoken to it for this
previous hour that we've talked

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.770
about how we all have to
have some responsibility,

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:04.660
whether we're veterans

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:08.010
or service military
family connected or not.

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:11.110
And I wondered, in your specific
programs, and I think Moe,

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:14.200
you probably have a lot to say
to this from the perspective

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.560
of the work you've
seen at the NEA.

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.820
But if you could, if you
wanted to take a minute

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:20.940
to talk a little bit
about the importance

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:25.990
of reaching beyond the echo
chamber of just veterans

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:30.370
and of veteran-connected
people and how your work gives

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:33.450
that opportunity or doesn't,
or if that's a challenge.

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:37.500
I see you nodding
your head, Stefanie.

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:38.800
I assume you --

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.140
&gt;&gt; Stefanie Takacs: Well,
we very much believe in all

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:45.150
of the work that we do
that solving problems

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:50.890
or building understanding
requires everyone at the table.

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:58.490
And any assumption, by
whomever that veterans coming

00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:03.350
out of service ought to
do that alone should be

00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:08.280
that that should be a solitary
process, that's not a viewpoint

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:11.150
that we embrace at Touchstones.

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:14.990
We really feel that
we have a lot to learn

00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:18.160
from veterans' experiences

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:23.090
and that we do not make
those opportunities available

00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:24.800
to us as a society.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:29.590
So I think that in the
future, as we continue to work

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:33.190
with more groups of veterans,
we will be inviting more

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:34.770
and more civilians

00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:38.040
to be co-participating
in those programs.

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:42.300
Our programs are always
open to the public,

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:47.670
and I think that part of what
we have been trying to learn

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:50.460
in the first iterations
of the programs

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:54.460
that we've been running is how
are we sensitive to the needs

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:55.760
of the veterans, right.

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:58.030
That needs to be
something that's

00:50:58.030 --> 00:51:00.950
at the forefront
of our thinking.

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:07.260
And at what point is it
constructive for civilians

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:08.870
and veterans to be together.

00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:12.670
And it may not be that
that's where you start.

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:17.340
But that one builds
that trust over time

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:21.090
so that those groups can
be constructive together

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:23.430
in building a new understanding.

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:26.030
So for us, it's vital.

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:30.960
It's vital to our
society that we have,

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.050
that we hear the
voices of veterans.

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:36.840
That the leadership that has
been instilled and practiced

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:40.880
in service is available
to us as a country.

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.650
And I think we're starting
to see more of that,

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.770
even in the political sphere,
with the number of veterans

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:49.340
who are stepping up
for public office.

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:54.090
And, you know, I think we
will continue as a country

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:56.220
to move more in that direction.

00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:58.520
At least certainly,
that's our hope.

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:01.820
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: I would
absolutely agree with that.

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:06.310
I think to the extent that
we can get veteran voices

00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:11.010
in the mainstream from whatever
perspective they're coming from,

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:14.300
I think it's extremely
important because, you know,

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.040
when I came here I thought, when
I first moved here I was like,

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:20.310
this is not a town that's
sympathetic to veterans.

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:25.260
You have to have an education
to be heard in any sense.

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:26.720
And I don't think that
should be the case.

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.430
Like no one should be
feeling that, right.

00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:30.740
But if you move to the South
then maybe they'll care

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.040
to your experience.

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:34.680
But if you're in D.C.,
no one cares, right.

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.800
So you sort of feel
muted in that sense.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.570
But I don't think that
should be the case.

00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:41.210
And I think the way you,
you know, resolve that is

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:43.100
by putting the veterans'
voices out, promoting it.

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:48.350
At the NEA, we have the National
Intrepid Center of Excellence

00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:53.710
where they do this
holistic wellness therapy.

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:57.560
And that sort of stays
in an isolated bubble

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.570
because it's dealing,
people dealing with TBI,

00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:02.090
traumatic brain injuries.

00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:05.150
But the Blue Star
Museum Program is one

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:07.860
that I think engages the public
and engages the experience

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:09.490
and allows veterans to come in.

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:10.970
But there's a dialogue
that happens

00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:13.040
when they come into the museums.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:16.110
So I think in that sense, I
think the NEA's platform is able

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:21.050
to spread that message, you
know, in that way, yeah.

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:26.440
&gt;&gt; Lovella Calica: I mean I
think, you know, like I said,

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:29.060
we're doing the National
Endowment

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:30.820
for the Humanities
Project in Philadelphia

00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:32.570
where we have these discussions.

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:35.060
But I think, you
know, we've done,

00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:37.200
Warriors Writers has done
poetry readings where people,

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.700
not that many people come,
so I think it's still hard

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:44.450
to get people to come out and
listen to veterans' poetry.

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:46.840
And I think people sort of,

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:48.850
I think some people have the
assumption that it's just going

00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:52.120
to be sad or hard or gory.

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:53.420
And some of it is.

00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:56.190
But I think it's also
our responsibility.

00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:58.600
Part of the reason
Warrior Writers came to be

00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:00.560
when I started it
11 years ago was

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.830
because I was hearing all these
stories and poetry by veterans,

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:06.140
and I thought, this has to
get out there in the world.

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:07.440
People have to hear this.

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.640
This is what's happening
to our service members.

00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:10.940
We only hear from the media.

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:12.240
We hear from the government.

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.670
We don't hear from
veterans themselves.

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:15.250
So we need to hear this.

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:17.340
We need to know what's
happening to the people

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.440
that are serving
and are coming home.

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:22.230
And so I think, I
don't know what,

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:23.620
I don't know how to do that.

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:26.400
I think there's, you
know, I think again,

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.510
it's sort of people
want the victim.

00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:29.840
or they want the hero.

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:34.400
And we need to engage opening
that up and saying, you know,

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.790
you need to be ready
to hear all of it.

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:39.650
But it's not easy, and I think,
again, that's why we do the work

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:42.340
with vets 101 training
before we have people come

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:43.670
and volunteer with us.

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:46.310
You know, you need to get
a little bit of a handle

00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:51.500
on what's, sorry, on what, who,
you know, the population is,

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:53.080
who the constituency is.

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:56.400
And what's going to create a
safe and comfortable space.

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.380
And, you know, how to take care
of yourself during that process.

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:02.180
Because, you know, if you
hear a story by a veteran

00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:04.370
and that's really impacting you,

00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:07.390
maybe because of your own
parents in the military,

00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:09.340
whatever, you know, you have
to take care of yourself.

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:11.670
So I think this idea
of self-care

00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:13.890
and community-care is something
that we've been talking a lot

00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:15.190
about Warrior Writers.

00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:17.370
Self-care being, you
know, go to therapy.

00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:18.670
You know, go to your
appointments.

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:21.270
Take your meds, you know,
get acupuncture, whatever.

00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:24.040
But also community
care whereas, you know,

00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.090
we're making these
resources available.

00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:27.630
We're having wellness days.

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:28.930
We're checking in
with each other.

00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:30.230
You know, we're providing meals.

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:32.680
We're not going from 9
a.m. to 9 p.m., you know,

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:36.100
these sort of things around
how do we create a culture

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:39.790
that can really handle
hearing some of these stories

00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:43.420
and supporting people in
their process of coming home?

00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:48.090
Which I think also, you know, my
partner's been home since 2004,

00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:51.160
and he still, you know,
he didn't come here today

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:54.110
because he wants to
stay home and wants to,

00:55:54.110 --> 00:55:55.690
you know, be by himself.

00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:58.350
And you know, he's just
dealing with a lot of anxiety.

00:55:58.350 --> 00:56:02.670
So I think also the
understanding

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:05.850
that it's a process and
it's a long process.

00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:07.900
And people go through that
in these different ways.

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:10.460
And there are a lot of different
ways that you can engage

00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:14.000
with people in, you
know, supporting them

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.780
and not necessarily talking

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:17.570
about the military
experience, you know.

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:20.860
Talking to veterans about their
kids or, you know, their hobbies

00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:22.160
or their artwork or whatever.

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.660
It doesn't always
have to be like so,

00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:25.560
let's talk about the
military, talk about.

00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:26.860
I'm a person too, you know.

00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.160
Like, you know, that's
one thing we talk

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.460
about in Warriors Writer,

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:32.230
people just see veterans as only
veterans and you can only talk

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:34.150
to them about that kind
of stuff, and that's all

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:35.450
that they want to talk about.

00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:36.750
Or that's all that they are.

00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:39.260
And for people who are
coming out of the military

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:42.420
or have come out, they want
to have other identities

00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:45.180
and other things that they're
thinking about and doing.

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:48.410
It's important that we as
civilians recognize that

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:50.790
and see them as just people.

00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:54.330
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Yeah.

00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:55.630
Yeah, I would agree with that.

00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:56.930
I think so much that what's
really frustrating a lot

00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:58.340
of times is that a narrative

00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:01.430
of the veterans are a sealed
society, and you sort of walk

00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:02.730
and operate within that.

00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:09.750
And that's frustrating that it
doesn't speak to the individual

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:12.940
and the individual's experience
and that individual's voice.

00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:14.260
And that's, it's one of those
things where you sort of,

00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:15.560
like your husband, sorry,

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.860
you kind of hate the
veteran narrative, right.

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:18.160
You hate hearing it.

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.570
You hate stuff like
this because it's almost

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:22.190
like it's already controlled.

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:24.270
You're seen as this
thing, but you're not this.

00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:26.100
You're not going
to this experience

00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:28.740
that you had in your
life, right.

00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:32.710
You would like to be able to
take the veteran's mantle off

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:35.010
at some point, you know,
like just be a person.

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:41.800
&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra: There's so
much that you, so many rich bits

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.210
that you've talked about
as we've continued the

00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:48.590
conversation, and I'm struggling
to come up with a good way

00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:53.570
to bring it to a natural
conclusion because what I want

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:56.520
to do is just ask you
questions all afternoon

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:57.820
and explore all these
things that you've touched

00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.120
on that we talk about all the
time and around and around

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.550
and around talk about
them with guests.

00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:05.470
We talk about them with poets,
and I just thank you so much

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:09.190
for sharing both on the
personal and the professional.

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:11.030
Because in this work
you have to.

00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:12.330
You have to do that
all the time,

00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:14.500
and it can get uncomfortable.

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:16.040
So thank you for doing
that here with us.

00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.280
I do need to manage our time,

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.360
so I'd like to give
you each an opportunity

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:22.780
if there's something you
wanted to share this morning

00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.410
that I didn't cover, I
didn't get the question

00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:27.430
in the right way.

00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:31.890
If you want to think about
that, and while you're thinking

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:37.750
about that, as soon as they've
had the chance to answer

00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:42.310
that question, we can
take a few questions

00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:44.880
from the audience before we
really have to wrap it up.

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:46.180
I'm told we can take
one question

00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:47.480
or two questions
from the audience.

00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:48.780
Is there anything further
any of you would like to say?

00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.620
&gt;&gt; Lovell Calica: In
preparing for this,

00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:52.890
I talked to a few veterans
and there was one thing

00:58:52.890 --> 00:58:54.630
that someone said that
we really, you know,

00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:56.380
he said you have to say this.

00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:59.070
And as a representative
of veterans' organization,

00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:02.290
this is something that
happens, I think, a lot.

00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:04.050
You know, I'm speaking that.

00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:07.080
But anyway but he thought
that it was really important

00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:11.660
that I recognize and say
that sometimes when we talk

00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:15.740
about veterans writing, you
know, we sort of talk about it

00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.570
in this sort of healing
and therapeutic way.

00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:20.050
While that's true and
important and valuable,

00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:21.810
and that's the case
for some people,

00:59:21.810 --> 00:59:24.630
it also depoliticizes the issue

00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:26.330
and the things that
they're writing.

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:28.590
And it's important
that, so it's important

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:31.110
that we recognize veterans
as free-thinking individuals

00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:34.180
that are not just
writing just to heal,

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:37.200
but some of them are writing
to articulate their stance

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:40.180
on the war, their stance on,
you know, the state of the VA

00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:42.900
and the lack of funding,
and I think it's important

00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:47.650
that we recognize, you know,
the diverse voices within that

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:51.070
and say and recognize that
yes, healing is part of it.

00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:55.110
But that we can't always
depoliticize it in that way

00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:58.650
because then it sort of
takes, again, away that power

00:59:58.650 --> 01:00:00.860
of veterans and their
individual stories.

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:02.330
You know, already
they're in the military

01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:04.900
and they weren't allowed to sort
speak openly about, you know,

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:06.200
whatever they believed in.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.070
And I think that
we can't perpetuate

01:00:09.070 --> 01:00:10.550
that once they've gotten out.

01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:13.660
We need to see those
stories for what they are.

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:17.370
So, I needed to say that for
Kevin and the rest of them.

01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:20.250
&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra:
Thank you, Lovella.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:21.550
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: I don't
know if I necessarily need

01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:24.310
to say this, but I think
there's something to be said,

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:29.120
and this sort of piggybacks
off what you're saying,

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.370
that I guess I would try to
communicate to take the veteran

01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:32.670
out of the veteran box.

01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:36.850
Their story doesn't start at
this, you know, moment in time.

01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:38.480
It's a longer thing.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.400
I would like to think that
everything that happened before

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.700
and after still matters.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.000
This is not just
the [inaudible].

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.800
I would say take the veteran

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.830
out of the veteran
box and stretch them.

01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:54.970
&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra:
Thank you, Moe.

01:00:54.970 --> 01:00:56.270
&gt;&gt; Stefanie Takacs.

01:00:56.270 --> 01:01:00.370
And I guess I would encourage
people to continue finding ways

01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:07.240
to have dialogue together
and to explore what it means

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.040
to be an American together.

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:16.140
And to sort of see the bigger
picture, service within that,

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.130
as you've just described, right.

01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:23.420
But the entire continuum
of one's life

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:28.430
and to really make room for
that to be, to allow room

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:31.400
for that in your own mind.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.210
&gt;&gt; Monica Mohindra: Well, thank
you, all of you for sharing this

01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:35.650
and for the work
that you're doing.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.770
And Moe, thank you for
your service to us.

01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:44.680
I also need to thank David
Surface at Fordham University

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:48.160
for his help in formulating
the questions, and Angie Hinzey

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.310
from ISCOPES at GW University

01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:52.860
for help formulating
the questions.

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:55.350
Thank you all for being with us,

01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:57.550
and I hope that you will
continue the conversation

01:01:57.550 --> 01:02:02.740
with us and hear more poetry and
more thoughts this afternoon.

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:04.220
Thank you very much.
