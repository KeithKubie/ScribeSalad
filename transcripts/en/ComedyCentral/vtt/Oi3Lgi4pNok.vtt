Hello.

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:05.405
I'm Katie Nolan,

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:07.373
and today we're gonna talk

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:09.409
about Gloria...

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.878
Steinem.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:14.881 line:0%
<i> Our story begins
 in the year 1963.</i>

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:18.484 line:0%
<i> Gloria Steinem was a graduate
 of Smith College,</i>

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:20.987
<i> very smart,
 she's 28 years old,</i>

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.555
<i> and she's a journalist.</i>

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:24.090
<i> And "Show Magazine" was like,</i>

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:26.192
<i> hey, Gloria, we have a story
 for you.</i>

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:28.061
<i> We want you to go
 undercover</i>

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:30.396
<i> at one of Hugh Hefner's
 Playboy clubs.</i>

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.866
<i> And Playboy clubs were
 advertising themselves</i>

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.302
<i> at the time as, like, being
 in a real live version</i>

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:37.970
<i> of "Playboy."</i>

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:39.672 line:0%
<i> So, you would have, like,
 beautiful women everywhere,</i>

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:41.507 line:0%
<i> and drinks and food
 and "dude stuff."</i>

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.976 line:0%
<i> - Yeah!
 - Boobies and vaginas!</i>

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:45.678
- [laughs]

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:47.013
And Gloria was like,

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:48.414
<i> I don't think
 this is what I want.</i>

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:50.116
<i> I want people
 to take me seriously.</i>

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.517
<i> And her editor was like,</i>

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.152
<i> I think this could be
 your chance</i>

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:56.089
<i> to call Hugh Hefner
 out on his Goddamn bullshit.</i>

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:59.058
<i> And she was like,
 you're right. I'm in.</i>

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:01.661
<i> Let's [bleep] do it.</i>

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:02.795
<i> Um.</i>

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:04.997
Uh, what was I talking about?

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.232
- Uh.
- So she says yes

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:07.266
to the thing...

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:08.434
to the assignment.

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:09.869
<i> And so she goes
 to the audition</i>

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:11.437
<i> which is at a Playboy club.</i>

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.339
<i> So she's this alias
 she's created for herself</i>

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:16.109
<i> which is Marie Catherine Ochs.</i>

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:18.344
<i> And the woman that she goes
 up to says,</i>

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:19.779
<i> take off your coat.
 Let me see your body.</i>

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:22.014
<i> Gloria was like,
 um, okay</i>

00:01:22.047 --> 00:01:23.249
<i> and, like, took her coat off.</i>

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:24.450
<i> And the woman was like...</i>

00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:27.987
<i> you look a little old
 for 24,</i>

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.622
<i> but your body's great.</i>

00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:32.492
<i> Come back on Saturday
 for a fitting.</i>

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:35.628
<i> And so Gloria comes back
 a couple of days later,</i>

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:37.563 line:0%
<i> and she sees this woman named
 Sheralee.</i>

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:39.332 line:0%
<i> And she's like,
 I'm the bunny mother.</i>

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:40.967 line:0%
<i> So she goes,
 and she gets sized.</i>

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.003
<i> She puts on this leotard,
 and she's like, this fits.</i>

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:45.304
<i> And they're like,
 no it doesn't.</i>

00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:47.206
<i> And they keep going
 in and in.</i>

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:49.842
<i> And Gloria's like,
 I think that's tight enough.</i>

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.410
<i> I can hardly breathe.</i>

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:54.480
- [laughs]

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:55.815
- I just had an ice--
- Are you good?

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:57.416
- An ice cube
just assaulted me.

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:59.085
- You got ISIS-ed.

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:02.722
- [laughs]
- Sorry.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.790
<i> - So the bunny mother,
 Sheralee, is explaining</i>

00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:06.225
<i> to the bunnies...</i>

00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:07.727
<i> there's all these things
 that they can take</i>

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.128
<i> your money away for;</i>

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:11.063
<i> like, if your ears are
 crooked,</i>

00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:12.498
<i> that's a demerit.</i>

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:14.967
<i> If your bunny tail's dirty,
 that's demerits.</i>

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.304
<i> If you're not smiling enough,
 that's a bunch of demerits.</i>

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:20.473
<i> They also give her
 this "Bunny Manual"</i>

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:22.475
<i> which is a list
 of all the rules</i>

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:23.776
<i> that you have to follow.</i>

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:25.444
<i> And in the Bunny Manual,
 it says...</i>

00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:27.713
<i> you're not allowed
 to date any customers.</i>

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:29.348
<i> But then they were told</i>

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:32.451
<i> unless they hold
 the special key.</i>

00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:34.220
<i> These special key members</i>

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:36.822
were allowed to do
whatever they want.

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.824
<i> Ew.</i>

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:41.761
<i> That's [bleep] up.</i>

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:43.729
Anyway.

00:02:43.762 --> 00:02:46.299
So, they're like,
great, you're all set.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.767
<i> You're going
 to start work soon.</i>

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.135
<i> We just need you to complete
 your physical.</i>

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:50.970
<i> And Gloria's like,
 what do you mean?</i>

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:52.638
<i> I'm going to be a waitress.</i>

00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:54.941
<i> And, like, oh, we just need
 you to complete a physical</i>

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:56.275
<i> with this doctor,</i>

00:02:56.308 --> 00:02:57.743
<i> and then you'll be fine
 to start.</i>

00:02:57.776 --> 00:02:59.345
<i> That's gross.
 - Yeah.</i>

00:02:59.378 --> 00:03:02.048
<i> - That's just gross.</i>

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.749
<i> So, she goes to the doctor.</i>

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:06.953
<i> She sits on the table,
 and she sees there's stirrups.</i>

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:08.854
And the doctor walks in,

00:03:08.887 --> 00:03:11.424
<i> and the first thing
 he says to her is...</i>

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.392
<i> so you want to be a bunny.</i>

00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:16.395
Which is alarming,
as a doctor.

00:03:16.428 --> 00:03:17.930
<i> He exams her,</i>

00:03:17.963 --> 00:03:19.465
<i> which to a woman means...</i>

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:20.600
you know.

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:21.701
- Pap smear?

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:23.236
- Did you say "patch"
smear?

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.037
- I've never had one.
- It's not a bagel,

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.305
Derek.
It's a...

00:03:26.338 --> 00:03:28.507
- It's a--
- I'm from New York, eh.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.343
[together]
I'ma gettin' a pap "schmear."

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:31.944
[both laugh]

00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:34.580
So, she finishes the exam.

00:03:34.613 --> 00:03:38.217
And she goes the next day
to train for this job.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.453
<i> That's a fancy word for</i>

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:42.888
<i> you're going to work
 and not get paid any money.</i>

00:03:42.921 --> 00:03:44.924
She's training
as a table bunny.

00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:47.360
<i> And they teach her
 that she has to follow</i>

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.895
<i> the other bunny servers
 around,</i>

00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:51.797
<i> and so she's going around,
 asking these people, like,</i>

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.700
<i> hello, I'm bunny Marie.
 What can I get for you?</i>

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:56.168
<i> And they would say things
 like,</i>

00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:59.438
<i> yeah, girl, let me
 see your titties.</i>

00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:01.073
<i> Open it up.</i>

00:04:01.106 --> 00:04:02.675
Which is bullshit.

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:03.709
How many times are you allowed

00:04:03.742 --> 00:04:04.710
to say bullshit on Comedy
Central?

00:04:04.743 --> 00:04:05.845
I've said it a whole bunch.

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:07.313
- Whenever you want.
- Okay.

00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:08.581
- It's some bullshit.
- [laughs]

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:14.520
- Do you want me
to teach you how to bunny?

00:04:14.553 --> 00:04:15.655
- Yes, all right.
So, when I walk--

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:16.856
How do I walk?

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.491
Well, so, it will be
on a tray,

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.026
and I need you
to be on your tippy toes

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:21.394
all the way up.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.062
Higher than that.
- This is all I can go.

00:04:23.095 --> 00:04:26.032
- And then cross your legs
when you walk.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:28.267
Bend over the table
to serve the drink.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.602
Butt out.
- Mm-hmm.

00:04:29.635 --> 00:04:32.204
Titties out.

00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:34.373
Go away, you slut.

00:04:34.406 --> 00:04:35.975
Anyway.

00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:37.376
<i> She's working
 all of these shifts,</i>

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:38.744
<i> and she's like,
 in her journal,</i>

00:04:38.777 --> 00:04:40.179
<i> she's writing
 all these injustices.</i>

00:04:40.212 --> 00:04:41.647
<i> They're, like, working
 these long hours.</i>

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.182
<i> They're not making
 any money.</i>

00:04:43.215 --> 00:04:44.517
<i> On top of that,</i>

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.052
<i> it's basically
 a prostitution ring.</i>

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:48.254
<i> And finally, after working
 in the Playboy clubs</i>

00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:49.889
<i> for four weeks,</i>

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:51.957
<i> Gloria was like,
 [bleep] this shit.</i>

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.526
<i> I have enough
 in my journal.</i>

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.861
<i> I'm gonna publish this shit.</i>

00:04:55.894 --> 00:04:57.296
<i> I'm out.</i>

00:04:57.329 --> 00:05:01.434
<i> It's just all the stupid
 sexist dumbass bullshit.</i>

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.369
She just wanted
to get the [bleep] out.

00:05:03.402 --> 00:05:04.870
And so she quit.

00:05:04.903 --> 00:05:06.305
<i> And so</i>

00:05:06.338 --> 00:05:08.574
<i> Gloria writes an expose
 on these Playboy clubs.</i>

00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:10.643
<i> She's like these women
 were like...</i>

00:05:10.676 --> 00:05:12.111
<i> not making as much money</i>

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:13.312
<i> as they were told they were
 going to make.</i>

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:15.081
<i> It's insane hours.</i>

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:16.849
<i> They're being grabbed
 all the time.</i>

00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:19.118
<i> They're treated
 like prostitutes.</i>

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:21.754
<i> They're basically being used
 as a tool</i>

00:05:21.787 --> 00:05:24.290
<i> for the male sexual
 revolution.</i>

00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:25.591
<i> But the women themselves</i>

00:05:25.624 --> 00:05:27.093
<i> don't get to
 own their sexuality,</i>

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:31.063
<i> and that's shitty.</i>

00:05:31.096 --> 00:05:32.498
<i> So they publishes--</i>

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:33.532
<i> they publishes--</i>

00:05:33.565 --> 00:05:35.034
<i> They publ--</i>

00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:36.702
They publish...
- Mm-mm.

00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:39.739
<i> They publish the story
 in the magazine.</i>

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:42.074
<i> So, the world reads
 this article,</i>

00:05:42.107 --> 00:05:44.877
<i> and to his very tiny credit,</i>

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.179
<i> Hugh Hefner says
 wow...</i>

00:05:47.212 --> 00:05:49.348
<i> Yeah, maybe they won't have
 to go</i>

00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:51.650
<i> to these physical exams
 anymore.</i>

00:05:51.683 --> 00:05:52.885
<i> And you know what,</i>

00:05:52.918 --> 00:05:54.587
<i> I'm going to
 stop making them</i>

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.722
<i> have to give so much of
 their money to us</i>

00:05:56.755 --> 00:05:58.424
<i> if they make a mistake.</i>

00:05:58.457 --> 00:06:00.526
Which is, like,
a really cool thing...

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:02.194
that Hugh Hefner did.

00:06:02.227 --> 00:06:05.498
But also, not as cool as just,
like,

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:07.867
always treating them
that way.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.804
<i> This article made Gloria
 Steinem a household name,</i>

00:06:11.837 --> 00:06:13.572
<i> and she went on to be this...</i>

00:06:13.605 --> 00:06:16.041
<i> huge feminist icon.</i>

00:06:16.074 --> 00:06:18.144
It's tough, but I swear
to God,

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:19.712
if it weren't
for Gloria Steinem

00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:21.981
I wouldn't be able to be
on TV.

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:25.451
It's very hard to be a woman
that's like, I love sports.

00:06:25.484 --> 00:06:27.153
- And you have stuck
to your guns

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:29.088
ever since you've started.

00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:31.090
And that...

00:06:31.123 --> 00:06:32.224
is what...

00:06:32.257 --> 00:06:33.526
- You cried.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.661
- I'm sorry.

00:06:35.694 --> 00:06:37.496
- Can I get somebody else
to do--

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:38.597
to do this?

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.832
- [laughs]
