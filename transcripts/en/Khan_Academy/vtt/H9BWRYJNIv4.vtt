00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.380
So far we've been able to define
the determinant for a

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.600
2-by-2 matrix.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.700
This was our definition right
here: ad minus bc.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.960
And then we were able to broaden
that a bit by creating

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.460
a definition for the determinant
of a 3-by-3

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.330
matrix, and we did that right
here, where we essentially

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.190
said the determinant is equal
to each of these terms-- you

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.490
could call these maybe the
coefficient terms-- times the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.682
determinant of the matrix-- you
can kind of view it as the

00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:31.450
submatrix produced-- when you
get rid of each of these guys'

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.650
column and row.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.340
So when you got rid of this
guy's column and row, you're

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.480
left with this matrix.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.200
So we said this guy times
the determinant of this.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.280
And we kept switching signs,
minus this guy times the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.610
determinant, if you move
his column and his row.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.440
So it was left with these terms
right there to get that

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.940
determinant.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.800
Then finally, you switched
signs again.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.620
So plus this guy times the
determinant of the 2-by-2

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.860
matrix if you get rid of this
row and this column.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.020
So this thing right here,
which was this matrix.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.850
Now let's see if we can
extend this to a

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.980
general n-by-n matrix.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.780
So let's write out our n-by-n
matrix right over here.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.700
I'll do it in blue.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.770
So let's say I have some matrix
A that is an n-by-n

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.010
matrix, so it's going
to look like this.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.870
This would be a11, that would
be a12, and we would go all

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.270
the way to-- you're going
to have n columns, a1n.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.600
And when you go down, this is
going to be your second row:

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.960
a21, and it's going to go all
the way down to an1, because

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.800
you have n rows as well.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.200
And then if you go down the
diagonal all the way, this

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.970
right here would be ann.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.920
So there is my n-by-n matrix.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.620
Now, before I define how to find
the determinant of this,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.310
let me make another
definition.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.250
Let me define-- so this
is my matrix A.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:05.210
Let me define a submatrix Aij to
be equal to-- see this is n

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.290
by n, right?

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.000
So this is going to be an n
minus 1 by n minus 1 matrix.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.370
So if this is 7 by 7, the
submatrix is going to be 6 by

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.150
6, one less in each direction.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.210
So this is going to be the n
minus 1 by n minus 1 matrix

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:35.160
you get if you essentially
ignore or if you take away--

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.950
maybe I should say take away.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.090
Let's say ignore, like
the word ignore.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.630
If you ignore the i-th row, this
right here is the row,

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:55.380
the i-th row and the
j-th column of a.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.060
So, for example, let's go back
to our 3 by 3 right here.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.370
This thing could be denoted
based on that definition I--

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.670
we could have called
this, this was a11,

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.000
this term right here.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.620
We could denote the matrix when
you get rid of the first

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.680
column and the first row or the
first row and the first

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.750
column, we could call this thing
right here, we could

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.550
call that big matrix A11.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.270
So this was big matrix A11.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.780
This is big matrix A21, or
actually, this matrix was

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.980
called C, so this would
be C11 right there.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:40.010
We could call this one, this
would be matrix C12.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.700
Why is that?

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.520
Because if you get rid of the
first row, let me get rid of

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.610
the first row, right?

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.190
The first term is your row.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.360
If you get rid of the first
row and the second column,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.180
this is the matrix that's
left over: 2, 3, 4, 1.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.590
So this is this guy
and this guy.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.600
2, 3, 4, 1.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.950
So this is the submatrix c
because this is the big matrix

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.930
C, But this one is C12.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.490
I know it's a little
bit messy there.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.310
So that's all we mean
by the submatrix.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.970
Very similar to what we did
in the 3 by 3 case.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.000
You essentially get rid of--
so if you want to find out

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.970
this guy's submatrix, you would
call that a11, and you

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.630
would literally cross out the
first row and the first

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.120
column, and everything
left over here

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.660
would be that submatrix.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.780
Now, with that out of the way,
we can create a definition,

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.210
and it might seem a little
circular to you at first, and

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.740
on some level it is.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.210
We're going to define the
determinant of A to be equal

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.320
to-- this is interesting.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.970
It's actually a recursive
definition.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.265
I'll talk about that
in a second.

00:04:49.265 --> 00:04:52.220
It's equal to-- we start
with a plus.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.540
It's equal to a11 times the
submatrix if you remove this

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.810
guy's row and column.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.940
So that, by definition, is
just A, big capital A11's

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.460
determinant.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.710
So that's exactly what we did.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.540
Let me write that a
little bit neater.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.670
So times the determinant of
its submatrix, so the

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.550
determinant of A11.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.416
So you take A11, you get rid of
its column and its row or

00:05:20.416 --> 00:05:22.740
its row and its column, and
everything else, you find the

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.120
determinant of that.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.854
Actually, let me write it
in terms of-- let me

00:05:25.854 --> 00:05:27.600
write it this way.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.420
a11 times the determinant
of the submatrix A11.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.130
And then we switch sides.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.000
We're just going to go along
this row, and then you do

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.490
minus a12 times the determinant
of its submatrix,

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.390
which we'll just call A12.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.070
We would get rid of this row
and this column, and

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.360
everything left would
be this matrix A12.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.030
We want to find its
determinant.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.995
And then we'll take the next
guy over here would be a13.

00:05:58.995 --> 00:06:01.150
So we switch signs with minus.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.890
Now, you go plus,
so a13 times the

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.960
determinant of its submatrix.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.220
So if this is n by n, these each
are going to be n minus 1

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.910
by n minus 1.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.070
So the determinant of A13.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.800
And you're just going to keep
doing that, keep switching

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.020
signs, so it's going to be a
minus and then a plus and you

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.550
keep going all the way--
and then I don't know.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.400
It depends on whether an,
whether we're dealing with an

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.000
odd number or an even number.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.350
If we're dealing with an even
number, this is going to be a

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.450
minus sign.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.430
If it's an odd number, it's
going to be a plus sign, but

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.970
you get the idea.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.520
It's either going to be a plus
or a minus, not just-- if it's

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.670
odd, this is going
to be a plus.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.790
If it's an even n, it's going to
be a minus, All the way to

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:47.020
a1n, the n-th column times
its submatrix, A1n.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.500
With that submatrix, you get rid
of the first row and the

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.700
n-th column, and it's going
to be everything

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.330
that's left in between.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.570
And you immediately might
say, Sal, what kind of a

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:56.610
definition is this?

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.130
You defined a determinant for an
arbitrary n-by-n matrix in

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.680
terms of another definition
of a determinant.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.880
How does this work?

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.330
And the reason why this works
is because the determinant

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.630
that you use in the definition
are determinants

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.090
of a smaller matrix.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.240
So this is a determinant of an n
minus 1 by n minus 1 matrix.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.440
And you're saying hey, Sal, that
still doesn't make any

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.900
sense because we don't know how
to find the determinant of

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.380
an n minus 1 by n
minus 1 matrix.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.470
Well, you apply this definition
again, and then

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.040
it's going to be in terms of n
minus 2 times n-- or n minus 2

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.220
by n minus 2 matrices.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.220
And you're like how
do you do that?

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.260
Well, you keep doing it, and
you're going to get all the

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.850
way down to a 2-by-2 matrix.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.840
And that one we defined well.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.640
We defined the determinant of
a 2-by-2 matrix not in terms

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.240
of a determinant.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.210
We just defined it in terms of
a times-- we defined it as--

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.720
let me write it up here.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.635
It was a times d minus
b times c.

00:07:51.635 --> 00:07:52.800
And you can see.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.340
I mean, we could just go down to
the 3 by 3, but the 2 by 2

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.210
is really the most fundamental
definition.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.390
And you could see that the
definition of a 3-by-3

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.720
determinant is a special
case of the general

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.110
case for an n by n.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.040
We take this guy and we
multiply him times the

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.800
determinant of his submatrix
right there.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.810
Then we take this guy where
we switch signs.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.890
We have a minus.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.700
And we multiply him times the
determinant of his submatrix,

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.520
which is that right there.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.950
Then you do a plus.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.455
You switch signs and then you
multiply this guy times the

00:08:21.455 --> 00:08:24.030
determinant of his submatrix,
which is that right there.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.870
So this is a general case
of what I just defined.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.040
But we know it's never that
satisfying to deal in the

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.520
abstract or the generalities.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.900
We want to do a specific case.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.190
And actually, before I do that,
let me just introduce a

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.610
term to you.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.120
This is called a recursive
formula.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.090
And if you become a computer
science major,

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.120
you'll see this a lot.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.150
But a recursive function or a
recursive formula is defined

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.630
in terms of itself.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.110
But the things that you use in
the definition use a slightly

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.480
simpler version of it, and as
you keep going through, or you

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.730
keep recursing through it, you
get simpler and simpler

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.480
versions of it until you get
to some type of base case.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.360
In this case, our base case is
the case of a 2-by-2 matrix.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.030
You keep doing this, and
eventually you'll get to a

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.220
determinant of a 2-by-2 matrix,
and we know how to

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.260
find those.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.735
So this is a recursive
definition.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.930
But let's actually apply it
because I think that's what

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.960
actually makes things
concrete.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.140
So let's take-- this is going
to be computationally

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.900
intensive, but I think if we
focus, we can get there.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:32.070
So I'm going to have a 4-by-4
matrix: 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.080
1-- throw some zeroes in there
to make the computation a

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:43.400
little bit simpler, 0, 1, 2,
3, and then 2, 3, 0, 0.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.640
So let's figure out this
determinant right there.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.040
This is the determinant
of the matrix.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.260
If I put some brackets
there that would

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.100
have been the matrix.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.000
But let's find the determinant
of this matrix.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.590
So this is going to be equal
to-- by our definition, it's

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:03.000
going to be equal to 1 times the
determinant of this matrix

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.900
right here if you get rid of
this row and this column.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:10.220
So it's going to be 1 times the
determinant of 0, 2, 0; 1,

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.320
2, 3; 3, 0, 0.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.600
That's just this guy right here,
this matrix right there.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.660
Then I'm going to have a 2, but
I'm going to switch signs.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.580
So it's minus 2 times the
determinant if I get rid of

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.880
that row and this column,
so it's 1, 2, 0.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.130
I'm ignoring the zero because
it's in the same column as the

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:40.525
2: 1, 2, 0; 0, 2, 3,
and then 2, 0, 0.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.540
And then I switch signs again.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.240
It was a minus, so now
I go back to plus.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.720
So I do that guy, so
plus 3 times the

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.040
determinant of his submatrix.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.330
Get rid of that row and get
rid of that columm,

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.766
I get a 1, 0, 0.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.010
I get a 0, 1, 3.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.700
I skip this column every time.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:15.010
Then I get a 2, 3, 0,
just like that.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.210
We're almost done.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.330
One more in this column.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.290
Let me switch to
another color.

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.160
I haven't used the
blue in this yet.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.110
So then I'm going
to do a minus 4.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:29.870
Remember, it's plus, minus,
plus, minus 4 times the

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.130
determinant of its submatrix.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.480
That's going to be
that right there.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:42.330
So it's 1, 0, 2; 0, 1, 2;
2, 3, 0, just like that.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.040
And now we're down to
the 3-by-3 case.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.390
We could use the definition of
the 3 by 3, but we could just

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.980
keep applying this recursive
definition.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:56.140
So this is going to be equal
to-- let me write it here.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.440
It's 1 times-- what's
this determinant?

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.640
This determinant's going to be
0 times the determinant of

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.950
that submatrix, 2, 3, 0, 0.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.150
That was this one right here.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.110
And then we have minus 2, minus
this 2-- remember, we

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.000
switched signs-- plus, minus,
plus, so minus 2 times its

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.020
submatrix, so it's 1, 3, 3, 0.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:31.650
And then finally plus 0 times
its submatrix, which is this

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:39.370
thing right here: 1, 2,
3, 0, just like that.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.770
And then we have this
next guy right here.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:45.060
As you can see, this can get a
little bit tedious, but we'll

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.130
keep our spirits up.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:53.570
So minus 2 times 1 times its
submatrix, so that's this guy

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.850
right here-- times the
determinant of its submatrix

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.840
2, 3, 0, 0.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.290
Then minus 2 times-- get
rid of that row, that

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.190
column-- 0, 3, 2, 0.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.620
And then plus 0 times
0, 2, 2, 0.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.730
That's this one right there.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.510
Halfway there, at
least for now.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:28.270
And then we get this next one,
so we have a plus 3.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.770
Bring out our parentheses.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.570
And then we're going to have 1
times its sub-- I guess call

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:33.820
it sub-determinant.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:39.580
So 1 times the determinant
1, 3, 3, 0, right?

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.710
You get rid of this guy's row
and column, you get this guy

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:42.870
right there.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:48.620
And then minus 0-- get rid
of this row and column--

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.246
times 0, 3, 2, 0.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:59.880
Then you have plus 0 times its
sub-determinant 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.230
Three-fourths of
the way there.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.180
One last term.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.790
Let's hope we haven't made
any careless mistakes.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:15.470
Minus 4 times 1 times 1,
2, 3, 0 right there.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:23.415
Minus 0 times-- get rid of those
two guys-- 0, 2, 2, 0.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.870
And then plus 2 times
0, 1, 2, 3, right?

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.130
Plus 2-- get rid of these
guys-- 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.350
Now, we've defined or we've
calculated or we've defined

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.060
our determinant of this matrix
in terms of just a bunch of

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.230
2-by-2 matrices.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.170
So hopefully, you saw in this
example that the recursion

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:48.680
worked out.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.410
So let's actually find what
this number is equal to.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:53.570
A determinant is always just
going to be a number.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.090
So let me get a nice
vibrant color.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.610
This is 0 times--
I don't care.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:59.940
0 times anything's
going to be 0.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.220
0 times anything is
going to be 0.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.550
0 times anything's
going to be 0.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.460
0 times anything's
going to be 0.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.470
Just simplifying it.

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.420
These guys are 0 because
it's 0 times that.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.910
0 times this is going
to be equal to 0.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.160
So what are we left with?

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:22.090
This is going to be equal to 1
times-- this is all we have

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:25.250
left here is a minus 2 times--
and what is this determinant?

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.450
It's 1 times 0, which is 0.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.220
It's 0-- let me write this.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.870
This is going to be 1 times 0
is 0, minus 3 times 3 is 0

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.980
minus 9, so minus 9.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.940
This right here is
just minus 9.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.270
So minus 2 times minus 9.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.840
That's our first thing, I'll
simplify it in a second.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.030
Now let's do this
term right here.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:51.060
So it's minus 2 times-- now
what's this determinant?

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.280
2 times 0 minus 0 times 3.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.030
That's 0 minus 0.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.040
So this is 0.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.990
That guy became 0, so we
can ignore that term.

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:03.050
This term right here is
0 times 0, which is 0,

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:04.370
minus 2 times 3.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.210
So it's minus 6.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:10.780
So it's minus 2 times-- so this
is a minus 6 right here.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:15.150
You have a minus 2 times a minus
6, so that's a plus 12.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.770
So I'll just write
a plus 12 here.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.910
This minus 2 is that minus
2 right there.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.370
And then we have a plus 3.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:27.020
And then this first term is 1
times 0, which is 0, minus--

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.880
let me make the parentheses
here-- 1 times 0, which is 0,

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.395
minus 3 times 3, which
is minus 9 times 1.

00:16:33.395 --> 00:16:34.840
So it's minus 9.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.120
Everything else was a 0.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.780
We're in the home stretch.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.750
We have a minus 4.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:47.670
Let's see, this is 1 times 0,
which is 0, minus 3 times 2,

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.100
so minus 6.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.660
So this is minus 6 right here.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.950
Minus 6, this is 0, and then we
have this guy right here.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:59.290
So we have 0 times 3, which
is 0, minus 2 times 1.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:03.350
So that's minus 2, and then
you have a minus 2 times a

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.440
plus 2 is minus 4.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.250
So now we just have
to make sure we do

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.900
our arithmetic properly.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:15.290
This is 1 times plus 18,
so this is 18, right?

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.230
Minus 2 times minus 9.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:21.819
This right here is minus 24.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:27.010
This right here is minus 27.

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:30.270
And then this right here, let's
see, this is minus 10

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:31.030
right here.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.650
That is minus 10.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:39.860
Minus 4 times minus
10 is plus 40.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.950
Let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.450
If we simplify this a little
bit-- I don't want to make a

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.540
careless mistake right
at the end.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:54.690
So 18 minus 24, 24 minus 18 is
6, so this is going to be

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.530
equal to minus 6, right?

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.090
18 minus 24 is minus 6.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:03.270
And then-- let me do it in
green-- now what's the

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.740
difference?

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:10.470
If we have minus 27 plus
40, that's 13, right?

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.510
It's positive 13.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:18.310
So minus 6 plus positive
13 is equal to 7.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.460
And so we are done!

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.700
After all of that computation,
hopefully we haven't made a

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:22.970
careless mistake.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.030
The determinant of this
character right

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.550
here is equal to 7.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:30.670
The determinant is equal to 7.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.310
And so the one useful takeaway,
we know that this is

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:36.950
invertible because it has
a non-zero determinant.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.130
Hopefully, you found
that useful.
