00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.760
Finding success with an original TV show is
never easy, which means writers and creators

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.221
are usually more concerned with earning another
season than planning years in advance. But

00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:21.430
sometimes, the minds behind our favourite
TV shows have a grand plan in mind – and

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.570
drop plenty of clues to help viewers connect
the dots to see what’s coming. Whether it’s

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.380
a punchline that takes years to arrive, or
a clue to solve the mystery, the following

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.590
video contains plenty of spoilers – you
have been warned. Here are ScreenRant's Brilliant

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.190
Clues Hidden In The Background Of TV Shows.
Oh, and be warned, there are major spoilers

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.230
in this video!

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.230
True Detective

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.449
As the name implies, the first season of HBO’s
True Detective left tons of clues for the

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.290
audience, and the characters to follow. In
the police search for the mysterious “Yellow

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.670
King” responsible for years of violence,
the colour yellow is used when the lead detectives

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.600
finally start following the right path. But
in the season’s biggest twist, the stars

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.530
discover that they had already found their
man in an earlier episode, mowing the grass

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.090
outside a closed school. Eagle-eyed viewers
could have followed more than their gut, too

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.990
– an obstructed sign flat out confirms that
the detectives should have taken notice.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.990
Arrested Development

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.390
Arrested Development may have been cancelled
after 3 seasons, but most critics and writers

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.520
agreed it was ahead of its time - jam-packed
with too many punchlines and running gags

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.200
to catch the first time around. When the Bluth's
stunted sibling Buster lost a limb to a loose

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.259
seal, the door was opened to a world of hook
and hand-based humor. But fans may not have

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.509
noticed just how far ahead of time the writers
planned the move, planting gags long before

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.179
the event ever took place. The jokes only
land on repeat viewings, showing just how

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:46.700
much the writers relied on fans re-watching
the series to catch every detail.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.890
Futurama

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.630
Every sci-fi fan knows that changing the past
can be just as much fun as exploring the future,

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.259
and showing the audience they've been fooled
all along is a clever tool for any writer.

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.600
With Futurama, that meant revealing that the
show's hero being frozen for 1,000 years was

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:12.430
no accident, but a plot carried out by the
team's super-intelligent alien pet, Nibbler.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.730
Making Fry the universe's last hope was taken
as a clever rewrite - but the pilot episode

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.960
really DID show Nibbler's shadow beneath Fry's
chair. The fans didn't spot it, and the writers

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.280
waited four full seasons to reveal the true
story behind the entire show.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.530
Firefly

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.230
Joss Whedon has a reputation for planning
his stories out years in advance, and the

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.110
short-lived Firefly is no exception. The hordes
of crazed space pirates known as Reavers weren’t

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.610
explained until the feature film, Serenity,
but the show’s pilot episode contained another

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.140
major clue of a story fans would have seen
play out. When the ship’s crew crosses paths

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.830
with a Reaver ship, each character prepares
for the event differently. Some turn to weapons,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.160
while Inara – the ship’s companion – turns
instead to a needle and vial of an unknown

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.190
liquid. Most assumed it was an injection to
kill herself before the Reavers could, but

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.060
it was actually medicine for the character’s
terminal illness. Whedon claimed the alternate

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.510
reading worked for the scene, and since the
show didn’t survive long enough to explore

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.070
that subplot, that’s where the story ended.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.880
Breaking Bad

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.290
Series creator Vince Gilligan turned the story
of a chemistry teacher turned Crystal Meth

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.890
kingpin into one of TV’s greatest shows
ever – with visual bookends, repeated imagery,

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.460
and yes, clues early on to just how far Walter
White would go into the world of Crystal Meth.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.740
The clues can be small, like when Walter urges
his partner Jesse to disappear, obscuring

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.960
a license plate to read “WYRUP” (wire
up) one episode before Jesse does just that

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.850
to help bring his friend down. Or they can
be far grander. When select episodes in Season

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.990
2 opened with black-and-white glimpses of
the future, fans took it as a sign that Walter’s

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.210
drug op would be discovered by the season’s
end. But the titles of those same episodes

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.870
promise a very different finale: “Seven
Thirty-Seven”, “Down”, “Over”, “ABQ,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.490
or Albuquerque, Walt’s hometown.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.990
Game of Thrones

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.080
The Red Wedding of author George R. R. Martin's
fantasy series may get most of the headlines,

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.980
but King Joffrey's death at Season 4’s Purple
Wedding is just as important. It's the king's

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.792
uncle and the innocent Sansa Stark who end
up blamed for the king's poisoning, but the

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:16.280
fans are never told explicitly how the plan
was carried out - or were they? It turns out

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.630
Sansa played a role in the plot, whether she,
or the audience, knew it. In the episode before

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.700
the Purple Wedding, a court jester who Sansa
had rescued from Joffrey gives her his mother's

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.150
necklace as a thank-you. She wears the necklace
to King Joffrey's wedding, and the ladies

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.389
of House Tyrell put their plan into action:
Olenna distracts Sansa long enough to pluck

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.139
one of the poison jewels free, meaning Margary
only has to take Joffrey's cup moments later

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.610
so the poison can be planted. After that,
the rest took care of itself.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.479
American Horror Story: Coven

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.200
In the third season of the anthology series
American Horror Story, it’s a coven of Salem

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.979
witches who take the spotlight. But when the
coven’s leader Fiona is stricken with cancer,

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.639
she claims it’s a sign that a new Supreme
– a single witch able to wield the Seven

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.990
Powers – is rising to power. She begins
to pick off her witches one by one, hoping

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.490
to kill the new Supreme before being replaced.
In the show’s opening credits, it’s actress

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.180
Sarah Paulson whose name is placed is first
shown next to a skeletal saint, known to those

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.870
in Mexico as Santa Muerte, also known as the
Lady of the Seven Wonders. If only Fiona had

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.630
noticed, she would’ve known it was Paulson’s
character, Cordelia who would lead the coven,

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.300
a secret spoiled in the first episode for
those paying attention.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.300
**For American Horror Story, the show's opening
credits are the same for each episode, showing

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.300
Sarah Paulson's name with the Santa Muerte
beside it. For the actual footage, I was thinking

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.300
more of a sizzle reel, likely in the last
episode when more than a few people are killed,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.300
and Paulson finally shows off her powers (I
didn't watch this season yet

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.300
Buffy

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.180
Joss Whedon’s love of foreshadowing got
to be put to full use with Buffy the Vampire

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.449
slayer, planting seeds for future twists both
big and small. Season 4 of the series earned

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:44.719
praise for having Willow come out, and enter
into a relationship with her girlfriend Tara.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:48.419
But an entire season before, the twist was
predicted when a vampire version of Willow

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.500
from an alternate universe made a pass at
her.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.669
But some clues were far more serious. In the
Season 3 finale, Buffy’s dream sequence

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:04.150
included some cryptic references, courtesy
of her ally-turned-enemy Faith. The nursery

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.999
rhyme reference referred to Buffy’s sister,
arriving in the next season. 7-3-0, on the

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:13.850
other hand, means 730 days, or exactly two
years - the time that would pass between that

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.340
episode and the Season 5 finale, in which
Buffy would sacrifice herself (for the first

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.969
time). Even if fans had deciphered the message,
two years wouldn’t have been enough time

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:25.300
to prepare themselves.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.860
