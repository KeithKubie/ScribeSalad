00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.081
Clocking in at 5 minutes and 55 seconds long
and encompassing elements of hard rock, opera

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:20.950
and pop, Bohemian Rhapsody is certainly one
of the more eclectic songs to make it into

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.759
the charts, but it’s by no means the longest.

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:29.359
Hey Jude by The Beatles (7:11), I’d Do Anything
for Love (But I Won’t Do That) by Meatloaf

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:36.390
(7:58) and All Around The World by Oasis (9:38)
are all songs that have managed to squeak

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.480
their way into the charts despite being about
twice the length of most other pop songs.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.190
That said, the fact that there are so few
songs over 5 minutes in length that have gained

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.150
that much airtime is a testament to how rare
of an occurrence that actually is.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.250
Taken from the album A Night at the Opera
and credited solely to Freddie Mercury, Bohemian

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.220
Rhapsody is noted as being one of the most
lavishly expensive songs ever recorded.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.420
In fact, it was reportedly the most expensive
single ever at the time.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.680
This was, in part, due to the band ultimately
using 180 separate overdubs, which was incredibly

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.720
tricky to do given that they were working
with 24-track analogue tape.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.290
There was also the fact that Mercury wasn’t
exactly sure how the song was supposed to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.290
go.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.171
Queen’s producer and a close friend of Mercury,
Roy Baker, would later note that the opera

00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:28.940
section of the song ended up sounding nothing
like Mercury’s original concept because

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.570
they “kept changing and adding things to
it.”

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.040
He also noted that when Mercury first introduced
him to the idea of the song, “He played

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.010
the beginning on the piano, then stopped and
said, ‘And this is where the opera section

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.150
comes in!’

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.260
Then we went out to eat dinner.”

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.540
Initially, Baker set aside a 30 second strip
of tape for the opera section, but had to

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.970
resort to cutting and adding new pieces of
tape to the reel due to Mercury’s habit

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.850
of “adding another Galileo” every time
they tried to record it.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.190
Due to this type of thing, the opera section
on its own reportedly took almost a month

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.190
to record.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.700
To quote Baker a final time on why this was
a big deal: “in 1975 [that] was the average

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.300
time spent on a whole album”.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.790
Although today the song has been lauded as
a masterpiece, when recording wrapped on Bohemian

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.610
Rhapsody, EMI (Queen’s record label at the
time) didn’t rate it that highly with their

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.220
general manager of international sales going
as far to say “what the f*ck is this?”

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.220
the first time the band played him the song.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.510
EMI wasn’t alone in this thinking and almost
everyone the band played an advanced copy

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.959
of the song for said the same thing, including
Elton John who famous exclaimed “are you

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:34.959
f*cking mad?”

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.069
upon first hearing the song and being told
it was going to be the first single of A Night

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.239
at the Opera.

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.719
As it turns out, EMI had banked on You’re
My Best Friend, being the big hit of the album

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.549
and they pushed the band to make it the first
single.

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.000
Queen remained steadfast in their decision
and told EMI that the first single had to

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.239
be Bohemian Rhapsody.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.359
In response, EMI tried to meet the band in
the middle and suggest that they trim the

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.859
song down, a suggestion that the band quickly
dismissed.

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.550
The one person who saw the genius of the song,
other than the band of course, was famed DJ

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.650
and a close friend of Mercury, Kenny Everett,
who famously stated that it was “going to

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.959
be number one for centuries.”

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.859
Exactly how Everett first got hold of a copy
of the single early in October of 1975 isn’t

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:19.859
clear.

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.430
Depending on who you want to believe, Everett
either asked Roy Baker for a copy after hearing

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.739
it at a private demonstration or was sent
one by Mercury himself shortly after it was

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:29.739
recorded.

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.370
Either way, we know that Everett was asked
to kindly keep the record to himself and absolutely

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.409
not play it on the radio or talk about how
he’d gotten his hands on a hot new record

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:40.409
live on air.

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.889
According to Baker, Everett got the message
with Baker stating he said, “I won’t play

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.389
it”, while giving them a wink.

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.169
You see, the band was still struggling to
get their label to make it the first single

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.510
of the album, so took matters into their own
hands.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.790
Despite the “strict” instructions not
to play it, immediately after getting a copy

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.230
of the single, Everett began playing clips
of the song on his morning show on Capital

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.159
FM, a popular London based radio station.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.349
Each time Everett aired a clip from the song,
he’d play it off as an accident, telling

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.629
listeners that “his finger must’ve slipped”
and that they weren’t supposed to have heard

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:14.629
anything.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.169
Steadily, interest in the song grew.

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.510
Callers began flooding the station with requests,
begging Everett to play the whole song, which

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.699
he’d by this point built up to a ridiculous
degree, telling his now captive audience that

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.560
he couldn’t play the entire song because
he’d been made to promise that he wouldn’t.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.770
Eventually, Everett relented and played the
entire song 14 times over the course of two

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.770
days.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.280
One critical thing Everett left out about
the single was where fans could buy it, causing

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.650
the station to be visited by hundreds of curious
music fans hoping to acquire a copy.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.050
Record stores across the country were also
similarly surprised when demands began pouring

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.650
in for the single the following Monday morning
after Everett had played the full song.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.460
The problem was that at this point the song
hadn’t actually been released yet.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.650
A similar thing was happening on the other
side of the pond when Paul Drew of RKO managed

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.030
to wrangle a copy of the song from somewhere
and started playing it across the RKO network

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.050
of stations.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.910
As Baker later stated, “It was a strange
situation where radio on both sides of the

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.970
Atlantic was breaking a record that the record
companies said would never get airplay!”

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.960
With the song already something of a hit on
the radio even before being released, the

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.509
label relented and on the 31st of October,
1975, Bohemian Rhapsody was officially released

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:32.560
as a single in the UK where it spent 9 weeks
at number one.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.210
In keeping with Kenny’s predictions, the
song is regarded today as one of the finest

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:55.890
ever recorded, including being inducted into
the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2004.
