Wiberg: The appealing thing
of armchairs

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.280
is they always have a story.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.480
Some of them are
100 years old,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.920
and being able
to work with those chairs

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.160
makes my life a lot better.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.800
In the age of 25,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.720
I discovered that I have
this eye disease.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.040
Now, 30 years later,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.720
I have about
five-degree vision,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.080
and it will decrease
until nothing's left.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.200
Super important
that I feel the material

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.280
and feel that I'm doing
the right thing.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.360
It's all in your hands,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.200
and you can feel it
before you can see it.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.920
For me, restoring chairs
is like

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.000
giving a second life
to something.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.920
It's really a wonderful
feeling,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.320
to make something
that really makes a difference

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.960
for other people.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.960
