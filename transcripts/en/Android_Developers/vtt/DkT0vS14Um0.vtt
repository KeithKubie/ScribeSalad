JOANNA SMITH: Screen real estate
on devices is pretty scarce,

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.321
and material design
encourages apps to have

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:06.734
a simpler and cleaner look.

00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:08.400
But this can make it
difficult for users

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.024
to discover all of the
options your app offers.

00:00:11.024 --> 00:00:13.190
I'm Joanna Smith, and this
is exactly why you should

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.020
consider a navigation drawer.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.020
A navigation drawer
is a panel of options

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.560
on the left edge of the screen.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.300
Usually, it is hidden from view.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.730
But it can be revealed when
the user swipes from the left.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.440
It may also be
permanently visible

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.690
if there's enough screen
real estate, such as a tablet

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.050
in landscape mode.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.630
Having a navigation
drawer, commonly

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.650
referred to as the left
nav, allows your app

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.950
to offer a wealth of
features and behaviors,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.022
without being
visually overwhelming.

00:00:36.022 --> 00:00:38.230
So you get to keep your most
important features front

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.800
and center, and then when
the user is looking for more,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.419
they can open this menu.

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:44.460
By now, you're completely
convinced that you need

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.210
to build a left nav right away.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.010
So allow me to show
you what to do.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.192
First, you're going to
create a drawer layout.

00:00:50.192 --> 00:00:51.900
The drawer layout
should be the root view

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.690
and contain two child views.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.960
The first child must be the
view from the main content

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.692
of the screen.

00:00:56.692 --> 00:00:58.400
This is for when your
left nav is hidden,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.260
so that when the drawer is
later opened, it will be on top.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.400
The second child is the view for
the navigation drawer itself.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.900
After you've got
your layout, you'll

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.870
need the list of items
that will fill it.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.250
A navigation view makes
this easy by providing

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.405
the framework you need
for the navigation drawer.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.530
You just need to provide
the navigation view widget

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.240
with two things-- the header
layout, if you have one,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.940
and the menu of list items.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.710
The menu is actually
pretty great

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.720
since it allows you to inflate
your content from a menu XML

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.720
resource instead of managing
a list view programmatically.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.220
And even better,
this means that you

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.170
get all of your
material design styling

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.190
on the nav drawer for free.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.030
This mini resource
can be as simple

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.080
as a collection of
checkable menu items.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.080
Whichever is currently
checked will be displayed

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.870
as the highlighted nav item.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.980
However, you can also
build more complex menus

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.060
by using sub-headers to
group items together.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.060
Now that you have your
list of navigation items,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.010
you'll need to respond
to click events.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.710
You'll get callbacks
on selected items

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.380
by setting an on navigation
item selected listener

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.050
using set navigation
item selected listener.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.680
This callback provides you with
the menu item that was clicked,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.670
allowing you to handle
selection events,

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.841
change the check status,
load new content, and so on.

00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:05.340
Now if your navigation
drawer is not

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.090
a permanent view in your
app, which is highly likely,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.660
you'll want to listen for
open and close events.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.850
This will allow you to
make any adjustments you

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.860
need before switching views.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.080
The default checker for
opening the navigation drawer

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.430
is a swipe from the left.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.440
But you can also use
the hamburger icon

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.200
to toggle the drawer
open and closed.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.470
Now there's one final note.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.960
I've been referring to
the navigation drawer

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.670
as a left nav, but
that does not mean

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.480
it must always be on the left.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.814
If your app supports right
to left layouts, for example,

00:02:31.814 --> 00:02:34.188
and you've already marked your
layouts with start and end

00:02:34.188 --> 00:02:36.040
attributes instead of
left and right ones,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.750
the system will create a
right nav for you instead.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.374
This way, your RTL users
can swipe from the right

00:02:41.374 --> 00:02:42.915
to open the navigation
drawer, and it

00:02:42.915 --> 00:02:46.377
will be properly aligned on
the right side of the screen.

00:02:46.377 --> 00:02:48.710

But most importantly, just
continue to build better apps.
