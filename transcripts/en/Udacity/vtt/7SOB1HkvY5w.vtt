There shouldn't be any changes in your local repository that

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.070
are not on GitHub because you ran getPush after the most recent change you

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.000
made to the local repository.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.550
Similarly, you ran getPull after the most recent change you

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.220
made directly on GitHub.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.920
So there shouldn't be any changes on GitHub that aren't in your

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.730
local repository.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.060
Instead the two repositories should have the same commits right now.
