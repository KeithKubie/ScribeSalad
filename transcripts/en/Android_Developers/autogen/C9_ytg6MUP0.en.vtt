00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139
work on Android security Shaolin will be
 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.799
work on Android security Shaolin will be
joining us in just a minute as well it's

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809
joining us in just a minute as well it's
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.990
joining us in just a minute as well it's
going to be a bit of a whirlwind tour if

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000
going to be a bit of a whirlwind tour if
 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.029
going to be a bit of a whirlwind tour if
I talk too fast or Shaolin talks too

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039
I talk too fast or Shaolin talks too
 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.710
I talk too fast or Shaolin talks too
fast I apologize but there's really been

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720
fast I apologize but there's really been
 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.210
fast I apologize but there's really been
a lot going on in the world of security

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220
a lot going on in the world of security
 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.599
a lot going on in the world of security
on Android and Google Play over the last

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
on Android and Google Play over the last
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.370
on Android and Google Play over the last
year the last two years last five years

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380
year the last two years last five years
 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.390
year the last two years last five years
and so we're going to try to touch on

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400
and so we're going to try to touch on
 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.099
and so we're going to try to touch on
quite a bit of that as we go through

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109
quite a bit of that as we go through
 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.209
quite a bit of that as we go through
here today and give you the information

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219
here today and give you the information
 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.400
here today and give you the information
that you hopefully need and certainly

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410
that you hopefully need and certainly
 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.080
that you hopefully need and certainly
seem to want we've got a lot of people

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
seem to want we've got a lot of people
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.450
seem to want we've got a lot of people
here today pretty exciting what we're

going to cover is we'll talk a little
 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.260
going to cover is we'll talk a little
bit about the security services and from

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270
bit about the security services and from
 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.090
bit about the security services and from
their handoff and begin talking about

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100
their handoff and begin talking about
 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.470
their handoff and begin talking about
the core operating system and app

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480
the core operating system and app
 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.250
the core operating system and app
security so we'll dive right in

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260
security so we'll dive right in
 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.180
security so we'll dive right in
yesterday we heard mention of something

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190
yesterday we heard mention of something
 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.389
yesterday we heard mention of something
new exciting Google Play protect what is

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399
new exciting Google Play protect what is
 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.670
new exciting Google Play protect what is
Google Play protect the core of it is an

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680
Google Play protect the core of it is an
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.990
Google Play protect the core of it is an
engine that we've built over the last

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
engine that we've built over the last
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.880
engine that we've built over the last
several years to protect all of the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890
several years to protect all of the
 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.830
several years to protect all of the
devices in the Android ecosystem this

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
devices in the Android ecosystem this
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900
devices in the Android ecosystem this
slide has grown year after year now we

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910
slide has grown year after year now we
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.700
slide has grown year after year now we
talk about over two billion devices

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710
talk about over two billion devices
 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.590
talk about over two billion devices
around the world that are protected by

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600
around the world that are protected by
 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.539
around the world that are protected by
those services scanning over a billion

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
those services scanning over a billion
 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.760
those services scanning over a billion
devices and checking over 50 billion

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770
devices and checking over 50 billion
 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.580
devices and checking over 50 billion
devices and the applications every

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
devices and the applications every
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.280
devices and the applications every
single day so incredible scale and the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
single day so incredible scale and the
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.660
single day so incredible scale and the
reason that we have that scale because

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
reason that we have that scale because
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.950
reason that we have that scale because
we need it to be able to see what's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960
we need it to be able to see what's
 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.719
we need it to be able to see what's
going on on an ecosystem that's on a

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
going on on an ecosystem that's on a
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.350
going on on an ecosystem that's on a
mass really almost the majority of

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360
mass really almost the majority of
 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.550
mass really almost the majority of
devices that are out there in the world

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
devices that are out there in the world
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.590
devices that are out there in the world
to be able to actually look at all of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
to be able to actually look at all of
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.730
to be able to actually look at all of
that data of course requires

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740
that data of course requires
 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.620
that data of course requires
computational resources turns out Google

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630
computational resources turns out Google
 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.450
computational resources turns out Google
has quite a few of those we use just a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460
has quite a few of those we use just a
 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.010
has quite a few of those we use just a
tiny sliver of them to look at the data

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020
tiny sliver of them to look at the data
 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.289
tiny sliver of them to look at the data
everyday over 20,000 dedicated

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299
everyday over 20,000 dedicated
 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.520
everyday over 20,000 dedicated
processors that are looking at that

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530
processors that are looking at that
 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.950
processors that are looking at that
application data analyzing it diving

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
application data analyzing it diving
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.170
application data analyzing it diving
deep into every single new application

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
deep into every single new application
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.880
deep into every single new application
that we find over 500,000 new

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890
that we find over 500,000 new
 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.039
that we find over 500,000 new
applications discovered every day and

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
applications discovered every day and
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.020
applications discovered every day and
trying to understand how they behave in

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
trying to understand how they behave in
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.969
trying to understand how they behave in
our environment how they behave out

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979
our environment how they behave out
 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.980
our environment how they behave out
there in the real world and what risks

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990
there in the real world and what risks
 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.200
there in the real world and what risks
they might pose for users now the reason

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
they might pose for users now the reason
 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.730
they might pose for users now the reason
we do that of course is to protect users

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740
we do that of course is to protect users
 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.039
we do that of course is to protect users
and so one of the most important things

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
and so one of the most important things
 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.200
and so one of the most important things
that we do is try to keep an eye on what

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
that we do is try to keep an eye on what
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.819
that we do is try to keep an eye on what
is the risk that users are being exposed

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829
is the risk that users are being exposed
 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.520
is the risk that users are being exposed
to clearly over the last few years what

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
to clearly over the last few years what
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.260
to clearly over the last few years what
we found is that users of Google Play

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270
we found is that users of Google Play
 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.330
we found is that users of Google Play
are in a much safer position they're

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340
are in a much safer position they're
 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.760
are in a much safer position they're
about 95 percent safer if they're

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
about 95 percent safer if they're
 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.990
about 95 percent safer if they're
installing applications that come from

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000
installing applications that come from
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.510
installing applications that come from
Google

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520
Google
 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.790
Google
and the reason is we're able to use data

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800
and the reason is we're able to use data
 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.740
and the reason is we're able to use data
that's gathered outside of google play

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750
that's gathered outside of google play
 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.290
that's gathered outside of google play
and then analyze that in the context of

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300
and then analyze that in the context of
 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.280
and then analyze that in the context of
an environment that's much more

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290
an environment that's much more
 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.140
an environment that's much more
controlled and so applications at the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150
controlled and so applications at the
 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.790
controlled and so applications at the
time that they're uploaded we're able to

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800
time that they're uploaded we're able to
 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.680
time that they're uploaded we're able to
analyze them understand what's in there

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690
analyze them understand what's in there
 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.060
analyze them understand what's in there
and then make good guidance and provide

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070
and then make good guidance and provide
 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.500
and then make good guidance and provide
that kind of guidance but we also

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510
that kind of guidance but we also
 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.390
that kind of guidance but we also
provide those protections outside of

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400
provide those protections outside of
 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.700
provide those protections outside of
Google Play and so that's what we wanted

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710
Google Play and so that's what we wanted
 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.110
Google Play and so that's what we wanted
to show here is that over the last few

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120
to show here is that over the last few
 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.670
to show here is that over the last few
years we've been carefully tracking this

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680
years we've been carefully tracking this
 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.110
years we've been carefully tracking this
keeping an eye on what's going on and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120
keeping an eye on what's going on and
 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.060
keeping an eye on what's going on and
making sure that users are being

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070
making sure that users are being
 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.090
making sure that users are being
protected from my perspective it's all

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100
protected from my perspective it's all
 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.730
protected from my perspective it's all
about the graphs but that's not really

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740
about the graphs but that's not really
 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.740
about the graphs but that's not really
how most people think about security

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750
how most people think about security
 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.180
how most people think about security
because most people aren't looking at

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190
because most people aren't looking at
 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.490
because most people aren't looking at
the entire ecosystem at once what they

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500
the entire ecosystem at once what they
 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.100
the entire ecosystem at once what they
want to know is am i safe and so that's

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110
want to know is am i safe and so that's
 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.330
want to know is am i safe and so that's
really what the announcement was

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340
really what the announcement was
 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.410
really what the announcement was
yesterday putting really in a brand

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420
yesterday putting really in a brand
 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.370
yesterday putting really in a brand
understanding that these protections are

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380
understanding that these protections are
 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.690
understanding that these protections are
there and making them more and more

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700
there and making them more and more
 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.330
there and making them more and more
visible to users but also that Google is

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340
visible to users but also that Google is
 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.830

Google doesn't look at the applications
 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.970
Google doesn't look at the applications
in Google Play it blows my mind every

the application is developer is

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940
the application is developer is
 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.540
the application is developer is
enrolling to become a member of sort of

Google Play publishing process and at

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380
Google Play publishing process and at
 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.420
Google Play publishing process and at
the time the application is published

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430
the time the application is published
 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.120
the time the application is published
and

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130
and
 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.310
and
every single day after that we reanalyze

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320
every single day after that we reanalyze
 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.900
every single day after that we reanalyze
all of those applications so it's

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910
all of those applications so it's
 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.190
all of those applications so it's
absolutely a lot of that kind of

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.200
absolutely a lot of that kind of
 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.330
absolutely a lot of that kind of
intelligence that's going on in the

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340
intelligence that's going on in the
 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.620

background and analysis going on in the
 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.540
background and analysis going on in the
background it simply wasn't exposed and

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550
background it simply wasn't exposed and
 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.920
background it simply wasn't exposed and
so a lot of the work that we're doing

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930
so a lot of the work that we're doing
 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.900
so a lot of the work that we're doing
right now is to just figure out how to

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910
right now is to just figure out how to
 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.600
right now is to just figure out how to
delicately indicate to the user whether

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610
delicately indicate to the user whether
 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.630
delicately indicate to the user whether
that be a consumer or an enterprise yeah

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:55.640
that be a consumer or an enterprise yeah
 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.130
that be a consumer or an enterprise yeah
this is happening we're checking these

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140
this is happening we're checking these
 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.430
this is happening we're checking these
things and we've got your back but it's

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440
things and we've got your back but it's
 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.770
things and we've got your back but it's
not just about consumers right it's also

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:02.780
not just about consumers right it's also
 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.480
not just about consumers right it's also
about application developers and making

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490
about application developers and making
 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.650
about application developers and making
sure that they have the ability to

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660
sure that they have the ability to
 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.200
sure that they have the ability to
leverage these services as well right

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.210
leverage these services as well right
 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.840

the verify apps API in the past we've
talked publicly about verify apps which

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190
talked publicly about verify apps which

is the mechanism that's used to evaluate
 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.040
is the mechanism that's used to evaluate
on a device and to check for a user on a

on a device and to check for a user on a
 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.870
on a device and to check for a user on a
device whether something is potentially

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:25.880

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:27.830
harmful or a piece of malware what we've
 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.830
harmful or a piece of malware what we've
done with the verify apps API is just

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840
done with the verify apps API is just
 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.450
done with the verify apps API is just
made that available to any application

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:31.460
made that available to any application
 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.790
made that available to any application
on the device so if you're concerned

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800
on the device so if you're concerned
 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.750
on the device so if you're concerned
about whether or not your application

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:34.760
about whether or not your application
 

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.090
about whether or not your application
should be running you can check are

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:37.100
should be running you can check are
 

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.310
should be running you can check are
there any other apps on this device that

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:39.320
there any other apps on this device that
 

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.140
there any other apps on this device that
I should be worried about what are those

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:41.150
I should be worried about what are those
 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.390
I should be worried about what are those
applications let me know what they are

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.400

doesn't mean everybody can install and
 

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.460
doesn't mean everybody can install and
really that's targeted at making sure

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:21.470
really that's targeted at making sure
 

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.139
really that's targeted at making sure

operating system to make it more secure
as well as the hardness we've collected

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200
as well as the hardness we've collected
 

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.160
as well as the hardness we've collected
a lot of data on the impact and the

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:00.170
a lot of data on the impact and the
 

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.540
a lot of data on the impact and the
adoption of some of these features so

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:01.550
adoption of some of these features so
 

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.490
adoption of some of these features so
I'm excited to share some of that with

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:03.500
I'm excited to share some of that with
 

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.389
I'm excited to share some of that with
you so let's dig in

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399
you so let's dig in
 

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:11.259
you so let's dig in
we'll start with the basics

00:11:11.259 --> 00:11:11.269
 

00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:13.389
and that begins with verified boots so

00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:13.399
and that begins with verified boots so
 

00:11:13.399 --> 00:11:15.850
and that begins with verified boots so
verified boot is androids secure boot

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:15.860
verified boot is androids secure boot
 

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.860
verified boot is androids secure boot
mechanism where we check the signature

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:17.870
mechanism where we check the signature
 

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.990
mechanism where we check the signature
of every stage of boots before running

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000
of every stage of boots before running
 

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.689
of every stage of boots before running
us and that has come a long way in the

00:11:22.689 --> 00:11:22.699
us and that has come a long way in the
 

00:11:22.699 --> 00:11:24.670
us and that has come a long way in the
last few years with Android marshmallow

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:24.680
last few years with Android marshmallow
 

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.160
last few years with Android marshmallow
we started requiring a verified boot for

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:27.170
we started requiring a verified boot for
 

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.769
we started requiring a verified boot for
all compatible devices with Android

00:11:29.769 --> 00:11:29.779

nougats that became verified boot is now

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:33.470
nougats that became verified boot is now
 

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.069
nougats that became verified boot is now
strictly enforced and that's required

00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079
strictly enforced and that's required
 

00:11:36.079 --> 00:11:38.590
strictly enforced and that's required
for all compatible devices and now with

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:38.600
for all compatible devices and now with
 

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.930
for all compatible devices and now with
Android oh we're providing guidance to

couple more security enhancements to
 

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:47.740
couple more security enhancements to
really round out the features that a

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:47.750
really round out the features that a
 

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.960
really round out the features that a
verified boot starting with roll back

protections with on compatible devices
 

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.019
protections with on compatible devices
on Android Oh verified boots will no

00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:56.029
on Android Oh verified boots will no
 

00:11:56.029 --> 00:11:58.689

longer boot and operating systems that's

00:11:58.689 --> 00:11:58.699
longer boot and operating systems that's
 

00:11:58.699 --> 00:12:00.370
longer boot and operating systems that's
known to has been rolled back to an

older potentially a much more vulnerable
version also with verified boot we have

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:06.350
version also with verified boot we have
 

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.439
version also with verified boot we have
hardened the unlocking mechanism the

00:12:08.439 --> 00:12:08.449
hardened the unlocking mechanism the
 

00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:10.660
hardened the unlocking mechanism the
bootloader a locking mechanism and what

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:10.670
bootloader a locking mechanism and what
 

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:13.480
bootloader a locking mechanism and what
that means is any bugs or any compromise

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:13.490
that means is any bugs or any compromise
 

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.880
that means is any bugs or any compromise
in the Android operating system cannot

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:15.890
in the Android operating system cannot
 

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.790
in the Android operating system cannot
unlock the bootloader only you by

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800
unlock the bootloader only you by
 

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.199
unlock the bootloader only you by
interacting with the bootloader itself

00:12:20.199 --> 00:12:20.209
interacting with the bootloader itself
 

00:12:20.209 --> 00:12:24.389
interacting with the bootloader itself
can unlock the bootloader

00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399
 

00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:27.309
so while verify boots protect your

00:12:27.309 --> 00:12:27.319
so while verify boots protect your
 

00:12:27.319 --> 00:12:30.639

operating system Android uses encryption

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:30.649
operating system Android uses encryption
 

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:33.699
operating system Android uses encryption
to protect user data and that has also

00:12:33.699 --> 00:12:33.709
to protect user data and that has also
 

00:12:33.709 --> 00:12:35.590
to protect user data and that has also
come a long way in the last few years as

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600
come a long way in the last few years as

we added a major upgrade to encryption

00:12:48.819 --> 00:12:48.829
we added a major upgrade to encryption
 

00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:51.699
we added a major upgrade to encryption
story called file based encryption where

00:12:51.699 --> 00:12:51.709
story called file based encryption where
 

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:53.230
story called file based encryption where
we encrypt different storage areas with

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:53.240
we encrypt different storage areas with
 

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.670
we encrypt different storage areas with
different keys

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:54.680
different keys
 

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.280

encryption was very very low marshmallow

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:40.760
encryption was very very low marshmallow
 

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.150
encryption was very very low marshmallow
that jumped to about 25 percent and now

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.160
that jumped to about 25 percent and now
 

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.350
that jumped to about 25 percent and now
in Android nougat we're seeing

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360
in Android nougat we're seeing
 

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.830
in Android nougat we're seeing
encryption support at around 80 percent

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:46.840
encryption support at around 80 percent
 

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.210

as a matter of fact we started requiring

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:49.220
as a matter of fact we started requiring
 

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.550
as a matter of fact we started requiring
encryption on compatible devices as of

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:51.560
encryption on compatible devices as of
 

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.560
encryption on compatible devices as of
Android marshmallow the reason that

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:53.570
Android marshmallow the reason that
 

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.390
Android marshmallow the reason that
number didn't jump immediately to 100%

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:55.400
number didn't jump immediately to 100%
 

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.530
number didn't jump immediately to 100%
is due to a couple of factors one is a

00:13:59.530 --> 00:13:59.540
is due to a couple of factors one is a
 

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.480
is due to a couple of factors one is a
lot of marshmallow devices or upgrades

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:01.490
lot of marshmallow devices or upgrades
 

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:03.610
lot of marshmallow devices or upgrades
from lollipop and so those devices were

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:03.620
from lollipop and so those devices were
 

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.380
from lollipop and so those devices were
not required to be encrypted when they

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:05.390
not required to be encrypted when they
 

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.960
not required to be encrypted when they
first shipped and also because of the

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:07.970
first shipped and also because of the
 

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.970
first shipped and also because of the
wide variety of devices that are

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:09.980
wide variety of devices that are
 

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.850
wide variety of devices that are
supported by Android we still see a lot

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:12.860
supported by Android we still see a lot
 

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.430
supported by Android we still see a lot
of very low performance devices that are

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440
of very low performance devices that are
 

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.160
of very low performance devices that are
not yet capable of supporting encryption

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:17.170
not yet capable of supporting encryption
 

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.660
not yet capable of supporting encryption
nevertheless we could expect that number

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:19.670
nevertheless we could expect that number
 

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.960
nevertheless we could expect that number
to continue to increase and we see that

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:22.970
to continue to increase and we see that
 

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.060
to continue to increase and we see that
encryption on Android is now the norm

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:25.070
encryption on Android is now the norm
 

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.710
encryption on Android is now the norm
and no longer the exception another way

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:29.720
and no longer the exception another way
 

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.350
and no longer the exception another way

in which we are protecting user data is
 

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.610
in which we are protecting user data is
to improve the secure lock screen

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:33.620
to improve the secure lock screen
 

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.670
to improve the secure lock screen
experience with Android marshmallow we

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:36.680
experience with Android marshmallow we
 

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.260
experience with Android marshmallow we
introduced official support for

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:38.270
introduced official support for
 

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.570
introduced official support for
fingerprint sensors and that had a

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:40.580
fingerprint sensors and that had a
 

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.540
fingerprint sensors and that had a
significant impact on the adoption rate

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:43.550
significant impact on the adoption rate
 

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:48.100
significant impact on the adoption rate
of a secure lock screen also we have

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:48.110
of a secure lock screen also we have
 

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:51.910
of a secure lock screen also we have
been working with manufacturers to put

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920
been working with manufacturers to put
 

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.130
been working with manufacturers to put
on requirements to make the

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:54.140
on requirements to make the
 

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.690
on requirements to make the
implementation of a secure lock screen

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:55.700
implementation of a secure lock screen
 

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.700
implementation of a secure lock screen
much more secure over time from the very

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:57.710
much more secure over time from the very
 

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.830
much more secure over time from the very
beginning fingerprint implementation the

00:14:59.830 --> 00:14:59.840
beginning fingerprint implementation the
 

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.510
beginning fingerprint implementation the
fingerprint verification was required to

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:01.520
fingerprint verification was required to
 

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.430
fingerprint verification was required to
be implemented in secure hardware such

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440
be implemented in secure hardware such
 

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.080
be implemented in secure hardware such
as the trusted execution environment the

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:05.090
as the trusted execution environment the
 

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.569
as the trusted execution environment the
PE with Android Mugen we started require

verification also take place in secure
 

00:15:12.029 --> 00:15:15.229
verification also take place in secure
hardware and now with Android oh we're

00:15:15.229 --> 00:15:15.239
hardware and now with Android oh we're
 

00:15:15.239 --> 00:15:17.929
hardware and now with Android oh we're
adding in support for tamper resistant

00:15:17.929 --> 00:15:17.939
adding in support for tamper resistant
 

00:15:17.939 --> 00:15:21.769
adding in support for tamper resistant

verification the significantly raises

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:34.470
verification the significantly raises
 

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.970
verification the significantly raises
the bar makes it much much harder to

00:15:44.679 --> 00:15:44.689
 

00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:46.699
so how are we doing with secure

00:15:46.699 --> 00:15:46.709
so how are we doing with secure
 

00:15:46.709 --> 00:15:49.129
so how are we doing with secure
lockscreen adoption we see that that has

00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:49.139
lockscreen adoption we see that that has
 

00:15:49.139 --> 00:15:51.019
lockscreen adoption we see that that has
also increased quite a bit over the last

00:15:51.019 --> 00:15:51.029
also increased quite a bit over the last
 

00:15:51.029 --> 00:15:51.799
also increased quite a bit over the last
few years

00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:51.809
few years
 

00:15:51.809 --> 00:15:54.439

whereas on lollipop devices adoption was

00:15:54.439 --> 00:15:54.449
whereas on lollipop devices adoption was
 

00:15:54.449 --> 00:15:57.710
whereas on lollipop devices adoption was
only about half and half that increase

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720
only about half and half that increase
 

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.619
only about half and half that increase
to almost 70 percent now on new Android

00:16:00.619 --> 00:16:00.629
to almost 70 percent now on new Android
 

00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:03.079
to almost 70 percent now on new Android
Newgate devices and a lot of that was

00:16:03.079 --> 00:16:03.089
Newgate devices and a lot of that was
 

00:16:03.089 --> 00:16:04.939
Newgate devices and a lot of that was
probably driven by the fact that a lot

00:16:04.939 --> 00:16:04.949
probably driven by the fact that a lot
 

00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:06.679
probably driven by the fact that a lot
of new devices now have a fingerprint

00:16:06.679 --> 00:16:06.689
of new devices now have a fingerprint
 

00:16:06.689 --> 00:16:08.749
of new devices now have a fingerprint
sensor and we see from the data that

00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:08.759
sensor and we see from the data that
 

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:11.329
sensor and we see from the data that
fingerprint devices are much more likely

00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:11.339
fingerprint devices are much more likely
 

00:16:11.339 --> 00:16:13.159
fingerprint devices are much more likely
to have a skier lockscreen than across

years with Android marshmallow we

00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:01.889
years with Android marshmallow we
 

00:17:01.889 --> 00:17:03.949
years with Android marshmallow we
introduced runtime permissions and we've

00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959
introduced runtime permissions and we've
 

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:06.679
introduced runtime permissions and we've
seen great adoption there with Android

00:17:06.679 --> 00:17:06.689

Mugen and Android oh we are continuing
to update the permissions model to make

00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039
to update the permissions model to make
 

00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:13.100
to update the permissions model to make
it more usable by good apps and less

it more usable by good apps and less
 

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:16.129
it more usable by good apps and less

into the details of that let's check out

00:17:17.539 --> 00:17:17.549
into the details of that let's check out
 

00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:20.199
into the details of that let's check out
how runtime permissions are doing

00:17:20.199 --> 00:17:20.209

we looked into

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:22.760
we looked into
 

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.140
we looked into
permission requests and so for each

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:26.150
permission requests and so for each
 

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.470
permission requests and so for each
request for let's say the camera group

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:29.480
request for let's say the camera group
 

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.800
request for let's say the camera group
of permissions we see that about 65% of

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:32.810
of permissions we see that about 65% of
 

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.860
of permissions we see that about 65% of
users 65% of those requests are accepted

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:35.870
users 65% of those requests are accepted
 

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.810
users 65% of those requests are accepted
by the users so that's towards one at

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:37.820
by the users so that's towards one at
 

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.060
by the users so that's towards one at
the end of the spectrum towards the

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:40.070
the end of the spectrum towards the
 

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:41.920
the end of the spectrum towards the
other end of the spectrum we see that

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:41.930
other end of the spectrum we see that
 

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.620

for the phone group of permissions only

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:44.630
for the phone group of permissions only
 

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.990
for the phone group of permissions only
about 44% of the permission requests are

about 44% of the permission requests are
 

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.870
about 44% of the permission requests are
accepted by the user so users are

were here in the last session actually

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240
were here in the last session actually
 

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.050
were here in the last session actually
in this tent there was a session about

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:05.060
in this tent there was a session about
 

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.140
in this tent there was a session about
instant apps so it's an app for those

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:08.150
instant apps so it's an app for those
 

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.210

who don't know is a feature coming to

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:10.220
who don't know is a feature coming to
 

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.310
who don't know is a feature coming to
Android where you can click on a URL and

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320
Android where you can click on a URL and
 

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.100
Android where you can click on a URL and
open it immediately in Android app even

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:15.110
open it immediately in Android app even
 

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.170
open it immediately in Android app even
if you don't have the app installed so

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:17.180
if you don't have the app installed so
 

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.630
if you don't have the app installed so
that has a potential to greatly improve

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:19.640
that has a potential to greatly improve
 

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.600
that has a potential to greatly improve
user experience as well as increase in

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:22.610
user experience as well as increase in
 

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.520

arbitrary URLs and apps also comes with
 

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:33.490
arbitrary URLs and apps also comes with
associated security and privacy risks so

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:33.500
associated security and privacy risks so
 

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.850
associated security and privacy risks so
how do we want to address that we are

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:36.860
how do we want to address that we are
 

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.310
how do we want to address that we are
addressing that by creating an updated

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.320
addressing that by creating an updated
 

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.350
addressing that by creating an updated
permissions model that's really tailored

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360
permissions model that's really tailored
 

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.240
permissions model that's really tailored
to the capabilities and characteristics

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:43.250
to the capabilities and characteristics
 

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.240

instant apps will have curative priority
best practices based on

00:21:50.139 --> 00:21:50.149
best practices based on
 

00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:53.679
best practices based on
for example instant apps must use

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:53.689
for example instant apps must use
 

00:21:53.689 --> 00:21:56.619
for example instant apps must use
runtime permissions and instant apps

00:21:56.619 --> 00:21:56.629
runtime permissions and instant apps
 

00:21:56.629 --> 00:22:00.779
runtime permissions and instant apps
will use HTTP instead of HTTP by default

will use HTTP instead of HTTP by default
 

00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:02.589
will use HTTP instead of HTTP by default
there are a lot of Android permissions

00:22:02.589 --> 00:22:02.599
there are a lot of Android permissions
 

00:22:02.599 --> 00:22:04.469
there are a lot of Android permissions
that instead ups actually cannot access

00:22:04.469 --> 00:22:04.479
that instead ups actually cannot access
 

00:22:04.479 --> 00:22:07.359
that instead ups actually cannot access
they cannot access any persistent

they cannot access any persistent
persistent device identifiers and

00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:10.279
persistent device identifiers and
 

00:22:10.279 --> 00:22:12.279
persistent device identifiers and
another example is that they can't

00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:12.289
another example is that they can't
 

00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:14.529
another example is that they can't
access the contacts permission you must

00:22:14.529 --> 00:22:14.539
access the contacts permission you must
 

00:22:14.539 --> 00:22:17.769
access the contacts permission you must
use the contact picker instead as app

00:22:17.769 --> 00:22:17.779
use the contact picker instead as app
 

00:22:17.779 --> 00:22:19.419

deployable is it instant up but it

00:22:21.999 --> 00:22:22.009
deployable is it instant up but it
 

00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:23.229
deployable is it instant up but it
actually makes your normal app much

00:22:23.229 --> 00:22:23.239
actually makes your normal app much
 

00:22:23.239 --> 00:22:24.519
actually makes your normal app much
better too because you're now

00:22:24.519 --> 00:22:24.529
better too because you're now
 

00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:25.959
better too because you're now
automatically using security and privacy

00:22:25.959 --> 00:22:25.969
automatically using security and privacy
 

00:22:25.969 --> 00:22:28.989
automatically using security and privacy
best practices and for users if the

00:22:28.989 --> 00:22:28.999
best practices and for users if the
 

00:22:28.999 --> 00:22:30.429
best practices and for users if the
majority of your apps are now using

00:22:30.429 --> 00:22:30.439
majority of your apps are now using
 

00:22:30.439 --> 00:22:32.199
majority of your apps are now using
these best practices then your device

00:22:32.199 --> 00:22:32.209
these best practices then your device
 

00:22:32.209 --> 00:22:34.779
these best practices then your device
becomes a little bit safer too so we're

00:22:34.779 --> 00:22:34.789
becomes a little bit safer too so we're
 

00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:41.459
becomes a little bit safer too so we're
very excited about the insane apps model

00:22:41.459 --> 00:22:41.469
 

00:22:41.469 --> 00:22:44.769
so while permissions is really a way to

so while permissions is really a way to
 

00:22:44.779 --> 00:22:47.799
so while permissions is really a way to
control app access to data within the

00:22:56.859 --> 00:22:59.499
compromise in one can affect the others
for many years in Android we have been

00:22:59.499 --> 00:22:59.509
for many years in Android we have been
 

00:22:59.509 --> 00:23:01.929
for many years in Android we have been
up we have been steadily improving the

00:23:01.929 --> 00:23:01.939
up we have been steadily improving the
 

00:23:01.939 --> 00:23:04.059
up we have been steadily improving the
application sandbox in force with

00:23:04.059 --> 00:23:04.069
application sandbox in force with
 

00:23:04.069 --> 00:23:06.729
application sandbox in force with
selinux and we'll see how that's doing

00:23:06.729 --> 00:23:06.739
selinux and we'll see how that's doing
 

00:23:06.739 --> 00:23:09.489
selinux and we'll see how that's doing
the next slide in Android nougat we

00:23:09.489 --> 00:23:09.499
the next slide in Android nougat we
 

00:23:09.499 --> 00:23:11.349
the next slide in Android nougat we
applied these same sandboxing principles

00:23:11.349 --> 00:23:11.359
applied these same sandboxing principles
 

00:23:11.359 --> 00:23:14.319
applied these same sandboxing principles
to the media server to significantly

00:23:14.319 --> 00:23:14.329

specific vendor components into their
 

00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:30.989
specific vendor components into their
own sand boxes so how are we doing there

00:23:30.989 --> 00:23:30.999
own sand boxes so how are we doing there
 

00:23:30.999 --> 00:23:33.609
own sand boxes so how are we doing there
we looked into the data into the Android

00:23:33.609 --> 00:23:33.619
we looked into the data into the Android
 

00:23:33.619 --> 00:23:35.169
we looked into the data into the Android
Security Bulletin data from the first

00:23:35.169 --> 00:23:35.179

four months of this year when I said all
 

00:23:37.729 --> 00:23:39.789
four months of this year when I said all
the kernel bugs and we see that about

00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799
the kernel bugs and we see that about
 

00:23:39.799 --> 00:23:43.749
the kernel bugs and we see that about
half of the kernel bugs almost half as

00:23:43.749 --> 00:23:43.759
half of the kernel bugs almost half as
 

00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:45.369
half of the kernel bugs almost half as
the Linux actually we do some severity

00:23:45.369 --> 00:23:45.379
the Linux actually we do some severity
 

00:23:45.379 --> 00:23:48.399
the Linux actually we do some severity
of almost half of those kernel bugs by

00:23:48.399 --> 00:23:48.409
of almost half of those kernel bugs by
 

00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:51.189
of almost half of those kernel bugs by
making posters of the kernel unreachable

00:23:51.189 --> 00:23:51.199
making posters of the kernel unreachable
 

00:23:51.199 --> 00:23:54.099
making posters of the kernel unreachable
by untrusted apps we made it so that

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:54.109
by untrusted apps we made it so that
 

00:23:54.109 --> 00:23:56.499
by untrusted apps we made it so that
it's much harder to exploit those parts

00:23:56.499 --> 00:23:56.509
it's much harder to exploit those parts
 

00:23:56.509 --> 00:23:58.299
it's much harder to exploit those parts
of the kernel and that's what selinux

00:23:58.299 --> 00:23:58.309
of the kernel and that's what selinux
 

00:23:58.309 --> 00:24:03.390
of the kernel and that's what selinux
really helps with

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.400
 

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.830
as I mentioned earlier we took the same

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840
as I mentioned earlier we took the same
 

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.170
as I mentioned earlier we took the same
sandboxing and isolation techniques and

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:08.180
sandboxing and isolation techniques and
 

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.750
sandboxing and isolation techniques and

versions with shiny new features and new
 

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:07.930
versions with shiny new features and new
security enhancements and have it be

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:07.940
security enhancements and have it be
 

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.670

also the end of the vendor interface

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:16.330
also the end of the vendor interface
 

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.660
also the end of the vendor interface
allows us to enforce the boundaries

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:18.670
allows us to enforce the boundaries
 

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:20.460
allows us to enforce the boundaries
between the framework and the vendor

limit the ways in which a bug in one can
 

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:30.680
limit the ways in which a bug in one can
affect the other to take an example

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:30.690
affect the other to take an example

let's go back to the media server as

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:32.980
let's go back to the media server as

part of project trouble we have re

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:35.800
part of project trouble we have re
 

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.860
part of project trouble we have re
architected the media server again in

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:37.870
architected the media server again in
 

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.620
architected the media server again in
Android L and taken the audio camera and

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:40.630
Android L and taken the audio camera and
 

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:43.320
Android L and taken the audio camera and
DRM hardware abstraction layers and put

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:43.330
DRM hardware abstraction layers and put
 

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.340
DRM hardware abstraction layers and put
them into different processes in

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:44.350
them into different processes in
 

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:47.160
them into different processes in
different sandboxes what that lets us do

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:47.170
different sandboxes what that lets us do
 

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:50.490
different sandboxes what that lets us do
is to say the framework pieces actually

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:50.500
is to say the framework pieces actually
 

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.070
is to say the framework pieces actually
now no longer need access to the kernel

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.080
now no longer need access to the kernel
 

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.200
now no longer need access to the kernel
components the kernel drivers that

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.210
components the kernel drivers that
 

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.360
components the kernel drivers that
control media playback and so now we can

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:57.370
control media playback and so now we can
 

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.570
control media playback and so now we can
put the framework of pieces also into

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:00.580
put the framework of pieces also into
 

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:02.550
put the framework of pieces also into
tighter sand boxes as well and make it

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:02.560
tighter sand boxes as well and make it
 

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.990
tighter sand boxes as well and make it
so that an exploit in the kernel

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000
so that an exploit in the kernel
 

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.610
so that an exploit in the kernel
compromising the kernel it's not much

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:05.620
compromising the kernel it's not much
 

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.110
compromising the kernel it's not much
harder for that compromise to exploit

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120
harder for that compromise to exploit
 

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.810
harder for that compromise to exploit
certain areas of the four it's now

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:09.820
certain areas of the four it's now
 

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.550
certain areas of the four it's now
harder for compromises in the framework

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:11.560
harder for compromises in the framework
 

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:16.550
harder for compromises in the framework
to exploit certain areas of the kernel

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:16.560
 

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.360
all right so speaking of the kernel

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:20.370
all right so speaking of the kernel
 

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:22.650
all right so speaking of the kernel
why is kernel why is the kernel

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:22.660
why is kernel why is the kernel
 

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:26.100
why is kernel why is the kernel
important in the last year we have spent

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:26.110
important in the last year we have spent
 

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:31.920
important in the last year we have spent
a lot of time hardening the kernel and

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:31.930
a lot of time hardening the kernel and
 

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:35.430
a lot of time hardening the kernel and
we did that for one major reason we see

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440
we did that for one major reason we see
 

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.710
we did that for one major reason we see
that kernel bugs are becoming a much

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:37.720
that kernel bugs are becoming a much
 

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.330
that kernel bugs are becoming a much
larger proportion of android security

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:39.340
larger proportion of android security
 

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:43.830
larger proportion of android security
bugs was in 2014 about 4% of android

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840
bugs was in 2014 about 4% of android
 

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.050
bugs was in 2014 about 4% of android
security bugs for kernel bugs that

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:46.060
security bugs for kernel bugs that
 

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.540
security bugs for kernel bugs that
number increased significance ignition

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:48.550
number increased significance ignition
 

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.940
number increased significance ignition
out forty four percent and there are

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:50.950
out forty four percent and there are
 

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.070
out forty four percent and there are
probably a couple reasons for this one

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:53.080
probably a couple reasons for this one
 

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.050
probably a couple reasons for this one
is we've made a lot of progress in

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:55.060
is we've made a lot of progress in
 

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.420
is we've made a lot of progress in
hardening the user space so for example

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:57.430
hardening the user space so for example
 

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:59.520
hardening the user space so for example
the application sandbox that's enforced

00:27:59.520 --> 00:27:59.530
the application sandbox that's enforced
 

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:01.380
the application sandbox that's enforced
by icy Linux that's done a lot better

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:01.390
by icy Linux that's done a lot better
 

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:04.260
by icy Linux that's done a lot better
over time and in order to break out of

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:04.270
over time and in order to break out of
 

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.090
over time and in order to break out of
that application sandbox in order to

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:06.100
that application sandbox in order to
 

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.010
that application sandbox in order to
break out of the isolytic sandbox you

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:08.020
break out of the isolytic sandbox you
 

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:12.330
break out of the isolytic sandbox you
have to compromise the kernel also the

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:12.340
have to compromise the kernel also the
 

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.300
have to compromise the kernel also the
kernel is very powerful has large attack

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:15.310
kernel is very powerful has large attack
 

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:18.210
kernel is very powerful has large attack
surface it's kind of like the king piece

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:18.220
surface it's kind of like the king piece
 

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:19.170
surface it's kind of like the king piece
in a game of chess

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:19.180
in a game of chess
 

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.380
in a game of chess
you take the kernel and you win the game

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:22.390
you take the kernel and you win the game
 

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:25.440
you take the kernel and you win the game
and so we decided to spend a lot more

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:25.450
and so we decided to spend a lot more
 

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:27.030
and so we decided to spend a lot more
time thinking about how to harden

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:27.040
time thinking about how to harden
 

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.710
time thinking about how to harden
carnal so we looked into what causes

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:31.720
carnal so we looked into what causes
 

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.290
carnal so we looked into what causes
kernel bugs we looked into the data from

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:34.300
kernel bugs we looked into the data from
 

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.410
kernel bugs we looked into the data from
2014 and 2016 and categorize different

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:37.420
2014 and 2016 and categorize different
 

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.030
2014 and 2016 and categorize different
kernel bugs into in different categories

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:39.040
kernel bugs into in different categories
 

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.310
kernel bugs into in different categories
and we see that the largest category

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320
and we see that the largest category
 

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.110
and we see that the largest category
accounting for about 45% is this missing

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:46.120
accounting for about 45% is this missing
 

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.570
accounting for about 45% is this missing
an incorrect bounce check when we're

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:48.580
an incorrect bounce check when we're
 

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.880
an incorrect bounce check when we're
copying data from user space to the

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:50.890
copying data from user space to the
 

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:53.850
copying data from user space to the
kernel so we presented this exact same

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:53.860
kernel so we presented this exact same
 

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.430
kernel so we presented this exact same
data to the Linux upstream community and

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.440
data to the Linux upstream community and
 

00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:00.000
data to the Linux upstream community and
to arm last year and to their credit

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:00.010
to arm last year and to their credit
 

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.160
to arm last year and to their credit
they were super responsive within a

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:02.170
they were super responsive within a
 

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.870
they were super responsive within a
couple of months they gave us a feature

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880
couple of months they gave us a feature
 

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.570
couple of months they gave us a feature
called hardened user copy that addresses

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:06.580
called hardened user copy that addresses
 

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.900
called hardened user copy that addresses
this an entire category of kernel bugs

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:08.910
this an entire category of kernel bugs
 

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:11.910
this an entire category of kernel bugs
so we have since then back ported

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:11.920
so we have since then back ported
 

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.710
so we have since then back ported
hardened user copy to the edge or

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720
hardened user copy to the edge or
 

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.350
hardened user copy to the edge or
kernels 318 and above and we have also

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.360
kernels 318 and above and we have also
 

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.030
kernels 318 and above and we have also
implemented a few more security features

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:18.040
implemented a few more security features
 

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.310
implemented a few more security features
on top of that we have implemented 10

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320
on top of that we have implemented 10
 

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.250
on top of that we have implemented 10
emulation we have implemented Kas LR and

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:23.260
emulation we have implemented Kas LR and
 

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.410
emulation we have implemented Kas LR and
many others so all of these kernel

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:25.420
many others so all of these kernel
 

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.510
many others so all of these kernel
features taken together we expect that

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.520
features taken together we expect that
 

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.430
features taken together we expect that
they will have a huge impact on the

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440
they will have a huge impact on the
 

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.800
they will have a huge impact on the
number and severity of kernel bugs in

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:31.810
number and severity of kernel bugs in
 

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:40.080
number and severity of kernel bugs in
the future another way in which we are

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:40.090
the future another way in which we are
 

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:42.690
the future another way in which we are
protecting the kernel is to reduce its

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:42.700
protecting the kernel is to reduce its
 

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.760
protecting the kernel is to reduce its
attack surface we're using a technology

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:44.770
attack surface we're using a technology
 

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:45.810
attack surface we're using a technology
called seccomp

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:45.820

actually was not very easy for us to fix
 

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:13.980
actually was not very easy for us to fix
those bugs and get them out to users

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:13.990
those bugs and get them out to users
 

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:18.330
those bugs and get them out to users
quickly we address that with Android

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:18.340
quickly we address that with Android
 

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.910
