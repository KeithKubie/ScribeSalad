00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.540
Sarah: Hi, welcome to our live Photography
Conservation Q&amp;A.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.920
I'm Sarah Meister, a curator in the department
of photography here at MoMA.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.340
Lee Ann: And I'm Lee Ann Daffner, the conservator
of photography here at MoMA.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.700
Today we are in the photo conservation lab
at MoMA.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.280
And we saw that there were so many wonderful
questions that came in from the viewers that

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.160
we thought in order to give everybody a little
time to get settled, we might take a minute

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.080
to give a tour of our facilities here.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.100
Not many people get a chance to have this
sort of behind the scenes.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.160
Sarah: I love this space, so we thought we'd
share it a little bit.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.860
Let's start at your desk.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.880
Lee Ann: Come look at where I do the work on the photography collection.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.500
Sarah: So, we picked a few things that we
thought might be particularly interesting.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.560
And I thought one of these is a recent acquisition.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.480
This falls under the category of things that
we say, that we really can't responsibly

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.260
put on view, at least for any length of time.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.200
And so, we thought it would be fun to show
you exactly what it is, but I let Lee Ann

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.000
hold things when I'm not wearing gloves.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Lee Ann: Okay.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.799
Well, if you come a little bit closer, you
might see that there's a little package here

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.840
on my work table.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.539
It houses an auto chrome, which is a late
19th, early 20th century color photographic process.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.160
The package is designed to protect this work
of art because it's glass.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.760
And it's a unique object and we absolutely
do not want to break the object.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.349
So, we have a little four flap enclosure.

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.980
I'm going to pull it out, handle very carefully.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.100
And then if you look through, you may see,
I have it held up against one of our windows.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.760
This is a very precious and unusual process.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.739
The image dye is made from dyed potato starch grains.

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:39.460
And this particular plate was in the camera
that Alfred Stieglitz had on that rooftop

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.540
that day back in... What year do you think this is?

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.360
Sarah: 1918, we think.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.940
But, Lee Ann, maybe one more thing about when
you're holding it up.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.820
One of the reasons that Lee Ann's desk is
right here is that it faces north.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.760
And so most... would you say most conservation
studios are designed this way?

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.250
Lee Ann: Whenever possible.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.060
The northern light is the most even light
that you can get.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.220
Southern light is very bright, but it's uneven
throughout the day.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:12.380
So very often, conservation labs will position
their work tables and their easels right around

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.420
that north facing light so that you can actually
maximize, you know, your working hours throughout

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.420
the day.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.520
Sarah: So maybe you'll show us a little bit,
we pulled an another print that Lee Ann's

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.660
working on and this way you can... or even
though in like galleries, we try to have the

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.580
lighting be as even as possible, so as to
de-accentuate the flaws.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.880
When Lee Ann's working on things, she likes
northern light or raking light to make them

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.210
as obvious as possible.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.560
And so, maybe you can show us what you're
doing with this one.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.660
Lee Ann: No, absolutely.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.340
What Sarah was saying was so true.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.700
In fact, light is one of the tools that we
use.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.560
We have to be able to see the object and the
materials so that we can understand the conditions,

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.100
so that we can understand what needs to happen
with this particular work of art.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:05.500
This is for an upcoming exhibition and it's
in the lab because it's on an original 1955

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.210
mount, but it was quite worn around the edges.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:16.609
And so, I've been consolidating with a material
that will hold the gelatin flaps in place.

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.600
And then I'm doing cosmetic integration with
specially formulized watercolors that are

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.370
perfect for the use, you know, filling in
the little losses.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.350
Sarah: Can I just point out two little things
that might be of interest.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:35.040
One is that you can actually see where there
were pins that held this mounted print in

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.220
place at one point.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.380
And do you want to flip it over so we can
show?

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.280
Lee Ann: Oh, sure.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.560
Yeah, it's really interesting.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.740
Sarah: And then the backside of it is, you
can see the two areas where there were blocks

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.860
glued to the back of the print and a wire
hung between them.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.880
And that's actually how these prints were
displayed.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.160
So while we wouldn't do this now, we certainly
are more and more trying to respect the original

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.740
display and that's something I really love
about this work by Otto Steinert.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.480
Lee Ann: Yeah.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.620
No, we want to try to preserve as much of
the history of the object as possible.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.880
And so that exhibition is definitely part
of it.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.920
Sarah: Should we go maybe to the microscope
for a little bit because we...

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.440
Lee Ann and I...

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.260
Lee Ann: All right. Let's go over here.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.420
Sarah: So this is a photograph by Bill Brandt.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:32.480
It's maybe a little hard to see with the mylar,
so I'll lift this, of Jean Dubuffet's eye.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.620
And this photograph was a really exciting
one to look at under the microscope.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.800
Lee Ann and I... and now I leave it to her.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.480
Lee Ann: Well, we carried out an extensive
survey of Bill Brandt photographs and it was

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.920
an amazing opportunity to look at a body of work
and understand the materials, the techniques.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:01.860
How did Bill Brandt enhance a photograph that
he had already spent so much time taking and

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.820
developing.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.860
And, you know, cropping really in a very special
and precise way.

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:12.229
So, in fact, Bill Brandt was a very heavy
retoucher.

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:19.340
And so, what we're going to look at under
the microscope now is some retouch around

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.340
the eye.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.740
So, let's...

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.539
Sarah: And one of the things Lee Ann helped
me understand was that there are different

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:31.260
kinds of retouching and she categorized them
in this book so that we think of them as additive

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
retouching and reductive retouching.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.860
Lee Ann: Exactly.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.900
Sarah: And they're all of these different
categories that once you're looking at them

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.140
under the microscope, you can see it super
clearly, even if to the naked eye, you just...

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.260
They seem like emphasis.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.140
Lee Ann: Exactly.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.220
I mean, that was the whole idea.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.200
He wanted the viewer to be able to look at
the photograph and see, you know, the bright

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.100
streaks in the eyeball or see the deep crevices
in the wrinkles.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.820
And he enhanced that by either carefully etching
away, which we can see now.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.509
I don't know if you've moved it, but that's
okay.

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:01.200
Sarah: Oh, sorry.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.840
Did you have it on an etch?

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.400
Lee Ann: Yeah, there you go.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:12.039
Do you see right around the eyelid there's
little white, very bright white patches and

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:17.180
then in the crevices of the wrinkles he's
just taken, you know, a brush and some ink

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.560
and he's really enhanced that.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.560
Do you want to have a look?

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.360
Sarah: Sure.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.560
Always.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.600
Never turn down an opportunity to look in
a conservator's microscope because you...

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.900
It makes it look almost like a moonscape.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.660
Lee Ann: It's completely different way of
looking at surfaces and materials.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.920
This is a surgical, a stereo surgical microscope.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:46.620
And so, you get the complete 3D experience
as opposed to a regular research microscope

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.600
that just has one ocular.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.940
Maybe some people have, you know, in their
science classes use one of those.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.020
But this one has two, it's stereo.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.140
So we can really see the surface.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.740
We can do work under the microscope.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.080
Sarah: And maybe you want to mention also
about the light because unlike the northern light

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.729
here, I don't know if you can see, but
there are these super, super angled lights.

00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:07.800
Lee Ann: Right. It's a very focused light.

00:08:07.809 --> 00:08:10.619
We can also take one of them off and make
raking light.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.480
And that also enhances the topography of the
surface and gives us more information.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.000
And with Brandt, you can see so much on the
surface.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.580
I mean, for a very flat gelatin, silver glossy
print.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.100
I mean, he really worked the surface.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.220
It's amazing to see.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.619
Sarah: And in some ways it's what makes each
one of his prints unique because he was so,

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:34.220
so engaged with the surface of the print that,
you know, people think of photography

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:39.740
as a medium of multiples and of something where
the machine really takes a prominent role.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.420
And while that's somewhat true, it's also
amazing when you encounter examples of the

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.380
handwork that goes into it as well.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.380
Lee Ann: Exactly.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:52.640
No, I concur completely and I really feel
like photography is a medium of multiples,

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.460
but every one had to be made by hand.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:59.220
And so there's going to be, you know, small differences
or large, you know, differences depending

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.200
on what the photographer has done.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.200
Well...

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.140
Sarah: So that was... so we're getting the
signal, it's time for us to go answer some

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.440
real questions.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.020
Your questions, not just things that make
us curious.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.320
So, give us a quick second.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.320
We're going to go to photography and then
we'll head into the main part of the

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.780
Live Q&amp;A from there.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.500
Lee Ann: All right.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.960
Hey, Sarah, do you want to turn off that light?

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.980
Sarah: Oh, I don't know how.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:22.900
Lee Ann: Oh, okay.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.700
I'll do it for you.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.720
Sarah: I don't touch her equipment.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:27.820
Sarah: Alright, see you in a minute.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.800
Lee Ann: Okay, let's go.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.220
Sarah: Hi, everyone.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.440
Lee Ann: Hello.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.120
Sarah: Here we are in the photography study
center.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.060
You may remember the spot.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:18.760
Lee Ann: Yes.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.820
And I hope that you all enjoyed your short
tour of conservation, but I think now it's

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.590
time to get to some of your questions.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.880
Sarah: So we have a couple of questions that
you submitted in advance.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.720
We picked our favorites and we're going to
start with those, although our producer will

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.420
hand us questions that any of you submit now,
so keep them coming and we're going to try

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.440
to get to as many as we possibly can.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.240
Lee Ann: All right, well, enough for the introductions.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.060
Let's look at our first question.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:51.060
So, Tree Island Horror asks, what's the most
difficult photograph you've ever had to save

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.060
and why?

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.700
That's a good question.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:00.700
I think from my perspective, working in a
museum that has a lot of contemporary art,

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.580
we deal with really large photographs.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:08.910
And I think the most challenging work that
I've ever had to address was the deconstruction

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:13.340
and reconstruction of a Jeff Wall mammoth-scale lightbox, where we had to completely

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.840
take the entire thing apart and then put it
back together in time for the exhibition.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.280
I didn't do this alone.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:25.220
This was a team effort, we had two conservators,
we had artists assistants and art handlers,

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.140
but it was really tricky and very challenging.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:33.120
Sarah: I don't take photographs so I don't
have a favorite one that I've ever treated,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:38.760
but I did pick one that I love that Lee Ann
treated and that I thought she did such a

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.640
marvelous job.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.880
It would be fun to share.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:47.350
This is a work by Edward Weston of Tina Modotti
and we brought a before just to show you how

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:50.200
dramatic and marvelous what she did.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:57.020
This picture had what looked like almost white
worms crawling across Tina Modotti's neck.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:02.520
And it was essentially unexhibitable because
it looked like she had such a horrible disease,

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.800
which she didn't have.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.360
Lee Ann: So we have...

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.570
Sarah: The reveal.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.700
Lee Ann: The before treatment photograph because
we document everything we do

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.560
before and after treatment.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.960
So this... that was a xerox, this is the actual
photograph.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.130
And, I don't know, Sarah, actually do you
want to see if you can hold it up?

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.060
Sarah: Maybe I'll see if I can hold it.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:29.000
Lee Ann: If you notice those white marks,
I went in and I isolated the actual photograph

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.480
with a material that would protect the platinum
print, which is below.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.620
And then I went in and I did retouch and it
was pretty successful.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.960
I don't think that you can even see.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.460
Sarah: To put it mildly.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.080
Yeah, Lee Ann's very modest about her treatments.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.720
I really, I think they're amazing, but I, of
course, can barely color with a crayon.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.540
So that's...

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.120
Lee Ann: That's probably not true.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.920
But part of our training is we want all of
the work that we do to be reversible.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.660
We want it to meet the aesthetic needs and
we also want to try to stabilize the works

00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:59.700
whenever possible.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.840
So the Jeff Wall's a good example of stabilization
and that was a good cosmetic treatment.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.660
Sarah: We have some others too if you feel
like it.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:11.480
And Jimmy Ho had asked a question similar
to that, but then he asked another one that

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:14.060
we thought was worth talking about in the
beginning.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.820
What is the relationship between the curator
and the conservator?

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.060
He asked before organizing exhibitions and archives.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:26.560
We think also that it might be interesting
just to talk in general how we... what we collaborate on.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.160
Lee Ann: Yeah. No, totally.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.560
Well, really, you know, it starts... a lot
of it starts with curatorial because there

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.800
may be exhibitions, there may be projects
loans.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:42.580
So they will present the needs revolving around
the work and then we as conservators will

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.660
come in and say: "Okay, well, you know, there's
a group of photographs that needs to be treated

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.780
or these need to be cleaned or we want to
redo the framing for some kind of, you know,

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.160
stabilization issues."

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.400
So it's a lot of back and forth trying to
meet the needs.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.350
Sarah: And also to protect the work.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.400
So how long it's going to be on view for?

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.860
What are the... all those parameters.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:01.480
Lee Ann: Right.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.480
That's a whole thing.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.220
Sarah: Big debate.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.040
Lee Ann: Yeah, the mission statement of the museum is twofold.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:12.140
On the one hand, to make the collection as
accessible as possible but also to preserve

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.240
for as long as possible.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.210
So, we try to find that common ground.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.680
Sarah: And often if we try to limit the amount
of time something's on view, so we'll say,

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.280
"Okay, we'll rotate that out after a certain
period."

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.740
Sometimes we'll lower the light levels.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.860
But there was a question that just came in
that I want to address.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:27.560
Lee Ann: Oh, okay. Great.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.860
Sarah: Sneak it in the middle.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.340
Deborah Hahn on YouTube asked, "Why don't
you put gloves on?"

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.100
Which is a super excellent question that we
should settle from the start.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.100
Lee Ann: Excellent question.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:42.160
Sarah: So, you might notice that when we were
holding this, we were never actually touching

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.640
the print or the original mount.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.720
We have this tissue, and Lee Ann's position,
if I can...

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:49.730
Lee Ann: Yes.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:50.930
And though that's fine to share.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.680
Sarah: Is that we get a better grip if we're
moving things around, if our hands are clean

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.260
and we're not touching the original photograph
without gloves.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:58.900
However...

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:03.840
Lee Ann: We do have gloves on our hand at all times
and some materials do require the gloves.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.860
Also, I don't know if you noticed, but when
we were handling the print without the inner

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:13.320
leaving, we weren't touching the mount, we
were touching the support mount.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:20.740
And the reason we have the support mount,
so there's a photo, secondary and tertiary 
area.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:29.420
This is a mount that we at the museum provided
to give the work support so that we're never

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:33.000
torquing or handling the actual work too much.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.920
Sarah: But thank you.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.420
That's a really good question.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.660
And we're happy, even though we had

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.540
some favorite questions
we are going to... we thought we would answer first,

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.400
we'd certainly are happy to...

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.080
Lee Ann: Take them when they come.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.800
Sarah: Best practices.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.100
Okay.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.920
Western Gallery... Thanks for...

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:54.740
Asks: "What is the long term storage plan for
the photography department

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.220
and where will the collection be housed as it grows?"

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:04.140
And then Na Diagram also chimed down a similar
question: "Would love to see the various storage

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:11.520
techniques, boxes, sleeves, and how your collection
cares, differs for archives and museum objects."

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.440
So, the long term...

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:14.970
We'll leave that up.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:21.620
The long term plan is that we try to store
here on 53rd Street in our cold storage as

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.200
much as possible of the collection.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.000
It, as you can imagine is pretty full.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.880
And as the collection grows, we occasionally
have to transfer things to offsite storage.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.880
Most...

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:39.820
Lee Ann: Especially the large format material
which we collect very, very large scale things.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.960
And they have to be stored with the paintings
on screens.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.960
So we just don't have that capability here
at 53rd Street.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.800
Sarah: And, you know, in terms of the long
term, we have room for growth here.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.840
We have room for growth in our facility in
Queens where MoMa QNS used to be.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:01.950
But we have film storage in Hamlin, Pennsylvania
and we have... and we occasionally outsource

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:05.860
unusual things to other places as well, cars
and things like that.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:06.840
Lee Ann: Right, right.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.780
It's true.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.280
Sarah: But to see the various storage techniques.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.320
Lee Ann: Yeah.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.880
We have a few things here.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.420
Sarah: I brought a few examples.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.420
Do you want to maybe talk about this one first
and then I'll get a...

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.320
Lee Ann: Okay. Sure.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.540
So let's see what we have here.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.160
Okay.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:27.080
So this is a mounted photograph by Henri Cartier-Bresson

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.640
and you can see that I opened the mount and

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.380
I took the inner leaving out.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:38.400
This is a museum style window mat.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:45.640
It's very thick and it has a nice bevel that
protects the photograph itself from anything

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.160
coming on top of it when it's in a frame and
there's a nice sheet of glazing.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:59.800
Inside what we see is a variety of photo corners
which hold the print secure within the window mat.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:05.920
And again, like I said earlier, this is really
important because it supports the entire photograph

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:13.420
during handling and, because photographs are
laminate layers, any kind of cramping or bending

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.220
is going to break that laminate layer and
that's where you start to get damages and

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:22.220
the work starts to, you know, deteriorate in
ways that we would like to control.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:27.700
Sarah: Just one more thing to note about this
though is, the corners hold the mount tightly.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.520
The corners hold the mount.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.620
And in this, this is something that we recently
had out of its mount.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.980
And so you'll see the top two corners are
actually not slid in.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.530
So just usually, they'll have four corners.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:43.300
So it won't matter what the orientation is.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.100
Lee Ann: Exactly.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.540
And I think we're probably due to redo the
photo corners, which on this piece and we

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.740
do on a regular basis.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.660
Sarah: Sorry, one more thing to pause about
this photography because I have to brag a

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.950
little bit more about Lee Ann.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:53.950
She was too modest.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.510
She wasn't even going to say it, but I don't
know if you can notice.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.210
I don't know how close we can zoom in.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:03.020
But that bottom right corner, bottom left
corner...

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.260
Lee Ann: Bottom left and top.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:12.080
So, this work was included in a major retrospective
of Henri Cartier-Bresson and had come into

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.010
the museum missing these corners.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.010
We don't know why.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:16.680
Sarah: Triangles, just like straight off.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.550
Lee Ann: Just like uneven triangle, so we
never could figure it out.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:25.960
But we went ahead and I made an insert here,
which can easily be removed.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.290
And it would not disrupt the mount here.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.310
It does not touch the photograph.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.460
But for now it can be displayed in a more
holistic manner.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:40.860
Sarah: Right. It allows you to look at the photograph as
a rectangle without a real consciousness of

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:45.600
those two missing corners, which would be
distracting and not really let you look and

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.460
fall into the work, which is the goal.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:53.160
Lee Ann: Yeah, no, those are lots of issues
that we deal with for every single photograph.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.840
What's best for the work, how do we want it
to look?

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.370
Do we not want to do anything?

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:05.280
Sarah: So we keep a lot of photographs matted
like this in boxes, but we also... that's not

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.360
always practical.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.960
It's not always possible.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:12.180
So in the boxes sometimes also, actually we'll
talk about this one in a minute.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.980
We have prints that will just keep...

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.990
Oops, sorry.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.780
Lee Ann: Yeah, actually, these boxes are nicely designed.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.540
You can open them up and then you have another
surface that you can slide the works onto.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:29.200
So these are a wonderful set of RC gelatin,
silver photographs.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.580
Sarah: Donna-Lee Phillips is the artist.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.580
Sorry.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.640
Lee Ann: The conceptual work.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:40.080
And we just have them in mylar sleeves, again
with that rigid support and that helps us

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.080
handle safely.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.980
Do we want to take one of these out or...?

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:43.700
Sarah: Sure.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:44.420
Let's take one out.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:49.600
The other thing that we debate sometimes should
the sleeves one... have one side sealed,

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.940
two sides sealed, three sides sealed.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.100
We usually do three because it's the most
protective.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.680
But I've heard Lee Ann make an argument sometimes
for larger work...

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.520
Lee Ann: Sometimes if you want to just lift
the mylar off the surface.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:11.080
It's really about the small details to help,
you know, protect the work for whatever physical

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.240
issue it has.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.440
So this one, there we go.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.080
Sarah: I'll hold the plastic.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.500
Lee Ann: I want to actually lift that off
the surface.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.500
Yeah, there we go.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:29.960
So, right, removing the print from the sleeve,
trying not to touch the surface.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.490
And then, so here now I'm definitely going
to wear my gloves because I'm handling the

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.490
actual photograph.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:40.700
Sarah: And this is a photograph in which the
artist actually typed a caption onto the original print.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:45.720
So you can almost make out the remnants of
the type on the back.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:50.080
But it's a pretty amazing thing, but this
is a fairly simple thing.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:55.170
And there... this isn't appropriate for most
display, but it's a nice storage option.

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:57.540
Lee Ann: I think I can get that back in.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.000
So, there we go.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.740
Sarah: Okay.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.180
But actually I'm going to let you do that.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.220
And then we go to the next question.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.280
Okay.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.700
Next question.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:14.120
Elie Tals writes: "How is digital
photography preserved?"

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.210
Lee Ann: That is an excellent question.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:20.420
We all live with digital images.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.000
They are everywhere and ever present.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.585
And this institution has a very dynamic and
strong department in

00:22:29.585 --> 00:22:32.460
electronic media and performance.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:37.620
We also are really lucky we have an entire
department of in-conservation devoted to the

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.760
preservation of digital files and digital
media.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:47.280
And so, I will defer anybody who's interested
in that topic to those colleagues

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.140
and we can share some links.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.720
You know, to point you in the right direction.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.460
But we do have protocols and they're good.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:02.380
Sarah: Damian Van Camp asks: "Some photographs
can be interpreted not only as two dimensional images

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.760
but as sculptural objects as well.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:09.460
Is this something you take into consideration
when organizing the display of such photographs?

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:13.340
Do you believe there's a way to provide that
experience to a viewer without

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.320
potentially compromising the safety of the artifacts?

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:21.280
Have you ever considered an exhibit that explores
the physicality of a photograph?"

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.860
This is a great question and ties into what
we were just looking at in the lab

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.360
with the Otto Steinert mounted print

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.000
and really giving a sense of that physicality.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:37.740
And I would argue even in a more subtle way
with the Bill Brandt photograph of Henry Moore

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:42.160
which has its own dimentionality by the creases
and the additions on it.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.760
But I thought to answer the last part of it
about whether we ever had an exhibition that

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.700
talked about that physicality where that was
a central concern.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:56.940
I would say that the Thomas Walter Collection
Exhibition is one where we made a conscious

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:02.980
effort to display the photographs in a way
that highlighted their physical presence.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:04.680
Lee Ann: Exactly.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:10.200
And that exhibition was part of a four-year
research initiative to look at a group of

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:15.660
242 photographs where we really delved into
the physical aspects of the photograph and

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:21.040
brought together curators and conservators,
conservation scientists and art historians

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.160
to look at the material.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.720
And again, it was all about the physical aspect.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.520
Did you wanna take this out or just to show...This
is a great one.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.640
Sarah: This is a great one.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.600
You know, I'm a little obsessed with Dorothea
Lange at the moment, I confess.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.920
Lee Ann: I'll hold here while you talk.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.420
Sarah: Okay.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:40.720
In part because just this week, we finished
this book, Lange "Migrant Mother."

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:46.320
And while we were doing this, in part what
we were researching was that very question

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.660
of the physicality of the print.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:53.720
What print is this book about if it's one
on one, and what other prints do we have

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.120
in the museum collection?

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.630
So, this is one that was made for the New
York Times.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:00.920
And I don't know if you can see here.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.330
Lee Ann: Here, I'll point out some of the
areas.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:07.741
I don't know if you're... if the camera can
actually see this, but you'll see there are

00:25:07.741 --> 00:25:11.660
some glossy areas and there are some really
some very matte.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:12.960
Actually, you know what?

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:18.750
I have one of my...I don't know if you can
see better this way where there are glossy

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.140
and matte areas.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:25.460
The matte areas have been highly retouched,

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.480
and that's for reproduction and the publication.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.480
Sarah: Hold on.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:30.820
I don't know.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.720
I mean, is that clear?

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.260
I hope that's clear to all of you?

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:38.540
It's amazing the degree to which, just like
Bill Brandt did on his Henry Moore, but the

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:44.210
degree to which people at the New York Times
just went right in there to make this photograph

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.620
reproduced better in ink.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:50.420
And I think when you look at this compared...

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.120
Lee Ann: Versus the...

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.940
Sarah: Let's take out this.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.840
With this, it's pretty dramatic how the...

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.830
Lee Ann: It's completely different.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:02.940
I mean, it really changed.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.000
The background is dark and here it's light.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.500
Sarah: And again, to speak to the materiality,
I'm going to lift...

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.630
This is called a sink mount.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:14.860
And the sink mount is something that allows
you... it makes a really deep window.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:20.340
So that again, the physicality, the dimensionality
of the print can be expressed.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.160
Historically, we would kind of suppress that.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:28.840
I would say we would mat it as if it weren't
this thick, well, not historically.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.440
I would say in recent decades we would have
done that.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.480
Historically, this would have just been like
this on the wall with no mat at all.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:40.100
But more and more, I think the Walter Project
and all those were interested in how they are physically.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.060
Lee Ann: Exactly.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.980
How... what is the history of the print, especially
of the exhibition of the print.

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:53.740
So this sink mat, which goes over, helps protect
the edges of this print so that when you put

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:58.560
the over mat over, everything is completely
even and you don't have those exposed edges.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.559
Sarah: All right. You want to take another question?

00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:01.559
Lee Ann: Sure.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.300
Sarah: I'll put some things away.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.000
Lee Ann: Okay.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.180
Well, let's see.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:13.220
Adam Addendum Redundant asks: "Can you restore
photographs like one would do with paintings

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.820
or is it mostly about conserving and archiving?"

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:24.960
In this institution, we definitely do conservation
interventions if you will, similar to what

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:29.380
you, what we showed at the beginning with
the Tina Modotti portrait and I did the cosmetic

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:33.900
reintegration of those bad stains that were
on the neck.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:38.880
We do focus on more just re-housing issues.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.760
It really depends on the collection.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:46.880
We'll work with the library and the archives
and we'll help them organize and house their material.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:51.440
But yeah, sometimes we spend a lot of time
working just on one the way you would in paintings

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.780
conservation where you would remove a varnish
or you might do some in-painting.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.620
The procedures are different, but the approach
can be similar.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:04.800
Sarah: This was another one that we're slipping
in because Julie Weber asked on YouTube live,

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.740
something that we think would be worthwhile
clarifying.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:13.960
She asked, "In the intro, it was mentioned
that some photographs are too precious to

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:17.240
exhibit," and I want to drill into what the
precious is there.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:22.200
But anyway, "How do you reconcile having such
photos in the collection and can they be shared

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.600
with the public in other ways?"

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.180
So...

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:24.740
Lee Ann: Great question.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:25.500
Sarah: Fantastic question.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.240
And I'm sorry we were a little bit rushed
in the lab because we wanted to get up here

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:33.350
and start with the Q&amp;A, but I'm glad we're
bringing this back up.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:39.350
I think by too precious, partly what you mean
is too fugitive, meaning that by exposing

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:45.480
it to light you can be damaging it and that
can be part of what's not treating a photograph

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:49.840
as responsibly as we intend to do.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:56.920
We, for instance, for that auto chrome, because
it is... that is actually a recent acquisition.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:05.220
It was a gift of Richard and Barbara Benson,
but we did exhibit when that work was first

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:12.220
brought to the museum, we exhibited a facsimile
of it, clearly marking that it was a facsimile,

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:16.820
which means essentially a copy that to the
naked eye seems the same.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.880
And we put that facsimile on view.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:25.750
So it's important for history and for scholars
to be able to have the real thing in the collection.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:31.780
But it's equally important that for something
that very, very fragile, precious fugitive print

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:36.480
if we put that on view in a regular
exhibition, it would deteriorate to the point

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.760
where it would be... it wouldn't look like
what it is.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.060
And so our responsibility is to find the right
balance.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.340
Lee Ann: Right. Exactly.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.360
Sarah: And so when you asked how they can
be shared with the public, one is by making

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.520
a facsimile and clearly labeling it as such.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:55.351
Another is through that book is reproduced
in a... that photograph is reproduced

00:29:55.351 --> 00:29:58.780
in a book that Richard Benson wrote called
"The Printed Picture."

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.150
So, putting our collection online is
another way.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:05.790
So we look for lots of ways to activate the
collection.

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:12.380
Lee Ann: And also, your department is very
active in bringing school groups at all different

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:18.460
levels through to give tours, small tours,
individual ones, and also encouraging scholarships.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:22.960
So, people can come and make an appointment
and actually see the photograph in a very

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.400
limited and controlled environment.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.340
So, there's the more public views and then
there's sort of a more one on one.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:36.140
Sarah: So anyway, we really... We
recently acquired a very precious

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:41.320
19th century photograph by Hippolyte Bayard, that will
be on view this fall.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:46.920
And we're really exploring different ways
of allowing... of how do we limit the light

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.280
but still share it and still preserve it.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.380
And finding the right balance between all
those things is important.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:57.440
But certainly, sharing it with the public
is a big part of that.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.680
All right.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.060
Oh, speaking which.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:04.460
Cora Johnston asked, "What is the oldest photograph
in your collection?"

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:07.700
And Felix Oncken wrote basically the same
thing.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.350
"What is the oldest photograph from MoMA's
collection?"

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:15.740
Lee Ann: Well, there are Henry Fox Talbot
prints in the collection and I think the Lace

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.799
Photogram 1842, that's probably it.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:26.740
Sarah: So early 1840s, we're not interested
in collecting, you know... The Henry Ransom

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:32.040
Humanities Research Center in Austin, they
have Niépce's original view.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.940
You know, one of the earliest photographic
processes.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:42.140
For us, it's about what are the earliest photographs
that speak to the ideas of modern art

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.760
that are then carried through in the collection.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:52.020
So, having an older photograph that we perhaps
couldn't exhibit at all or something that's

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:57.460
important just because it was the first is
less important to us than having a work like

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:05.040
Talbot's The Open Door, which is an incredibly
important work that speaks to practices of

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.540
allegory that come forward later.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.560
Lee Ann: Exactly.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.520
Come up again and again and again.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:18.180
Ronald Lusk asks: "What advice do you have
for a current fine art photographers for making

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:21.750
preservation easier for future curators and
conservators?"

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:23.049
Well, I can say...

00:32:23.049 --> 00:32:24.660
Sarah: Thank you for asking.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:31.920
Lee Ann: Well, I can say right off the bat
that, you definitely want to document everything you do.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.800
You want to know... you want to make a note
of what the papers were, how it was processed.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:42.961
You want to give some indication of, you know,
the size of your collection, I guess, or how

00:32:42.961 --> 00:32:45.440
it might be important in the body of work.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.140
But it's really the documentation of the physical
part that's going to help us down the line

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.220
understand the work.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:57.340
And so, so many photographs had been created
that are amazing, but we don't understand

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.460
the physical aspect.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.299
And so, preservation can be a little bit more
challenging in those cases.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:06.120
Sarah: And for some works that incorporate
an aspect of deterioration into that work.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.500
When is that deterioration welcome?

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:09.510
When is it too much?

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:13.340
So, I think those are some of the parameters
that Lee Ann was asking about.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:19.990
But there are... we love having dialog with
artists when they're saying: "I'm thinking

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:21.280
of mounting my print.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.880
This is a look that I aspire to have for my
work.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:29.580
What kinds of materials would you recommend
that we use to mount my print to?"

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:30.540
Lee Ann: Yeah.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.680
And in those situations...

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.500
Sarah: Sorry.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.220
We don't want to dictate to an artist how
their work should look, but if they ask us

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:38.160
a question, we're certainly happy.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:42.750
Lee Ann: And we've done a lot of research,
and we have a lot of experience on, you know,

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:46.419
the history of photography and different,
you know, mounting systems, pros and cons.

00:33:46.419 --> 00:33:48.620
And we want to be able to share that information.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.260
At the end of the day, the artist will have
to make a decision based on

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.340
what they to convey.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:59.360
But, yeah, there are many different ways that
works can be mounted and framed and presented

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.110
and those materials are changing all the time.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.020
New things come on the market.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.200
So, we try to...

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.120
Sarah: Protection is generally welcome.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.520
Information and protection.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.720
Lee Ann: Definitely.

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:21.420
Corporal Cheddar, Pasquale V, Anna Maria Med and Adelaide, they ask,

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:23.980
"What is the process for getting into conservation?

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:28.480
What advice would you have for young artists
looking into joining the field?"

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.520
Okay.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.580
So, conservation really... just a little preamble.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.300
Conservation brings in three different disciplines.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:41.800
It brings in studio art, art history and science.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:52.080
So, now our field has graduate programs that
help students master the areas of those three

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:57.170
separate disciplines to become a conservator.

00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:04.200
The ways in which somebody might investigate
conservation, there are actually some websites

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.300
which maybe I'll mention in a moment, but...

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:10.160
Sarah: Maybe we can ask the producer to put
them up on the...

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.320
Lee Ann: Yeah.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:18.580
Because, there is one group, the Emerging
Conservators Group, which is part of the

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.840
American Institute for Conservation.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:27.020
And they have put together an incredible 10
tips for people who are interested in conservation.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:31.880
And so if you Google that or you go onto the
AIC website, you can go and read a little

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.340
bit more about some of those tips of getting
into conservation.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.630
But I'll mention just a few, which I think
are really good.

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:43.820
Number one, you should find a conservator
and go visit them in their lab.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:49.330
There's nothing like being there as you saw
earlier today, you know, what is the environment like

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:51.760
what kinds of projects are they working
on?

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.180
Join the professional organizations.

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.140
And I think that we gave a list of the producers.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.800
I'll rattle a few off.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:04.859
There's the American Institute for Conservation,
there's the International Institute for Conservation,

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:11.300
ICOMCC, which is the International Council
of Museums Conservation Committee.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:18.800
Those professional organizations have all
kinds of different activities and online resources

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:25.360
that you can investigate, and becoming a member
is a way of first demonstrating your interest,

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.000
but also finding out about what does this
field really about.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.760
So, find a conservator, visit a lab, join
a professional organization, take advantage

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:40.560
of the online resources, not just for the
organizations, but the graduate programs in

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:46.680
North America have very detailed information
about requirements to get into conservation.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:51.120
And that's another way that you can find out
and maybe meet some people.

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:56.190
There are other things that you should explore,
but that might kick off some of the exploration

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:58.460
that I'm sure you'll want to take on.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.120
Sarah: Yes.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.420
So, I don't know how to say this, so I'm going
to spell it.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:12.450
This is from "hvssvn" and asked: "Do you
use scanners or digital cameras to capture

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:17.120
these physical photos to archive digitally
and why?"

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.340
The answer is, well, this is sort of simple.

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.860
Yes, we use both, well, rarely scanners...

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:23.800
Lee Ann: Not the scanner.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:30.540
Sarah: Not a scanner so much, but a digital
camera is used at all stages of the... of our

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:36.320
process, from even before acquisition, identifying
it as something that we are thinking about,

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.360
talking about it with our peers.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:43.820
Then when we acquire it, we make a high resolution
scan to put on the website, when we try for

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:50.000
that scan to be color corrected and balanced
and everything that we could use it in a publication.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.020
And then the other thing for conservation.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:56.680
Lee Ann: Right. So, in conservation, we document all

00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:00.210
the work that we do, all the conservation 
treatments that we carry out on work.

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:05.250
We document before, during and after the conservation
treatment.

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:08.280
And we use very high resolution digital imaging
for that.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.619
And we have our archiving protocols.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.120
So, there's a lot of imaging that happens. For sure.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.060
Sarah: Images of images.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:19.860
So this is a question from Dmace3...

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.640
Dmace13, sorry.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:26.020
And Chez Foxy Jam, sounds familiar.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:32.800
"What advice would you give to smaller collections
who want to provide better conservation techniques

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:37.440
to photo archives that are restricted by budgets
and/or lack of resources?"

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.220
To which was added by Chez Foxy Jam.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:44.460
"What basic strategies would you recommend
to organizations or brands who are developing

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:49.380
their own research collections in-house but
who do not have dedicated archivists and or

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.280
conservationists on staff?"

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.860
And I have to say this could be my favorite
question of the day because the truth is,

00:38:55.860 --> 00:39:00.420
all of us can do things to protect the photographs
in our lives and the photographs

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.100
for which we're responsible.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:06.960
And half of what, Lee Ann, well, maybe not
half, but a significant chunk of what Lee Ann

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:14.380
has taught me is that basic conservation
principles of keeping light levels low, handling

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:22.100
things carefully, keeping environment's stable,
those things are really good for all collections,

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.920
from MoMA's collection to mine at home.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.980
And I think that, I mean, I'd love from you
to elaborate.

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:28.980
Lee Ann: Yeah, for sure.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:31.700
Sarah: But I think the idea of information
we can share is great.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:32.340
Lee Ann: Yeah.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:37.920
And we want to share and some of those resources
that I mentioned just a moment ago, we'll

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:42.460
also give some of this information and point
you in the right direction.

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:49.050
But so much of conservation and preservation
is common sense, in the sense that as Sarah

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:55.460
was saying, you want to organize your collection,
make sure you know what you have in your collection.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:56.720
You want to house it properly.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:00.760
It doesn't have to be housed in beautiful
eight ply mounts, but it could be housed...

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.330
Sarah: Yeah, I mean, I remember what Lee Ann
said, we could have prints that were just

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:10.100
on a board, an archival board, not an acidic
board, just in a polyethylene, which is for

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.200
normal people, plastic...

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.600
Lee Ann: But it's a nonreactive.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.600
Sarah: Fine.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.090
Lee Ann: Yeah, no, there are definitely differences
in...

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:20.810
Sarah: But a polyethylene bag and a board.

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:26.440
Those are really inexpensive materials and
they provide an extraordinary amount of protection

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.380
and stability.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:28.280
Lee Ann: Exactly.

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:28.940
Yes.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:35.520
Sarah: And, sorry, just to add onto this question,
Nik Yazikov from YouTube live, just related

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:41.380
to this road: "What are the best ways to avoid
large prints deteriorating or getting damaged

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:46.400
while on display if you cannot afford expensive
framing or mounting?"

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.120
Lee Ann: It's a really good question.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:53.860
It's a little tricky because, again, this
is a common sense situation.

00:40:53.860 --> 00:41:00.760
If you have a large print and you are displaying
it on the wall, and there's nobody around,

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.940
meaning, you know, it's in your private residence,
probably you're not going to have the same

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:08.480
problems that you would have in a major institution
because of the traffic.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.860
And again, that's a common sense.

00:41:09.869 --> 00:41:15.119
Sarah: So keep children, pets away from it,
don't talk in front of works of art.

00:41:15.119 --> 00:41:18.390
You know, the reason we don't have a lot of
photographs sitting in front of us right now

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:22.820
is that Lee Ann taught me when I'm speaking
about a photograph, I should always have my

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:26.240
hand or something in front of my mouth, so
that we... You spit on them and you damage them.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.760
Lee Ann: It's part of the way we talk.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.360
And so you definitely have to be mindful.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.740
But yes, the larger the print, the more problems
are going to be and the bigger the problems

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.880
they can be.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:44.420
The framing and mounting... look around, shop
around and see if you can find a mounter or

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.360
a framer who is willing to work with you to
achieve your goal.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:52.640
And it's just a matter of doing research and
trying to get...

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.980
Sarah: But if you can't frame or mount it,
try to put it in a place where the conditions

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:01.540
are reasonably stable, where there's no direct
sunlight and where there aren't a lot of people

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:02.580
elbowing around.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:08.320
So like a hallway is great in some ways because
it's dark, but it's narrow so people are

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.020
more likely to brush against it.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.720
So using that common sense, I would say goes
a long way.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.140
Lee Ann: Yeah, definitely.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.060
Framing does protect the work.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:21.460
So, there's no way around that part.

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:22.880
Sarah: We do like framing.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.240
Oh, all right.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.300
This is one for you.

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:30.780
Lee Ann: So Andrea Elkind, Tairo and
Pamela Knohr ask: "What are best practices

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:33.300
for conserving photos in a humid city?"

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.220
All right.

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:41.180
So, another really good question, light, temperature,
and humidity.

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:46.620
Those are the three culprits that photographs
are susceptible to.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.130
And humidity is one of the worst.

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:52.980
So, while we are concerned about temperature
and we want to keep the temperature in a reasonable

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:58.140
range and we want to keep the light levels
at a reasonable level, humidity is really

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:03.320
going to do it in for your photographs because,
actually, there's two reasons.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.880
You have a lot of organic materials in photographs
of gelatin silver prints.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:13.620
You've got, you know, albumen prints and those
are made up of largely organic materials,

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:15.720
so they're susceptible to mold.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.520
Also, insect damage can be a problem too.

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:25.200
But on the other hand, you also have the image
making material which can also be susceptible

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.450
to high levels of humidity.

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:31.740
So all of our color photographs are made from
dyes similar to the dyes in our clothing.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:37.540
And as you know, the dyes will fade in light,
they can also fade in, you know

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.000
continual washings.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.960
Sarah: But is there's anything people can
do...

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.060
Lee Ann: Well, I wanted to go...

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:42.800
Yeah, hang on, hang on.

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.560
Sarah: Sorry.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:52.580
Lee Ann: So the best practices would be knowing
that, keep your collection in boxes with buffering

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:59.040
material like matte boards and blotter materials
or high quality papers that will help to absorb

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.760
some of that excess moisture.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.730
Try to keep away from windows.

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:08.280
And also the other thing, if you keep your
collection in an environment that's somewhat

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:12.180
stable, meaning it doesn't fluctuate, you
know, from really hot temperatures and humidity

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:16.320
down to very low, keep it where you like to
be.

00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:19.690
Where we are comfortable is where the photographs
are going to be comfortable.

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:21.440
Sarah: So an attic for instance...

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:25.180
Lee Ann: Is not a good place or the basement
is not a good place, but your closet, which

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:27.380
is dark, that's probably a good place.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:28.740
Sarah: All right.

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:33.080
Lee Ann: Should I, let's see if this is for
you or for me.

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:40.920
Ianthe Papadima says: "Where
does MoMA's vernacular photography come from?

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.000
Family albums, flea markets, etc.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.520
And do you try to identify old photographs?

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.580
And if so, how?"

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:48.880
And I think that that's for her.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.780
Sarah: Okay.

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:57.180
So, when she asks about vernacular photography,
what she means for those of you who don't

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:02.960
know that word is, photographs that weren't
originally intended to be works of art and

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:08.900
that can... the umbrella that that encompasses
can include anything from a photograph that

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:13.600
was made for a newspaper like that print of
''Migrant Mother" that we were looking at

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:18.120
to a snapshot that you might find in a family
album.

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.640
We do have examples of that in the collection.

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:25.513
They're really some of my favorite works,
but they...

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:29.320
We acquire them from a whole range of places.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:37.880
Typically we're not scouting through flea
markets, eBay, things like that.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:43.599
We are very fortunate that we have some collect–
There are really, really fantastic collectors

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.640
out there of vernacular material.

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:52.680
Some of them have a business of it, some of
them are just really, really good passionate

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:56.620
collectors and very generous ones who share
with us when they get something that they

00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:01.380
think is really special, that ought to be
in the museum's collection.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:04.760
So, we get it from a wide variety of places.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.440
And do we try to identify unknown works?

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.580
Always.

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:14.680
You know, the reason I've, in general, moved
away from the idea of anonymous photograph

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:17.520
to photographer unknown is that the...

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.520
Lee Ann: It's in the cataloging.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:19.980
Sarah: In the cataloging of it.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:23.780
To say anonymous implies that the photographer
doesn't want to be known.

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:29.300
Whereas to say, photographer unknown really
suggests closely the reality, which is

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.500
that we just don't know.

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.320
But that doesn't mean we don't want to try.

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:39.180
And we have all kinds of ways of trying material
evidence that we develop and look at

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:45.080
with conservation to, the internet can be very
helpful with that.

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:50.060
Really scrutinizing the picture on the front
and the back looking for marks or any clues.

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:55.270
Lee Ann: And this goes back to the question
that we had earlier about how, you know, what

00:46:55.270 --> 00:47:00.360
should fine art photographers be doing, you
know, for their work... for the future curators

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.180
and conservators.

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:06.720
And labeling and identification, it cannot
be underestimated.

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.700
Sarah: Yeah.

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:12.900
That would be a gift, we don't count on it,
but it would be a gift.

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.580
Lee Ann: Okay.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:17.560
Sarah: Okay.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:18.860
Barking.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:22.980
This is a question from barkinghere.

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:30.750
"What's considered the most valuable photograph
or photographs in MoMA's collection and why?"

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:35.520
And I'm sure our general council is like,
don't talk about value.

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:41.900
But I think, you know, how much you pay for
a photograph is one expression of

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.460
a photograph's value.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:49.460
But partly what I love about what we do here
and the kinds of things we take care of is

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:54.120
that sometimes the value can be a teaching
value.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:59.400
Sometimes the value can be simply the joy
that it brings to stand in front of it.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:03.180
And those kinds of things are a lot harder
to put a number on.

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.100
Lee Ann: Even something, yeah.

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:08.640
For example, some of the vernacular photographs
you were just mentioning, some of those are

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.840
amazing and they're wonderful and you would
never want to... Um thank you.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.920
My microphone.

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.000
Sarah: Your microphone.

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:15.620
Lee Ann: Yeah.

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.940
And so the monetary value is not the issue
there.

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:19.960
It's not the...

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:25.040
Sarah: But I would say Grosso Modo, works
where you've read that there have been scandals

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.320
about fakes.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.180
That might be one way.

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:32.580
Nobody bothers to make a fake of something
that isn't really...

00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:33.840
Doesn't have a high market value.

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.640
Lee Ann: That's true.

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:42.160
Sarah: And unique works, works that when,
you know, anything where we send it out on loan

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:48.840
where we know that it would be impossible
to get another replacement print.

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:53.420
We put a number on it, but the truth is the
number should be priceless because there's no...

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:58.900
We have so many treasures in the collection
where they simply couldn't be replaced.

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:04.400
And so, that's where, when Lee Ann says keep
those light levels low, we say, okay.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.480
Lee Ann: Yeah.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:06.500
Okay.

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:09.100
All right.

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:14.340
So, this could be for both of us.

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:20.960
apokalipsischilango asks: "Is there a specific
photograph that you're really fond of?

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.300
How, when, where was it taken?"

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:26.540
And seascrafty says: "Which is your favorite
photo?"

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:29.510
So, I mean, I will say, I mean, every day...

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:31.970
Sarah: I make a habit of not answering this
question.

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:35.040
Lee Ann: I know, well, there's 30,000 photographs
and they're all amazing.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:38.400
They're all just, you know, magic because
photography is magic.

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.780
And this changes for me, you know, which
might be a favorite.

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:49.880
But I have to say I'm very fond of work that
Alexander Rodchenko made in 1935 or so

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:51.480
was called The Dive.

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:58.880
And he took it in a very young Soviet Russia
and it's a portrait of a man diving off of

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.080
a diving board and he's doing a cannon ball.

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.120
And it's just a really amazing print.

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:03.940
Sarah: But be honest.

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.540
What's part of what you like about that picture?

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:06.720
Because I happen to know.

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:10.540
Lee Ann: Well, because I spent so much time
with it and the research.

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.120
When the paper...

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:13.520
So the paper was made...

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.500
Sarah: I'm gonna keep her honest.

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.200
Lee Ann: Yes, okay.

00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:23.440
I love that work because it's such a symbol
of the time in which it was made and everything

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:29.440
about it, the materiality and the image speaks
to the hardships that were happening in

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.740
Soviet Russia at that time.

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:33.130
Sarah: So will you describe...

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:38.240
Sometimes you hold a piece of paper and it stays flat.

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.500
Lee Ann: Good rigidity.

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:40.500
Sarah: Rigidity.

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:45.160
Lee Ann: But this photograph, the paper is
very fluid and very, you know, it doesn't

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.260
have a lot of integral strength.

00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:52.880
And that's just because of the paper making
at the time hadn't developed.

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:58.660
And so it's just such a... It's so evocative
of that moment and that's why I love that print.

00:50:58.660 --> 00:50:59.780
What about you?

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:03.300
There's got to be one that speaks to you in
some way.

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:04.700
Sarah: Really, no.

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:08.560
But I'll say often it's related to what you're
working on.

00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:09.920
Lee Ann: Yeah, that's true.

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:13.589
Sarah: So if would have asked me six months
ago I would've said Lange's Migrant Mother

00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:15.550
because that was all I could think about.

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:17.800
You know, I would lie in bed at night and
dream about it.

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:23.520
Most recently I finished a project about an
album of photographs made by Frances Benjamin

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.880
Johnston, and it's called The Hampton Album.

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:30.840
And a handful of them are going to go on view
in two weeks in an exhibition called

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:37.260
Lincoln Kirstein's Modern, because Lincoln Kirstein
gave the album to MoMA in 1965.

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:45.460
And we are just printing now for the first
time, a near facsimile of the original album.

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:49.220
So everyone can hold it and enjoy it.

00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:50.420
Lee Ann: They're exquisite.

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:57.349
Sarah: They are magnificent platinum prints
made between 1899 and 1900 and the album is

00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:59.810
just unbelievable and I'm so honored.

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:04.980
Latoya Ruby Frazier wrote a text that's in
the book along with the text that I wrote

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:09.640
and it's just... it's a marvelous album.

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:13.900
And even though prints from that album are
in the Library of Congress and at Hampton

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:20.820
University and in the Harvard Art museums,
what we have is in fact the most complete

00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:22.510
and it's just extraordinary.

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:25.050
Lee Ann: Yeah, it's a truly unique and amazing
object.

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:28.960
Sarah: And in terms of what we do together,
there's a note on the prints in

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.420
the back of the book.

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:37.339
And I had described the paper one way, I think
I had said a low quality paper.

00:52:37.339 --> 00:52:41.460
And Lee Ann and the whole conservation team
came up here and they're like, "Let's talk

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:44.880
about the language that you use to describe
this paper."

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:50.720
And we settled on, well, I'd said inferior
quality.

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:55.041
And we settled on average quality because
it's not that it was inferior, but we have

00:52:55.041 --> 00:53:00.980
wonderful discussions about what does it mean
to describe something as low quality, if that's

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:06.620
not really getting at the, you know, there's
a practicality to it and I think we can

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:08.000
find the right balance to that.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.680
Lee Ann: To communicate, you know, to people
who don't have an opportunity

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.740
to spend so much time with this work.

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:18.620
What sentence, what description is going to
convey that information the best?

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:19.460
Sarah: That was fun.

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:20.220
Lee Ann: Yeah, it was good.

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:24.020
Sarah: Anyway, so I'll call that my favorite
for now.

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:27.859
Oh, this is for you.

00:53:27.859 --> 00:53:30.150
Lee Ann: Kevinplam.

00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:33.800
"What emerging archive technologies are you
excited for?"

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:36.100
Emerging archive technologies?

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:44.820
Well, it's not that this is difficult to answer,
but archiving technology.

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:51.730
So if we're talking about housing the collection,
we're always looking for better materials

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:57.720
that we can, you know, store with the mat
and the sleeves and the inner leaving papers.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:02.120
We're always looking for better ways to store
things in terms of

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.820
the furniture and a better shelving system.

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:09.220
Sarah: Sorry, one little example of this is the... Do you
remember the year that we came up with the

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:11.800
openable photo corners? This was good.

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:19.500
Lee Ann: So this was a system that we designed here
in house with one of our extremely talented colleagues.

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:24.720
So these are photo corners that can be opened
and then closed.

00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:29.720
So, and the photo corner stays intact and
can be reused.

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:32.990
And that's good for conservation of labor
and also of material.

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:37.170
So we don't have to redo every single time
like that Tina Modotti, we have to redo those

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:40.000
photo corners, but we will redo them to look
like this.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.620
Sarah: The Cartier-Bresson.

00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:43.260
Lee Ann: Yes, you're right.

00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:44.270
Cartier-Bresson.

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:45.270
So...

00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:48.329
Sarah: So that's sort of a new approach to
something.

00:54:48.329 --> 00:54:49.329
Lee Ann: Exactly.

00:54:49.329 --> 00:54:50.780
Sarah: It's kind of old fashioned.

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:53.770
But it was new system for us.

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:54.770
But I think...

00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:56.380
Lee Ann: It's a refinement of a system.

00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:01.470
And that's again, about this detail of, you
know, focusing on what ways can we better

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:04.440
serve the collection and care for the collection.

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:07.720
So from an archive point of view, that's how
I would answer that question.

00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:12.040
From the question is though, here is archive
technologies.

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:18.500
Archive technologies, I mean, that to me
infers data management or imaging system.

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:24.300
So, I mean, we just look forward to easier
ones to use to make their job easier...

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:27.600
Sarah: We have a lot more colleagues around
the institution who say: "Hey, there's this

00:55:27.609 --> 00:55:30.099
great new technology."

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:32.040
And they teach us how to use it.

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:36.360
Lee Ann: Yeah, it's not going to get used if it's not intuitive.

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:39.560
I don't want to say easy, but if it's not
an intuitive system, it's not going to be

00:55:39.569 --> 00:55:40.569
as successful.

00:55:40.569 --> 00:55:42.160
So that's what we look forward to.

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.980
Sarah: This is a good question.

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:49.400
So cietisoonguyen... Sorry for butchering the
name.

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:52.140
Asks: "What is the best way to mount

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:54.040
a printed photograph?"

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:59.060
And prewarfathead asks: "Dry mounting used
to be a thing.

00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:00.300
Now, not so much.

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:03.100
Is it bad if you get a dry mounted photo?

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:05.100
Do you try to separate it from the mount?"

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:06.950
Maybe we'll start at the end in that.

00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:11.500
Lee Ann: So the dry mounting tissues, although
I think that you still can get them and it

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:15.869
still is done professionally and then also
amateurs can do this on their own.

00:56:15.869 --> 00:56:16.920
Sarah: I used to do it.

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.050
Lee Ann: Yeah, dry mount tissue is not the
worst thing.

00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:24.700
We have noticed that that tissue can actually
act as a barrier, a buffer between the photograph

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:26.800
and the mount that it's adhered to.

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:30.560
So it's not necessarily a bad thing.

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:35.069
And oftentimes we see all kinds of dry mounted
photographs and we don't take them off unless

00:56:35.069 --> 00:56:38.750
there's really some sign that it is a problem
with the work.

00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:44.040
And we rarely see it because those systems
have been highly refined over the years by

00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.040
the photo industry.

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:48.620
Sarah: But if you were to say today, what
would be the best way to mount a photograph?

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:51.840
Lee Ann: So, well, it depends on what you want to do.

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:56.700
The most important thing is that your photograph
has a rigid support so that you can handle

00:56:56.700 --> 00:57:00.400
it and for, you know, framing it up.

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:05.730
After that you can do photo corners, you can
do hinges, you can do an overall mounting.

00:57:05.730 --> 00:57:09.580
It really depends on the look that you are
after as a photographer.

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:16.240
Sarah: And I would say, well, I think here
our principle is as reversible as possible.

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:22.500
So we will... our preference would be photo
corners internally at a certain scale.

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:28.340
That's not really practical, but we really,
we don't have the technology to mount prints

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.830
above a certain scale.

00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:34.030
And that's often something that we hope and
have a dialogue with living artists about

00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:38.740
to say maybe let's talk about how we would
recommend you mount this through

00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:42.440
an outside lab and then we'll acquire it once it's mounted.

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:48.580
Because there are risks also associated in
mounting processes and then once it's mounted

00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:51.040
if there are no borders, the edges are fragile, so...

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.560
Lee Ann: That's why frames actually really
do help.

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:57.520
Even though there is a minimal aesthetic with
not showing something that's framed and we

00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:01.240
understand that and always respect the artist's,
you know, intent for that.

00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.640
Something to be aware of.

00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:10.780
Sarah: memona_madi asks: "What would be the
best way to share that 30,000 items collection

00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:13.360
beyond the museum's physical space?

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:18.640
How could you create new cultural opportunities
to your audience online?"

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:23.340
And whoa, if we don't spend an enormous amount
of time thinking about this.

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:32.500
I would say in some ways, this represents
what we expect the future of the museum to be.

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:39.240
Meaning, we want to encourage people to come
here to look at the original objects to experience them.

00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:45.620
And we are developing a system for rotating
our gallery displays so that more and more

00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:49.480
of the collection can be on view more regularly.

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:54.280
But the truth is there are many people for
whom it's not practical or possible for them

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:58.060
to come to the museum really, maybe not more
than once in their life.

00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:04.040
And so the online course, Seeing Through Photographs,
that we did and the other online courses that

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:09.260
the museum offers, that's one way to provide
access into the collection.

00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:14.339
The museum's website, we spend an enormous
amount of time and effort getting good images

00:59:14.339 --> 00:59:20.250
and providing cataloging information and other
supplemental information so that even though

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:24.640
not everything is on the website yet, you
can use that as a tool to begin browsing through

00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.000
the collection.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:33.520
Lee Ann: Recently the museum has scanned and
posted online, all of the exhibition views.

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:37.720
Which I think is an amazing resource to see
how it works were shown.

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:41.860
Sarah: So you can go through, browse through
the exhibition history and then even through

00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:43.140
that link to object.

00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:48.030
So we're constantly working with our teams
inside and outside the museum.

00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:50.790
And if you have ideas, let us know.

00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:55.960
We can't say that we think we've figured it
all out, but we do spend a lot of time thinking

00:59:55.960 --> 01:00:01.609
about that and the Seeing Through Photographs
learners are really all over the world.

01:00:01.609 --> 01:00:03.600
So, I can't believe it.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.890
Lee Ann: Oh, no.

01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:07.150
Sarah: But it's time to wrap up.

01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:08.150
I've just informed.

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:09.150
Lee Ann: Okay.

01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:10.150
All right.

01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:11.900
Sarah: So, this is exciting.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:17.720
There are people who tuned into this live
stream from California,

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.360
Athens, Greece,

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.240
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:21.960
Lee Ann: Sao Paolo.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.640
Sarah: Sao Paulo yay! Florida.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.440
Sorry, I'm working on a Brazilian project.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.080
Florida,

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.120
Montreal.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:29.940
Lee Ann: Paris.

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:30.980
Sarah: Paris. That's nice.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:35.280
Italy, South Africa, Russia and Tennessee.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.080
So, thank you all.

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.740
That is really an extraordinary audience.

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:41.620
Lee Ann: No, that is super exciting.

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:45.060
Sarah: We appreciate all of your thoughtful questions
and comments.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:50.840
Lee Ann: So, if you've enjoyed this, please
check out...

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:56.180
There are other playlists on conservation
and photography, other ways to...

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:58.800
Check out some of the subjects that we've
been talking about.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:03.369
Sarah: And that Seeing Through Photographs
course that I just mentioned a minute ago,

01:01:03.369 --> 01:01:08.910
there's a link I think in the description
below and it's a free online course.

01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:15.250
We really, anyway, we welcome people to learn
through that about photographs.

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:17.250
And if we... Oh, this is the most important.

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:22.830
If we didn't get to your question and you
left them on Instagram or YouTube, we will

01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:26.970
do everything we can to try to pay attention
to those questions in the coming days.

01:01:26.970 --> 01:01:28.970
Lee Ann: Yeah. It would be good to come back to some.

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:31.850
Sarah: But if you think... you're lying in
bed at night and you think, oh, I really wanted

01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:36.400
to ask something, go ahead and add it and
we'll do our best to tend to it.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.610
So, we appreciate everyone tuning in.

01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:40.970
Lee Ann: Yes, thank you for tuning in and sending your questions.

01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:43.730
And I think there's a subscribe button down
there.

01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:48.930
So please hit the subscribe button and you'll,
you know, keep informed in all the different

01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:51.570
programs that are coming through the YouTube
channel.

01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:53.140
Sarah: So, bye for now. Thank you.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:54.560
Lee Ann: Okay, bye bye.
