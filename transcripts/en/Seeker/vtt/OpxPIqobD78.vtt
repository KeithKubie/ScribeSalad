00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.649
Astronomers are always looking for the “most
distant” galaxies, the “most energetic”

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.050
stellar explosions and the “most massive”
stars.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.350
But what about the biggest cosmic walls?

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.629
Hello!

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:17.590
I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer for Discovery
News, and I want you to imagine the biggest

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.160
collection of galaxies possible.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.720
Now double it.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.990
No, triple it.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.990
Can you see it?

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.070
Yep, that’s a galactic wall.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.820
Well, OK, these aren’t walls of bricks and
mortar; they’re walls of galaxies cemented

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.920
together by dark matter.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.100
They are the biggest structures in the universe
that we know of.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.100
And.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.100
They.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.100
Are.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.100
HUGE.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.100
But what are they exactly?

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.870
Well, nearly 14 billion years ago, our universe
exploded from a single point, spewing matter

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.579
and energy to form the rapidly expanding universe
we know and love.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.260
All the matter in the universe splattered
and condensed into long web-like filaments

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.140
of dark matter, along which galaxies gravitationally
attached themselves.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.510
As the universe cooled and matured, a 3-dimensional
web of galaxies formed -- composed of both

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.520
these long filaments and vast bubble-like
voids.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.000
Along these filaments, dense superclusters
of galaxies settled -- this is what we call

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
“galactic walls.”

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.200
And perhaps the most famous galactic wall
is the Sloan Great Wall that was discovered

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.430
by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey -- or SDSS
-- in 2003.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.240
It’s basically a huge collection of galaxies
about 1 billion light-years from Earth, spanning

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.760
over 1.4 billion light-years across (it therefore
takes light 1.4 billion years to travel from

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.590
one end to the other).

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.850
Though impressive, the Sloan Great Wall is
no longer the biggest, but it remains the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.150
most famous.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.150
Since 2003, bigger galaxy walls have been
detected, but this year, the biggest wall

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.550
of all has been claimed.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.790
When studying a collection of distant galaxies
between 4.5 and 6.4 billion light-years away,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.000
astronomers realized that over 800 of them
occupy the same cosmic filament, a volume

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.369
ten times that of the Sloan Great Wall.

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.880
They called it the BOSS Great Wall -- after
the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.180
a project also run by the SDSS.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.909
BOSS is designed to study the distribution
of galaxies throughout the cosmos, in an effort

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.620
to understand how fast the universe is expanding
and how galaxies move in relation to one another.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.630
Though impressive, these Great Walls may not
actually be the greatest of them all.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.560
For starters, records are made to be broken,
and bigger walls could be discovered in the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.500
future as surveys get more and more sensitive.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.210
Also, there’s a large swathe of sky BEHIND
our galaxy called the “Zone of Avoidance”

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.530
that astronomers cannot see -- it’s a region
of sky the Milky Way’s core and disk is

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.530
blocking from view.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.940
So there could be the mother of all walls
that we’ll never observe.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.410
So why do we care about these huge walls of
galaxies besides the fact we love big things

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.360
in space and we love breaking records?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.390
Well, according to the “cosmological principle,”
all matter in the universe, when viewed on

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.760
a large enough scale, should appear more or
less uniform and the largest structures shouldn’t

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.500
exceed 1.2 billion light-years across.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.239
This is based on a mathematical theory put
forth by none other than Isaac Newton.

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.761
A possible galactic wall measuring over 1.2
billion light years across could mean that

00:02:50.761 --> 00:02:53.990
our understanding of the universe is incomplete
or incorrect.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.239
And there are clues that there are even bigger
structures out there.

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.510
Speaking of huge cosmic structures, there’s
a mysterious cold spot imprinted in the cosmic

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:25.780
microwave background, watch my recent DNews
video about what this discovery could mean:

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.170
So what do you think is going on?

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.690
Is our understanding of the universe flawed?
