00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.669
What’s the point of putting lipstick on
a guinea pig?

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.110
Other than making the guinea pig look fabulous,
obviously.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.790
Hello there lovely people, Amy here on DNews.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.800
I wear cosmetic products, obviously, and probably
do, too, even if you don’t think you do.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.359
That’s because along with makeup, moisturizers,
and nail polish, the US Food and Drug Administration’s

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.020
(FDA) definition of cosmetics includes things
like shampoo, deodorant, and toothpaste.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.630
Unless those cosmetics also treat something
like dandruff or cavities, provide sun protection,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.120
or have a color additive, the FDA has no authority
to regulate them and it’s up to the cosmetic

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.080
company to make sure they’re safe before
they hit the market.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.399
There are a lot of factors to consider when
testing a cosmetic.

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.970
Manufacturers need to know if products will
cause an allergic reaction; if they’ll cause

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.289
temporary or irreversible skin or eye damage;
at what point they’re toxic if absorbed

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.750
through the skin, lungs, or digestive tract;
the effects of long-term exposure; if they’re

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.129
carcinogenic; if they cause infertility; or
if they cause birth defects.

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.010
Pretty much all the things you need to worry
about if you’re a teenage boy who overuses

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.339
body spray.

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.189
But cosmetic companies can’t jump straight
to testing on teenage boys because they’d

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.530
probably get a call from their irate mothers.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.530
No.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.110
Companies don’t test on people because it’s
inhumane and if something goes wrong, it might

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.599
irreparably harm a human being.

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:21.459
Before a human uses a product, we have to
be sure they’re reasonably safe, so for

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:25.709
a long time animals were used to test the
chemicals in cosmetics first.

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:29.189
Usually the tests involve mice, rats, guinea
pigs or bunnies.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.859
Understandably, many people consider these
tests inhumane, and some places like Europe

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.099
have banned products that have been tested
on animals entirely.

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:40.400
Other places like China actually require animal
testing on the finished products.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.289
The FDA’s stance falls somewhere in the
middle: companies are neither encouraged or

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.329
discouraged to test on animals, though the
FDA has stated they would like to gain the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.200
maximum amount of information using the fewest
animals as humanely as possible.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.130
Depending on what they’re testing for, scientists
might use just one bunny or as many as 2600

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.229
mice.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.569
Cosmetic makers would probably rather not
test on animals if they could avoid it.

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.590
It’s expensive and a PR nightmare.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.640
Plus using an animal for testing a chemical’s
effects on people can be imprecise because,

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.500
well, they’re not people.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.980
But scientists are developing methods that
substitute animals for test tubes.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.719
The Johns Hopkins Center for Alternatives
to Animal Testing, appropriately acronymed

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.829
to CAAT, is foremost in in vitro testing.

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.720
But some things, like how a product behaves
when inhaled, still can’t be replicated

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.760
artificially.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.170
Other proposed methods involve using mathematical
models to extrapolate how thousands of different

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.610
chemicals will behave after testing just a
tiny fraction.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.730
Either way, learning more about what we put
on and in our bodies is always a valuable

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.579
pursuit, otherwise we could end up like the
Romans, who unknowingly poisoned themselves

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.189
with white lead used for makeup foundation.

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.440
All for the sake of beauty.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.540
Ultimately, moving away from animal testing
will require some innovative changes, as do

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.540
most

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.019
Tech innovations are constantly changing our
lives – both professionally and personally.

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.689
If you are fascinated with the latest in tech
innovations and how they are impacting the

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.450
world around you, check out Full Sail University.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.050

programs that help you build a skill set for

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.230
the tech industry.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.920

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.459
A lot of research depends on using animals,
particularly lab mice.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.620
But why mice?

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:26.940
Trace explains here.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.579
Though cosmetic testing on animals gets more
attention, most animal testing is done for

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.879
pharmaceutical or biomedical research.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.620
Is using animals ok for one and not the other?
