00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.680
Now you can see how we apply these rules of inferences on sentences in

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.060
a knowledge base or philosophical agent to prove all kinds of sentences. See,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.250
imagine that an AI agent begins with the knowledge that if an animal has

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.880
feathers, it implies that the animal is a bird. Now it comes across Harry,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.890
who does have feathers. By Modus Ponens,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.500
therefore the AI agent can conclude that Harry is a bird.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.780
This completes the proof for our original goal of proving that Harry is a bird.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.400
Now let us suppose that a goal is to prove that Buzz does not have feathers.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.980
Once again, imagine an AI agent which begins with the knowledge that if

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.000
an animal has feathers, it implies that the animal has, is a bird.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.530
The agent comes across a animal, which is not a bird. Then by Modus Tollens

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.920
it can infer that buzz must not have feathers. This completes the proof for

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.110
of a original goal of proving that buzz does not have feathers. Okay. So

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.600
now, we have looked at two ways of proving the truth value of various sentences.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.650
The first way was just through truth tables. I could have sentences and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.740
logic. Then I could write another sentence. And ask myself, what,

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.481
what is the truth value of this sentence? I could construct a truth table for

00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:18.743
that sentence, composed of the truth values of all the predicates,

00:01:18.743 --> 00:01:22.760
with some of which might be coming from earlier sentences. The second way in

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.314
which we have seen how we can prove the truth values of sentences and

00:01:26.314 --> 00:01:29.510
logic is by applying these rules of inferences like modus ponens and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.190
modus tollens. This is very powerful, and in fact the power of this logic has

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.875
been known since before the birth of AI. As computer scientists however,

00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:42.958
we'll analyze this power in a slightly different way. Yes, we can use method of

00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:47.960
truth tables to construct a truth table for any arbitrary sentence. However,

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.640
the sentence was complicated. Then the truth table very soon will become very

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.570
complex. Computationally, that is infeasible for very long,

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.570
large sentences. Similarly, yes we can apply simply modus ponens and

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.920
modus tollens to find the truth value of many sentences. But if the knowledge

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.560
base consisted of a very large number of sentences, instead of just one or

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.410
two sentences, then the kinds of inferences, number of inferences I

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.140
can draw from those sentences simply by applying modus ponens and modus tollens,

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.010
will be very large. Or if I had to find the truth value of a single sentence,

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.790
then the different pathways I could take in order to get to the truth value of

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.170
those sentences can make for long, large problem space. So while these

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.840
methods of proving the truth with your sentences and logic have been around for

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.480
a long time. These methods are not computationally feasible. At least not for

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.470
complex tasks. At least not for agents that have only limited computational

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.900
resources and from who we want near realtime performance
