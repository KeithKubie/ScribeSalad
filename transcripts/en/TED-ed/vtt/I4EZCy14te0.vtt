00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:08.480
Twenty thousand years ago,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.305
the Earth was a frigid landscape where 
woolly mammoths roamed.

00:00:12.305 --> 00:00:15.065
Huge ice sheets, 
several thousand meters thick,

00:00:15.065 --> 00:00:18.304
encased parts of North America, 
Asia, and Europe.

00:00:18.304 --> 00:00:21.598
We commonly know it as the "Ice Age."

00:00:21.598 --> 00:00:24.980
But geologists call it 
the Last Glacial Maximum.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.137
That’s because it’s the most recent
time that ice reached such a huge extent,

00:00:29.137 --> 00:00:34.699
and “ice age” is an informal term 
without a single agreed-upon definition.

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:36.374
Over the last million years,

00:00:36.374 --> 00:00:39.654
there have actually been 
about 10 different glacial maxima.

00:00:39.654 --> 00:00:42.733
Throughout Earth’s history, 
climate has varied greatly.

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.463
For hundreds of millions of years,

00:00:44.463 --> 00:00:46.694
the planet had no polar ice caps.

00:00:46.694 --> 00:00:50.134
Without this ice, 
the sea level was 70 meters higher.

00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:53.714
At the other extreme, 
about 700 million years ago,

00:00:53.714 --> 00:00:56.693
Earth became almost 
entirely covered in ice

00:00:56.693 --> 00:00:59.844
during an event known 
as “Snowball Earth.”

00:00:59.844 --> 00:01:03.604
So what causes these massive swings 
in the planet’s climate?

00:01:03.604 --> 00:01:07.673
One of the main drivers 
is atmospheric carbon dioxide,

00:01:07.673 --> 00:01:09.593
a greenhouse gas that traps heat.

00:01:09.593 --> 00:01:12.304
Natural processes, such as volcanism,

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:14.142
chemical weathering of rocks,

00:01:14.142 --> 00:01:16.334
and the burial of organic matter,

00:01:16.334 --> 00:01:21.534
can cause huge changes in carbon dioxide 
when they continue for millions of years.

00:01:21.534 --> 00:01:25.783
Over the past million years, 
carbon dioxide has been relatively low,

00:01:25.783 --> 00:01:27.775
and repeated glacial maxima

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:31.304
have been caused by cycles 
in Earth’s movement around the sun.

00:01:31.304 --> 00:01:32.574
As Earth rotates,

00:01:32.574 --> 00:01:35.743
it wobbles on its axis 
and its tilt changes,

00:01:35.743 --> 00:01:39.693
altering the amount of sunlight that 
strikes different parts of its surface.

00:01:39.693 --> 00:01:42.541
These wobbles, combined 
with the planet’s elliptical orbit,

00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:44.435
cause summer temperatures to vary

00:01:44.435 --> 00:01:47.804
depending on whether the summer solstice 
happens when Earth is closer

00:01:47.804 --> 00:01:49.643
or farther from the sun.

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:52.094
Approximately every 100,000 years,

00:01:52.094 --> 00:01:57.142
these factors align to create dramatically
colder conditions that last for millennia.

00:01:57.142 --> 00:02:00.636
Cool summers that aren’t warm enough 
to melt the preceding winter’s snow

00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:03.844
allow ice to accumulate year after year.

00:02:03.844 --> 00:02:06.214
These ice sheets produce 
additional cooling

00:02:06.214 --> 00:02:09.663
by reflecting more solar energy 
back into space.

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:13.144
Simultaneously, cooler conditions 
transfer carbon dioxide

00:02:13.144 --> 00:02:15.425
from the atmosphere into the ocean,

00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:18.574
causing even more cooling 
and glacier expansion.

00:02:18.574 --> 00:02:20.584
About 20,000 years ago,

00:02:20.584 --> 00:02:25.314
these trends reversed when changes 
in Earth’s orbit increased summer sunshine

00:02:25.314 --> 00:02:28.774
over the giant ice sheets, 
and they began to melt.

00:02:28.774 --> 00:02:31.413
The sea level rose 130 meters

00:02:31.413 --> 00:02:35.904
and carbon dioxide was released 
from the ocean back into the atmosphere.

00:02:35.904 --> 00:02:38.443
By analyzing pollen and marine fossils,

00:02:38.443 --> 00:02:42.505
geologists can tell that temperatures 
peaked about 6,000 years ago,

00:02:42.505 --> 00:02:46.314
before another shift in Earth’s orbit
caused renewed cooling.

00:02:46.314 --> 00:02:48.074
So what’s coming next?

00:02:48.074 --> 00:02:51.203
Based on the repeated natural cycle seen 
in the climate record,

00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:54.984
we’d normally expect the Earth 
to continue a trend of gradual cooling

00:02:54.984 --> 00:02:57.225
for the next few thousand years.

00:02:57.225 --> 00:03:01.106
However, this cooling abruptly 
reversed about 150 years ago.

00:03:01.106 --> 00:03:02.516
Why?

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:06.851
Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere 
have been rising since the 19th century,

00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:09.083
when fossil fuel use increased.

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:12.509
We know that from studying air bubbles 
trapped in Antarctic ice.

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:15.663
This surge in carbon dioxide 
also coincides

00:03:15.663 --> 00:03:20.155
with a global temperature increase 
of nearly one degree Celsius.

00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:22.615
Ice cores 
and atmospheric monitoring stations

00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:25.844
show us that carbon dioxide levels 
are rising faster,

00:03:25.844 --> 00:03:27.584
and to higher levels,

00:03:27.584 --> 00:03:30.493
than at any point 
in the last 800,000 years.

00:03:30.493 --> 00:03:35.843
Computer models forecast another one to
four degrees Celsius of warming by 2100,

00:03:35.843 --> 00:03:39.155
depending on how much 
additional fossil fuel we burn.

00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:43.185
What does that mean for the ice currently 
on Greenland and Antarctica?

00:03:43.185 --> 00:03:46.932
Past climate changes suggest that even 
a small warming shift

00:03:46.932 --> 00:03:51.130
can begin a process of ice melt 
that continues for thousands of years.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.804
By the end of this century,

00:03:52.804 --> 00:03:57.375
ice melt is expected to raise 
the sea level by 30 to 100 centimeters,

00:03:57.375 --> 00:04:01.354
enough to impact many coastal cities 
and island nations.

00:04:01.354 --> 00:04:04.950
If a four-degree Celsius warming persisted
for several millennia,

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.622
the sea level could rise 
by as much as 10 meters.

00:04:08.622 --> 00:04:10.404
By studying past climates,

00:04:10.404 --> 00:04:13.324
scientists learn more about what drives 
the shifts in ice

00:04:13.324 --> 00:04:15.784
that have shaped our planet 
for millions of years.

00:04:15.784 --> 00:04:18.384
Research suggests that 
by taking action now

00:04:18.384 --> 00:04:20.875
to reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions quickly,

00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:25.175
we still have the opportunity to curb 
ice loss and save our coastal communities.
