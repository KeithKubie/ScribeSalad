00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.900
Born in Paterson, New Jersey in 1910 to Gustav
and Otillia Haast, Bill Haast was interested

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.540
in snakes since he was 7 years old.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.010
This interest turned into something of an
obsession during summer trips to Boy Scout

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.390
camp, beginning when he was 11.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.930
The next year Bill suffered his first snake
bite from a timber rattlesnake he tried to

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.930
catch.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.950
At the time, Bill was four miles from the
camp’s first aid station, so he applied

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.140
the standard field dressing of the day (making
crossed cuts over the fang marks and applying

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.719
potassium permanganate) and walked back to
camp.

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.589
Although his arm had swollen pretty well before
getting back to camp, he ultimately recovered

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.609
with no long term ill effects.

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.559
When he returned to camp the following year,
he suffered another bite from yet another

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.230
snake he was trying to catch, this time a
large copperhead.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.109
Having learned his lesson from the previous
year, he was equipped with a snakebite kit

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.899
and was immediately injected with anti-venom.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.870
Despite the early treatment, he was hospitalized
for a week after this bite.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.500
young-billNot satisfied with snakes in the
wild, Bill began collecting them via mail

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.020
order catalogs as well.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.430
When he brought his first one home, he later
stated his terrified mother refused to be

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.400
near it and fled the apartment for three days,
initially refusing to come back until he got

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.400
rid of the snakes.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.020
Soon, however, she agreed he could keep, and
even grow, his little collection of snakes.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.500
Restless and confident, Bill spent his final
year in high school sneaking out of the building

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.590
the second his mom was out of sight after
dropping him off.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.899
He’d then simply wander around all day.

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.950
By age 16 in the late 1920s, he gave up the
ruse and joined a roadside snake show, hoping

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.259
to make his way to Florida after reading in
a catalog that the diamondback rattle snake

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.689
he purchased was shipped out of Florida.

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.701
After the traveling snake show shut down due
to the effects of the Great Depression, he

00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:56.329
eventually did indeed make his way to the
Florida Everglades, where he supported himself

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.700
by rooming with and helping a bootlegger.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.219
While this gave him ample time and opportunity
to catch and study various snakes, ultimately

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.750
the bootlegging entrepreneur was arrested.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.320
At this point, Bill had a dream- to start
a snake farm.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.790
Unfortunately for him, that required money.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.680
So he decided to go back to school where he
studied to become an airplane mechanic.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.610
Upon graduation, he was hired by Pan Am as
a flight engineer and traveled the world,

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.620
allowing him to collect even more exotic snakes.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.450
He generally brought his snakes back via safely
storing them away in his toolbox.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.209
He stated of this, “In those days there
were no laws prohibiting it, but the crew

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.640
members didn’t appreciate it.”

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.370
Besides collecting often deadly snakes from
around the world and bringing them on planes

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.250
back home, Bill also spent his time as a flight
engineer saving up money to build a large

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.280
snake farm.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.360
By 1946, he was able to purchase a plot of
land in south Miami, sold his house, and began

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.659
building his Serpentarium.

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.530
Unfortunately for him, his wife, Ann, didn’t
exactly appreciate his obsession with snakes

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.909
nor the new direction her husband was taking
with his life, and she soon divorced him.

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.239
Undeterred, one year later Bill opened the
Serpentarium with a skeleton staff of himself,

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.720
his new wife, Clarita, who was much more supportive
of his little snake enterprise, and his son,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.730
Bill Jr., who, after being bitten four times
by the snakes, left the snake farm to seek

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.730
safer work.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.250
milking-snake2Over the next 20 years, Bill
amassed an impressive array of venomous snakes

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.310
from around the world, at any given time having
in excess of 500 snakes on his little farm.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.500
You might think such an endeavor wouldn’t
be very profitable, but Bill found ways to

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.890
make quite a bit of money off his snake farm.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.340
He generated income in two ways.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.140
First, he “milked” venom from his 60 species
of snakes in front of a paying audience every

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.140
day.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.700
This not only generated revenue from ticket
sales, but also from the sale of the raw material

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.560
needed to produce anti-venom- a gram of which
would net as much as $5,000 in some cases,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.780
taking 100 or so milkings to produce one gram.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.610
Being something of a dangerous profession
with accidental bites not uncommon, Bill also

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.319
decided to try to use the mithridatism approach
to protecting himself against the snakes-

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.610
namely, injecting himself with gradually increasing
doses of venom from different snakes he milked

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.060
regularly, including the Cape, King and Indian
cobras.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.360
injecting-snake-venomThis worked.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.060
In the 1950s, although he was bitten by cobras
approximately 20 times, he had few ill-effects

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.019
and didn’t need any anti-venom.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.170
Eventually, his immunity to many snake bites
had grown so strong that he often donated

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:32.270
blood to treat snakebite victims when anti-venom
for a particular type of venom was not otherwise

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.440
available.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.660
According to the New York Times, over 20 people
who likely would have died without the antibodies

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.830
in his blood were saved because of his donations,
including in one instance where Bill flew

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.770
all the way to Venezuela to donate a pint
of his blood to be used for a boy who’d

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.770
been bitten.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.449
For this act, the Venezuelan government made
Bill an honorary citizen of the country.

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.150
(Normally snake anti-venom is made via injecting
diluted venom into certain mammals and then

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.560
collecting the resulting antibodies from the
animal’s blood.)

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.690
charming-snakeWhile the farm was very profitable
for Bill, a non-snake-related tragedy led

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.160
to the closing of the Serpentarium.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.530
You see, in addition to snakes, Bill also
kept alligators and crocodiles in a pit on

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.610
the premises.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.870
In the late 1970s, a six-year-old boy fell
into the pit.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.930
Seeing a tasty snack, one of the crocodiles
lunged for the boy before a random bystander,

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.780
Nicolas Caulineau and the boy’s father,
could get to him.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.530
The two men did eventually manage to get on
top of the near one ton crocodile and attempted

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.860
to free the boy, but it was too late.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.280
While today Bill would have been sued into
oblivion for this, the boy’s parents did

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.750
not blame Bill for the accident.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.330
Nevertheless, he never forgave himself and
not long after closed the snake farm… but

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.110
not before firing nine rounds from his Luger
pistol into the crocodile in question, ultimately

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.510
resulting in it dying about an hour after
being shot.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.630
Years earlier, Bill developed a keen interest
in the medicinal uses of snake venom when

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.699
he and a University of Miami researcher experimented
with its utility in treating polio, with encouraging

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.760
results, before Dr. Jonas Salk came up with
an effective and safe vaccine against the

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.760
disease.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.729
Now without his snake farm to run, Bill decided
to devote his time to once again exploring

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.050
various snake venoms’ medicinal properties
with medical professionals.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.789
This culminated in Bill and a Miami doctor
treating over 6,000 patients suffering from

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.660
multiple sclerosis and arthritis with a certain
blend of snake venom.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.720
While some of their research and results were
promising, in 1980, the FDA shut the pair

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.919
down, claiming that Bill’s manufacturing
process on the venom used for injections was

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:32.400
not rigorous enough.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.610
Undeterred, in 1990 Bill persisted with his
research at the Miami Serpentarium Laboratories

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.610
he established.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.520
Bill also continued to inject himself with
a variety of venoms, which ultimately came

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.789
from 32 different snake species.

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:48.050
Although he had long thought that his daily
venom regimen contributed to his good health,

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.440
a sample size of one certainly isn’t good
enough to give definitive credit to anything.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.910
When he reached 100 years old, he was asked
about this, stating, “Aging is hard.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.759
Sometimes, you feel useless.

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:00.539
But I always felt I would live this long.

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:01.539
It was intuitive.

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:06.129
I always told people I’d live past 100,
and I still feel I will.

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:07.610
Is it the venom?

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.610
I don’t know.”

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.660
Bill Haast died of natural causes some six
months after turning 100, on June 15, 2011.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:20.000
In his lifetime, he stated he had been bitten
by snakes approximately 173 times, 20 of which

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.340
were nearly fatal.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.699
Among the more notable of these strikes, he
had a rather nasty incident with an eastern

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:30.430
diamondback rattlesnake that left one of his
hands looking a bit like a claw.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.650
In another significant strike, a Malayan pit
viper managed to cause significant damage

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.810
to his index finger.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.569
In yet another instance, a cottonmouth snake
sank its fangs into one of his fingers, resulting

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:43.009
in the finger turning black almost instantly.

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:47.490
Concerned, he called his wife over and had
her lop off the blackened bit of his fingertip

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.160
with garden clippers before the venom could
spread.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.729
In an incident in 1989, a particularly nasty
strike from a Pakistani pit viper nearly killed

00:07:55.729 --> 00:07:59.710
him, but according to The Associated Press,
someone in the White House managed to use

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:04.530
one of their contacts in Iran to get rare
vials of the anti-venom from that country

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.500
to Bill, who ultimately recovered.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:13.330
Despite his love for snakes, he did note that
they don’t make the best pets, “You could

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:18.950
have a snake for 30 years and the second you
leave his cage door cracked, he’s gone.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.910
And they’ll never come to you unless you’re
holding a mouse in your teeth.”

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:26.540
When asked about his thoughts on life, having
lived to over 100, he stated, “The art of

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.060
living is not an instinct; it must be learned.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.750
Isn’t it a pity that it takes all of it
before we know how to use that which we no

00:08:33.750 --> 00:09:10.450
longer have?”
