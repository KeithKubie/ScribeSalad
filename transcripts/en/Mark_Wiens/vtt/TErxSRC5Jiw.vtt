00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.650
- Hey everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.950
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Bangkok, Thailand

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.547
and I think Bangkok is
one of the best cities

00:00:04.547 --> 00:00:07.250
outside of Japan for Japanese food.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.160
And so today for lunch,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.850
I was invited to a restaurant called Umi,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.110
which is one of the best Omakase
Japanese sushi restaurants

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.610
known for very seasonal
fish and ingredients.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.470
Today they got a big chunk of fish,

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.897
a special chunk of fish which
comes from a giant maguro,

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:24.200
so that's the special event.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.593
The restaurant is at Gaysorn Plaza.

00:00:25.593 --> 00:00:26.800
I just got here.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.762
I'm very excited for
sushi today for lunch.

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:32.929
(smooth techno music)

00:00:44.014 --> 00:00:45.499
You ready to eat some sushi, Ying?

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:47.190
- Yes! (laughs)

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.654
- We just arrived to Gaysorn Plaza.

00:00:49.654 --> 00:00:52.390
(smooth techno music)

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.490
Ying, What floor are we on?

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.090
- The first floor.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.160
- Okay, oh yeah, first floor.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.940
It was kinda tricky to find it.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.475
First floor, Gaysorn Plaza,

00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:03.430
and then you come all the
way to the back corner

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.160
and it's kind of just
like a little hidden door,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.853
but very beautiful Japanese...

00:01:07.853 --> 00:01:09.830
And yeah, just kinda hidden back here.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.490
So this is the spot, it's called Umi.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.323
We are just in time for lunch.

00:01:12.323 --> 00:01:15.363
(soft upbeat music)

00:01:15.363 --> 00:01:18.060
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.940
The fish just came in today

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.440
and it's gonna be a lot of tuna today

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.865
and they were just explaining
to me about the whole tuna.

00:01:23.865 --> 00:01:27.190
How the tuna is caught, it
comes directly from Japan

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.395
from a very well-known supplier.

00:01:29.395 --> 00:01:32.562
(smooth upbeat music)

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.280
Okay, first opening
course, little fish on top,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.733
and then there's a vegetable
on the bottom there.

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:52.960
Mm, and it tastes like
vinegar, slightly sour,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.360
and with that very crunchy
fish, that's awesome.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.225
Oh this one is the skipjack tuna?

00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:04.260
Skipjack tuna, which is
just slightly marinated,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.730
beautiful and even the spring onion

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.793
and the ginger is from Japan, beautiful.

00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:19.690
Yeah, and just that tiny
little dab of green onion,

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.260
but it comes, you taste it so vibrantly,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.353
and that fish just, it's so smooth.

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:29.340
Okay, next is Kawahagi,
this is leather fish.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.230
And you can just see
how fine the detail is.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.810
There's just a tiny, tiny...

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.350
These are Japanese spring onions on top

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.380
with maybe some sesame seeds

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.093
and then there's like a little
jelly on the bottom as well.

00:02:43.708 --> 00:02:45.423
All the sesame seeds

00:02:45.423 --> 00:02:48.640
and then like wrapped
up in this jelly sauce.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.080
Mm, the sesame seeds and spring onions

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.928
really come in nicely.

00:02:51.928 --> 00:02:54.290
- [Man] Cheek bone of the
fish, cheek meat and the tuna.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.413
- [Mark] Oh wow, and it's cured?

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:01.567
- Um yes, we age them
actually, we aged them

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:05.260
for about six days.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.570
- [Mark] Wow, that one is
beautiful, the marbling.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.580
It's an aged blue fin tuna,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.203
and just beautiful fatty marbling.

00:03:13.047 --> 00:03:16.214
(slow relaxing music)

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.993
That's amazing.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.029
Is that a radish sauce on top?

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:29.593
Yeah, just this light
radish relish almost.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.946
It's so fatty and juicy.

00:03:34.946 --> 00:03:37.946
(soft upbeat music)

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.914
This one is abalone?

00:03:40.914 --> 00:03:41.747
- [Man] Yeah.

00:03:41.747 --> 00:03:42.960
- Abalone with, what type of sauce is it?

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.510
- [Man] Just the liver sauce. (coughs)

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.410
- Oh that's the liver sauce?

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.130
The abalone with liver sauce.
- Right.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.830
- Okay, awesome.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.230
Abalone in it's own liver sauce.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.560
The liver almost looks like mustard.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.433
Like it's got that slight
yellowy color to it.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.233
- [Man] That sauce, that sauce.

00:04:02.631 --> 00:04:04.236
Sauce okay.

00:04:04.236 --> 00:04:05.813
- That's awesome.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.760
That liver sauce really rich
and almost kinda sticky.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.760
And then with that abalone
is sweet and almost spongy.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.860
You wanna wipe up all of that liver sauce.

00:04:19.343 --> 00:04:20.431
(speaking in Thai)

00:04:20.431 --> 00:04:23.681
(Ying laughing loudly)

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.700
We all wanted a little bit of rice

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.773
to finish off all that liver sauce.

00:04:34.763 --> 00:04:37.763
(slow upbeat music)

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.677
Stunning.

00:04:42.677 --> 00:04:45.677
(slow upbeat music)

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.200
- [Man] Komakata, it's a monkfish liver.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.400
- [Mark] Monkfish liver.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.030
Oh it's seasonal, okay.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.220
How is it?

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.735
- You need to try it by yourself.

00:04:57.735 --> 00:04:59.107
(everyone laughing)

00:04:59.107 --> 00:05:00.976
It's the best thing.

00:05:00.976 --> 00:05:03.080
- [Mark] Is this a winter fish?

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.777
- Right, just winter.

00:05:04.777 --> 00:05:07.846
- [Mark] And they all tried
it, they said it's amazing.

00:05:07.846 --> 00:05:12.173
Yeah, it looks beautiful with
a little dab of wasabi on top.

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.280
(slow upbeat music)

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.803
Wow, yeah. (speaking Thai)

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.690
It's so creamy.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.152
Is that like a little bit of yuzu?

00:05:27.152 --> 00:05:27.985
- [Man] Yeah.

00:05:27.985 --> 00:05:28.818
- Or the citrus?

00:05:28.818 --> 00:05:30.630
Slightly taste the yuzu in the wasabi.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.023
Wonderfully creamy and custardy.

00:05:34.442 --> 00:05:37.980
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.970
Okay, next dish that we're having

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.780
is called Shirako, which is cod sperm.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.860
And I remember the first
time I tried this in Japan

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.930
I actually didn't know,
didn't know I was trying it

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.040
until I posted it and then
somebody mentioned that,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.690
but it's really good.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.050
Again, this you can smell the...

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.457
You can see the little fish on top.

00:05:57.457 --> 00:06:02.283
And yeah, it's a popular winter dish item.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.114
At first you think it's
really creamy, really rich,

00:06:07.114 --> 00:06:09.410
but then it sort of like
dissolves in your mouth.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.410
It's awesomely good.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.780
How big was that fish?

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.850
- This one is about 180 kg.
- [Mark] 180 kg?

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.983
- This one is from Big Maya,

00:06:22.113 --> 00:06:26.820
it's like the area between
Hokkaido and the Mainland.

00:06:27.698 --> 00:06:30.283
- [Man] This is the meat.
- [Mark] Ah, okay.

00:06:30.283 --> 00:06:31.537
- [Man] So basically
we gotta try this one.

00:06:31.537 --> 00:06:34.593
We gotta try the one with
the age for like seven days.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.620
- [Mark] Oh, that's the...

00:06:40.736 --> 00:06:43.903
(bouncy techno music)

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.000
Just unwrapped the chunk of tuna.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.440
That is beautiful, you
can just see the layers

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.720
and the different grids and the belly part

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.410
have it goes from dark to lighter color.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.170
But what's awesome is that
it's just us eating here today.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.210
So we can film and make a video.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.650
And yeah, just have fun as you're eating.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.763
But, okay now we're getting
to the serious tuna.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.606
What is that part?

00:07:14.606 --> 00:07:16.420
- [Chef] It's the black part.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.459
- [Mark] Oh, thank you!

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:19.800
- [Man] You need to understand,
this part right here.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.810
- [Mark] 3D, wow.

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:24.280
- [Man] Whoa (grunts).

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.760
- [Mark] That's the chunk comes
from that front belly part.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.350
- [Man] So basically this is...

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.377
What ever is here, it's right at the bone.

00:07:33.377 --> 00:07:35.080
So the black, you take it out.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.110
- [Mark] So that's from that section.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.955
This section right here.

00:07:38.955 --> 00:07:39.788
- [Man] Yeah, this section is this.

00:07:39.788 --> 00:07:40.670
- [Mark] You see the chunks of fish

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.550
but you're not sure exactly
where they come from.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.930
So that's awesome that
we have a 3D Tuna Model.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.760
And so the second that
he's cutting up right now

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.580
which is, that's where you get

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.710
a lot of the main pieces

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.010
comes from the front belly bottom section.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.383
Very cool!

00:08:02.944 --> 00:08:05.527
(upbeat music)

00:08:13.012 --> 00:08:13.853
- [Mark] So that one is the Akami?

00:08:13.853 --> 00:08:15.055
- [Man] Yeah.

00:08:15.055 --> 00:08:18.555
- [Mark] And then chutoro?
- [Man] Chutoro.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.870
This part is between chutoro and otoro?

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.660
- [Mark] That fish looks
beautiful, and this is Umi.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:31.170
They're explaining me all
they use is wild caught tuna.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.483
It's all wild tuna, it's all
local Japanese tuna as well.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:39.070
Had a sushi omakase before

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.180
where it's the course, piece by piece,

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.880
but never one with this amount

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.580
and variety of part of tuna.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.260
So this is a really special experience.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.600
Again, slicing up a different tuna,

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.860
and it comes from two different fish,

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.950
so you can see the marbling
and the different sections

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.180
which looks different from each other

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.320
because of two different fish.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.890
Some of them are going in marinades,

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.450
others are gonna be left as is.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.130
And he's just preparing
all the ingredients

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.373
and the fish to start making the sushi.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.965
(upbeat music)

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.043
First bite of sushi.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.140
Mm, good wasabi in there.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.790
Fish is just perfectly
like warm room temperature.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.880
The whole some of it
together, yeah that's awesome.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.910
Okay, next one is from a fish called Buri.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.852
And this is the belly part,
and you can just see it close

00:09:35.852 --> 00:09:38.853
even in your finger you can
just feel how soft it is.

00:09:38.853 --> 00:09:42.020
(soft relaxing music)

00:09:44.554 --> 00:09:45.941
Mm, yeah, that one is awesome.

00:09:45.941 --> 00:09:48.220
- [Ying] (speaking in Thai)

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.580
- [Mark] It's extremely soft,

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.593
but then it has this almost
snap to it when you bite down.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.600
All right, this one is horse mackerel.

00:10:01.045 --> 00:10:03.628
(upbeat music)

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.980
Again, topped with those spring onions.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.070
Oh, that complements it so well.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.022
Okay, it's time to start on the tuna.

00:10:14.022 --> 00:10:16.440
(upbeat music)

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.850
- [Mark] This one is chutoro,
and you can just look

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.780
at the vibrancy of that color.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.203
And that's because it's from
the very very fresh fish,

00:10:23.203 --> 00:10:26.210
which was just newly
arrived to the restaurant.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.850
That's the fish he just caught up.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.454
Like even, you can see
that gradient on it.

00:10:30.454 --> 00:10:33.037
(upbeat music)

00:10:35.765 --> 00:10:36.598
Wow!

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.260
Oh, that is spectacular!

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.590
Literally just melting in your mouth.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.823
You barely need to chew.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.700
And that's just full of flavor.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.920
- [Mark] Shimofuri?
- [Man] Yes.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.960
- [Mark] Oh, I didn't even know that one.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.220
Okay, this one is
shimofuri which is between

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.470
the medium fatty and the very fatty belly.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:59.740
So it's that stage in between,

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.890
and you can just see it glistening.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:05.547
You could see that the fat
strands just weaved through it.

00:11:05.547 --> 00:11:08.130
(upbeat music)

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.457
Wow, the quality.

00:11:21.021 --> 00:11:22.538
Just the texture.

00:11:22.538 --> 00:11:24.751
- [Man] (coughs) Aged them for seven days.

00:11:24.751 --> 00:11:26.449
- [Mark] Oh this one
akami, aged for seven days?

00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:27.616
- [Man] Yeah.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.310
- [Mark] Okay, this is that 200?

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.060
- [Man] Yeah, 260 kg.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.220
- Akami tuna, the red part of the tuna,

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.063
which has been aged for seven days.

00:11:50.746 --> 00:11:52.490
Mm, was fatty content but very rich,

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.480
still very a deep up flavor.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.700
Again, it's the one between
the otoro and the chutoro.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.380
So kind of the fattier, medium fatty tuna.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.733
And then this one is aged for seven days.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.787
Because we had the fresh one
of that same fatty content.

00:12:16.787 --> 00:12:17.810
This one is different.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.580
It has developed more
rich and more juiciness.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.413
Sweeter.

00:12:21.413 --> 00:12:23.759
They're both good, just different.

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:26.926
(upbeat bouncy music)

00:12:37.443 --> 00:12:38.358
(chuckles)

00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:42.020
- [Mark] (speaking in Thai)

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.143
Okay, on to the Uni, sea urchin.

00:12:51.836 --> 00:12:53.160
Mm, it's so sweet.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.970
It is melted ice cream,
so sweet and so silky.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.190
- [Man] This one is very special casing.

00:13:01.067 --> 00:13:02.517
- [Mark] Mm, okay.

00:13:02.517 --> 00:13:04.992
- [Man] Wow. (soft voice)

00:13:04.992 --> 00:13:08.236
(everybody laughs loudly)

00:13:08.236 --> 00:13:10.443
- [Mark] (speaks in foreign language)

00:13:10.443 --> 00:13:12.051
So what type of urchin is it?

00:13:12.051 --> 00:13:13.540
- [Man] These are buffalo.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.590
- [Mark] He just opened
up a box filled with uni.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:17.780
It's a very special type of uni.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.646
It's just blooming.

00:13:20.646 --> 00:13:23.229
(upbeat music)

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.410
Next up is a little
rice bowl with the uni.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:41.580
He put on wasabi and then some salmon eggs

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.577
I believe salmon eggs on top.

00:13:43.577 --> 00:13:47.020
You can literally see the
uni just starting to melt,

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.573
like custardy melting
nest on top of that rice.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:01.820
Mm, that uni is just dissolving

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.040
and then has just like
a hint of a bitterness

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.681
which increases the flavor

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:13.033
and liquefies in your
mouth, on your tongue.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.638
Ying, can you hold my bowl?

00:14:16.638 --> 00:14:18.805
(giggles)

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.533
Thank you.

00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:26.238
(upbeat music)

00:14:33.709 --> 00:14:36.343
Okay, this one is anago sea water eel.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.080
That zing of the citrus, the sauce,

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.883
just the melt in your mouth fish.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:45.677
And like fleshy, mm.

00:14:46.909 --> 00:14:49.492
(upbeat music)

00:15:06.659 --> 00:15:09.970
(everyone speaking on foreign language)

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:10.860
- First he put in rice then

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.718
he puts in a whole layer of wasabi,

00:15:12.718 --> 00:15:16.510
and then like a little
handful of minced tuna

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.670
of variety of parts of tuna,
just chopped up minced.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.583
Oh, this is one of my favorite things.

00:15:28.659 --> 00:15:29.492
Yeah!

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:33.300
That is outstanding.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.420
The crisp seaweed, the rice,

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.220
just the melt in your mouth minced tuna

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.886
and then just the balanced of wasabi.

00:15:40.886 --> 00:15:43.469
(upbeat music)

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.590
And this is the tamago, the final course.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.260
This is the egg, sweet egg.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:58.260
This one very spongy, you
can feel the moistness of it.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.054
Mm, really nice, has that sponginess

00:16:08.054 --> 00:16:11.883
but at the same time it sort
of melts down in your mouth.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.780
And that wraps up just an incredible,

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.223
incredible sushi omakase experience.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.760
Okay, the tamago is not the ending course

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.676
there's some fruit Japanese grapes.

00:16:30.676 --> 00:16:32.843
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:32.843 --> 00:16:35.843
(everyone laughing)

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.080
It's so juicy, so plumped and just...

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.260
All right, we just made it back home

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.860
after an amazing lunch.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.300
And what was so cool about
that experience, oh okay...

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.250
For one thing they weren't actually open

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:02.090
so it was just us kinda sampling
sushi and just having fun.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.350
But it was such an education.

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.150
I've had omakase sushi before,

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.830
a set menu where the chef
gives you piece by piece.

00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:12.650
But this was really fully based on tuna.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.700
So it was really a tuna
experience, a tuna education.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.500
And so Kunat and Kunshin, they really know

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.140
a lot about fish, a lot about sushi.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.060
So just having them and the
chef was awesome as well.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.883
But then having them explained
every piece, where it's from,

00:17:27.883 --> 00:17:31.080
being able to really taste for myself

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.790
the difference between an
ultra fresh piece of tuna

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:38.480
and then aged intentionally piece of tuna.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.100
And then mere different marinades,

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.480
but also then just no marinade,

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.300
and then just having
them all consecutively

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.590
that was very cool.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.150
That was an amazing tuna sushi

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.410
omakase experience in Bangkok.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:51.380
I wanna say a huge thank you

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:55.800
to Kunat, Kunshin and Kun Eis
for inviting me for lunch.
