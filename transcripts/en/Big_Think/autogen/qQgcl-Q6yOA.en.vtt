securities which people don't understand

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
securities which people don't understand
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.940
securities which people don't understand
very well and they rely on high degrees

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950
very well and they rely on high degrees
 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.600
very well and they rely on high degrees
of leverage so if they have you know a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610
of leverage so if they have you know a
 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.940

billion dollars in their hedge fund they

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950
billion dollars in their hedge fund they
 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.299
billion dollars in their hedge fund they
might borrow as much as 30 billion

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309
might borrow as much as 30 billion
 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.130
might borrow as much as 30 billion
dollars to to trade with and so their

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140
dollars to to trade with and so their
 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.100
dollars to to trade with and so their
strategies are backed by high amounts of

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
strategies are backed by high amounts of
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.869
strategies are backed by high amounts of
leverage and that creates some problems

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
leverage and that creates some problems
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.689
leverage and that creates some problems
but what we've what we've learned is

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699
but what we've what we've learned is
 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.170

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.390
highly leveraged as well some some by 35
or 36 21 and so that means that if your

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
or 36 21 and so that means that if your
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.030
or 36 21 and so that means that if your
leverage that heavily when in when

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040
leverage that heavily when in when
 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.830
leverage that heavily when in when
markets head down you can be you can be
