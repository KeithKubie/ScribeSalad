00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
Good morning, everyone. It's Mark Wiens and it is a very early morning here in Bangkok. We got a flight at 2 a.m.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.399
and we caught a taxi to Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok. And Ying and I are on our way to the island of

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.629
Langkawi, which is in northern Malaysia, and it's actually right near the border of Thailand in the south

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:29.250
but we've got a fly from Bangkok to Kuala lumpur first. It's flight number one and then with from Kuala Lumpur

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.730
we got to fly to

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.919
island of Langkawi, so we are about to catch our first flight now

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.530
to KL.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:47.279
It is about 4:30 a.m. and I think this is the quietest I have ever seen this airport. A couple weeks ago

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.879
I was contacted by Naturally Langkawi, which is under the tourism of Malaysia branch and

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.389
they invited us for a trip to Langkawi

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.949
for a full week to do a bunch of things and eat a lot of delicious food.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.849
So, Ying and I are on our way now to Langkawi, and I think this should be a really, really fun trip

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.139
But also, I want to say a big thank you for watching it was yesterday's

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.559
I think yesterday's vlog depending on when I upload this this vlog, but thank you all for the positive feedback.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.390
I really appreciate it and since you guys enjoyed that I decided I am going to try to make a daily vlog

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.070
for this trip to Langkawi.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.059
So keep coming back. I'm going to be uploading a daily vlog

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.129
We have so many cool activities that are on our schedule as well as a lot of delicious food

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.909
Here's a quick photo of langkawi the island that we're going to. So this is

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.679
actually Thailand comes all the way down south and then this is Malaysia. And then you can see

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.539
right there is the island we are going to call Langkawi.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.480
I

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.980
fell asleep before we even took off and I was sleeping

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.560
but I just woke up for breakfast now and I order the nasi lemak,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.960
which is traditional Malaysian food.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.560
The peanuts - okay, let me go and get piece of the egg in the prawn.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.800
It's scorching hot.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.740
Okay, so we just landed in Kuala Lumpur and the flight was just under two hours, and I think we have a

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.449
two-hour layover. Bye-bye. Thank you.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.420
But yeah, that was a good flight. Umm, I

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.460
got a good nap in there

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.800
And then ate that. Just woke up to eat that nasi lemak. Got about two hours before flight to Langkawi

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.000
So going to do some email.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:04.320
We're on flight number two now. On our way to Langkawi and a flight should just be about 45 minutes from Kuala Lumpur.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:18.960
We have landed at Langkawi International Airport.  It is a safety requirement that you remain seated until the aircraft comes to a complete stop. Seat belt sign has been switched off.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.420
We're going to go get our bag and there should be someone here to pick us up

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.740
Thank you. Okay.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.780
There's our name right there. Oh, thank you.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.340
HelloQ

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.160
Hello!

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.680
Thank you very much.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.610
What is the name of the restaurant we're going to now?

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.839
The Seashells... the Seashells Restaurant.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.930
And we are now in the car on our way to a restaurant called The Seashells, which is in an area called

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.519
Laman Padi, which is the rice field, rice field area and

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.520
so we are gonna go for lunch, and I am very ready to eat lunch.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.430
We are eating a dish called nasi campur,

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.600
which is rice with a bunch of different curries and they had all the curries in

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.290
kind of the front of the restaurant, and so we chose

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.840
Oh

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.619
I chose a couple of different fish, chickens and

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.690
beef. The food looks awesome and our guide Wankesh is gonna

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.559
just quickly explain a couple of the dishes. Daging kurma.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.140
Daging kurma. "Daging" is "beef". Okay. "Kurma" is maybe

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.090
Arabic-style.  Oh,

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.090
like who like "kurma".

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.809
Okay, okay. This is - in Malay, we call it "ayam masak merah".

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.560
"Ayam" is "chicken". Okay, "Masak" is the "cooked".

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.399
Okay. "Merah" is "red". Okay, and then this one is Ikan bakar. Ikan bakar. What type of - which is grilled?

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.320
It's grilled fish. Grilled fish.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.239
It's like butterfly cut. Yes, butterfly cut. And then grilled with some sambal. Sambal, yeah.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.570
And then this is like a - is it shrimp paste? Shrimp paste. Oh!

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.209
In Malay, we call it "air asam". Actually, I think I should just put a bunch of things on my plate

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.459
before I start eating. Here goes that the chicken - the red chicken curry.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.630
Oh, that is looking flavourful.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.249
Next chicken curry on this side of the plate

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.149
Omelette goes right on top there.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.519
And then revolve the plate. And then this is the beef dish in coconut milk.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.220
and then fried fish.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.949
Then, finally, this one is the ikan bakar, the grilled fish, which is one of my favorite things to eat in Malaysia.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.199
And I'm gonna. Actually, I don't think I'll even add this to my plate.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.960
I think I will just break off a piece and eat. Actually, this is going to have to be my first bite

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.570
I'm gonna reach in for some of this shrimp paste - chilli sauce - put that onto the fish.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.519
Yeah, I gotta - I gotta reach in for a bite immediately of this ikan bakar.

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:24.409
Mmm, that fish is extremely juicy and it has a wonderful like - kind of like

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:26.959
roasted - very like -

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:30.768
chili - chili roasted flavor to it, and then the sauce is a little bit spicy.

00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:33.259
I got a piece of onion in that bite as well

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:41.539
as - I can just taste a very - a very faint hint of shrimp paste in it. The beef dish. The cubes of beef and

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.539
Yeap, let me try to break into one of those pieces and get more. Actually, looks like it needs a little more

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.449
gravy on top of that.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.610
All right.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.580
Mmm, the meat is tender and

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:08.290
then the sauce is rich. I can, I can taste a distinct kind of almost cumin flavour.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:15.970
Maybe the... Yeah, it tastes - definitely has some cumin and maybe some curry leaves. Are there curry leaves in there too?

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.600
Yeah. Okay!

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.500
Yeah.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:24.610
Definitely distinct of cumin and curry leaves in there, which I love, but it doesn't have the all the

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.580
like - spicy - normal spices of a curry

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:35.049
but just that really strong cumin flavour. And then with a creamy coconut gravy. That's that's like. It's kind of like a beef stew.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.869
but with cumin in it. This chicken curry...

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.140
Oh, this - that beautiful red colour.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.350
And I've got to have that chili in this bite too.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:01.550
Mmm. That was a big bite, but that is - um - that has a little bit of a sweetness to it, but I can

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.209
taste the blend of chilies in there. The onions um

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.530
The...

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:13.370
It has a little bit of like a lemony flavor to it, but that's just a really it's not as spicy as it looks.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:20.449
But it is very, very flavorful, and has a nice chewy flavour to it. Ying and I managed to polish off that lunch.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.360
That was quite a lot of food, but it was really good.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.309
Um, I think my favorite was the ikan bakar. That grilled fish. And it just had a beautiful

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:34.999
Grilled flavor to it. I am very satisfied, and I could definitely just like sit in this chair for the rest of the afternoon.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.760
But I think we're going to go to check into our hotel.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:44.900
And we they have set us up in a hotel called the Andaman, which I think will be very nice.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:09:01.499
Okay, we've just stopped on the side of the road to buy some snacks. Sa wat dee kap.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:15.089
This is like some deep-fried corn. Deep-fried corn fritters.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:28.049
You call this "chuaem kluay", which is a banana fritter. Some kind of banana fritter.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.320
Well, that tastes like deep-fried banana bread. Oh, but it's sticky. Yeah, very good.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.100
Okay, and then lastly. This is a doughnut she has handed us. Oh,

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.580
that is very soft and squishy and then she sprinkled some

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.390
Like Brown - is it like palm brown sugar on top. Brown sugar. Okay!

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.910
Mmm. Oh,

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.089
that is extremely like doughy and

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:12.000
fluffy. And then it's kind of it's kind of salty and sweet at the same time.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:19.530
It has a really nice kind of almost like vanilla - maybe pandan fragrance to it. boom on top

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.170
on our top

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:29.220
But she is actually she speaks Thai. She's from the province, or she said she's originally from the province of Satun,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.369
which is in the south of Thailand. It's the closest province

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:36.059
to Langkawi on the coast. So, it's actually. It's actually.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:42.299
Langkawi is like right on the border of Thailand and Malaysia. So,

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:47.580
there's a lot of influence of Thai and Malaysia mixed here in Langkawi.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.150
Okay, we just got into the hotel room. Oh!

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.590
Hello, Ying! And

00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:03.559
before we destroy this room with taking - unpacking our bags and everything. I better give you a quick tour, the bed, and

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.770
check out all these little snacks.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:11.599
They gave us - do know what we're having? It's like chips.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.470
Some kind of chips and like dip and then there's a fresh

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:22.520
There's a fresh coconut here, but anyway the real highlight of this room is that view of the ocean from out here.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.060
Just look at this view from our balcony though. Oh!

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.769
Okay, and now let's go check out the bathroom. Oh

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.460
yeah! The tub

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.499
Oh, and then look at the toilet. It looks like it's like.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.489
It looks like it's hovering. Okay, enough of the bathroom.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:51.299
Let's go sample those snacks. This looks like chips and - chips and salsa.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.169
And then check out all this fruit they've been giving us. Oh,

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.650
about a grape.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:05.129
Starting to get extremely sleepy though. I think it's about 5 p.m. now.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.600
And it has been already a very long day since 2 a.m.. this morning.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:14.700
With a few naps in the airplane, but I am starting to get drowsy though

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.030
I do want to go out and explore this hotel a bit and go to the pool and the ocean

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.780
We walked out to the beach the sun has already sort of gone down.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:28.199
It's nice and Shady, but if I would have stayed in the room it definitely would have crashed pretty hard taking a nap

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.660
but I'll take a refreshing swim now.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.819
For dinner, we are at Jala Restaurant,

00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:54.599
which is at the Andaman Hotel, and it's a very, very nice restaurant, but you take off your shoes.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.879
It's a sand floored restaurant.

00:12:56.879 --> 00:12:59.759
So you take off your shoes and then they take your shoes and you can walk around barefoot.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.610
But we got here just as the sun is going down.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:04.720
So, it is

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:10.980
the tail end of the sunset, but it's a beautiful view and this is a really pleasant restaurant so far.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.680
So this is the Crimson Red Snapper. Yeah, that looks...

00:13:14.319 --> 00:13:20.459
That looks perfect. The fish has arrived for dinner, and I ordered the red snapper. A Crimson Red Snapper,

00:13:20.459 --> 00:13:25.289
which is steamed and a couple different sauces and then a couple of different side to vegetable dishes.

00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:27.899
But I got to go straight in for this fish.

00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:33.808
Oh, and I'll slip that like. I'll set the skin side down.

00:13:35.079 --> 00:13:37.079
With no sauce first.

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.689
That fish is

00:13:46.689 --> 00:13:48.129
extremely fresh,

00:13:48.129 --> 00:13:50.049
and just the

00:13:50.049 --> 00:13:54.119
steaming sauce is very light. I can taste a little bit of sesame oil

00:13:54.119 --> 00:13:59.879
maybe. And a little bit of oyster sauce a very light seasoning, but really fresh fish.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.780
That sauce is just a tiny bit spicy. I

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.849
can taste and maybe just a tiny bit sweet as well it almost tastes like a Thai

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:23.639
seafood sauce. It almost has like a little zing to it. In Thailand, I have grown to using

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:27.869
pretty much exclusively using a spoon to eat food

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:32.280
So, I have almost it almost feels awkward for me to use a fork to eat

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.129
but I'm going to I'm going to do my best.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.280
It's been a

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.819
very long day, and a tiring day,

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.410
but also a very good day and a very good introduction so far to Langkawi.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:52.019
We my goal is to make a vlog every day on this trip to Langkawi. So, keep coming back

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.119
