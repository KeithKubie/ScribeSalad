00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:08.720
We know from the California experience
what does climate change means maker

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:19.610
drugs for us exactly 40 years ago, I
discovered the greenhouse effect

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.949
chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs. These
pollutants were used those days as

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.381
refrigerants and as propellants

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.660
in spray cans. Until then, scientists
thought carbon dioxide from fossil fuel

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.570
was the one man-made greenhouse gas. My work showed these CFCs, they're more than

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.399
10,000 times more potent than carbon
dioxide. So how much pollution are we

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.129
dumping into the air every year? Close to
50 billion tons

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:59.381
of pollutant gases are dumped in the
atmosphere. I made the prediction in 1980

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.800
that the greenhouse effect should be
detectable by the year 2000 and the planet

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.610
started warming significantly past 2000, so the prediction was confirmed. So come 2010,

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.890
the warming will take off and reach values
which we have not seen in the last few

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.990
million years. Can we do anything to stop
this warming and bend the curve twenty years from now

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.030
and stop the warming reaching catastrophic climate?
Fortunately we can! We have the science

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.299
and we have the technology. Take the University of California, San Diego. We generate

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:44.140
our own power by solar, fuel cells and using methane from water treatment plants.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.750
They're off-the-shelf technologies. There is no reason these cannot be deployed for the rest of

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.480
the nation and for the planet.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.340
